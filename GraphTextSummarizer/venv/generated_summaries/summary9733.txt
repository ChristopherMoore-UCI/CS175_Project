The police officers were taken in Valle del Cauca, another department in southwest Colombia, and had been held since January 25. The soldier, identified as Josue Alvarez, was captured on January 30 in Narino, a department in southwest Colombia. "We hope Mr. Alvarez will soon be reunited with his family," Jordi Raich, head of the ICRC delegation in Colombia, said in a statement. ICRC said it has facilitated the release of eight people this week, including Alvarez, two police officers, also held by the FARC, and five civilians, held by a second rebel group, known as the National Liberation Army, or ELN. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, commonly known as the FARC, released a soldier hostage on Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported.
