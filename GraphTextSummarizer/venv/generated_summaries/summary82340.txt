WHO to review Ebola response amid criticism Airline worries Leave no stone unturned is the approach Frontier Airlines is taking, after a passenger came down with Ebola. Most of them weren't on flights with Amber Vinson, the second Dallas nurse who contracted Ebola after helping treat Duncan. The employee of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital was a lab supervisor and did not have direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, who died there while being treated for Ebola. "The samples which are in a container, so the USCG members are not exposed, were then taken by Carnival's on board doctor," said Petty Officer Andy Kendrick, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman. In an effort to further quarantine the deadly virus, the Ohio Department of Health, upped the ante on specific Ebola monitoring requirements on Saturday for those potentially affected by the deadly virus.
