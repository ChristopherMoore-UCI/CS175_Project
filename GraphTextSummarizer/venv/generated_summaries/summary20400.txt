"Displaced people in northeastern Nigeria and across borders are in a very dramatic situation, they fear for their lives and are at this point unable to return to their homes," said Liz Ahua, who's coordinating Nigerian refugee efforts for the U.N. Aid agencies are scrambling to provide the refugees with clean water, shelter, food and access to education. "Adequate funding is crucial to make sure aid agencies can improve the living conditions for refugees in asylum countries and respond to their protection needs," Ahua said. "We relocate refugees away from the conflict border areas, and establish additional refugee camps where needed." The United Nations is appealing for $174 million to help Nigerian refugees who've fled to neighboring nations following militant attacks. "The conflict has had a devastating impact on children, including many who were forcibly recruited by the insurgents in Nigeria," Ahua said.
