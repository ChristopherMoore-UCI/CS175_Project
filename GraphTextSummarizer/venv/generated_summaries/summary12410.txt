At least six rivers in northern Illinois have surged to record levels in recent days after the area was deluged with 5 inches of rain. "The sustained periods of heavy rainfall (have) swollen creeks and streams and is pushing the Mississippi River over flood levels, endangering river communities," Nixon said. As rivers across the heartland swelled during the past two weeks, rising water was blamed for four deaths. Flooding in Illinois alone has displaced thousands and prompted Gov. Pat Quinn to declare 44 counties as disaster areas. In DuPage County, Illinois, a body was found floating in Salt Creek last week, the local sheriff's office said.
