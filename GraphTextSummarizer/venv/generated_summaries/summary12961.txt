Here are key initiatives from President Barack Obama's State of the Union address Tuesday night: • Implementation of a minimum tax for multinational companies, which would fund additional tax breaks for companies that create jobs in or move them to the United States. • Establishment of a financial crimes unit of investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud and protect investors, and a second unit to investigate abusive lending practices and institutional gambling on risky mortgages. • Tax relief for small businesses that are raising wages and creating good jobs. • Passage of tax credits for companies that hire veterans. • Support for a mortgage refinancing program for all "responsible" homeowners, funded by "a small fee" on large financial institutions.
