French Immigration Minister Eric Besson said France was offering refuge to 150 victims of the attack as a gesture of friendship and support to Christians who face hardships. -- About three dozen survivors of last month's brutal attack on a Baghdad church have found refuge in France, where they have been given temporary status as asylum seekers. It was one of the worst attacks against Iraq's dwindling Christian minority in recent years. "France supports their desire to remain and live in peace on their land, where they have lived for centuries," Besson said. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq.
