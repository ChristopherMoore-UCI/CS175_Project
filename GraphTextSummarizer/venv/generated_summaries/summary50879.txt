Mash-up of Britney Spears' "Boys" and Justin Bieber's "Boyfriend," sung by Darren Criss and Kevin McHale Time to channel your inner boy band, Artie and Blaine! Glee's season 4 premiere airs Thursday, Sept. 13 at 9 p.m. Music from the new season will be available for download on iTunes beginning Tuesday, Sept. 11. In the most danceable song of the five Glee songs previewed today, this mash-up features a sultry Hudson, who may have mastered a Spanish accent a little better than Lady Gaga did. Last but certainly not least, we got to hear the song of the summer â€” the ubiquitous "Call Me Maybe" â€” sung by an ensemble of Glee cast members.
