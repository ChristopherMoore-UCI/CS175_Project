-- The body of Edelmiro Cavazos Leal, the mayor of the city of Santiago in Nuevo Leon state, was found Wednesday, two days after he was abducted, Mexico's interior ministry announced. Cavazos was kidnapped by gunmen early Monday, Nuevo Leon state officials said at a news conference later that day. Nuevo Leon, which borders Texas, has been the frequent site of drug cartel violence, especially around the state capital of Monterrey. Interior Minister Jose Francisco Blake Mora said he will travel to Nuevo Leon to confer with local officials. More than 28,000 people have been killed in Mexican drug violence since Calderon initiated a crackdown against the cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006.
