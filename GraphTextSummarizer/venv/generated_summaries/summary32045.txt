Libya's interim leaders declared the nation's freedom Sunday, ushering in a new era after the death of longtime ruler Moammar Gadhafi. NATO, which launched a military operation in March to protect Libyan citizens against the Gadhafi regime during the Libyan war, plans to end its mission there by October 31. We are proud of everything we have done to assist so far, and stand ready to help the Libyan people in the future," British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement Sunday. " Gadhafi's family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership "to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites," a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported. Cheering crowds packed a central square in Benghazi Sunday afternoon for a ceremony that leaders said formally marked victory after eight months of fighting.
