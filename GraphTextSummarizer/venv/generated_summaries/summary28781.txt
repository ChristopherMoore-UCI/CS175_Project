The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, signed by President George W. Bush, requires doctors and insurers to treat mental illness the same as physical illness. Insurance companies often cover mental illness in a more limited fashion than physical illness. The move "finally puts mental health and behavioral health on equal footing," Sebelius said. "The not-so-good news is you are eligible for treatment now, but often the services are not available," said Carolyn Reinach Wolf, an attorney who specializes in cases involving mental illness. In a move aimed at boosting mental health treatment, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on Friday announced new rules that will put teeth in a 2008 mental health equity law.
