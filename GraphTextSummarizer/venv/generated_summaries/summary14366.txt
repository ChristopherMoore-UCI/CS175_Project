CONI's partnership with Ferrari dates back to 2006, with a Maranello-designed sled taking to the track at the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver, Canada. "We have selected from our F1 team and our road cars department some engineers who have achieved some brilliant results in F1 and were looking for new opportunities within the company," explained Ferrari engineer Ferdinando Cannizzo. Ferrari's work in all of those events involves helping an object move through the air, water or snow with minimal drag, which is where aerodynamics engineer Luciano Mariella comes in. Other winter disciplines such as skiing have benefited from wind tunnel testing and Ferrari's knowledge of aerodynamics, as well as Summer Games sports such as archery, rowing, canoeing and kayaking. "The idea was to share the knowledge between our institute and Ferrari to try to improve all the sports where technology plays a big part in the results," CONI deputy general secretary Carlo Mornati told CNN.
