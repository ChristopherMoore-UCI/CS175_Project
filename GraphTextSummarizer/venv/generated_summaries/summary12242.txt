-- Carolina Panthers defensive end Greg Hardy, who was convicted of domestic violence this summer, did not play Sunday in his team's win over the Detroit Lions. According to an August 28 memo sent by Goodell to all 32 teams, anyone in the league -- players or team personnel -- will be suspended for a minimum of six games for a first offense of domestic violence. The Panthers drew heated criticism over its handling of Hardy even while speaking out against domestic violence. Owner Jerry Richardson, while accepting a civic award last week, began to cry while speaking about domestic violence. "To those who would suggest we've been too slow to act, I ask that you consider not to be too quick to judge." Although he did not mention the words "domestic violence" in his post-game remarks, Panthers coach Ron Rivera obliquely acknowledged the controversy looming over not just Hardy, but over the entire league.
