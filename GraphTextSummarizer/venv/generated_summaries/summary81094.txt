"President Barchi believes that Professor Jackson is an effective administrator capable of confronting challenging and complex problems and is an effective manager and steward of the university's resources," said E.J. Miranda, director of media relations at Rutgers. "The University views the plaintiffs' claims in this lawsuit as lacking merit and plans to vigorously defend its business decisions made in restructuring the University's Office of Career Services," said John K. Bennett, the attorney for Rutgers and Jackson said. Almost immediately, Jackson reportedly told staffers that "there was going to be a review of Career Services and that there would be changes." Attorneys for Jackson and Rutgers asked that a judge dismiss the entire complaint. Gregory S. Jackson, who was appointed by Rutgers President Robert S. Barchi as his chief of staff in April, is being sued for allegedly unlawfully terminating three staffers in the university's career services department.
