"To defend for almost 45 minutes with one less man on the pitch, I can't describe in words what these players have done," Iceland manager Lars Lagerback told Icelandic television. "It's obviously a very bad result," France manager Didier Deschamps told French television. Earlier in the second half, Ronaldo appeared to headbutt Swedish defender Mikael Lustig. Italian referee Nicola Rizzoli opted not to punish the Real Madrid star but later showed him a yellow card for clipping Swedish keeper Andreas Isaksson. The game finished on a sour note, following a clash between Germany's Toni Kroos and Italian defender Thiago Motta.
