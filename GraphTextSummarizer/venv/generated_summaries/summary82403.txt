An injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death. --   Connie and Donald McCracken were watching CNN one evening last week when they learned of the tragic death of actress Natasha Richardson from a head injury. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much," McCracken says. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.
