" Other White House officials who left after the election include White House counselor Dan Bartlett, budget director Rob Portman, chief White House attorney Harriet Miers, political director Sara Taylor and deputy national security adviser J.D. Crouch. Rove intends to return to Washington over the weekend, according to a White House official. Perhaps Bush's most powerful White House aide, Rove submitted his resignation to Bush on Friday, he told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux in an e-mail. Libby's attorneys contended that Libby was the victim of a White House conspiracy to protect Rove but never presented any evidence to support that claim. Senior administration officials said White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten recently told senior aides if you're staying after Labor Day, plan to stay for the remainder of the term, so make decisions now, which forced Rove to make his decision.
