"In the heavyweight division, there is nothing else out there as far as British fight fans are concerned, Harrison-Haye is enormous," he told Sky Sports News. Britain's WBA beltholder David Haye, who both Klitschkos have accused of being scared to fight them, may next fight former Olympic champion Audley Harrison, according to promoter Barry Hearn. Hearn, whose son Eddie is involved in the talks with Haye's manager Adam Booth, said the fight would be a boost for British boxing. He is more experienced than me, has more professional fights on his record and is one of the hardest punchers in the division. Vitali Klitschko has confirmed that he will defend his world heavyweight boxing title against former champion Shannon Briggs on October 16 in his adopted home city of Hamburg.
