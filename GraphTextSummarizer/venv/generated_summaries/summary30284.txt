Google said the beta-testing process will investigate ways to streamline Domains for users, improve customer service and determine which extra services, such as mobile-site design, will be offered. Google hasn't announced when Domains will be available to the public, although it's encouraging potential customers to request invite codes to test the service. The new Google service will allow users to purchase new domain names as well as transfer existing ones. "Businesses will be able to search, find, purchase and transfer the best domain for their business -- whether it's .com, .biz, .org, or any of the wide range of new domains that are being released to the Web," Google said in a blog post about the venture. It gets them hooked into its many products including Google Apps, Gmail, Google Pages, etc.," wrote Andrew Allemann for Domain Name Wire, an industry blog.
