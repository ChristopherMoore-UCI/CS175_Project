Police say this same group of bikers descended on New York City and clogged up Times Square last year in what Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said is a "major stunt event." One biker who was struck by the SUV, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, was arrested and faces several charges, including reckless endangerment, reckless driving and endangering the welfare of a child, police said. The gang, called "Hollywood Stuntz," according to police, chased the man, and he was forced to stop because of flat tires. "It was an accident," says Lt. Karen Anderson. The New York City Police Department said a man driving a Range Rover with his wife and 2-year-old daughter inside Sunday struck a motorcyclist on Manhattan's West Side Highway, breaking his leg.
