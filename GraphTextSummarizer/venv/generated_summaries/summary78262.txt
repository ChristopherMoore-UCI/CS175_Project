-- Myanmar has invited the United States and the European Union to send representatives to observe elections in April, according to officials in the region. International attention is focused on the April elections, which are seen as a test of the Myanmar's government's commitment to lasting political reform. Suu Kyi, who was released from years under house arrest in 2010, has been crisscrossing the country to attend election rallies. An official from Myanmar's Information Ministry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, confirmed that the country had offered to let the U.S. and the EU election monitors observe the by-elections due to be held on April 1. The international community has applauded recent steps toward greater openness in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962.
