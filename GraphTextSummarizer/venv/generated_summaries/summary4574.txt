The prime minister said he was confident he would win the next election to end the power-sharing deal he entered with President Robert Mugabe, adding that his main task would be to revive Zimbabwe's economy. The fragile coalition government has been marred by disagreements between the former political foes, with Tsvangirai claiming that Mugabe is reluctant to make Zimbabwe a democracy. Tsvangirai and Mugabe formed a power-sharing government in 2009 after postelection violence following Mugabe's victory claim. "We hope SADC (Southern African Development Community) and the AU will continue to support our efforts to reject attempts to manipulate the will of the people and remain resolute in their approach in dealing with the Zimbabwe issue." Tsvangirai's comments came at the end of his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) congress in Bulawayo, southwest of the capital, Harare. Mugabe wants the elections held this year, but Tsvangirai has demanded reforms first.
