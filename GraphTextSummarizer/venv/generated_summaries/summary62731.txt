-- This is the time of the year when NBA executives may get a little religious, praying that the ping pong balls in Wednesday's NBA draft lottery fall in their favor. Davis, a 6-foot-10 power forward who led Kentucky to a NCAA national championship this year, is believed to be the top prospect for any team who wins the first pick in the NBA draft. Here are the odds of getting the first pick for the 14 teams in the draft lottery, according to the NBA: 1. The Bobcats' dismal distinction means it will have a 25% chance of getting the top pick in Wednesday's draft lottery -- and the greatest chance at picking Kentucky's all-world big man Anthony Davis. The draft lottery, which determines the order of the first 14 teams drafting in the June 28 draft, will be held in New York Wednesday night and will be televised.
