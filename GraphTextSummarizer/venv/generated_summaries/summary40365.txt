-- Charlie Sheen, once TV's highest-paid actor, is offering $1,000 to a waiter who got a 20 cent tip from wealthy football star LeSean McCoy. He disputed the suggestion that McCoy had been given bad service, justifying the minuscule tip. Sheen pledged the grand in a tweet to Tommy Up, the owner of Philadelphia's PYT burger joint where McCoy, an Eagles running back, dined Monday afternoon. The 26-year-old McCoy, who has a $45 million, 5-year contract with Philadelphia's NFL team, has not directly responded to the restaurant's beef, but a local sports reporter quotes him saying "It's bull****, man. Many Eagles fans objected to his apparent effort to shame the popular player -- whose nickname is "Shady." "I decided to take action after some serious thought," Up wrote on Facebook.
