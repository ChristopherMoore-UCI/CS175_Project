-- The day of the Gen. McChrystal mea culpa last week, an Afghan friend of mine, whom we can call Osman, drove from Kandahar city to his native village. This search has become a fact of life since the movement re-established its control over villages in Panjwai, a district in Kandahar province. Groups like the one that stopped Osman alternate between the battlefield and the haven in Pakistani Baluchistan, only eight hours away. For example, the Afghan leadership insists on holding parliamentary elections in September, even though everyone else knows they would be disastrous for the counterinsurgency objective of boosting government legitimacy. Osman's encounter with his tenant Taliban gives a clue to the steady supply of insurgent fighters and commanders.
