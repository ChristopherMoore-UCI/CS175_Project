Iran denied Bahrami access to Dutch consular assistance and would not let Dutch officials attend her trial because Tehran did not recognize her dual citizenship, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Netherlands said on January 5. Fars added that during a search of her house, while she was charged with security crimes, 450 grams of cocaine and 420 grams of opium were discovered and, following further investigation, it was found that she had also distributed 150 grams of cocaine. The Netherlands recalled its ambassador from Iran, it said Monday, after Iran executed a Dutch-Iranian woman in spite of Dutch efforts to intervene in her case. The campaign said Bahrami was originally charged with security offenses in the wake of widespread protests against the government over a controversial presidential election in June 2009. Iran hanged Bahrami in late January, saying she was a drug smuggler.
