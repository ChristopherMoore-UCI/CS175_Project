It leaves Luke Donald, Padraig Harrington and Justin Rose now requiring picks from captain Colin Montgomerie, but Sergio Garcia's decision to take a break from golf has made his decision a little easier. Woods is now hoping that U.S. captain Corey Pavin will make him one of his four captain's picks. Tiger Woods may have clung on to his world number one status but after a disappointing final round at the PGA Championship will have to rely on captain Corey Pavin to play in the Ryder Cup. Woods needed to finish in the top 15 at Whistling Straits to have any chance of forcing his way into the eight automatic selections for the United States team to face Europe at Celtic Manor in October. Germany's Martin Kaymer has sealed his place in the Europe team after his first major victory, while Paul Casey, who tied 12th, has also forced his way into the nine automatic selection spots.
