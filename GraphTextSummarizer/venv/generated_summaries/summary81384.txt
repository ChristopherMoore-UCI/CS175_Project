In a Boston Globe poll in September 2013, for example, only a third favored the death penalty over life without parole for Tsarnaev. Almost two years since the Tsarnaev brothers allegedly placed two bombs at the Boston Marathon finish line, turning the city's beloved Patriot's Day race into a war zone, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is finally going on trial. I guess it's easier to be outspoken against the death penalty when you're not defending an alleged terrorist, but instead pointing out the alarming number of death row prisoners who have been wrongly convicted. And while seeking revenge makes for great action movies, in real life it lowers our own standards. Indeed, the death penalty is nothing more than institutionalized revenge.
