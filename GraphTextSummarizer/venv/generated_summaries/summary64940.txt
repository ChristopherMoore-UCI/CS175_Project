The real guy is based in Berlin, where he recently finished a two-and-a-half year stint playing an American rock star on German soap opera "Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten" ("Good times, bad times"). After much discussion and online gnashing of teeth about the disheveled pitchman for travel company Trivago, the Germany-based company has heeded the call for a Trivago Guy makeover. Williams' original Trivago look is the work of a European stylist. There's a contest under way to find a new outfit for American actor and musician Tim Williams, aka the Trivago Guy. Williams had an early acting role on the "Cosby Show" and he has also appeared on "Law and Order" and on New York stages.
