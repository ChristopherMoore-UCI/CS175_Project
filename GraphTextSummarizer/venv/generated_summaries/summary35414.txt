-- Venus and Serena Williams' bid for a fifth consecutive Grand Slam doubles title ended when they were beaten in the Wimbledon quarterfinals. The defending champions were beaten 3-6 6-3 6-4 by Russian pair Elena Vesnina and Vera Zvonareva -- their first defeat at the championships since 2003. It means Wimbledon is over for Venus -- the first time she will leave the All England Club in London without a trophy since 2006. Venus and Serena became the top ranked female doubles pair in the world after winning the French Open in Paris earlier this month. The Russian plays Tsvetana Pironkova, from Bulgaria, who beat Venus on Tuesday.
