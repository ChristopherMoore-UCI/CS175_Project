" Obama promised the United States would support the governments of both Sudan and Southern Sudan to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition to independence. The conflict, which left 2 million people dead, pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians and animists in the south. Why are we separating?" Sudan's north and south fought a war for more than two decades, finally ending in a peace treaty in 2005 that paved the way for the referendum. U.S. President Barack Obama announced Washington's intention to recognize Southern Sudan as a sovereign, independent state in July, when a comprehensive peace agreement with the north is due to end. Before Southern Sudan can become independent, the two sides still have to address various issues including currency, citizenship, national debt, and how to divide the majority of oil reserves found in the south.
