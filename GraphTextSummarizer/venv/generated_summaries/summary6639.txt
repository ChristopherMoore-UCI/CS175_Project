-- A gunman in apparent financial distress took several firefighters hostage Wednesday in suburban Atlanta, then was killed in an exchange of gunfire hours later after law enforcement authorities determined he might lash out at his captives. "They are simply relieved that the situation is over," said Gwinnett County Fire Department spokesman Thomas Rutledge. "It got to the point where we believed that (the firefighters') lives were in immediate danger," Gwinnett County police spokesman Ed Ritter said Wednesday night. But he was calling the shots."
