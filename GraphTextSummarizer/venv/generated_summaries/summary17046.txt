-- Iraqi security forces on Thursday thwarted an attack by an al Qaeda splinter group on a military base in central Iraq, killing 40 gunmen, Iraq's Interior Ministry said. In March alone, terrorist attacks and other violence killed 592 people and injured 1,234 others in Iraq, excluding Anbar province, according to the United Nations The United Nations in March kept separate, civilian-only figures for Anbar, which has seen intense fighting between Sunni extremists and Iraqi security forces since the beginning of this year. Also Thursday, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in northern Iraq, killing at least four people and injuring 13 others, police officials in Tikrit and Kirkuk said. Iraq has been beset with political and sectarian violence for months, often pitting Sunnis -- a minority in Iraq -- against Shiite Muslims, who came to dominate the government after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003. One Iraqi army officer was killed in the attack by members of the group calling itself the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, according to the ministry.
