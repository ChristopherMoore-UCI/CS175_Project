Taking militants out with drones isn't simple, but it's the best strategy available to eliminate the threat of terrorists in Yemen, U.S. President Barack Obama said Sunday. Explaining why he was ruling out sending American troops to fight ISIS, Obama said he was modeling his strategy after what he said were successful efforts in Yemen and Somalia to partner with governments to go after terrorists. The unraveling security situation in Yemen -- the same country Obama cited as a model for his fight against ISIS terrorists -- has thrown the President's counterterror message into question. Obama was confident on Sunday that U.S. anti-terror efforts would continue in Yemen. "This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years," Obama said on September 10.
