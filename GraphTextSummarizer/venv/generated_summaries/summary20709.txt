U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told NBC's "Meet the Press" program on Sunday that "thankfully, we do not have any reports of any American citizens killed or injured" in Egypt's anti-government demonstrations. From those locations, U.S. citizens must make their own travel plans and reimburse the government for their flights out of Egypt, the embassy said in a statement. PBS travel-show host Regina Fraser, currently in Egypt filming an episode of her show "Grannies on Safari," has been frustrated by the lack of information. -- The escalation of protests across Egypt on Sunday has prompted businesses and governments to evacuate their citizens and clients from the country.
