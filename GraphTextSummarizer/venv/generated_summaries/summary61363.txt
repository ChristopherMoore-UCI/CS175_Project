A study published in the American Sociological Review claims men who engage in "traditionally female labor" (dishes, laundry, etc.) get less sex than those who do not. That makes sense, but then some are saying men who do chores get less sex than men who don't. But, the study also finds that, "A couple's sex life is governed by a gendered set of sexual scripts," meaning that men who do typical "guy" chores, such as mowing the grass, do, in fact, get lucky more often. It's not that we, ladies, prefer lazy men who drink beer and watch football. So guys who help more at home get more at home, right?
