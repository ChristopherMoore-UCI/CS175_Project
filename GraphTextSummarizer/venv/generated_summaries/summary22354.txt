-- Police on Friday arrested a former Massachusetts chemist accused of lying about drug evidence she handled while working at a state police lab, which has raised doubts about thousands of criminal cases. Massachusetts authorities will review the sentences of 1,140 people who are in prison after being convicted with evidence at least partly provided by Dookhan, whose work with criminal evidence is under investigation. At the time, state police were taking over what had previously been a Department of Public Health drug laboratory, which certified random drug tests for the police departments in Norfolk, Suffolk, Middlesex and Bristol counties, as well as for Cape Cod and the nearby islands. She allegedly "lied about the integrity of drug evidence that she analyzed," according to an attorney general statement Friday. Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick ordered the lab to be shut down on August 30.
