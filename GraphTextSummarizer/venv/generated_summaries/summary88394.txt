The People's Liberation Army Air Force has trained macaques to keep its troops safe by discouraging birds from nesting near the air force base, the PLA's website reported earlier this week. When swarms of birds fly around the base, it poses a threat to military planes that are in mid-flight. When the nests of birds are discovered in tree tops, the monkey army is deployed to remove them. The monkeys are used in an unidentified air force base in northern China, which is situated right on a major migratory route for birds. The PLA have tried many different methods to remove the nests in the past, including opening fire on the nests, using long bamboo poles to topple them out of trees, and having soldiers climb the trees to pick them out.
