-- As Mayor Michael Bloomberg vowed would happen, the New York City Law Department has filed an appeal after a New York judge scrapped the city's controversial ban on big containers of soda. Some 20% of New York City public school children are obese and another 20% are overweight, according to the city. Sugary drinks linked to 180,000 deaths worldwide "The organizations and individuals who have joined these amicus briefs understand the toll that obesity is taking on communities here in New York City and across the nation," Bloomberg said. "We very much questioned the efficacy of putting a dent in obesity by restricting the cup size in restaurants in New York City that sold sugar-sweetened beverages," said Scott DeFife, the association's executive vice president for policy and governmental affairs, in an interview this month. "We don't think that micromanaging food service packaging is the way to end obesity in New York City."
