"It was a bit like finding the holy grail," said Anton van Helden, the collection manager of marine mammals at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. So rare is the species that when a pair of dead whales washed up on a New Zealand beach in late 2010, scientists didn't even know what they had. Scientists can only guess based on what they know about other beaked whales, which are often boat-shy, spend little time at the surface and dive to depths of 6,600 feet (about 2,000 meters), according to van Helden. "Yes, the discovery is indeed most exciting," said geology professor Ewan Fordyce, who studies the evolution of whales and dolphins at University of Otago but who was not involved in the research. "We now have collected the only complete specimen in the world of this rarest of whales," van Helden said.
