These days the town makes most of its money from old people and "stag and hen" nights -- drunken pre-nuptial parties with half-naked gangs of drunken lads and lasses falling in and out of strip clubs, sex shops, bars and brothels. The town's like a British version of New York's Coney Island, with miles of rundown old buildings, tattered and torn and closed-down shops. They stumble past gift shops selling novelties concerned with sexual organs, like pens shaped like penises and coffee mugs with breasts on them. Other residents of Blackpool town center include students who work in the amusement arcades and bars, and there's a sizeable proportion of aged pensioners who've retired there. The other businesses that are doing well are the shops who sell the cut-price alcohol, which are putting Blackpool's pubs out of business.
