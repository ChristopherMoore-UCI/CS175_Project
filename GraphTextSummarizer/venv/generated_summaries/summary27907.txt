-- Former Agriculture Department employee Shirley Sherrod said Thursday she will pursue a lawsuit against conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart. "I wonder if Ms. Sherrod, who is such a champion of transparency, will publicly disclose who is putting her up to this. "I'm also waiting for Ms. Sherrod to publicly apologize for accusing anyone opposed to nationalized healthcare of being racist," Bozell said. He has said he released the Sherrod video because he believes it shows the NAACP itself tolerates racist behavior within its ranks -- an accusation that came after the civil rights group made a similar charge against the conservative Tea Party movement. Brent Bozell, head of the conservative Media Research Center, said Thursday Sherrod was the one who needed to apologize.
