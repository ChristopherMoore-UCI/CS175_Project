"We were born on carpets and we grew up in houses filled with Pirot carpets." Mastery of craft Pirot carpets are very thin but extremely dense, and are said to last more than a century. It's the knowledge I learned from my mother and my grandmother," says Slavica Ciric who founded the Lady's Heart cooperative in Pirot with local women in 2009, to try to stop the skills nurtured throughout centuries from passing into oblivion. Their dexterous fingers race up and down large wooden looms, weaving the bold geometric patterns distinct to Pirot carpets. Once celebrated throughout Europe for their beauty, Pirot carpets graced the walls and floors of Serbian royal palaces, as well homes of the urban elite. And it's those patterns that give Pirot carpets a mystical allure.
