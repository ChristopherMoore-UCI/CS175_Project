In negotiations with Kodak, Weinstein Co. is joined by Warner Bros, Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, and Walt Disney Studios. The Wall Street Journal reports that a group of directors, led by the likes of Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Judd Apatow, and J.J. Abrams (who is filming Star Wars VII on film) pushed studio heads into negotiations with the film company. Apatow told the newspaper that both film and digital video are "valid choices" but "there's a magic to the grain and the color quality that you get with film." But in the interest of staving off premature extinction, a group of directors have banded together to keep the Eastman Kodak Co. making movie film. These discussions, which the WSJ broke the lid on, revolve around promises to buy a set quantity of film for the next several years, regardless of whether they plan to use all of it.
