Nominated for six Grammy Awards, including nods for album of the year and song of the year, Adele surprised fans when she tweeted about her impending performance. Yet, Adele's singles are still permanent fixtures on the radio, but not in the same way that Bruno Mars and the Black Eyed Peas are, Yahoo.com music columnist Paul Grein said. One Boston Globe writer even profiled a few people brave enough to admit to crying along to Adele's "Someone Like You." "(Adele) really struck a chord at the right time," Bakula said. "And Adele, even though she's having big hits, too ... you have the sense that her career probably won't always be as a big radio star." "You don't see pyrotechnics and fog behind Adele," Caulfield said.
