Grant's killing sparked public furor, when cell phone video went viral showing former transit police officer Johannes Mehserle shooting him in the back, while another officer knelt over him. The Bay Area Rapid Transport (BART) settled a federal civil rights lawsuit out of court for a sum of $175,000, spokeswoman Alicia Trost told CNN. Activists felt the former law officer deserved the tougher conviction of second degree murder, and violent protests erupted after Mehserle's sentence was handed down. BART has implemented dozens of recommendations made by the Nation Organization of Black Law Enforcement (NOBLE) since Grant's killing, Trost said. -- A California transit authority has agreed to pay damages to five men who were detained with Oscar Grant, the victim of a high-profile fatal police shooting in 2009.
