The carrier, taking fun seriously, quickly established a reputation for edgy safety videos -- part of the company strategy, Air New Zealand CEO Christopher Luxon told CNN. The "Safety in Paradise" video, which rolls out on Air New Zealand flights at the end of February, is beautifully shot and certainly cheerful and fun. From the negative corner, while some commented they were appalled Air New Zealand would be so sexist, others said the Sports Illustrated version just isn't all that clever -- a disappointing follow up to the airline's creative safety videos of the past. Many praised Air New Zealand for using beautiful women to promote the Cook Islands and complimented the airline on its marketing prowess, given the mass of media attention now being given to the safety video. The most recent effort though is being criticized by some as neither ground-breaking nor as creative, after the airline teamed up with Sports Illustrated magazine to produce what it's calling "the world's most beautiful safety video."
