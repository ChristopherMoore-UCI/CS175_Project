-- The United States Navy has 323,000 active duty service members, many of them housed in close quarters -- yet it is able to avoid major outbreaks of contagious diseases like those seen on commercial cruise ships. "It's important to keep it clean because cross-contamination is a big factor for illnesses," said Jakeila Owens, Iwo Jima culinary specialist. Keeping vessels extraordinarily clean is part of the daily routine for everyone onboard U.S. Navy ships. "If you have a ship whose main center of gravity is social gatherings, food places, dancing areas places for libations, and gating on decks and swimming pools -- all of those things that sailors wish they had, but don't have on our Navy ships -- then I think it is a much more challenging environment to control the spread of a highly contagious virus," Nathan said. Once you do become ill from one of these highly contagious organisms, you are really chasing it then," Vice Adm. Matthew Nathan, Surgeon General of the Navy, told CNN.
