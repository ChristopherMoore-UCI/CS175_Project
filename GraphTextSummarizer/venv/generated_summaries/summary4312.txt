"My biggest goal is to compete at Australian Open," the 26-year-old Spaniard told CNN Espanol, referring to the first grand slam of 2013. He has also seen Britain's Andy Murray, who won the men's singles gold medal at the 2012 Olympic Games, move above him in the world rankings after securing his first grand slam title at last month's U.S. Open. Nadal has been forced to watch from the sidelines as longtime rival Roger Federer returned to the top of the world rankings after winning a seventh Wimbledon singles title. Eleven-time grand slam winner Nadal refused to rule out playing in Spain's Davis Cup final match against Czech Republic in November, but admits it could be difficult to force himself into the team after a three-month absence. The former world No. 1 has been sidelined with tendonitis -- inflammation in the knee -- since withdrawing from July's Olympic tournament and has not played since losing to unseeded Czech Lukas Rosol in Wimbledon's second round.
