The U.S. attorney's office in Tampa said Scott Allan Bennett hasn't been indicted but has been charged by criminal complaint for actions last year at MacDill Air Force Base, the headquarters of both Central Command and Special Operations Command. It said Bennett "was apprehended by base security forces during a random base entry vehicle check." The affidavit says Bennett "repeatedly held himself out to officials in the Housing Office" at the air base as being on active duty and eventually was approved for the on-base living quarters. Regarding the charge concerning the weapons, Chalela said Bennett had moved on base "just a few days" prior to the April 23 incident. When Bennett was asked if there were more weapons in the car, he said there weren't any.
