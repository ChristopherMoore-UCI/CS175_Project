President Richard Nixon smiles and waves to a supporter in Washington in January 1973. They show President Richard Nixon at both his best -- delving into the intricacies of Cold War diplomacy -- and his worst, plotting against his perceived political enemies in the media and elsewhere.

At another point, Nixon tells then-Republican National Committee Chairman George H.W. Bush that the GOP can further boost its electoral fortunes by recruiting "attractive" women to run for office. Still basking in the afterglow of a landslide 49-state reelection in 1972, Nixon at one point tells aide Charles Colson that he wants nothing to do with those who would advise reaching out to critics in order to try and unify the country.
