"We are extremely disappointed that organizers of Black Lives Matter protest chose to ignore our stated policy and repeated reminders that political protests and demonstrations are not allowed on Mall of America property," AoM's said in a statement. A choir of protests echoed through the country's quintessential megamall, when a few hundred demonstrators from Black Lives Matter raised their voices at the Mall of America. They held the protest Saturday against the Bloomington, Minnesota, mall's wishes, and were met by police who made at least 20 arrests, CNN affiliate KARE reported. " Marchers raised their hands in the air and lay down to play dead -- simulating the deaths of young black men Michael Brown of Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner, of New York, in confrontations with police. Officers called out to the crowd to leave, police spokesman Mark Stehlik told KARE.
