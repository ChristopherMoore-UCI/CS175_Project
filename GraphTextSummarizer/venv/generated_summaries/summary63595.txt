" Tunisia's president: 'The extremists are a minority of a minority' Ennahda executive bureau member Abdel Hamid Jlassi said party officials were meeting to discuss whether to accept the dissolution. Chokri Belaid was shot dead outside his home Wednesday morning, throwing the country into confusion and prompting angry protests. The climate of intimidation included calls by preachers in some mosques in July for the killing of certain Tunisian political figures and personalities, including Chokri Belaid, she said. Belaid routinely received death threats for his outspoken criticism of Tunisia's moderate Islamist-led government. Tunisia has made great progress toward democracy in the past two years, she pointed out, with presidential elections expected after the new constitution is approved, likely later this year.
