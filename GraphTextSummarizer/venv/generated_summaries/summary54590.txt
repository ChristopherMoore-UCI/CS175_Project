Meanwhile, Concha has become a spokeswoman for the movement against clinics that claim to cure homosexuality and is working with organizations that aim to raise awareness on this issue. Some of these clinics operate as addiction treatment centers, but they offer homosexuality cures in a clandestine way. Moreira, the health undersecretary, says new regulations for addiction treatment centers were implemented last year. "What concerns us is that we have reports about their methods to change a person's sexual orientation and treatments that include torture and human rights violations." Since CNN visited Bridge to Life, the Ecuadorian government says, two raids were conducted at the clinic. The government, Moreira says, is aggressively investigating reports of clinics supposedly offering to cure homosexuality.
