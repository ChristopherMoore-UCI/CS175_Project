" This is all part of a crackdown resulting in the deaths of more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen from April 19 to 21, Yemeni officials have said. " U.S. special operations troops have played a role in the offensive, in part by flying Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot in southern Yemen. Operations have included attacks by Yemeni commandos and suspected U.S. drone strikes, according to a Yemeni official. "So far, dozens of Yemeni soldiers have been killed or wounded and dozens of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) members have been killed or wounded. The high-level Yemeni government official said Thursday that "decisive battles" are ongoing, with troops "conducting ground operations still in the toughest areas."
