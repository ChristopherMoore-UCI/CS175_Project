Emma Llanso, a policy attorney with the Center for Democracy & Technology, said proposals by various governments to treat internet connections like the telephone system are cause for concern regarding privacy and the unfettered, free flow of information. The dot-nxt site has published a clearinghouse of leaked documents regarding member proposals. Some European and Middle Eastern members are calling for so-called termination fees, in which networks where a web session begins must pay the routing cost for the session's destination â€” like phone companies work with phone calls. It's a closed, government-controlled agency that should not be making decisions about internet policy," he said. Llanso said termination fees, which would obviously be paid for by consumers, also opens the door to more internet monitoring.
