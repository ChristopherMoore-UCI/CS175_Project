FIFA strengthened its ethics code after the suspension of former AFC chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, who challenged Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency and was also a member of the executive commitee. Manilal, who is chairman of FIFA's Futsal Committee, launched the 2012 World Cup in that mini version of football in Thailand last December. He lists meeting Brazilian legend Pele and being elected to FIFA as his "fondest football memory" and is also a supporter of English Premier League giants Liverpool. A high profile member of FIFA's executive committee, has been provisionally banned from "football related activity" for 90 days, the world governing body said Monday. There is no suggestion Manilal was involved, but Bin Hammam withdrew 24 hours before the presidential election ballot after being provisionally suspended by FIFA.
