The film's producer, South African Anant Singh, says he first started corresponding with Mandela about the movie's rights when the iconic leader was still behind bars. Starring British actor Idris Elba as the beloved South African icon, "Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom" had its South African premiere Sunday in a buzzing Johannesburg cinema. " "Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom" will be released in South Africa on November 28 and one day later it will premiere in in New York and Los Angeles. "It is an exceptional honor to have the film screening hosted by President Obama at the White House as it is the first for a South African film," said the movie producer.
