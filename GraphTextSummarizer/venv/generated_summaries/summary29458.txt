Stephen Lowy is the son of Westfield's founder and chairman Frank Lowy, who fled post-war Europe to set up shop in Sydney in the early 1950s. "In one sense the Games is an interruption to that normal footfall, in another sense it is a massive opportunity in exposing new people to the building who ordinarily would not come here on a regular basis," said Steven Lowy, co-chief executive of the Westfield Group. "We are looking for cities that are important from a world context, cities that are important in robust economies, and robust political markets that give you some sort of certainty," Lowy said. "The first developing market that we really entered into was Brazil, and that was last year," Lowy said. "Governments focus on consumer behavior, it is hugely important for any country from an economic perspective, and so we are at the fulcrum of that and we do our best to make sure that our buildings produce enormous economic activity," Lowy said.
