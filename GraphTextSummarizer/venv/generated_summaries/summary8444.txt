A longtime flight attendant told KARE that children who are traveling alone normally get special attention. Officials in Hennepin County are waiting until "things are resolved out there" before proceeding with the case, Chuck Laszewski said. As of Monday, the boy was still in Las Vegas, where his status will be discussed in court Tuesday, a spokesman for Minnesota's Hennepin County said. Over the years other airports have had similar incidents. The following morning the child took a light-rail train to the airport, cleared security and made it to Las Vegas nearly without detection.
