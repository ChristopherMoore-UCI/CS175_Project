The hardware and software system, the first of its kind for the iPhone, is called AOptix Stratus, which comprises both the iOS app â€” which will cost $199 â€” and a wrap around device for an iPhone 4 or 4S. The app uses the iPhone camera to snap pictures of faces and record voices, while there's an extra camera that does iris scanning and a small sensor to scan fingerprints. AOptix has unveiled its app and a wrap-around device for turning the smartphone into a portable iris, face, fingerprint and voice scanner. Think of a border protection agency that could use iris recognition at an airport's customs checkpoint, or a police or law enforcement agency that needs to verify identities on the go and can't afford large, cumbersome hardware to do so. This automatic capture works both with the iPhone camera and with the built-in iris scanner. The app allows the user to create a person's profile including his or her iris, face, voice, fingerprints and biographical information.
