So the family decided to spend $26,000 on two massive SpongeBob monuments at Walker's gravesite -- one in an Army uniform for Walker, and another in a Navy uniform to honor Kara, an IT specialist for the Navy. "Every year, my sister had a SpongeBob birthday party," Walker's twin sister Kara said. " Even her curtains and bathroom were decked out with the underwater fry cook's image, her mother told CNN affiliate WLWT. "The funeral home actually bought the pillow of SpongeBob and we asked if they could put it in her casket," Deborah Walker said. Before the family ordered the SpongeBob memorials, it got the go-ahead from a cemetery representative, Deborah Walker said.
