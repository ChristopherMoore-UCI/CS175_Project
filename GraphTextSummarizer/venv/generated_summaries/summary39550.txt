Three years of political transition, including a devastating year of Muslim Brotherhood rule, prompted many Egyptians to long for a disciplined strongman who can guide the country towards security and stability. Even the head of the Coptic Church in Egypt, Pope Tawadros II, has endorsed el-Sisi's presidential bid, not surprising, especially after Muslim Brotherhood supporters were blamed for attacks on scores of churches around the country as deadly clashes took place in Cairo last August. Of course, his success is not guaranteed, but his strong connection to Egypt's most influential institutions serves as a positive asset that sets him apart from other candidates. At this juncture of Egypt's post-Mubarak story, only former army chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has emerged as a candidate who enjoys both the support of the state and the street. In comparison with the political upheaval in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, and other places in the Middle East, Egypt still seems better off.
