As the host of the popular "American Bandstand," Clark shaped American tastes in music trends, and with a fresh-scrubbed, boy-next-door persona, he introduced the world to likes of Buddy Holly and James Brown. "He has been cremated, but no other plans have been finalized," Clark publicist Paul Shefrin told CNN. -- Dick Clark, the music impresario and host of "American Bandstand" who died this week, has been cremated, his representative said Friday. Clark's "American Bandstand" began as a local TV show in Philadelphia in 1956. In 1960, the Ku Klux Klan sent death threats to Clark when he brought his short-lived "American Bandstand" spinoff "The Dick Clark Show" to Atlanta.
