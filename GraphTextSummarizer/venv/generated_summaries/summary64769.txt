Trying to distill amorphous concepts of Korean-ness into physical form was Cho's task when he designed the South Korean pavilion at the recent Shanghai Expo. " It was not until 2003 that Cho made it back to South Korea to set up his firm, Mass Studies, so some questioned if he was the best candidate to design South Korea's pavilion at the Shanghai Expo. " Many of Cho's buildings are in South Korea, but some of his temporary structures, such as the "Air Forest" set up in Denver, U.S., in 2008 and "Ring Dome" seen in Milan and Yokohama, have made it abroad. "I'd been influenced by many other cultures, so that was a big challenge to address this Korean quality in a contemporary way," Cho said. That was when he was 12 years old and after he graduated from Yonsei University in South Korea he moved to the Graduate School of Architecture at Columbia, New York.
