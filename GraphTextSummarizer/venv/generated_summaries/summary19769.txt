"We have been constantly compared since we were in junior competition so I always considered her a rival," Kim told reporters last year. Both Asada and Kim plan to retire following this year's Winter Games. Asada and Kim have been adversaries since their very early days as competitive skaters, and have shared honors throughout their respective careers. Asada finished up as runner-up to her nemesis the last time they met in Olympic competition, taking the silver while Kim grabbed the top podium spot. They were born only 20 days apart, in 1990, and given the length and depth of their on-ice history, it is fitting that they should both choose to bow out of the sport at the same time.
