Joyce said the new partnership would benefit its frequent flyers in particular, with the airlines offering reciprocal access to tier status benefits, including end-to-end recognition of customers, lounge access and priority check-in and boarding. "By establishing this partnership we are providing our passengers with additional connectivity in Australia and the region and the ability to utilize enhanced frequent flyer benefits, and have access to premium lounges for an exceptional travel experience," he added. "We will be poised to deliver the best in networks, frequencies, lounges, loyalty programs and customer experience." As part of the deal, the Australian carrier will transfer its hub for European flights from Singapore to Dubai from April next year -- subject to regulatory approval.
