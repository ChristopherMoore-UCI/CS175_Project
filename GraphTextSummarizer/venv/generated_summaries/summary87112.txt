One of the fiercest rivalries in world football produced a relatively low-key affair, with the booking received by Iraq substitute Samer Saeed that led to the goal being the only yellow card brandished by Uzbekistan referee Ravshan Irmatov. -- Iran's bid for a record fourth Asian Cup final title began with a 2-1 victory over neighbors Iraq in Qatar on Tuesday, thanks to a late goalkeeping error by the defending champions' Mohammed Kassid. Peseiro replaced Al Johar in 2009 when the Green Falcons failed to qualify for last year's World Cup. The U.A.E. had won their only previous Asian Cup encounter in 1992 -- the communist country's last Asian Cup appearance, and second since it began in 1956. However, Iran leveled three minutes before halftime when Gholam Reza Rezai beat the offside trap to collect Andranik Teymourian's clever pass into the penalty area and beat goalkeeper Kassid for his ninth international goal.
