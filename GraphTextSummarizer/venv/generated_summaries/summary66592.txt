The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which provides assistance for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, has expressed alarm over reports of heavy gunfire from Syrian security forces into the refugee camp and other areas. -- Gunfire and shelling rang out across Syria's coastal city of Latakia early Tuesday amid reports of Palestinian refugees fleeing a restive and impoverished enclave there. The Syrian government vehemently denied reports that more than 5,000 Palestinians fled the refugee camp in the area after it came under fire from Syrian security forces. Bloodshed in the country has persisted since a government crackdown on anti-government protesters started in mid-March. Christopher Gunness, UNRWA spokesman, said refugees in Latakia had been asked to leave by the Syrian security forces.
