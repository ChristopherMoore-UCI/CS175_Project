Jesse Levin: There isn't a space that really exists like the active collaborative workspace and the true benefit for people is the mixed modality, the multi-dimensionality experience. We layered in entrepreneurship, build, art, music and culture and really kind of created this project around the notion that physicality stimulates innovation and creativity. The company's co-founders Lance Pinn and Jesse Levin talk to Smart Business about how an active collaborative workspace can stimulate innovation and creativity. So we designed a place for them to come in and if they're freelancers, if they're coders, or they're entrepreneurs; they can come in here, they can sit down on a yoga ball and do sit-ups and work at their desk or they can stand at a stand up desk and do pull ups and jam on their spread sheets and also go for a climb, take a yoga class, sit in the sauna, grab a coffee, check out the street art on the wall; you name it. We're really trying to experiment in a way where people can blur the lines between work, life, and play, as we like to say.
