Concern about corruption in Romania led northern European countries last year to block the country from joining the European Union's Schengen passport-free area. Nastase served as Romania's premier from 2000 to 2004 and remained an important figure in his Social Democrat Party. -- Former Romanian Prime Minister Adrian Nastase was hospitalized Wednesday after an apparent suicide attempt that took place hours after the Supreme Court confirmed his two-year prison sentence for illegally raising campaign funds, the government said. The country has been criticized by Brussels in recent years for failing to enact judicial reform and to solve corruption cases involving high-profile politicians. Nastase won't be allowed to run for or serve in public office for two years after he completes his prison sentence.
