-- Tour de France champion Bradley Wiggins doubled Britain's gold medal tally, just hours after the host nation won its first event at the London Olympics on Wednesday. Britain's cycling and rowing medal successes helped GB move up in the medal table from 21st to 10th, with hopes high that there could be more medals for the hosts at the Aquatics Center in Wednesday's evening session. Wiggins had been the favorite for gold after winning both time trial stages en route to becoming Britain's first Tour de France Champion last month this year, and his dominance was clear to see as he finished eight seconds ahead of the Germany's 2011 world champion Tony Martin. Australia's Kate Hornsey and Sarah Tait claimed silver, with Juliette Haigh and Rebecca Scown of New Zealand a mere 0.33 seconds behind in third. With his seventh Olympic medal, four of them gold, Wiggins is now the most decorated British Olympian, while the morning's medal ensured Heather Stanning and Helen Glover became the first British female rowers to win an Olympic title.
