I love staying connected to friends, and will occasionally post photos on Facebook, but I rarely put my kids' photos on the Web or my blog. I asked her if she felt posting photos on Facebook was a real danger to her kids, and she said she believed, "It could be, but to me, it is more of an ethical decision." Mary Kay, mother of two, has no issue having her kids' photos on the Web. Yet, I notice a lot of blogs seem to be nothing but family photos. She said, "I have not heard of any parents with young children being stalked because they saw pictures of kids on someone's Facebook page." She said it is far more common "for tweens to create a Facebook page, lie about their age, post provocative photos and profiles that are not private, tag their names and very easily become accessible."
