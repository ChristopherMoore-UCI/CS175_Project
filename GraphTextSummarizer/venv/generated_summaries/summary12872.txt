("Girls in bikinis battle enormous Transformer-style robots, helped by Daft Punk-style storm troopers on Tron motorcycles," went the description of a TripAdvisor reviewer.) The band's videos sometimes take months to come together, OK Go's Damian Kulash told HLN last month, and the day they debut is usually the quietest they've had in a while. The band worked with Japanese director Morihiro Harano to design the 5-minute-plus clip, which begins with the group on UNI-CUBs doing some leg moves and then rises high over a building lot while the band is joined by several -- and then dozens -- of umbrella-toting Japanese schoolgirls. Part of the idea came from a visit to Tokyo's Robot Restaurant, kind of a Medieval Times with robots. The band's creative videos have made use of treadmills, dominoes and optical illusions.
