Lee Hollingsworth of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds told CNN it was not uncommon for Asian fishermen to use birds such as cormorants to dive down and retrieve fish that are then regurgitated whole. "They will remain in detention on Christmas Island while immigration officials consider any claims to remain in Australia." Australian media reports said the men spent 25 days afloat in the cooler, surviving only by drinking rainwater and eating regurgitated fish dropped by birds. -- Two men found floating in a giant cooler off the Australian coast say they want to stay in Australia and don't want to go home, immigration officials said Friday. The men will be transferred to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, where Australia has an immigration detention facility, a spokesman for the Department of Immigration and Citizenship told CNN.
