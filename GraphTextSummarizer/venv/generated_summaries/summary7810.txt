There is still a possibility that disease will return in these patients, but the chances are low, Fauci says, and being able to live many years without therapy is "a pretty good bonus" of early treatment. But in situations like this one, it can be said that there is "sustained remission that doesn't require therapy," says Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Usually, mothers with HIV get treatment so that the infection is not transmitted to their baby in the first place; for the United States, the situation is a "fluke," Fauci said. A recent study in the journal PLOS Pathogens reports that 14 patients with HIV, who received antiretroviral treatment within 10 weeks of infection, had their viral loads decreased so much that scientists say they are "functionally cured. Normally, after a person gets infected with HIV and years pass, the virus establishes a reservoir in the long-lived T-cells called lymphocytes, Fauci explains.
