In addition to air operations, the fleet has deployed surface ships equipped with sophisticated search capabilities. According to Marks, the "TPL-25 Towed Pinger Locator System" is able to locate black boxes on downed Navy and commercial aircraft down to a maximum depth of 20,000 feet (6,096 meters) anywhere in the world. The P-3's long-range, long-loiter capability -- it can remain in the air for up to 16 hours -- has made it the benchmark for maritime patrol aircraft -- and perfect for this type of search. In the past week, the spotlight has shifted to an expanse of the Indian Ocean more than 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) southwest of Australia, triggered by satellite images showing "suspicious" objects floating in the water. Satellites China has had satellite assets deployed in the search for the missing airliner from the early stages of its disappearance -- including the optical earth observation satellite "Gaofen-1," which is responsible for the latest images of "suspect objects" floating in the southern Indian Ocean.
