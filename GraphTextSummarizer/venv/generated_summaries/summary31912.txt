"Boeing recommends operators inform flight crews of the above investigation details and the (Dutch Safety Board) interim report when it is released. -- Boeing is asking pilots who fly its 737 jets to pay careful attention to flight instruments after Dutch investigators said a faulty altimeter contributed to the recent crash of a 737 in the Netherlands. The plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed, said Pieter van Vollenhoven, head of the Dutch Safety Board. "Boeing reminds all operators to make sure flight crews pay close attention to all primary flight controls during critical stages of a flight," Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx told CNN on Thursday. Automatic pilot should not be used for landings if altimeters are malfunctioning, he said.
