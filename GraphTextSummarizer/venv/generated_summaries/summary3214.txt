The judges found the federal government used "an unrealistically low estimate" of the amount of oil Shell might be able to produce when calculating the project's impact on the Arctic environment. "Until it knows those impacts, it can't decide whether to proceed with the leases, and it has no business letting Shell continue to operate under leases that the government is going to have to reconsider." Both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service had questioned the 1 billion figure before Shell's lease sale was approved in 2008, the decision states. Shell has invested billions into its Arctic oil plans and began preparatory drilling in September 2012. Officials with what was then the Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department agency that handled oil and gas leases, estimated the potential amount of recoverable oil at 1 billion barrels. Niel Lawrence, a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the Obama administration "can't in good conscience authorize Shell to do exploratory drilling under those leases.
