A Pontotoc County, Mississippi, grand jury has charged Harry Bostick with drunken driving leading to a death, felony drunken driving and fleeing the scene of an accident where a death occurred, according to the indictment filed on Thursday and obtained Monday by CNN. Asked Monday night about the new charges, Linda Smith said she doesn't want Bostick to get any more second chances. In the grand jury indictment, Bostick is accused of "willfully, unlawfully and feloniously" driving while intoxicated; refusing to immediately stop or give his name, address or registration; and having "negligently" caused Smith's death. That means that Bostick will avoid the possibility of a stiffer sentence if he's convicted on the charges tied to Smith's death, because it will be treated as his third DUI offense instead of his fourth. Charity Smith attempted to pull out onto a highway just outside Tupelo when Bostick's truck slammed into the side of her car, the patrol says.
