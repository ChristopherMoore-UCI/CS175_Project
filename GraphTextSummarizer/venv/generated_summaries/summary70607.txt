Kathreen Ricketson, 41, is believed to have drowned, Western Australia police said. The children have been reunited with family members, Du Cloux said. The children watched as other beachgoers desperately tried to resuscitate their mother after her body drifted ashore, CNN's Australian affiliate ABC News reported. But the dream turned to tragedy Wednesday when the parents apparently got into trouble while swimming off a remote beach in Western Australia, while their children, ages 10 and 12, were on shore. Class Constable Richard Du Cloux of Exmouth police told CNN.
