-- World champion Valentino Rossi capped his remarkable return to the MotoGP circuit by taking fourth place behind Dani Pedrosa in his first race since breaking his leg six weeks ago. Lorenzo leads the standings with 185 points, 47 points ahead Pedrosa with Rossi in sixth place on 74. Spaniard Pedrosa on a Honda came in clear of Rossi's Yamaha teammate Jorge Lorenzo in the German round of the championship at Sachsenring. Former world champion Casey Stoner pipped Rossi for the final place on the podium in a thrilling finish. The restart saw a shortened 21-lap race which gave Pedrosa the chance to register his second win of the season and cut Lorenzo's lead in the title race.
