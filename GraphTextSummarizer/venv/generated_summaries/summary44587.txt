The two A-listers haven't appeared together on screen since 2005's "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," where they met and fell in love. Universal Pictures Chairman Donna Langley is equally thrilled to collaborate with the two superstars: "Angelina and Brad represent two of Hollywood's brightest talents," she said, "and we are excited to be a part of their collaboration on this powerful piece." Sparks flew between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie the first time they worked together. Pitt and Jolie will co-star in "By The Sea," the upcoming drama written and directed by Jolie. The movie was a box office hit, offering audiences a glimpse at the first moments of Pitt and Jolie's high-profile romantic relationship.
