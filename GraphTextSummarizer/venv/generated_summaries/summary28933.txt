Previous launch attempts by the North in 1998, 2006, 2009 and April this year failed to achieve their stated goal of putting a satellite into orbit and provoked international condemnation. Experts had also speculated that Pyongyang wanted this launch to happen before the end of 2012, the year that marks the centenary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder of North Korea and grandfather of Kim Jong Un. " Washington will work with other countries -- including China, Russia and other Security Council members -- "to pursue appropriate action," said Tommy Vietor, a U.S. National Security Council spokesman. North Korea surprised and angered the international community Wednesday by launching a long-range rocket that may have put an object in orbit. Kim Jong Il died on December 17 last year, so the first anniversary of his death falls within the launch window that North Korea has announced.
