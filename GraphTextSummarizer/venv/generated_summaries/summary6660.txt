That's hard to say, admits Guiuan Mayor Christopher Gonzales, given the scale of what's happened. Situated where the Philippines meets the Pacific Ocean, Guiuan had the look and feel of a tropical paradise -- replete with surf camps, resorts and pristine white beaches. "If you want to look at our municipality," Gonzales said, "it's total damage; 100% damage." Its location on Samar Island's southeastern tip, in many ways, had been Guiuan's greatest blessing. " Guiuan was cut off from outside communication and many basic necessities until recently, when a C-130 military cargo plane flew over the ravaged area and landed at its small airport.
