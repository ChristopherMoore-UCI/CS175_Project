The Grammy-winning singer honored Nunn for her work with the Points of Light Foundation at a charity event in 2010 and has been a semiregular attendee at Clinton Foundation events since 2009. The Atlanta-based singer and dancer will hold a campaign event for Georgia U.S. Senate candidate Michelle Nunn on September 13, and the former President will be the fundraiser's marquee guest. Usher is hosting a Senate fundraiser, but Bill Clinton is getting top billing. "Both in office and out, President Clinton has been a tireless advocate for Georgia families and a force for consensus building and creative problem solving in Washington," Nunn said in a statement about Clinton's support. The former President has already helped Senate campaigns in Kentucky and Arkansas, and on Tuesday, he is set to campaign for Dannel Malloy, Connecticut's incumbent governor, in New Haven, and Rep. Mike Michaud, Maine's Democratic gubernatorial candidate, in Portland.
