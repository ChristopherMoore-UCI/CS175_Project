"Hickstead really was a horse in a million and my heart goes out to Eric and everyone connected with this wonderful horse," said Princess Haya bint Al Hussein, the wife of the prime minister of the United Arab Emirates and the president of the sport's governing body, Federation Equestre Internationale. " Lamaze rode Hickstead to win an individual gold for Canada at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and countless Grands prix and Nations Cup victories. Hickstead collapsed and died in front of hundreds of spectators at the Rolex F.E.I. World Cup in Verona, Italy, on Sunday. "Our deepest sympathies go out to the owners, to Eric and to all the connections of one of the greatest jumping horses of all time," said FEI Jumping Director John Roche. The Dutch Warmblood stallion completed the 13-track show jumping course and collapsed on the ground under his rider, the reigning Olympic champion and world number one Eric Lamaze.
