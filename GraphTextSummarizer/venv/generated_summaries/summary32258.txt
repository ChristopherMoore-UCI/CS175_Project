-- Orangutans and bonobos in one of North America's leading ape research centers are spending time high in their habitats to escape Iowa floodwaters, officials said Monday. Water on the grounds of the Great Ape Trust of Iowa in Des Moines has been as high as 14 feet after flooding began last week. The trust's Web site said the Des Moines facility, built in a former sand quarry, will be the largest in North America when it is completed. "The parts that house the animals all have drains, and being wet is a part of their daily routine," said Al Setka, director of communications. Research, including the future and origins of culture, language, tool use and language in ape species, was brought to a standstill, officials said.
