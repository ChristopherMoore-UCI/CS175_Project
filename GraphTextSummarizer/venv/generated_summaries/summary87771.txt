Mazda is the first Japanese automaker to report China sales data since violent anti-Japanese protests erupted in Chinese cities last month over the Senkaku islands -- a small chain of islets controlled by Japan but claimed by China. Japanese carmakers appear to be suffering significant sales declines in China over a flare-up over disputed islands in the East China Sea, after Mazda reported that sales in the country fell 35 per cent year on year in September. Nissan, Honda and Toyota are expected to report September China sales figures next week. September and October are the most important months for car sales in China, heightening the impact on production and profits. Goldman Sachs estimates that sales of Japanese-brand cars in China will be 40 per cent lower in the six weeks to the end of October than the same period last year.
