Testimonies included emotional accounts from men who say police stopped them for no reason and from police officers who say quotas forced them to make unnecessary stops. In the recordings, which were played in court by the plaintiffs' lawyers, supervising officers can be heard saying they want "more 250s," referring to the form that officers fill out when they conduct a stop, question and frisk. The federal class-action lawsuit claims that police officers routinely stop minority men, particularly black and Latino men, without legal reasons. City attorneys say that officers operate within the law, going where the crime is, and that crime happens to be higher in minority neighborhoods. Plaintiffs' attorneys maintained that police officers feel pressure to stop and frisk to meet supervisor demands, which consequently results in the unlawful and unjustified stopping of New York City residents.
