Attorneys act to conceal names in Zumba sex case According to Kennebunk police, authorities were tipped off in September 2011 to illicit activity at the studio. Both of the accused pleaded not guilty this month to prostitution-related charges: 106 against Wright and 59 counts against Strong. She allegedly got help from her business partner Mark Strong, a 57-year-old insurance salesman and private investigator. Today, the town -- a stone's throw from the tourist haven and rocky shores of Kennebunkport where, among others, former President George H.W. Bush has a seaside home -- is on edge, waiting for the other shoe to drop. Neither Wright -- whose studio is "now closed," according to its website -- nor her attorney, Sarah Churchill, returned calls from CNN.
