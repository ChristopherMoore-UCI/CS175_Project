BBC spokeswoman Katya Mira said the corporation has received at least 25 "official" complaints recently about Cerrie Burnell, new host of two shows on the BBC-run CBeebies television network, which is aimed at children younger than 6. Michael Carrington, BBC controller of CBeebies, said the company is standing by Burnell. In one chat room, a father lamented that Burnell being on the show forced him to have conversations with his child about disabilities. The BBC is receiving complaints about kids' show host Cerrie Burnell, who was born with one hand. Burnell started as a presenter of the shows in late January after acting with theater companies in Manchester, England, and Brazil.
