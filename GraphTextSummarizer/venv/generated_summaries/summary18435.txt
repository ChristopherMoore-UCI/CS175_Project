Wealthy Asian buyers Christie's picked Hong Kong to appeal to the growing number of wealthy Asian buyers that have made the city the world's third largest auction center after London and New York. More than 120 rare and vintage handbags estimated to be worth almost $1 million will go under the hammer in Hong Kong on Monday at a sale organized by auction house Christie's. Hong Kong, a popular shopping destination for moneyed Chinese, also has something of a tradition of trading in luxury handbags. It's the first time the 248-year-old company, better known for its sales of fine art, has sold handbags as a separate category at auction. A chain called Milan Station, which sells second-hand Chanel, Gucci, Hermes and Louis Vuitton handbags, listed on the city's stock exchange in 2011 and has spawned many imitators.
