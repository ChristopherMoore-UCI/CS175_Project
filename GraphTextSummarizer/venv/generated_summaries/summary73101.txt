Platini is understood to have held talks with FA chairman David Bernstein last week about the semifinals and final being held in English capital. London successfully hosted the 2011 European Champions League final between Manchester United and Barcelona. That game brought in $17.8 million for the FA and the governing body has already agreed a fixed rental price for next season's Champions League Final. The Frenchman is keen for one city to host the final stages of the tournament with London a huge draw following its recent triumph in hosting the 2011 Champions League Final and more recently, the Olympic and Paralympic Games. UEFA president Michel Platini is keen to revolutionize the tournament by holding matches across several European cities rather than just one or two countries.
