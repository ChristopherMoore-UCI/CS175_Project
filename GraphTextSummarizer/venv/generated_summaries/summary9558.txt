Newspaper vendor John Mgbachi, a former shoemaker from Eastern Nigeria, who has a stand in Tinubu Square on Lagos Island said that far from being bad for business, he welcomes the free readers. Welcome to Nigeria's free readers associations -- where mostly young men gather around newspaper vendors to read the headlines and debate the issues of the day. He added that the dire economic situation in the country meant that many Nigerians cannot afford to buy newspapers. Mgbachi added there has a been a sharp decline in readers because most people now read their news on the internet. Discussions among the free readers are loud and furious and have only intensified as Nigeria goes to the polls to decide who will be the next president.
