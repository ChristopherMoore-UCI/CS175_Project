Those Democratic or Independent governors criticized a federal appeals court ruling last year against federal oversight, saying it "allows upwind states to postpone the costs of air pollution controls for years, while in the interim downwind states and their residents are forced to suffer the present consequences of that pollution. An Obama administration lawyer did that Tuesday in closely watched environmental appeal, comparing federal efforts aimed at curbing air pollution to basketball scores. At issue is whether an "upwind" state that is polluting a "downwind" state is free of any obligations under the so-called Good Neighbor provision, unless and until federal regulators have quantified the upwind state's contribution to downwind state's air pollution problems. In Tuesday's session, Justice Department lawyer Malcolm Stewart got the ball rolling when he said the EPA should be allowed to use the somewhat discretionary standard "contribute significantly," when determining a state's cost-based share of transported air pollution. "There are various reasons to think that EPA reasonably construed that term to include a component of difficulty of achievement," he said of a downwind state's inability to comply, in the face of continuing pollution from its neighbors.
