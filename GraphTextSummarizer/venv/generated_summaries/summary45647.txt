Euromonitor predicts that by 2017, China will be the leader in international departures followed by Germany and Russia. Currently, Germany, the United States, UK, China and Russia are the top five countries for international departures, according to Euromonitor. China's October 2013 ban on shopping tours may result in a decrease in Chinese visitors to Hong Kong and Seoul (another prominent retail city), the report stated. According to Euromonitor, international arrivals to Hong Kong would be static without this group. Meanwhile, Chinese cities are struggling to attract visitors.
