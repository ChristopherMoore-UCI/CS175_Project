By 2009, Dolon's family had already gone through four different lawyers to help them apply for legal status with no avail. Durbin shared Dolon's story on the Senate floor earlier this year as a way to drum up support for the Dream Act -- an initiative that would legalize young immigrants who have been in the country for more than five years if they attend college or serve in the military. But without permanent relief, many like Monji Dolon are still in immigration limbo. -- It wasn't until his senior year of high school in North Carolina that Monji Dolon found out about his murky immigration status. His family had emigrated from Bangladesh in 1991 when Dolon was 5 years old and since then Dolon, his mother and his brother have lived without legal residency in the United States.
