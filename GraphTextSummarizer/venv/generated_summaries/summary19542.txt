Shafiq Ahmed, an official with Pakistan's meteorological department, said the tremor, which he put at magnitude 7.9, struck inside southern Iran, near the border with Pakistan. Tremors were felt in southern Pakistan, including the city of Karachi, and across Balochistan province from Gwadar on the southern coast to Quetta and the border with Iran. The lest earthquake comes on the heels of another last week in southern Iran, which left at least 37 people dead. A state of emergency has been declared in the Saravan area, and rescue workers have been deployed from other provinces, Iran's state-run IRNA news agency reported. The quake injured a dozen people in southeastern Iran, authorities said.
