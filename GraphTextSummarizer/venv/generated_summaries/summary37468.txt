Tropical storm force winds are expected to reach parts of the North Carolina coast by Thursday afternoon, with hurricane force winds arriving by late Thursday, the center said. -- Hurricane warnings and watches stretched from North Carolina to Delaware and covered parts of Massachusetts on Wednesday as forecasters upgraded Hurricane Earl to a Category 4 storm and warned it will be approaching the East Coast by late Thursday. On Wednesday evening a tropical storm warning for the area between Cape Fear, North Carolina, and Bogue Inlet, was extended from the North Carolina-Virginia border to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. The center extended hurricane and tropical storm watches and warnings northward through Massachusetts on Wednesday evening and said the storm's track has shifted slightly to the west, closer to North Carolina's Cape Hatteras. They will report to facilities in eastern North Carolina, but away from the coast, said spokesman Maj. Matt Handley.
