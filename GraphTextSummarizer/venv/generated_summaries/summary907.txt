These huge sharks' irregular behavior comes on the heels of the catch of a rare goblin shark in Florida in May and the closing of an Alabama beach because of a "swarm" of sharks this month. In August, researchers from the nonprofit group Ocearch tagged Katharine off Massachusetts' Cape Cod, along with the 14-foot long, 2,300-pound shark Betsy. This massive great white shark was most recently spotted 100 miles off the Florida coast in the Gulf of Mexico, headed toward Texas. Perhaps the tags will prove more helpful than the researchers in Cape Cod could have predicted, ensuring that Katharine's Texan size is all that she is remembered for. It is estimated that Katharine will be past the mouth of the Mississippi River in a week and will enter the waters off Texas not long afterward if she keeps to her current course.
