" "Choosing to advance Bush's NAFTA-style Korea free trade agreement rather than the new trade policy President Obama promised during his campaign will mean more American job loss," Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch said in a statement. -- U.S. President Barack Obama announced what he called a "landmark" trade agreement with South Korea on Saturday that he said will increase U.S. exports by $11 billion and support 70,000 American jobs. "In particular, manufacturers of American cars and trucks will have much more access to the Korean market, will encourage the development of electric cars and green technology in the United States and will continue to ensure a level playing field for American automakers here at home," Obama said. "In fact, it's estimated that today's deal alone will increase American economic output by more than our last nine free trade agreements combined." Obama made the announcement just after the Senate rejected Obama's proposal to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts to everyone but the wealthiest Americans. The new agreement calls for South Korea to reduce its tariff on U.S. auto imports from 8% to 4%, and fully eliminate it in five years.
