Huppenthal told CNN he was backing this week's decision by exiting state superintendent Tom Horne giving the state's second largest district 60 days to comply with a new 2011 law banning certain ethnic studies programs in public schools. -- Arizona schools superintendent John Huppenthal has told the Tucson district to stop teaching its controversial Mexican-American studies program or face losing $15 million in annual state aid under a new law, he said Tuesday. I don't understand what is so scary about that concept." Huppenthal, who was a state legislator for 18 years and was the chairman of the Arizona Senate education committee, said he was serious about enforcing a $15 million-a-year penalty that both sides agree would devastate Tucson schools, if the district doesn't end the ethnic studies program. Also Monday, Tucson superintendent John Pedicone told administrators and employees that he wouldn't tolerate any student walkouts protesting the state superintendent's actions. Huppenthal said he observed one of Tucson's ethnic studies classes last year.
