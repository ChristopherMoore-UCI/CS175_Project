" But de Villota is proof that kids and the track can mix, having grown up the daughter of former F1 driver Emilio de Villota. De Villota became the first female driver in Formula One in 20 years after joining Russian team Marussia in March in a testing role. Just weeks after De Villota signed with Marussia, 29-year-old Briton Susie Wolff joined Williams as a test driver. " De Villota is the first woman to be part of the elite motorsport since Italy's Giovanni Amati entered three grands prix for Brabham in 1992, but failed to qualify for a race. She now works alongside Marussia's newly-formed lineup of German veteran Timo Glock and French rookie Charles Pic, and plans to get behind the wheel during the 2012 season.
