Uruguay books place in final Venezuela increased the tempo in extra time; twice hitting the woodwork through Maldondo's deflected cross-come-shot and a free-kick from Juan Arango. The 5-3 loss denied Venezuela the chance to reach the final of the Latin American tournament for the first time. After the match, Venezuela's coach, Cesar Farias, was left to rue his team's ill fortune. Venezuela will now play Peru, who lost to Uruguay in the other semi-final, for 3rd place. The match itself was largely disappointing and finished goal-less, a far cry from the 3-3 thriller played out in the group stages by the same two sides -- Venezuela had come back from 3-1 down.
