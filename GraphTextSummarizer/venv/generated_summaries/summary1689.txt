French police have arrested four people linked to Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman and hostage-taker at a Parisian kosher supermarket on January 9, a Paris prosecutor's spokesman said. Charlie Hebdo has a controversial history of depicting the Prophet Mohammed, often in an unfavorable light, which has angered many Muslims around the world. Brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi, authors of the deadly attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices, were killed days later after two violent standoffs. Since the attack, European nations have carried out raids on suspected terror cells with links to ISIS in Syria. France has been under a heightened state of alert since January's terror attacks in Paris that killed 17 people.
