In a speech to the Republican National Committee, Huckabee said that it was wrong to give women access to no-co-pay birth control under the Affordable Care Act -- that by doing so, women were being told "they are helpless without Uncle Sugar coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they cannot control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of government." Of the thousands of types of medical care covered by insurance companies -- somehow  he and a lot of other politicians have focused like a laser on birth control -- on taking coverage away from women. They ignore the fact that women use birth control for a whole host of medical reasons -- and that's their business, not Mike Huckabee's. Former Arkansas Governor and presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee sparked outrage across the country this week for his offensive remarks about women and birth control. Many women also need birth control for medical reasons.
