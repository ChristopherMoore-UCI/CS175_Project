While Vawter, 31, has been part of the Illinois rehab center's trial for about a year, this weekend's fourth annual SkyRise Chicago fundraiser was the first public test of the technology. Levi Hargrove, from the Chicago rehab center, told WLS that "really advanced hardware" makes the device work. When Zac Vawter put his mind to climbing the 103 floors of Chicago's iconic Willis Tower, his legs did the rest. The Seattle resident scaled the skyscraper's stairway heights on Sunday thanks to what the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago calls the "world's first neural-controlled bionic leg." Among them was U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, who has worked tirelessly with the Rehabilitation Institute since suffering a stroke last January.
