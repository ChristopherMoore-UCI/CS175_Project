"The criminal history of the defendant, Radric Davis shows a complete and utter disregard for the lives of others as well as for their personal pursuits," Aladino Ortiz with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday. Rapper Gucci Mane will serve 39 months in prison after pleading guilty Tuesday to a federal firearms charge. He was facing up to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $500,000 on two counts of possessing a firearm as a felon after a pair of September incidents in which he reportedly showed a gun and threatened police. The plea agreement worked out with prosecutors saves Gucci Mane, 33, whose real name is Radric Davis, considerable time behind bars. On both occasions, Davis displayed the loaded firearm, acted erratically, and made threats to individuals, including police and his attorney."
