One cable quotes the ambassador as telling Eritrean officials: "Eritrean support for Somali extremists obviates closer ties and Eritrea will be held accountable for any al-Shabaab attack on the United States." "How do you think we would react to a major al-Shabaab terrorist attack against the United States?" In its short life, Eritrea has been involved in a ruinous border war with Ethiopia that cost thousands of lives, and is regularly accused by Western governments and the United Nations of supplying arms to Islamic militants in Somalia -- a charge raised by the ambassador with Eritrean officials. But Eritrea's alleged support for the Shabab militia - an affiliate of al Qaeda - didn't help matters. According to the cables, the government's stock answer was to blame America "and its puppet Ethiopia" for all its troubles, with President Isaias at one point claiming that the CIA was trying to lure Eritrea's youth abroad. In Eritrea, as in most of east Africa, football -- or soccer -- is a passion.
