In Spain's La Liga, Valencia kept their third grip on third place with a 1-0 win over Deportivo la Coruna as David Villa scored a first half penalty. Smith, who won his first seven Scottish titles with Rangers in his first spell at the club, savored the latest victory which has come against the backdrop of financial worries and uncertainty over the future ownership of the famous club. It was their fifth straight league win under interim manager Neil Lennon, but Rangers' title triumph was a formality which was confirmed later at Easter Road. Siem de Jong's early double gave Ajax a 2-0 lead after the Dutch Cup final first leg against Feyenoord. Kyle Lafferty scored his third goal in four games to secure the three points for Rangers, who were the defending champions.
