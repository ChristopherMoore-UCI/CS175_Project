Year after year, she forced me to take them at our local pool in Iowa City. My parents adopted me as an infant and went on to have a biological child -- my brother, Jason -- a couple of years later. The only news we got was that if Jason and I remained without a guardian, we would have to enter foster care. Mike says that Linda came up with the idea to make his role with Jason and me official -- he could become our guardian. As soon as he walked in, he took charge -- and took care of Jason and me.
