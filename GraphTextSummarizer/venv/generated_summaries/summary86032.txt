From the Boston hospital bed where he's being guarded by federal authorities, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev said he and his brother Tamerlan, 26, "decided spontaneously" to target Times Square, New York police Commissioner Ray Kelly said, citing information he received from the FBI. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg told reporters Thursday that the surviving suspect in last week's marathon blasts that killed three and wounded scores more told investigators that he and his brother were heading to New York next. While the targeted stretch of Boston's Boylston Street is often lively and always in focus on Patriots Day, New York's Times Square is a hub of activity -- including locals and tourists, vendors and performers, not to mention police officers -- most every hour of every day. Kelly, the city's police commissioner, said the surviving Boston attack suspect went to New York twice last year. Authorities don't know if those visits had anything to do with the Tsarnaev brothers' alleged plans to attack New York, nor do they have an indication that the city is "a target of another terrorist attack stemming from the Boston bombings," Kelly said.
