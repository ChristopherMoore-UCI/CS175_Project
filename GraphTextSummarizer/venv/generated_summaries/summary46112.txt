-- A man who survived the April 2007 massacre at Virginia Tech says not enough is being done to keep guns out of the hands of people like the shooter even as a jury found the university failed to warn students earlier that a gunman was on campus. Cho's mental health status should have been noted in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, a database of people disqualified from gun purchases. "We have Congressional representatives and many state legislators who have failed since Virginia Tech to keep the mentally ill and other dangerous people from easy access to guns," Goddard said. "It's outrageous that in America people sell guns without background checks and with no questions asked." In the aftermath of the shooting, Goddard went to work as a gun control advocate, calling for among other things stronger measures that keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill.
