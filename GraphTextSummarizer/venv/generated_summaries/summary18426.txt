Since the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, there has been a rise in interest from oil companies and government departments in funding new techniques for reducing the environmental impact and cost of future oil spills. -- Oil companies could soon be using an innovative new technique involving nanotechnology and magnets to help clean up offshore oil spills.

Robotic sailboats built to clean up oil spills While their impact on the environment is still largely unknown, scientists such as David Andrews from the U.S.-based Environmental Working Group (EWG), say their use should be limited. For Shaw, a newly developed skimmer from an Illinois company Team Elastic offers a better method for cleaning up oil spills.
