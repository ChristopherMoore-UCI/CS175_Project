" Hampshire police said Ashya was taken to Materno Infantile Hospital in Spain and that the facility was communicating with Southampton General Hospital, where the boy had been removed by his parents. British police have arrived in Spain to question the parents, Malaga police told CNN. Hotel staff members in Malaga, Spain, recognized Ashya and his family from media coverage and contacted police. After Ashya was taken from the hospital without authorization Thursday, the family -- including Ashya's six siblings -- boarded a ferry and headed to Cherbourg, France, that night, police in Britain said. Brett and Naghmeh King took their 5-year-old son, Ashya, who has brain cancer, to France and then Spain late last week, authorities said.
