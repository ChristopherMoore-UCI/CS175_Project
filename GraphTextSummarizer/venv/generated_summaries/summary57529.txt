-- Hip-hop artist Rick Ross learned Thursday he'd been dumped by the sportswear company Reebok after the company decided he hadn't shown an "appropriate level of remorse" for using lyrics in one of his songs that seemed to allude to raping a woman. In the song "U.O.E.N.O," Ross raps: "Put molly all in her champagne, she ain't even know it. At this time, it is in everyone's best interest for Reebok to end its partnership with Mr. Ross." The drug mentioned in Ross' song is "molly," which is a slang term for a powerful form of the psychoactive drug MDMA, commonly called ecstasy. While we do not believe that Rick Ross condones sexual assault, we are very disappointed he has yet to display an understanding of the seriousness of this issue or an appropriate level of remorse.
