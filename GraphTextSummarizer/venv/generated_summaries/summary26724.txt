Airline takes heat over note on wing Horizon Air was required to use solid rivets on the doors, but instead used blind rivets, which can be fastened from one side of a panel or structure, "blind" to the opposite side. The FAA discovered the violations last year when Horizon modified a 23rd aircraft with blind rivets, and the plane experienced an incident during a flight because of wire damage, the agency said. -- The Federal Aviation Administration has proposed a $1 million civil penalty against a regional airline for allegedly using improper rivets on cockpit doors, saying the rivets could have damaged wiring and other aircraft components. Bobbie Egan, a spokeswoman for Horizon Air, said the airline opted to use an "alternative and stronger" rivet, which Horizon believed was acceptable to the FAA. The agency said Horizon Air operated 22 aircraft for more than three years with the improper rivets, making at least 186,189 flights while the planes were "unairworthy."
