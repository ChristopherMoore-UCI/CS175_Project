-- Jim Lehrer, the mainstay of public television's longest running news show, is stepping aside as anchor of "PBS Newshour" next month, PBS announced Thursday. " Lehrer will be on the show "on many Friday evenings" to moderate the weekly analysis of syndicated columnist Mark Shields and New York Times columnist David Brooks, PBS said. Lehrer began paving the way for this transition in December 2009 when he agreed to drop his name from the title, making it the "PBS Newshour." "I have been laboring in the glories of daily journalism for 52 years, 36 of them here at the Newshour and its earlier incarnations and there comes a time to step aside from the daily process, and that time has arrived," Lehrer said in a written statement. Lehrer served as the show's Washington correspondent when it premiered as the half-hour "Robert MacNeil Report" in 1975.
