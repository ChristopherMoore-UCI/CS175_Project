"I'd like to pay an enormous tribute to (Hague), who is standing down as an MP at the next election," Cameron tweeted Monday night. While foreign secretary, Hague took a prominent stand on the issue of ending sexual violence in conflict, teaming up with Hollywood star and U.N. special envoy Angelina Jolie to call for global action. -- William Hague announced his resignation as Britain's foreign secretary, in what was perhaps the biggest surprise of a major government reshuffle by Prime Minister David Cameron. Cameron has promised a referendum on UK membership of the EU by the end of 2017 if he is still Prime Minister after the 2015 election. Hague said on Twitter that he would continue to lead the UK campaign to end sexual violence in conflict as Cameron's special representative.
