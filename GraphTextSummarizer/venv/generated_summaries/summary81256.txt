The brokerage has a team of about six people plus feng shui masters -- they won't say who they are -- working on the report for several months leading up to the publication. Interestingly, those with the same birth sign as the year sign invariably have bad years. Now in its 19th year, the index is a guide to your investment decisions -- specifically how the benchmark Hong Kong Hang Seng Index will perform -- over the next 12 months, based on the ancient Chinese art (or science, if you prefer) of feng shui. But before anyone dismisses this as a mere marketing ploy or mystical mumbo-jumbo, take a look at last year's forecast. If you are wondering what that entails, this report consults the experts on bazi (fortune charts), wu-xing (five-element theory) and xuan kong (flying stars).
