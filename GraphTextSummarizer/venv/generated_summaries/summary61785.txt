-- Hillary Clinton gave a full-throated endorsement of Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf on Thursday, delivering a fiery speech that hit Wolf's Republican opponent, pushed the larger Democratic midterm message and, at times, highlighted herself. Clinton's event with Wolf offered a dramatic contrast to the time she spent with Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn on Wednesday in Chicago. While Clinton and Wolf stood in front of a cacophony of television cameras and cheering supporters, Clinton and Quinn spent most of their time together behind closed doors at a private fund-raiser. Wolf, however, is a safer bet for Clinton, as most polls have the Democrat up by double digits over Republican incumbent Tom Corbett. Hillary Clinton's midterm campaign schedule "Listen, I am the one running for governor," Wolf said, half joking, when Clinton peeked her head around the curtain behind the stage and the crowd erupted in applause.
