A Democratic point man on the budget, Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, blasted the administration for its "reckless fiscal policies," blaming the president's tax cuts for driving the government into deficit and saying Bush "will be remembered as the most fiscally irresponsible president in our nation's history." "The determination was made that getting the economy back on track was a higher priority than immediate deficit reduction," Nussle said. President Bush inherited a budget surplus of $128 billion when he took office in 2001 but has since posted a budget deficit every year.

Nussle said the $170 billion, bipartisan stimulus, which congressional Democrats and Bush agreed to earlier this year, was a major reason the deficit was expected to reach record levels next year.
