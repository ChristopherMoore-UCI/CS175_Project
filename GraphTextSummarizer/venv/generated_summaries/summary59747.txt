Waves of this height are not very common in the Mediterranean under normal conditions, but it would not be unusual to find waves of this magnitude within strong storms (as was the case with these waves). Buoys nearby recorded significant wave heights (defined as the average of the largest 1/3 of waves over a 20 minute period) over 6 meters. Winds of this magnitude will result in a very rough sea state and large waves. Cruise ships are frequently affected by large waves all over the world, although normally not to this extreme, and with minimal consequences. How far from a storm can you find large waves?
