Clicking it brings up two options for organizing News Feed content: "Highlighted Stories First" or "Recent Stories First." The Recent Stories option will order News Feed items in reverse chronological order, though it is not as comprehensive as Facebook's real-time "Ticker". Facebook is rolling out an update to News Feed that lets people sort information by Recent Stories or Highlighted Stories. The new News Feed has the ability to see recent stories in News Feed if you had logged in recently, but it wasn't a comprehensive option. The social network revamped News Feed in September in an attempt to make sure users don't miss the important events in their friends' lives.
