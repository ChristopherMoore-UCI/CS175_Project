Both he and Hogg think the slowing pace of conventional drug development is driving more people to look to Chinese medicine. Dr. Yibin Feng at Hong Kong University's School of Chinese Medicine is studying the effectiveness of Chinese medicine treatments for cancer and liver disease. "Now new drug discovery from natural products and other material is more difficult that many years ago, people notice the wisdom in Chinese medicine," says Dr. Feng. Dr. Hogg believes gradually the foreign regulators will become more open to the range of Chinese drugs. Chi-Med is not alone in its efforts to take Chinese botanical drugs beyond China.
