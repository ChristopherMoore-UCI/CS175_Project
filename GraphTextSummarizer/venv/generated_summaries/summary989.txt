Boos, gunfire greet Colombian president's arrival in FARC area Colombia's Santos says government, rebels in talks GPS: As part of a road map for a possible peace deal, the FARC has said the government will need to enact land reform for peasant farmers, help coca growers plant other crops and reintegrate thousands of FARC soldiers into Colombian society. A possible peace deal will face many obstacles, including long-standing allegations that FARC guerrillas have enriched themselves with ransoms paid for kidnap victims and with drug trafficking. "Anyone who breaks the law in Colombia should be tried in Colombia," said FARC negotiator Ricardo Tellez. -- Members of Latin America's largest guerrilla group declared Thursday they will ask for an immediate cease fire when they meet with Colombian government negotiators for peace talks next month.
