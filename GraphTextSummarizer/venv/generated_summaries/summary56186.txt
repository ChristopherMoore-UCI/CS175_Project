Gloria Borger says independent voters generally like Obama's approach to the job of president. Way back in the campaign, a central question was whether voters could get comfortable with Obama; now they consider him a regular guy. While the inside-the-beltway chatter has been that the ubiquitous Obama ought to become a little more scarce (or voters will stop listening), these voters are clearly listening. "He was able to speak about health care in a way that people can understand," says Remi Brooke, 60, an Obama supporter. "He's more upfront, does a lot of speeches, verbalizes more than we've ever been used to," adds Nora Seeley, a 54-year-old dental hygienist who voted for Obama.
