A pharmacy graduate from Massachusetts who sympathized with al-Qaeda, and traveled to Yemen in the hopes of linking up with the terrorist group, was sentenced Thursday to 17Â½ years in federal prison, court officials said. "You might call (Mehanna) a terrorist wannabe," said Brown, who noted that Thursday's sentencing reflected an apparent compromise. U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole also handed Mehanna seven years of supervised release as a part of the closely watched decision Thursday. "This is one of the most significant terror-related cases ever brought," said Boston College law professor George Brown. "I think the judge wanted to be cautious and distinguish this kind of conduct from the more fundamental (and traditional descriptions of) terrorist acts," Brown said.
