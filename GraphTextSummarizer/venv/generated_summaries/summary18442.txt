But the police could do what they need to do to investigate gun crimes and to provide gun owners with an incentive to do background checks. Right now, federal law requires background checks only for gun sales made by licensed federal firearms dealers (FFLs), not private parties. And in the debate over gun control, the vast majority of the public also agrees that requiring background checks for all gun transactions -- even private sales at gun shows or between acquaintances -- would achieve this end. Requiring background checks for non-FFL sales in the secondary market can make it harder for criminals to get guns. This, they argue, is a violation of the privacy of gun owners and could one day help the government confiscate all guns.
