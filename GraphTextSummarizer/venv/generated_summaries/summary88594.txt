CNN: Is there a possibility that this alternate version of "Star Wars" could live on beyond these eight issues, at least in the fans' minds? Rinzler: Fans have been asking already about this, because so many things are hinted at particularly in the first issue, about the past, or characters in the periphery, or just spoken of and not seen. CNN spoke separately to J.W. Rinzler, who adapted Lucas' script for comics, and artist Mike Mayhew. CNN: What do you think fans will take away from this book? Rinzler: Based on early fan feedback from the first issue, they're really enjoying this alternate universe, and they're getting to read a story that's being told by George. You see many of the things you love in "Star Wars" but in a slightly different way. Mayhew: The characters in this story are much different than the characters in "Star Wars."
