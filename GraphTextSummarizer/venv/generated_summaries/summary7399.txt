All of this will be thrust on us by something that Kurzweil calls the Singularity, a theorized point in time in the not-so-distant future when machines become vastly superior to humans in every way, aka the emergence of true artificial intelligence. Kurzweil's magnum opus, "The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology," outlines the implications of this transition in a way that is simultaneously believable, terrifying, meticulous and mind-bendingly absurd. In the year 2050, if Ray Kurzweil is right, nanoscopic robots will be zooming throughout our capillaries, transforming us into nonbiological humans. Computers will be able to improve their own source codes and hardware in ways we puny humans could never conceive. See the rest of "The Singularity of Ray Kurzweil" at Motherboard.tv People like to tag Kurzweil as the "rightful heir to Thomas Edison," and that's not a stretch considering he's responsible for some of the most useful inventions of the past century.
