A dispute over natural gas supply flared Friday between Russia and Ukraine, even as a ceasefire between Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine appeared to be taking hold. The developing situation in eastern Ukraine was the focus of an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting in New York on Friday. Europe also has the option of reverse supply -- sending gas back through pipelines into Ukraine. Russia has used gas as a weapon before, cutting off supplies to Ukraine three times in the past decade. A meeting between the European Union, Russia and Ukraine is due to take place in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday to discuss gas supply to Ukraine.
