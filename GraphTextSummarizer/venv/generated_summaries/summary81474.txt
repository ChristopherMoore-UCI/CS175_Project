"This case shows what happens when companies fail to follow their ethical and legal responsibilities," said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. -- Illegal sales practices by CVS Pharmacy Inc. allowed criminals to make mass purchases of a component used in the manufacturer of methamphetamine, said federal prosecutors, who announced a settlement Thursday that will cost the company $77.6 million and bring new controls. Prosecutors said the violations occurred in California, Nevada  and "likely" 23 other states where "CVS failed to implement appropriate safeguards." In 2007, after Mexico banned the sale of pseudoephedrine, Los Angeles County experienced an epidemic of "smurfing", a practice in which individuals make multiple purchases of items containing pseudoephedrine with the aim of getting large amounts for use in meth production, the statement said. The company's improper sales of pseudoephedrine, an ingredient found in cold and sinus medicines, led directly to an increase in methamphetamine production in California, said the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, California. "Smurfers inundated CVS stores in Los Angeles and Orange County, and later stores in the Las Vegas [Nevada] area, to purchase cough and cold remedies, sometimes cleaning out store shelves," authorities said.
