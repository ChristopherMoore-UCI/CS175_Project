At one point, bloodied men from the pro-regime side were dragged toward the center of Tahrir Square by anti-government demonstrators who beat and kicked them along the way. Many of the injuries were serious, even though demonstrators wrapped sweatshirts and other clothes around their heads to protect themselves from flying stones. As night fell, pro-Mubarak forces began throwing Molotov cocktails, and with the sun going down, flames rose from the square. Some ripped street signs out of the ground, using the metal as makeshift shields. People tore paving stones out of the streets with crowbars and their bare hands, filling bags with rocks to use as an arsenal in the street battle.
