"Instead of continuing to torment Raif Badawi by dragging out his ordeal with repeated assessments, the authorities should publicly announce an end to his flogging and release him immediately and unconditionally," said Said Boumedouha, deputy director of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program. After enduring wounds from being struck 50 times, a Saudi blogger has been given a reprieve in receiving another 50 lashes this Friday, said Amnesty International. He was supposed to be beaten again the third week, but Saudi officials postponed that due to medical advice, the blogger's wife said. There is no way of knowing whether the Saudi Arabian authorities will disregard the medical advice and allow the flogging to go ahead," Boumedouha said. On Wednesday, a medical committee of about eight doctors assessed Badawi at King Fahd Hospital in Jeddah and determined he was too injured to withstand the beatings this week, according to Amnesty.
