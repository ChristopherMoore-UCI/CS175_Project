Officials do not dispute that Snowden had critical information about how NSA programs worked. -- U.S. intelligence now believes Edward Snowden did not gain access to the "crown jewels" of National Security Agency programs that secretly intercept and monitor conversations around the world, CNN has learned. Snowden did leak sensitive documents about anti-terror programs, detailing secret telephone metadata and e-mail surveillance. As such, the government has accelerated efforts to better secure classified information, improvements that had begun even before Snowden went public. The assessment also has concluded that Snowden took advantage of knowing that a good deal of information was concentrated in one portion of the NSA's computer system.
