Instead of sending more money to Washington -- instead of funding more Solyndras and racking up more debt -- we return power to the people by cutting tax rates and wasteful spending. Under our plan, people will spend less time navigating the maze that is Washington and more time developing the new ideas that will power our economy. And that's great for Washington; it thrives on more power. They want to take more from families to spend more in Washington. They'll face less opportunity, more debt, and fewer jobs.
