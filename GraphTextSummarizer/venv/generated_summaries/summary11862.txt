How heroin kills you "Rather than provide first aid or call 911, Ms. Tichleman proceeds to gather her belongings including the heroin and needles," the police statement reads. Detectives say security footage from the yacht shows Tichleman, who boasted of over 200 client relationships via a website called "Seeking Arrangements," injecting Hayes with heroin. Forrest Timothy Hayes, 51, had an "ongoing prostitution relationship" with Alix Catherine Tichleman, 26, when he was found dead November 23 aboard his 50-foot yacht in the Santa Cruz harbor, according to a police statement. Tichleman stepped over Hayes' body several times while gathering her belongings, at one point stepping over him to finish a glass of wine, police say. Tichleman appeared in court in Santa Cruz on Wednesday.
