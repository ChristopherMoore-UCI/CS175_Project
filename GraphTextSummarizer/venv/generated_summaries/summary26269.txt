"We are very saddened by this loss," said Chris Dold, vice president of veterinary services for SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. SeaWorld has had 26 successful births of killer whale calves in captivity, according to Dold, who said the birthing success rate is about 50 percent in the wild and 85 percent in a "zoological situation." -- A killer whale at SeaWorld Orlando died Sunday while giving birth, the theme park said. "Although we understand that complications with pregnancy can occur here, just as they do in the wild, the loss of any animal affects all of us at SeaWorld." Taima, a 20-year-old killer whale, died from complications associated with the birthing process, SeaWorld said. SeaWorld canceled two shows on Sunday, but all shows were expected to resume Monday.
