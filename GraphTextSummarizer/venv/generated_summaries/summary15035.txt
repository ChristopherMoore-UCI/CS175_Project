"As of today asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia," said Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in a statement announcing the law. "Our country has had enough of people smugglers exploiting asylum seekers and seeing them drown on the high seas," said Rudd, who previously served as foreign minister. As a consolation, if fewer boats arrive as a result of the policy, Australia plans to raise the number of legal asylum seekers it takes, Rudd said. It is roughly 2,000 miles from Australia's shores, where Rudd said in no uncertain terms that "boat people" are no longer to tread. "If they're found to be genuine refugees, they will be resettled in Papua New Guinea," Rudd said.
