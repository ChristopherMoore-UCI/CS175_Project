Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen requested the loan last Sunday after days of insisting Ireland did not need help. -- European Union finance ministers on Sunday agreed on an 85 billion euro (U.S. $113 billion) bailout package for Ireland. "The Irish authorities have today proposed a clear and realistic package of policies to restore Ireland's banking system to health and put its public finances on a sound footing," said Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the IMF. "The recent events have demonstrated that financial distress in one member state can rapidly threaten macro-financial stability of the EU as a whole through various contagion channels," the Eurogroup said in a statement. The plan calls for introducing water meters, making students pay more for higher education, and requiring more Irish workers to pay income tax.
