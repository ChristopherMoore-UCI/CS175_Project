When they fired at the shark they saw by the body, it "rolled over and disappeared," said Inspector Shawn Rutene. By the time police officers reached the swimmer floating off a New Zealand beach, it was already too late: a large shark was biting the lifeless body. He was swimming 200 meters (220 yards) offshore near Muriwai Beach, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) from central Auckland when the 12-to-14-foot shark struck. Police officers and life guards on the scene went out in inflatable boats. The attack took place off a popular beach west of Auckland on Wednesday afternoon, police said, as people gathered there to enjoy the summer sunshine.
