However, a member of the board's Refugee Protection Division, William Davis, has written in The Toronto Star that the board found that Huntley's case demonstrated "a picture of indifference and inability or unwillingness" by South Africa to protect "white South Africans from persecution by African South Africans." Kaplan is a human rights lawyer in Canada who left South Africa 20 years ago to escape the apartheid government's discrimination against black South Africans. Huntley's attorney, Russell Kaplan, said his client had been attacked seven times by black South Africans who called him a "settler" and a "white dog." The Immigration and Refugee Board recently granted refugee status to Brandon Huntley, 31, a South African native who has been living illegally in Canada. The board decided to let him live and work legally in Canada after Huntley argued he had been the victim of racial violence and discrimination in South Africa.
