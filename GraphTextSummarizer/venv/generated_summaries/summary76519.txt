Facebook is adding new security features, which come after a pair of high-profile cracks in the site's defenses that surfaced this week. "With a little motivation and not much skill, it's fairly trivial to sniff HTTP traffic," Alan Ross, the lead security analyst for Intel IT, told CNN in November. "The vast majority of people who have used Facebook have never experienced a security problem," Alex Rice, a Facebook security engineer, wrote on the company blog. Facebook reduced spam from partners' applications by 95% last year, Bret Taylor, the company's technology chief, said at a conference this week. The social networking giant currently employs Captcha technology, but this new method could supplant that.
