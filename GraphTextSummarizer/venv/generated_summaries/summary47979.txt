For years, Apple executives have labeled the set-top box a "hobby" product because of its mild success compared to blockbuster sellers like the iPhone and iPod. Now that Apple TV has been revamped into a streaming rental service with an arsenal of stealth features, maybe Apple has a chance to change the TV business -- if not today, perhaps later. For now, that capability is not included in Apple TV, but the underlying operating system certainly supports it, so Apple might open a TV App Store in a future software update. Long story short, you'll be able to wirelessly stream media from some third-party apps straight to your Apple TV with an AirPlay button. Now that we know Apple TV runs iOS, it's likely that third-party apps such as MLB at Bat or ABC Player will be able stream media to the set-top box, too.
