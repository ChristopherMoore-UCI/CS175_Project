" Davis said that while Marshall spent a short time following the Stones, it was enough to create a bond with some of the members, especially Richards. Davis said that Marshall's strong personality, fierce passion for music and his drive to get the best pictures while maintaining a sense of camaraderie made him relatable to musicians such as Richards. There will also be a show at New York's Steven Kasher Gallery from July 5 to September 8, and an exhibit at EMP Museum in Seattle, opening on July 14. Amelia Davis, a photographer who worked as Marshall's assistant, is the sole owner of Jim Marshall Photography. It was a heady time filled with parties and recording sessions and only one person was there to capture it all intimately -- famed music photographer Jim Marshall, who was covering the tour for Life magazine.
