-- At least 40 members of a religious minority in Myanmar were killed by security forces and Buddhists in the western village of Du Char Yar Tan last week, a human rights group said. Riot police have moved into the village, and journalists and human rights activists have been denied access, according to Fortify Rights. U.S. President Barack Obama urged Myanmar's President Thein Sein during a visit to the White House last year to respect the rights of the Rohingya minority. The U.N. calls the Rohingya Muslims one of the most persecuted populations in the world, and 3,500 of them live in the village of Du Char Yar Tan. The officers fled, except for police Sgt.
