All this talk about wings versus capsules goes to a larger point: What's the ultimate goal behind spacecraft like Dream Chaser, Dragon and Boeing's capsule, the CST-100? Gregory suggests that space planes are preferable because their engines would be designed to "breathe air like a jet at lower speeds" and then "switch to rocket mode in the high atmosphere." The theory behind space planes is they would be able to take off from a runway, rocket into low orbit, and then fly to a landing on a runway. " A downside of most capsules: They splashdown in the water, creating water damage, although Russia's Soyuz capsule's system allows it to land safely on solid ground. NASA's program to fund private spacecraft development offers only a fraction of that amount -- less than $400 million awarded so far.
