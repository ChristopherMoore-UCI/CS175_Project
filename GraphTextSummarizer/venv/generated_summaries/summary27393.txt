A simple hacksaw, which you could use with one hand, was much more effective." Roger Brydges, sailing accident investigator at the Maritime Accident Investigation Branch, said recreating sailing disasters to such minute detail had never been done before. "The authorities were telling us that a gas explosion was too dangerous, that we were crazy," former Yachting Monthly editor Paul Gelder said. These aren't undercover spies, but sailing experts undertaking a controlled explosion as part of a series of ground-breaking experiments into nautical safety. The Crash Test Boat series was first floated as Beeson and fellow sailing enthusiasts mulled over enduring maritime questions such as: 'What would you do if your mast fell over?' For the team, the explosion was also a thrilling chance to live out a few Bond-style fantasies, as Gelder said: "How many people get to blow up a 40 foot (yacht) as part of their job -- and all in the name of safety?" Now a battered mess, the Crash Test Boat continues to educate the public, exhibited at boating shows across Britain and used as a teaching aid at the International Boat Building College in Suffolk.
