The issue has raised attention on overall gun deaths in the country, with supporters of tougher gun laws noting that more than half all homicides involve firearms and U.S. levels are higher than other countries. While polls show Americans favoring expanded background checks and other proposals intended to crack down on gun trafficking, more pro-gun states have passed laws easing firearms restrictions. -- A compromise proposal to expand background checks on gun sales lacks enough support to win Senate approval now, which will likely delay a vote on the measure that has strong public support, one of the sponsors told CNN on Monday. Their amendment expands background checks to gun shows and all Internet sales, but exempts private transactions such as hunting rifles traded among family and friends. The amendment will be one of perhaps dozens to be debated on the broader package of gun laws drafted in response to the killing of 20 first-graders and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.
