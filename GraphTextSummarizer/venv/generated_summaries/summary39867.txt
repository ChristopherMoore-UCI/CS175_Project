Tobacco companies have sought to evade the new ban on deceptive "light" and "low-tar" labels by introducing lighter-colored packaging for light brands and switching to terms such as "gold" and "silver" to replace "light" and "ultra-light." Although the Obama administration and public health groups failed to persuade the justices to reconsider earlier rulings that limited the financial penalties and remedial measures the trial court ordered, the Supreme Court left intact the trial court's damning judgment: The tobacco industry has illegally profited from selling products that cause disease and death. Congress and the Obama administration should fund a national public education and stop-smoking campaign, and the Food and Drug Administration must effectively exercise its new authority to regulate tobacco products. Even as the FDA begins to exercise its new authority over tobacco products, the industry concocts new schemes to thwart the regulations. As smoking rates have declined and restrictions on smoking have multiplied, the industry has introduced new smokeless tobacco products and significantly increased marketing for them.
