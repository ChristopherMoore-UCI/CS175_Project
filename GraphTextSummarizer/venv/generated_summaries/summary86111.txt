The Independent Greeks, a conservative nationalist party led by former New Democracy lawmaker Panos Kammenos, saw its support shrink from 33 seats in May to 20, while Golden Dawn -- which hadn't won seats in parliament before -- held steady. Tsipras congratulated New Democracy late Sunday, but said his party's nearly 27% showing has forced Greek leaders to realize the bailout "is a nonviable economic plan." Samaras "has the opportunity to form a government on the basis of the people's verdict and on the basis of his own program," Tsipras said. European Union leaders hailed the vote, with eurozone finance ministers praising results "which should allow for the formation of a government that will carry the support of the electorate to bring Greece back on a path of sustainable growth." Syriza and New Democracy were effectively tied in the last official polls two weeks ago, in part because Syriza was seen as offering something new and different, Greek journalist Fanis Papathanasiou said Sunday. -- The leader of Greece's center-right, pro-bailout New Democracy party claimed "a victory for all Europe" after topping Sunday's parliamentary elections, a vote seen as a referendum on the survival of the continent's common currency.
