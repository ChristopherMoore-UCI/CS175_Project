Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal told reporters Tuesday that he is asking Facebook, Twitter and other online sites to regulate content before it is published. Indians expressed outrage Tuesday at a top telecommunication official's push to get social media sites to screen content considered defamatory to religious and political leaders. Sites like Facebook already have built-in mechanisms to flag and filter defined categories of objectionable content. The difference with what Sibal is proposing now, Pahwa said, is that service providers would have to censor content before it is even published. In a statement sent to CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN,  Facebook said: "We want Facebook to be a place where people can discuss things freely, while respecting the rights and feelings of others, which is why we already have policies and on-site features in place that enable people to report abusive content.
