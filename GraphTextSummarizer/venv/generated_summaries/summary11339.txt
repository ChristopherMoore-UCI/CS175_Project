Many of them are suspicious of the Europe-leaning views of those in western Ukraine, who were at the heart of the protests against Yanukovych that filled central Kiev for months. Some analysts say they fear parts of eastern Ukraine could push to break away from a pro-Western government in Kiev in favor of Russia. But it's notable that Yanukovych was recently in Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine. A lot of people with Russian heritage in eastern Ukraine feel that their cultural identity is under threat with the pro-European side in the ascendancy in Kiev. The Russian foreign ministry says it has recalled its ambassador from Ukraine to Moscow for consultations, citing "the aggravation of the situation." Everybody's waiting to see what Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key backer of Yanukovych, does next.
