A huge star at home, Cassel has enjoyed critical success abroad with roles in films like "Eastern Promises", David Cronenburg's 2007 tale about the Russian mafia in London, and is one of only a handful of French male stars to get parts in Hollywood. The two-part movie --released in the UK and the U.S. this month -- is the perfect showcase for Cassel's muscular brand of acting and pairs him up with the grand old master of French cinema, Gerard Depardieu, who plays the head of Mesrine's band of hoodlums in the film. Cassel has won plaudits for his virtuoso turn as a French gangster in the movie "Mesrine." " Cassel's first movie role was in "La Haine" (or "Hate" in English) the 1995 indie hit about a group of youths living on a Paris housing estate. "(Cassel) is viewed in France as a very good actor with charisma and intelligence," Agnes Poirier, a London-based French film critic told CNN.
