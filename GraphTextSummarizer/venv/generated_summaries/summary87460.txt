London's Metropolitan Police "report that since December, there have been four times as many anti-Semitic attacks as attacks on Muslims, even though there are seven or eight times the number of British Muslims as there are Jews," said British lawmaker Denis MacShane, who chaired the country's first parliamentary inquiry into anti-Semitism. Throughout my life, I have experienced anti-Semitic attacks. "We need to say to countries that promote anti-Semitism: 'Drop that hate of Jews.'" MacShane said lawmakers around the world needed to take a stand against anti-Semitism. It's a potent ideological force, causing fears to Jews in many different countries, and it has to be combated by all people that care about democracy," MacShane said.
