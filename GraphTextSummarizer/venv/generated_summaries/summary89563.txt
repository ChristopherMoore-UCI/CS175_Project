Staffers at Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten said the cartoons will be in a book created by cultural editor Flemming Rose and will be titled "The Tyranny of Silence." The cartoons were published in September 2006 and sparked worldwide protests after the reprinting of the caricatures in other publications. The book is scheduled to hit stores on September 30, staffers said. The cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed that sparked protests worldwide four years ago will be republished in a new book soon. Rose could not be reached for comment.
