-- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will return to work next week after a nasty bout with stomach flu and a concussion sidelined her for three weeks. Clinton has promised to testify her next month before the before the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs committees about the findings of a scathing independent report that found "grossly inadequate security" and "systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies" at the State Department. "She looks forward to getting back to the office next week and resuming her schedule." Clinton spent the holidays with her family after working from home for the past week. Last week Clinton's deputies Thomas Nides and Bill Burns testified in her place at open hearings on the deadly attacks after Clinton had to bow out under doctors' orders. Clinton said in letters to the heads of those committees that she accepted every one of its recommendations, including strengthening security, adding fire-safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high-threat areas.
