-- Protesters and activists demanding justice for slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin are no closer to closure, even with the news that second-degree murder charges were filed against shooter George Zimmerman. " On February 26, the 17-year-old Martin was shot dead by community watch officer Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. "I don't have too much faith in Florida justice, given the Casey Anthony debacle." The debate on CNN iReport mirrored a national outcry, which saw thousands taking to the streets in "Million Hoodie" marches, demanding that formal charges be filed against Zimmerman. Defenders of the law have said Zimmerman's actions were legal and justifiable on these grounds, while critics argue that such laws precipitated Martin's death.
