The second prediction was that our collective, visceral reaction to drones would force a national conversation about the adequacy of privacy law. Which is why I would rather see an end to bad privacy law than an end to drones. My first prediction was that drones would trouble the public more than other contemporary surveillance technologies, in part because of their association with war. We could see drones accompanying early morning joggers, taking sport, wildlife, and other photography to a new level, or mapping out hard-to-reach geographic terrain. Whether it's true or not -- the Federal Aviation Administration is investigating -- we are going to be hearing more and more about drones in American skies.
