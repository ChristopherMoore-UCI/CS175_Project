-- Don't print up the official stationary yet, but reality star and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian has designs on political office. "it's a great idea," Ara Najarian, a city councilmember and former Glendale mayor, told E! News. Kardashian shared her political aspirations in a bonus clip for her sister Khloe Kardashian Odom's E! show "Khloe & Lamar. " "I decided, I'm gonna run for the mayor of Glendale," Kim said as the sisters tooled around Dallas. "She's learning more about ways in which she can help to do her part to make a difference in the community." Mayor Kim sounds good to a couple of the more influential members of the Los Angeles suburb.
