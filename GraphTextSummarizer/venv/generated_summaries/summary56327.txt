" I suggest to Ridley that his act creates a dilemma for audiences: in normal circumstances it would be offensive for people to laugh at someone's disability but Lost Voice Guy invites his audience to laugh along with him at his own disability Lost Voice Guy thanks the audience for their warm welcome and adds: "I haven't felt this important since the doctors said I was going to be a special child." Under the stage name "Lost Voice Guy," Lee is fast becoming the talk of the town. On stage he uses an iPad with a text-to-voice app. I'd like to think the audience go away with a more positive view about disability."
