A remake of the original 1980 film, the new movie aims to breathe life into the former franchise about a psychopathic killer who preys on a group of young people at the fictitious Camp Crystal Lake. And there are times in the film here and there where I would do little tips of the hats or little homage for the guys who have played him before. That's kind of what's coming over me: "Oh you're, you're really nice," but ... on the other side of me there are other Dereks that are angry, and like I said before, have a little bit of issues. I've got a whole lot of daddy issues. Mears was cast as the iconic boogeyman Jason Voorhees in the new "Friday the 13th" movie.
