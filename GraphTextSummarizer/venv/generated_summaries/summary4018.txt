At one of the churches on Sunday, many survivors and family members of victims gathered for a two-hour Mass to remember the victims and honor divers and rescue workers. The night of the accident, many survivors sought shelter in churches and other buildings on the tiny Tuscan island of Giglio. Other crew members and Concordia executives also could face trial. "I came to pray for my colleagues and the passengers who lost their lives," said Santosh Velhal, a Costa Concordia crew member from Mumbai who worked in the ship's security department. The Concordia's captain, Francesco Schettino, could face charges that include manslaughter and abandoning ship.
