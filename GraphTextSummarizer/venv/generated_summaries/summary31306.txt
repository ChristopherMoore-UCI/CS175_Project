Beltran Leyva, who led a cartel by the same name, had been living a discreet, low-profile life in Mexico's Queretaro state, ditching fancy cars and other trappings of luxury to appear as a simple businessman, Zeron said. But in reality, Zeron said, Beltran Leyva was "one of the main leaders of drug trafficking in Mexico" and headed "a large network of corruption and money laundering." His arrest came after 11 months of investigation as intelligence officials traced his path, Tomas Zeron de Lucio, the director of criminal investigation for Mexico's Attorney General's Office, told reporters. Members of the Mexican Army didn't fire a single shot when they captured Hector Beltran Leyva in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, officials said. The State Department has said the cartel was responsible for transporting weapons and ammunition to Mexico from the United States, and trafficking in cocaine, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
