Judge blocks Pennsylvania voter ID law for November election "The Department of Justice is pleased that the court has denied "preclearance" of the South Carolina law for the 2012 elections," said Justice Department civil rights spokeswoman Dena Iverson. In "pre-clearing key sections of the South Carolina statute, the judges compared the law with those of other states, including Texas, where a federal court panel rejected a photo ID requirement for voting," wrote the opinion's author, D.C. Circuit Judge Brett Kavanaugh. And in Texas, unlike South Carolina, many counties lack a place for voters to obtain qualifying photo identification cards. The judges noted that about 95% of South Carolina registered voters possess the approved photo IDs. "With regard to future elections, the department welcomes the court's agreement that South Carolina's law required broad modifications in order to respond to the serious concerns raised by the attorney general that the law as written would exclude minority voters."
