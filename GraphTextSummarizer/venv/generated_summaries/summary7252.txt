"They shouldn't be used as a tool for suicide attacks." Afghan and foreign forces have arrested many would-be suicide bomber children. There were conflicting reports about how the plot was foiled, but the fact that a young girl was caught up in the middle of it was shocking enough for President Hamid Karzai to quickly condemn the alleged attackers. Last year, Afghan police intercepted 41 children whom insurgents were planning to use as suicide bombers. Spozhmai's brother and a friend forced her to attempt a suicide attack on the police station, spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. The girl's brother, Zahir, is known locally as Hameed Sahib and is a local Taliban commander, the country's Interior Ministry said.
