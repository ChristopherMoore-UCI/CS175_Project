Chalmers said he would expect the cost of ISIS airstrikes to be in the "ballpark," of the Libya operation, "assuming we only use air power and the campaign lasts for a couple of years. Chalmers pointed to the UK's seven month involvement in Libya through 2011, which cost around $390 million, including missiles and flight hours. The bill is additional to standard defense budgets, which include staffing costs and weapons spend. Flying the Tornadoes costs around $57,000 per hour, according to information released in a parliamentary debate about Libya in 2011. U.S. forces have been using Tomahawk missiles for airstrikes in Syria earlier this week -- dropping 47 of them on Monday evening.
