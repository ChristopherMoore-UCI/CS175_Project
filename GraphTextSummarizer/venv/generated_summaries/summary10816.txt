Odom, who is married to reality TV star Khloe Kardashian, was not in court for the arraignment at the Van Nuys branch of Los Angeles County Superior Court. Khloe Kardashian, who married Odom in 2009 after a 30-day courtship, tweeted about her frustrations when rumors surfaced days before his arrest that her husband was addicted to pain medications. Odom is a free agent who has played in the NBA for 14 years, for the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks and, most recently, the Los Angeles Clippers. The basketball star was arrested in the early morning hours of August 30 by a California Highway Patrol officer who reported seeing Odom, 33, driving his white Mercedes SUV in a "serpentine manner at 50 mph." In 2001, Odom admitted to having violated NBA drug policies twice.
