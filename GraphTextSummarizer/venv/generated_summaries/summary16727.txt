Rebel spokesman Ibrahim Beit-elmal said Gadhafi forces failed Wednesday in their attempt to enter the city on the three front lines. He said the rebels had gotten most of their weapons by taking them from Gadhafi forces "as spoils of war. In Zlitan, fighters attacked Gadhafi forces Thursday, taking four of their vehicles, but they failed to establish complete control, he said. The Transitional National Council, based in the de facto rebel capital of Benghazi in eastern Libya, has been seeking international support, including money, in its battle to oust Gadhafi. A spokesman for a Libyan opposition group told CNN that Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, was the primary negotiator for an exit plan for his father, but suggested the timing of the talks might not be good.
