In addition, suspected U.S. drone strikes over the weekend pounded a mountain camp where al Qaeda fighters were training for attacks "against Yemeni and foreign interests," Yemen's Supreme Security Committee said. A "massive and unprecedented" assault against al Qaeda fighters in Yemen appears to be targeting high-level operatives of the terrorist network, U.S. analysts said Monday. Did the United States miss top al Qaeda meeting in Yemen? One of the sites targeted is in the same area where scores of al Qaeda followers had gathered recently to hear from Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the head of the terrorist network's Yemeni branch and the global organization's "crown prince," the official said. Previous U.S. strikes have killed radical Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and Fahd al Quso, an al Qaeda operative wanted in the bombing of the destroyer USS Cole in 2000.
