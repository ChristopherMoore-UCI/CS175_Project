While she wants to avoid coming across, as she puts it, as a "Cinderella story," Belarus was hardly a hotbed of tennis talent when Azarenka was growing up, and her future was never mapped out. "She never really talked to me about tennis or anything specific, she just was explaining to me about when she was growing up," Azarenka told CNN's Open Court.

Hurting from a slow start to her 2011 season, Azarenka wondered if professional tennis was really the career for her. When she started working in a local tennis center, Azarenka's mother Alla needed a distraction for the young "Vika" so she could get on with her job.
