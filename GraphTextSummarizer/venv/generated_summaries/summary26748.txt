The clock is ticking on an interim nuclear deal with Iran, as well as efforts in Congress to pass new sanctions for greater leverage in global negotiations on a comprehensive accord. The question is whether the steps Iran is taking under the interim deal will blunt or bolster the congressional push for more sanctions. Meanwhile, pro-Israel members of Congress are seeking additional sanctions against Iran that would take effect if the talks break down. "Given these stakes, it's regrettable that the President does not want to work with Congress to bolster his negotiating hand with additional sanctions, which would go into effect should Iran fail to meet its commitments. Sunday's announcement that a six-month interim agreement formally begins on January 20 means that Iran must dismantle or freeze some of its nuclear program and open it to more international inspections in return for limited relief from crippling international sanctions.
