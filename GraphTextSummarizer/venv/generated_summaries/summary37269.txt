" "President Putin has repeatedly attempted to shift blame of the conflict in Ukraine and the internal problems that Russia is experiencing away from his own policies," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The tanking Russian economy seems to be doing little to encourage President Vladimir Putin to repair relations with the West. With Russia's economy on the verge of collapse, Putin could have used his annual marathon news conference on Thursday to show flexibility over Ukraine and to raise the prospect of relief from Western sanctions. "This insistence that Russia is headed in a disastrous direction, that Putin needs to recognize that and reverse course implies an expectation that at some point, Putin will realize that and give in to the West's pressure over Ukraine" said Matthew Rojansky of the Wilson Center. U.S. officials and western Russian experts are also anxious about Putin's state of mind.
