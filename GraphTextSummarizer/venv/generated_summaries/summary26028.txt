-- An investigation into the deaths of two people who spent up to two hours inside a "sweat lodge" at an Arizona retreat last week has been elevated from an accidental death investigation to a homicide inquiry, Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh told reporters Thursday. One person remained hospitalized Thursday in critical condition, Waugh said. Authorities were attempting to determine whether documents exist on how to construct sweat lodges and on their proper use, as well as documents showing whether participants were advised of the risks of sweat lodges either before or during the program. The use of sweat lodges for spiritual and physical cleansing is a part of several Native American tribes' cultures. The owners of the resort built the sweat lodge, Waugh said, under Ray's direction.
