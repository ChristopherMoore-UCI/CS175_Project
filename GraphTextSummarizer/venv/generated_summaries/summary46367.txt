McLaren's 2008 world champion Lewis Hamilton did well to finish second after damaging his car on the first corner while Lotus Renault's Russian driver Vitaly Petrov achieved his first podium finish. Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel started his 2011 Formula One defense in emphatic style on Sunday, leading the season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne from start to finish. Red Bull team boss Christian Horner said after the race his team did not use its KERS power-boost system because of technical issues, underlining the scale of Vettel's victory. "The start was crucial, I was on the clean side, but didn't know if it was enough until we got through the first corner. Fernando Alonso finished fourth for Ferrari, with Mark Webber in his Red Bull in fifth place.
