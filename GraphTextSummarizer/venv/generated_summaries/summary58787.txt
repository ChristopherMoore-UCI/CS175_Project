-- Slovakian Peter Sagan made up for a series of near misses to claim his first stage win on this year's Tour de France in Albi Friday. They pushed on after the second of the day's climb which left other star sprinters such as Mark Cavendish of Britain and Germany's Andre Greipel, winner of stage six, trailing. "This was a show of how strong we are as a team," he told the official Tour de France website. Impey is expected to cede the jersey as race favorites such as Chris Froome and Alberto Contador make their bid for overall domination in the mountains. Sagan, who has already taken a stranglehold on the green points jersey he won for the first time in last year's Tour, has been denied victory on four previous stages, but made no mistake this time after superb work from his Cannondale team.
