Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. was sentenced to serve three months in jail and fined $2,500 Wednesday in connection with a domestic violence incident, according to court officials and CNN affiliate reports. Mayweather was sentenced to six months in jail on the misdemeanor charges, but 90 days will be suspended if he serves 90 days, said Mary Ann Price, spokeswoman for Clark County, Nevada, courts. Felony charges of coercion, robbery and grand larceny were dismissed as part of a plea agreement, CNN affiliate KNSV reported. He was arrested in September 2010, police said, after he punched the mother of his children at his home, according to CNN affiliate KVVU. He must report to jail January 6, Price said.
