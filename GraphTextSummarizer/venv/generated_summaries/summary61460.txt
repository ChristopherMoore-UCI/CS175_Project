The clipper race was a life-changing adventure for both Blair and Brbora. "You might be sitting up on deck and hear this whistling sound and it's a pod of dolphins or whales or giant sea turtles," Brbora said. For Brbora, the biggest challenge came just two months before the end of the race when his vessel was almost destroyed in a storm 900 kilometer off the coast of San Francisco. Brbora was flung against metal railing in the accident, suffering a strained hip, while fellow crew member Jane Hitchens, 50, also from Britain, broke her ribs. They included a NASA scientist, ballet teacher, TV weather girl, farmer, undertaker and London cabbie driver.
