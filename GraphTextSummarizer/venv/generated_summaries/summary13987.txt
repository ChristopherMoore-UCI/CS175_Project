-- The Obama administration sent mixed signals Wednesday on its stance on a no-fly zone in Libya, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying U.N. backing was essential while White House spokesman Jay Carney left the door open to the United States acting unilaterally or in concert with NATO allies. Carney and other administration officials contend the United States already has moved quickly in the crisis by freezing $30 billion in U.S. assets of Gadhafi, supporting further U.N. sanctions on Libya and sending military aircraft to help transport foreign nationals who fled the fighting there. Some critics, as well as top Democrats such as Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, have called for a stronger U.S. response to the Libya violence, including the possible imposition of a no-fly zone that would prevent Libyan military aircraft from attacking the Libyan people. A few hours later, Carney told reporters at the White House that U.N. backing was just one possible form of the international support sought for any military intervention in Libya. " In a letter dated March 5 to the U.N. General Assembly, Libya's Interim Transitional National Council -- the opposition movement seeking to oust Gadhafi -- asked for the international community to "fulfill its obligations to protect the Libyan people from any further genocide and crimes against humanity without any direct military intervention on Libyan soil."
