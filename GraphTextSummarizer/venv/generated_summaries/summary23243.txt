In honor of Juneteenth, the museum helped CNN.com choose six destinations that will enlighten and educate visitors about a complicated period of American history, the road to emancipation. In the region: Ossabaw Island, the first Georgia State Heritage Preserve, has a strong African-American history connection, particularly in the three cabins dating between 1820 and 1840 â€” built from shells, sand, lime and water to house enslaved people. The heart of Gullah culture, this island near Beaufort, South Carolina, is home to the Penn Center, a school, job training facility and a safe haven for freed people as early as 1862 after the Sea Islands were occupied and liberated by Union troops. Westward migration of freed people from the South eventually led to towns such as Allensworth, chartered in 1908 in rural Tulare County. Philadelphia, a birthplace of American independence, was also a city of slave-holders.
