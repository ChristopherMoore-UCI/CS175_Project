TEPCO looks for outside help to stabilize Fukushima Huge volumes of toxic water The plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco), has been struggling to deal with the high volume of contaminated water at the plant. As news emerged last week of the leak of hundreds of tons of radioactive water from a storage tank, the NRA said it was planning to issue the alert, its gravest warning since the massive 2011 earthquake and tsunami that sent three reactors at the plant into meltdown. The decision to issue the level 3 alert came two days after a Japanese government minister had compared the plant operator's efforts to deal with worrying toxic water leaks at the site to a game of "whack-a-mole." Toshimitsu Motegi, the industry minister, said Monday after visiting the plant that "from now on, the government is going to step forward." There are now about 1,000 of the containers, 93% of which are already full of radioactive water. About 400 tons of groundwater flow into the site each day, and Tepco also pumps large amounts water through the buildings to keep the crippled reactors cool.
