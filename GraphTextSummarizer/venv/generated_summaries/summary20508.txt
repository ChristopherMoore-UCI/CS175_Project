In announcing Willis' arrest on Monday, Chicago police superintendent Garry McCarthy said the suspect is a gang member with 38 prior arrests. The superintendent said this was not a case of gang violence even though the suspect and the victim's father have ties to gangs. According to court documents, Willis saw Jonathan Watkins, Jonylah's father. Suspecting that Watkins had stolen a Sony PlayStation system and drugs from the home of his mother, Willis went to get a gun, the documents say. Willis drove a van to the alley where Watkins was parked and changing Jonylah's diaper; he walked up behind the van and fired four shots, the documents say.
