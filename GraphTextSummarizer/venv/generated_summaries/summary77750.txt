-- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has promised that the Italian Formula One team will not make major changes for 2011 despite this year's title disappointment, and he tipped Felipe Massa to return to form. However, Montezemolo backed Ferrari to bounce back next year with both drivers at the helm. Massa impressed with new Pirelli tires "I remember that at the start of 2006, many people said I would only last a year at Ferrari and then I won races that season and went on to stay for a long time more. Massa played very much a secondary role on his return to driving following his horror accident in July last year, and had to watch as new teammate Fernando Alonso was denied his third drivers' crown on the last day of the season. I'm thinking here of the fact that at the end of last year, our energy recovery system was very competitive.
