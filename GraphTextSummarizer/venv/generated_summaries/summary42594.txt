"If you've had a good meal with protein, vegetables, and a healthy fat, your dessert has a better chance of being emotionally satisfying," says Julia Ross, director of the Recovery System Clinic in Mill Valley, California, and author of "The Diet Cure." Surprisingly, emotional eating doesn't have to be a problem, says Michelle May, M.D., author of "Eat What You Love, Love What You Eat. "There's no harm in meeting any need with food -- unless it becomes chronic or extreme," Ross says. "Nobody should feel guilty if they use food to celebrate or feel comfort," Ross says. That's why it's counterproductive to say to people, 'Just don't do it.'" The treats we crave most are packed with powerful natural chemicals that bring on pleasure.
