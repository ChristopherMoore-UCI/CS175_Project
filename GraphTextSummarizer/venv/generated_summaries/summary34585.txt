Once the land was sold and Blob's Park shut down, Eggrel found himself gazing out his front yard at the facade of a dance hall and all the open space surrounding it. The developers agreed to rent 40 acres of the land back to Eggrel, a small portion compared to the land he grew up on, but it gave Eggrel the right to reopen the doors to Blob's Park. As for the economy and Blob's Park, Eggrel has this to say: "I hope it takes a long time to rebound. Blob was the great-uncle of Max Eggrel, who grew up on the land in Jessup, Maryland. "My brother ran the park until New Year's Eve (of 2007), and the rest of my family members decided, with the pressure from developers, to sell the land," Eggrel says.
