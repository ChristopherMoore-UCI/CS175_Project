Two robbers entered the landmark Cartier jewelry store located near the Champs Elysees in Paris on Tuesday evening, according to police spokesman Luc Poignant speaking to CNN affiliate BFMTV. -- A jewelry heist on one the world's most prestigious jewelry stores has been foiled, and both would-be thieves are in police custody after an attempted escape amidst a flurry of security forces, according to police, eyewitnesses and French media. While exiting the jewelry store, the thieves fired on police forces, says Poignant, who returned fire on the pair of robbers. A police chase ensued after the pair of robbers jumped on a scooter and left the scene, followed by police. The suspects surrendered late Tuesday, walking out of the salon with their hands in the air, according to an eye-witness speaking to BFM TV.
