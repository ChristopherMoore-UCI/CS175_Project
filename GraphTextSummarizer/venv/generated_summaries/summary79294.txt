Sam LaHood said while he felt "safe physically," he was concerned that the investigation into the work of American non-governmental organizations has "taken on a more serious nature, and the next step from here would either be arrest or go to trial." Egypt's investigation of and raids on U.S. democracy support groups working in that country could mean the end of U.S. aid to Egypt, members of Congress told top Obama administration officials, as well as the head of Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, last week. Members of Congress issue warning on U.S. aid to Egypt "We had been assured by leaders in the Egyptian government that this issue would be resolved, that harassment would end, that NGOs would be allowed to go back to business as usual and that their property would be returned," State Department spokesman Victoria Nuland said last month. Despite assurances the State Department says were given to the U.S. ambassador by Egyptian authorities, two of the NGOs said that as of early January, no property or cash had been returned. " Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson both spoke with high-ranking Egyptian officials following the raids to voice their concern.
