Up to 18 of Brazil's 26 states were left without power when electricity from the Itaipu dam was interrupted around 10:15 p.m. (7:15 p.m. ET) Tuesday, leaving Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other cities in darkened chaos. The states of Sao Paulo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo went totally dark, while Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, Goias, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana, Acre, Rondonia, Bahia, Sergipe, Paraiba, Alagoas, Pernambuco and Rio Grande do Norte were partially affected. "Those responsible for the energy supply do not perceive that the weather is changing and that there's a lot of hot weather in the spring," said Rio resident Pabla de Visconti. "I thought, 'How is this happening?' " said Rio de Janeiro resident Wesley Ferreira. Authorities in Rio de Janeiro and other cities stepped up enforcement.
