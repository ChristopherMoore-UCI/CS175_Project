The FBI is not involved because it does not have jurisdiction, as the ship was off the coast of Mexico flying under a foreign flag, said spokeswoman Laura Eimiller of the agency's Los Angeles office. The vessel, which left Los Angeles on Sunday, docked Wednesday in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, Donnan said. The unidentified worker on board the Disney Wonder failed to appear for a Tuesday shift, Disney spokeswoman Christi Erwin Donnan said. -- A Disney Cruise Line employee has been reported missing during a seven-day cruise off the Mexico's Pacific coast, the company said Thursday. The Mexican navy has been conducting searches since Tuesday, Disney Cruise Line said in a written statement.
