"This stuff that he's teaching is really good stuff, but he's hurting people and hiding behind this good stuff so people don't believe he's capable of hurting people," said Sarah Baughn, a former student who now accuses Choudhury of sexual assault. "And yet, after this lawyer sends out these kinds of blasts in social media asking people if they've been a victim of Bikram Choudhury, all of a sudden these people come forward and all have very similar claims." Carney Shegerian, Baughn's attorney, said that's simply not true. But when asked whether he'd had sex with other students, he responded, "yes and no." Civil lawsuits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court tell the story of a different Bikram Choudhury, describing him as someone who preyed on young women who looked to him for guidance. " Choudhury repeatedly denied sexually assaulting anyone, saying he would never resort to physical aggression to have sex because he has so many offers.
