-- Ten Mexican nationals have been charged with last year's killings of three Americans connected to the U.S. Consulate in Juarez, Mexico, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Wednesday. We will continue to use every tool at our disposal to hold accountable violent criminal organizations and gangs that have been terrorizing border communities," said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. Seven of the 10 defendants charged with the consulate killings are in custody in Mexico, U.S. authorities said. "The indictment unsealed today represents our continued action to ensure safety along our Southwest border, to seek justice for victims of violent crime in this region, and to weaken dangerous criminal organizations currently operating in Mexico and the United States," said Holder. "Twelve of these defendants were arrested just this morning by teams of United States federal, state and local authorities in Texas and in New Mexico," Holder announced at a Justice Department news conference.
