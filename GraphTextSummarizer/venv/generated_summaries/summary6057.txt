In her final remarks, Masipa dismissed evidence given by probation officer Annette Vergeer that prison would not be able to accommodate Pistorius' disability, saying her testimony was based on outdated information and sketchy. What will Oscar Pistorius face in prison? This is a human tragedy for the family of Reeva Steenkamp and also for Oscar Pistorius.

On the other hand, mitigating factors include that Pistorius is a first offender and remorseful, Masipa said.
