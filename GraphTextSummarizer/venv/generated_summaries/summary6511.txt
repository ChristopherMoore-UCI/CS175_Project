John Constable (1776-1837) was famous for his landscapes of the English countryside, particularly scenes of his native Suffolk. Christie's analyzed the painting in 2013 and declared that it was the work of a follower of John Constable -- not a creation of the famed English Romantic landscape artist himself. In 2012, the Constable painting "The Lock" became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold, fetching Â£22.4m ($34.8 million) at an auction at Christie's in London. But Sotheby's claimed it was an original Constable made in preparation for another work owned by the Tate gallery in London. Anne Lyles, former 18th and 19th century British art curator at the Tate, wrote in catalog for the Sotheby's auction that "the present work by Constable was heavily retouched with a dark and opaque pigments which probably dated to the late 19th or early 20th century, in a misguided attempt to 'finish' the painting.
