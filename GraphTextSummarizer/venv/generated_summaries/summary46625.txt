In Sunday's men's final, Roger Federer tries for an eighth Wimbledon title against top seed Novak Djokovic. Kvitova became the Queen of Wimbledon once again when the powerful, left-handed Czech crushed Bouchard 6-3 6-0 in a mere 55 minutes for a second crown at tennis' most prestigious tournament, claiming the $3 million first prize. Not known for her scampering, Kvitova for good measure won the point of the final when she retrieved like Rafael Nadal and struck a slice-backhand passing-shot winner to hold for 3-1 in the first set. No matter what happens in the months leading into Wimbledon, former world No. 2 Kvitova -- who will rise to fourth in the new rankings -- appears to instantly feel at home at the All England Club. But Bouchard's coronation will have to wait, since none of the above mattered to Petra Kvitova.
