Perhaps his greatest influence "was on the lives of generations of Notre Dame students, whom he taught, counseled and befriended," said Jenkins, the Notre Dame president, in his statement. "We mourn today a great man and faithful priest who transformed the University of Notre Dame and touched the lives of many," said the Rev. John I. Jenkins, Notre Dame's current president, in a statement. Father Theodore M. Hesburgh, who led the University of Notre Dame to national academic prominence and became an influential figure in both the spiritual and political worlds, has died. " Over the course of a career that spanned more than seven decades -- 35 of them as president of Notre Dame -- Hesburgh ended up at the highest levels of both church and state. He traveled so much he became the subject of a campus joke: God is everywhere, Hesburgh is everywhere but Notre Dame.
