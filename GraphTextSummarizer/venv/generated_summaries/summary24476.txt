Bari took the lead in just the seventh minute as former Juve youth player Riccardo Meggiorini blocked a clearance on the edge of the area and then his shot deflected into the net off Nicola Legrottaglie. French forward David Trezeguet equalized in the 23rd minute after Bari goalkeeper Jean-Francois Gillet could only block Diego's shot, but the hosts went ahead again just before halftime with a penalty from Paulo Barreto, who was tripped by Italy defender Fabio Cannavaro. Napoli are also in that bunch on 24 points -- 11 behind Inter -- after drawing 3-3 at Cagliari, who are one point further back in 11th place. Cirro Ferrara's third-placed team remained five points behind Serie A leaders Inter Milan, who travel to lowly Atalanta on Sunday. However, Lavezzi was sent off for kicking a ball at Cagliari coach Massimiliano Allegri as tempers flared during injury-time, then Bogliacino's header denied the home team a fifth successive win.
