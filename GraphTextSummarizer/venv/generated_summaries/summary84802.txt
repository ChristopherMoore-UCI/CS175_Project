It is particularly interesting to ponder Jefferson's legacies at this moment in American history. Many enslaved families lived at Monticello for generations; some spending far more actual time on the land than Jefferson or any member of his legal white family. For many Americans -- most importantly the numerous school children on field trips -- Monticello has been, and will be, their only firsthand experience of an American slave plantation. So Monticello, perhaps the most well-known slave plantation in the world, stands as one of Jefferson's most important and enduring legacies. Each year, thousands of people from all over the world make the trip up the 867-foot little mountain to visit a place that was home not only to Jefferson, but to hundreds of enslaved blacks who labored in his fields, plantation industries and house.
