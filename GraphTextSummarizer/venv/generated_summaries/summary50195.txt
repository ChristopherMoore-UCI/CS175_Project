-- BP officials have turned to a new source for help with their oil cleanup efforts: actor Kevin Costner. The machines use a centrifuge mechanism to separate oil from water and recycle the crude at the same time, Costner said. Each machine weighs about 4,000 pounds, he said, and will allow crews to collect more oil. The oil giant announced Monday that it had ordered 32 machines from Costner's company, the actor told CNN in an exclusive interview on "AC360." It's certainly a way to fight oil spills in the 21st century," he said.
