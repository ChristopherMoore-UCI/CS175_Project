Honolulu mayor Kirk Caldwell has signed into law two bills that ban smoking in public places across Oahu, including beaches, parks, tennis courts, softball fields and public pools. According to CNN affiliate KHON, the ban is part of a statewide effort to reduce cigarette-butt litter and address public health concerns about secondhand smoke. E-cigarettes aren't covered by the ban and can still be used on Oahu beaches. Unanimously approved by the Honolulu City Council, the new laws expand existing regulations banning smoking in public places. It's already against the law on Oahu to smoke within 20 feet of entrances to stores, restaurants, bars and other workplaces.
