In the years since independence Ghana has navigated tumultuous periods of army rule and political uncertainty. However the West African country is hailed as one of the continent's success stories -- the international community has often lauded Ghana as a beacon of peace and stability while U.S. president Barack Obama called it a "model for democracy" in Africa. Although a general election was successfully held in 1969, Ghana was soon to enter a new period of political uncertainty and economic stagnation that lasted for more than a decade. The country is often described as "Africa for beginners," combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. Gold and cocoa are both traditionally major sources of foreign currency for the country, while in 2007 economic expectations were raised higher following the discovery of major offshore oil reserves.
