"We are all concerned about what has happened to Hannah Graham, and if using aerial drones can find her or at least provide some leads to law enforcement, all the better," John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, said in a statement. Legal limits on unmanned aircraft use by state and local law enforcements were instituted by the Virginia state legislature in February 2013, earning the support of civil liberties proponents and marking an historic first across the nation. "There's been an overreaction on the part of state legislatures with respect to this technology," said Brendan Schulman, who represents drone operators as Special Counsel at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP. "Drones will spy on us without our permission in violation of our constitutional rights under the 4th Amendment," said David Swanson, an activist who brought the initial anti-drone resolution to the Charlottesville city council, in February. Schulman pointed out that state legislators' "knee-jerk reaction" highlighting privacy concerns is often overblown given state laws which prohibit invasions of privacy.
