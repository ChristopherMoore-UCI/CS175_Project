Child's play For reigning Miss Rodeo America, 23-year-old Chenae Shiner, the journey to rodeo royalty began as a youngster growing up on her parents' ranch in Roosevelt, Utah. "As Miss Rodeo America you're traveling 100,000 miles across the country performing at rodeos -- and many of those are full of horses you're not familiar with. Then it was on to Las Vegas' glittering MGM Grand Hotel for the Miss Rodeo America pageant, held as part of the annual National Finals Rodeo -- or as Shiner described it: "The Superbowl of Rodeo." As 1973 queen Pam Minick said: "Miss Rodeo America is the ultimate cowgirl -- wholesome, beautiful and tough as nails." No horsing around Miss Rodeo America must be many things -- pretty, personable and educated.
