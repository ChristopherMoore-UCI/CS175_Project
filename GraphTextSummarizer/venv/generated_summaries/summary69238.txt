And he got a few breaks -- including when the Cardinals' Carlos Beltran smacked a shot that appeared to hit the left-field chalk but was ruled foul, and when teammate Mike Baxter made a spectacular catch in left field in the seventh inning, slamming the wall so hard that he had to leave the game with an injured shoulder. The Mets' hometown crowd at Citi Field erupted after Santana rallied from a 3-0 count to strike out Cardinals third baseman David Freese to end the game, and later when he was asked about making Mets' history. -- New York Mets pitcher Johan Santana tossed the first no-hitter in the franchise's history Friday night in an 8-0 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. "I don't even think I threw a no-hitter in video games," he told reporters. The Mets have had their fair share of standout pitchers.
