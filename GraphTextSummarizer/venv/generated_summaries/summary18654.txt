-- A federal hearing began Monday to determine whether SeaWorld Orlando should be charged with a willful violation in the 2010 death of killer whale trainer Dawn Brancheau. In his opening remarks on Monday, OSHA attorney John Black said SeaWorld allowed their trainers to take a calculated risk by working with killer whales that have the potential to cause harm or death to those who get close. Since the accident, SeaWorld has restricted all trainers from entering the water with killer whales until further notice, though Tilikum has returned in a theme park show called "One Ocean." "SeaWorld recognized the inherent risk of allowing trainers to interact with potentially dangerous animals," Cindy Coe, OSHA's Atlanta regional administrator, said in a statement. In February 2010, as park guests watched in horror, Brancheau, 40, was pulled into a SeaWorld pool and drowned by a 12,000-pound killer whale named Tilikum.
