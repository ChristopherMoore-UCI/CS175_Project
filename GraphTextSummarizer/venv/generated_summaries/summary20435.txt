Watch how Baptiste helped end the slaughter of turtles in her community Â» Her efforts -- and those of many others around the region -- are making a difference. "Here, turtle slaughter is a thing of the past," Baptiste proclaimed. Still, turtle slaughter persists throughout the region, and Baptiste is working to help other groups learn from her success, most recently on the island of Dominica. For years, Baptiste and her group patrolled the beaches every night of turtle nesting season. "Twenty years ago, this was a graveyard," Suzan Lakhan Baptiste said of the six-mile stretch of beach near her home.
