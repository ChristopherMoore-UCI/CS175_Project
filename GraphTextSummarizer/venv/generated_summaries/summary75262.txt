Freelancer James Foley was taken in northwest Syria on November 22, Thanksgiving Day in America, his family said, adding it decided to make his capture public now in the hope that media attention will increase the odds he'll be released unharmed. Syrian war's death toll surpasses 60,000 Foley communicated with his sister online, via Skype, on Thanksgiving morning, his brother, Michael Foley, told CNN Wednesday. James Foley was working on several stories when he was abducted, including one "on the destruction of the ancient city of Aleppo," said his brother, Michael Foley. The global news agency AFP, which has been using Foley's work since March 2012, released a statement saying that Foley was taken in the northern town of Taftanaz and that no one has claimed responsibility. "After respecting his family's initial decision to remain silent about the abduction, AFP now fully supports its choice in making the news public and wholeheartedly calls for the journalist's release," said AFP CEO Emmanuel Hoog. The news outlet ran a story on its website Wednesday about Foley's abduction in Syria.
