Few consider Obama's speaking style un-presidential either, but Romney's speaking style, that of the airline pilot or the man in the GPS saying "Turn right," is even more of what we think of as how the commander in chief talks. Romney's stuck with the vanilla, while Obama even mixes in a bit of chocolate in mainstream speeches. Some think him "fake" when sounding preacherly in speeches to the NAACP, but they miss that Obama is doing just what most black Americans do 24/7, sliding between two ways of talking: vanilla and chocolate. Romney and Obama come from different linguistic cultures, and unfortunately for Romney, his is increasingly obsolete. The language gulf between Obama and Romney is even on view on their websites.
