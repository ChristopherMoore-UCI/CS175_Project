The Colby Fire near Glendora destroyed two homes and injured one person Thursday morning, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said. The three men, all in their early 20s, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting a fire, said Police Chief Tim Staab of Glendora. -- A homeless man and two other men were tossing paper into a campfire when a gust of wind apparently spread embers that have since led to a 1,700-acre wildfire burning in the Los Angeles County foothills, authorities said Thursday. Added Deputy Chief John Tripp: "If we don't get the rains that gets us out of fire season that gets the vegetation to be less receptive to fire, we have to keep our diligence up." One man is from Glendora and another is from Irwindale, he said.
