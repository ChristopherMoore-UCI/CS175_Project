-- The town of Dublin, Georgia, is putting saggy, baggy pants in the category of indecent exposure, with violators facing fines of up to $200. Riviera Beach, Florida, and Flint, Michigan, passed bans against sagging pants in recent years, but the Riviera Beach legislation later was declared unconstitutional after a court challenge. The result was that council members decided to put exposure due to baggy clothing in the same category as masturbation, fornication and urination in public places. The amendment, which Best plans to put into immediate effect at the City Council meeting, prohibits the wearing of pants or skirts "more than three inches below the top of the hips exposing the skin or undergarments. (Sample lyrics: "Pants on the ground, pants on the ground/looking like a fool with your pants on the ground.")
