Israeli Justice Minister Tzipi Livni says "it is clear for us here in Israel" that chemical weapons have been used in Syria, and an international response to the crisis should be "on the table in the discussions between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Obama" during the president's trip to Israel. In February, Israel attacked a convoy of anti-aircraft weapons in Syria. There are reports that chemical weapons were used in two locations Tuesday in Syria, killing at least 25 people. That assault did not involve chemical weapons, but clearly their use would increase the stakes for Israel. " Israelis have long been concerned that Hezbollah, Israel's foe in neighboring Lebanon, could gain possession of Syrian chemical weapons if the Assad regime is further destabilized.
