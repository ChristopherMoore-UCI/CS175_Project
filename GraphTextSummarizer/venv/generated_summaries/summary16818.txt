-- Election Day demolished the notion that New York state, which tends to vote Democratic in presidential elections, is a bastion of the brand of progressive politics embodied by Andrew Cuomo's sometime-rival, the high-profile mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio. In an article titled "The Zeitgeist Tracked Down Bill de Blasio," one of the mayor's labor allies claimed that New York City progressive politics were in tune with the spirit of the age (the zeitgeist), and that "shifting demographics and the social liberalism of young people portend a long period of Democratic dominance in national politics." But at the same time, New York Republicans flexed political muscles -- and Democrats engaged in destructive infighting -- in a way that suggests the Empire State, which might seem solid Democratic blue on the outside, has deep streaks of Republican red on the inside. Instead, he squandered millions on a fake party, and left millions more in his campaign account as New York Democrats in the legislature and in Congress withered on the vine," said Bill Lipton, the executive director of Working Families, in a blistering statement hours after election results became clear. That will make it hard, if not impossible, for de Blasio to win an increase in the minimum wage, college scholarships for undocumented immigrants, legal limits on rent increases, equal-pay legislation and other state-controlled policies loudly championed by the New York City mayor and his allies among labor leaders and community activists.
