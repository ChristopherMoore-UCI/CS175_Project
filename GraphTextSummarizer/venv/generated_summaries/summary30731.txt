The film of Neda's death is the abbreviated history of contemporary Iran. With Neda's death, the Iran I know finally has a face. This Friday evening throughout Iran, people will be lighting candles in memory of Neda and others who have died in the past few days. Editor's note: Roya Hakakian is the author of "Journey from the Land of No: A Girlhood Caught in Revolutionary Iran." As if her death were not tragic enough, the authorities have banned all mosques throughout Tehran from holding prayer services for Neda.
