"I  fly in to Oakland County 2 resolve issues and u guys got jokes?" Apparently stung by the reporting, McCrary released a string of tweets defending himself, including one where he appears to compare himself to a late civil rights leader. IMDb lists 51 acting credits, including stints on "Anger Management" with Charlie Sheen and a two-year run on "The Young and the Restless" as Malcolm Winters. McCrary has stayed busy since his days on "Family Matters" in the 1980s and 1990s, according Internet Movie Database. He wasn't behind bars long, McCrary was released before the day was over, according to Carrie Rudzki with the jail in Oakland County, Michigan. Actor Darius McCrary was jailed on Wednesday for failure to pay child support.
