Vernace was charged in 1998 in Queens County Supreme Court with the deaths of Godkin and D'Agnese, but was acquitted of state charges after trial in 2002, according to prosecutors. Criminal acts from 1978 through 2011 included drug trafficking, illegal gambling and the 1981 double homicide of Richard Godkin and business partner John D'Agnese, according to prosecutors. "It took too long, but we will take it," Godkin's widow, Catherine Godkin, said outside court. D'Agnese was shot in the head and Godkin was shot in the chest when he tried to intervene, according to court documents. That eyewitness testified that he saw Vernace point a gun at Godkin's head and saw one of Vernace's accomplices threatening D'Agnese with a gun, according to a 2013 statement by the U.S. Attorney's Office.
