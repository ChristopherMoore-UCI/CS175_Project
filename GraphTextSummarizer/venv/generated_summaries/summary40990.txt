According to the Institute for Justice, a public interest law firm that investigates civil forfeiture practices, these seizures carried out by the IRS had increased from 114 in 2005 to 639 in 2012. In addition to the IRS, the Department of Justice and U.S. attorney's offices across the country have civil asset forfeiture authority. The FAIR Act will ensure that federal government agencies, like the IRS and Department of Justice, no longer profit from taking the property of U.S. citizens without due process, while maintaining the ability of courts to order the surrender of proceeds of crime. Moreover, the FAIR Act eliminates incentives for civil forfeiture by rerouting funds seized by the IRS to the general treasury rather than the unaccountable Asset Forfeiture Fund, which has little congressional oversight and has grown since its inception in 1986 to more than $2 billion in 2013. Recent announcements by the Justice and Treasury departments that they will end most forms of equitable sharing -- the practice of federal law enforcement coordinating with local and state law enforcement for the purpose of pursuing civil asset forfeiture cases -- are a start, but this only affects a fraction of overall seizures.
