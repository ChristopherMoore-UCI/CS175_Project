-- Authorities in Egypt have frozen the assets of former President Hosni Mubarak and his family, state-run media reported Monday. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister David Cameron arrived Monday in Cairo, his office said, for meetings with Egypt's military leadership, to which Mubarak ceded power. Two former Egyptian ministers were transferred to criminal court on Monday, according to state news agency MENA. On Sunday, Mubarak's attorney said that false information had been published by media outlets both in Egypt and elsewhere regarding the former president's wealth, calling it "baseless rumors ... an attempt to cause damage to his reputation and his integrity," according to EgyNews. And on Saturday, Egyptian Prime Minister Ahmed Shafiq responded to a question on the matter during a meeting with newspaper editors and media representatives by saying he only knew what he "read about Mubarak's wealth in the newspapers and in the media, just like everyone else," EgyNews reported.
