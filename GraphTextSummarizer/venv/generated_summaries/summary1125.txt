Wright, Baxter and a man referred to as C.S. allegedly agreed to pay $900 for the devices, as well as separate riot gear, according to a criminal complaint filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court. "Occupy Cleveland," a local branch of the loosely organized protest that began last year in New York's Zuccotti Park, tweeted on Tuesday that it was "shocked by these allegations." "We continue to be committed to creating social change through non-violence," the group said. "The FBI and the Department of Justice are not and do not investigate movements," Dettelbach told reporters Tuesday. The men, whose attorneys could not be immediately reached for comment, were slated to appear before a federal magistrate in U.S. District court later Tuesday. " "The defendants stand charged based not upon any words or beliefs they might espouse, but based upon their own plans and actions," U.S. Attorney Steven Dettelbach said in a statement.
