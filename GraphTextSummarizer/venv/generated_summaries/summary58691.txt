To mark the 20th anniversary of Tilganga, Amendolia has released some of his most striking images of Ruit and his team at work in Nepal and other countries in the region, including Bhutan, China, Myanmar, North Korea and Indonesia. Infiltrating North Korea Amendolia, who described Ruit as "a maverick in some ways," accompanied the Nepalese surgeon on one of the first trips to North Korea in 2006. In the past 30 years, Ruit has personally restored the sight of more than 100,000 people across Asia and Africa, and taught his rapid-fire technique to countless other eye surgeons in parts of the world as isolated as North Korea. Australian photographer Michael Amendolia has been capturing these intimate scenes -- the expressions of relief and tears of joy -- while traveling with Ruit and his colleagues since the early 1990s. " Amendolia describes how the North Korean surgeons, who came from across the country, were so eager to learn that they huddled close to Ruit, leaning over the operating table to get a better look as he worked.
