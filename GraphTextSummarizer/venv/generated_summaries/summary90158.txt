-- Singer Elton John paid tribute to his friend and fellow AIDS-activist, Elizabeth Taylor, at a concert in Pittsburgh Wednesday night. This is for you and your beautiful memory and for all the people you helped and saved." Taylor and John have been active for years in raising awareness about AIDS and HIV, as well as raising money for research and care for sufferers. John accepted an award on her behalf from the group she helped create, the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amfAR), at the group's 25th annual black-tie benefit in February. "Today I lost a friend and you lost a hero named Elizabeth Taylor," the singer told a cheering crowd at the Consol Energy Center. Taylor passed away early Wednesday at the age of 79.
