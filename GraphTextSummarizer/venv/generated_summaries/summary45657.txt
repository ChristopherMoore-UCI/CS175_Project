Parallel to Operation Linda Nchi, Kenya has gone after ethnic Somalis within their own borders triggering protest by Human Rights Watch, which has accused the government of ethnic profiling and mistreatment. Al-Shabaab said the attack was retaliation for Kenya participation in Africa Union military operations in Somalia. A day after the attack, Kenyan security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into Somalia. And in October 2011, Kenya Defense Forces invaded Somalia, where Al-Shabaab is based, with the crushing Operation Linda Nchi, Swahili for "Protect the Country." Last May, tour companies evacuated vacationers from Kenya after the UK and United States issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks.
