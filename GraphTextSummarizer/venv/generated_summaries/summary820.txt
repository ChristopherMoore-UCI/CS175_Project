The Houston family decried the family's lack of involvement in the project, and the singer's sister-in-law, Pat Houston, posted on Facebook, "I say this to all Whitney's family, friends and fan base: If you watch this movie, watch it knowing that Lifetime is notorious for making bad biopics of deceased celebrities and brace yourself for the worst. In July, Brown reportedly went on a Twitter rant, expressing unhappiness with the Lifetime biopic "Whitney," directed by actress Angela Bassett. From her desire to launch a career in music and acting to her grief over the loss of her mother, singer Whitney Houston, the 21-year-old shares much with her followers. " Brown tweeted an apology after insulting Bassett. From before her mother's death: After Houston's death, she and Nick Gordon got matching tattoos with Houston's initials.
