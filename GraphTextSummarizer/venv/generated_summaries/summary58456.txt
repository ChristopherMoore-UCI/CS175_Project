The current agreement gives the United States full jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed by the military on Afghan soil. "If US military forces conduct military operations on Afghan homes even one more time, then there will be no BSA and we won't sign it," Karzai said Sunday. Thousands of tribal elders made their way to the capital to join the loya jirga, a grand assembly, to confer on the key issue of whether or not to support the presence in their country of a limited number of U.S. troops beyond next year. The assembly's decision is not binding, but Karzai has said he will follow their recommendation under one condition -- that U.S. forces do not conduct house raids. Members attending the 4-day-long loya jirga urged President Hamid Karzai to sign it before the end of the year.
