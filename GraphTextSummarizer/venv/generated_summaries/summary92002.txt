On "CNN Newsroom" throughout the week, we will also drill down, so to speak, on aspects of the problem that you rarely see explained on television: How oil refineries work, how the availability of "surplus gas" from independent oil companies can play havoc with pump prices, and what effect the squeeze on oil will have on the market for alternative energy. CNNMoney: Will oil prices kill the stock market rally? And on her prime-time "OutFront" show, Erin Burnett will step back and look at the global market for oil, examining where all the demand is coming from and how a global thirst for oil as far away as China for can affect the price you pay at your station around the corner. In fact, probably no fact of our daily economic life is as universally felt and poorly understood as gas prices. On CNN.com and CNNMoney.com, you'll be able to compare gas prices on a state-by-state map.
