-- If you've traveled to Asia at all, the center of all things techy and kitschy, you've no doubt witnessed some of the odd stuff sold in vending machines there. Block out the noise with a pair of Beats by Dr. Dre headphones available from one of the Best Buy Express vending machines at San Antonio International in Texas, one of the more than 50 airports across the country to feature the retail giant's automated selection of digital cameras, portable media players, gaming consoles, phone chargers, and other gadgets that help make travel -- and life -- a little easier. (Japan, in fact, has the highest concentration of vending machines in the world, with one per every 23 people.) But unusually stocked vending machines are showing up more and more frequently in the United States these days, particularly in airports and other areas heavily trafficked by travelers. The Art-o-mats, which are all reconfigured from vintage cigarette machines, are somewhat of a work of art in themselves.
