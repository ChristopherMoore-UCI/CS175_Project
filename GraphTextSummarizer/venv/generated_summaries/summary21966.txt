The 44-year-old actress and ex-cover girl is fronting the Downforce1 team, which will compete in the 2012 European Le Mans and International GT Open series. Anderson, more famous for sporting a red bathing suit as C.J. Parker in the hit '90s TV show than racing overalls, launched the venture earlier this month with the aim of competing in the 2013 open-wheel NASCAR series in the U.S. "Fast cars and fast women go together," the former Playmate of the Month said on the team's website. The team's sole driver Markus Fux, who also doubles up as Downforce1's marketing coordinator, announced they will miss this weekend's International GT race in France. The Canadian is described as a fan of motorsport divisions "from NASCAR to Formula One" and hailed the venture as "a dream come true. "Due to technical issues and circumstances beyond the control of the team, the management of Downforce1 have reluctantly decided, in the interest of the team and its sponsors, not to attend the first race at Paul Ricard," read the statement.
