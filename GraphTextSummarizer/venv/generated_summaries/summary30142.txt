(E Ink is a proprietary type of electronic paper that's found in most e-readers.) -- From the responses to our story Thursday on how tablets are paving a rough road for the future of dedicated e-readers, one thing was clear: We still love our E Ink. The real problem with e-readers is that they last (nearly) forever, that people don't need to replace or upgrade every few years or so. I really do fear that tablets will kill off both paper and e-ink and will diminish the pleasantness of the reading experience. For reading a book, e-ink is best, for web browsing and video, a bigger tablet is much better.
