-- HLN's Nancy Grace announced on her program Monday night that she had surgery to remove a solid mass that doctors had feared could be cancer. Speaking by phone to substitute host Jean Casarez of In Session, Grace said she is recovering at home with her husband, David, and their 3-year-old twins, John David and Lucy Elizabeth. Saying she was "the lucky one,'' Grace urged women to make appointments for routine exams even if they feel fine. Grace said she hopes to return to work next Monday. When the doctor said it could be cancer, Grace described it as "that moment you see in movies and you hear about that always happens to somebody else but not to you."
