U.S. officials were reluctant to hand over Daqduq to the Iraqi judiciary over fears that under pressure from Iran, Iraqi authorities would release him. In a written statement, al-Maliki said he could not agree to turn over Daqduq to the United States because the "Iraqi judiciary did not agree" the request was in accordance with Iraq's laws. In the statement released Saturday, the prime minister said the Iraqi court ordered Daqduq's release after it determined there was a lack of evidence. With the release of Daqduq, at least one U.S. lawmaker has called for U.S. relations with Iraq to be re-evaluated. The United States appealed the ruling and provided additional evidence against Daqduq, which the Iraqi court also ruled was insufficient, al-Maliki said.
