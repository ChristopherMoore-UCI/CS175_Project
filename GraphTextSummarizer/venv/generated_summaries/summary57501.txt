There are several possible explanations, all of which point to a fundamental problem with intelligence information and our national intelligence apparatuses. Even when we know something, protecting the methods of collection can be more valuable than the possibility of taking action based on gathered information. More data does not necessarily mean better information. But while the Allies knew a lot, they would only act on information they learned when there was another plausible way they could have learned it. The agency measures its success by amount of data collected, not by information synthesized or knowledge gained.
