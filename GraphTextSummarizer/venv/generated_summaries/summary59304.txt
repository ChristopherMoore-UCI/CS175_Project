A New York medical examiner's office said Saturday that a body discovered this week along a remote stretch of Long Island beach was that of Shannan Gilbert, the missing New Jersey woman whose disappearance led investigators to 10 sets of human remains and the hunt for a possible serial killer. Moments later during the same hearing, Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota took the stand and rejected Dormer's statement. The reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $5,000 -- was raised five-fold, making it the largest offered in Suffolk County history in an apparent bid to fill out a case that some fear has gone cold. Additional remains were later uncovered in neighboring Gilgo Beach and in Nassau County, about 40 miles east of New York City. "Our condolences to the Gilbert family and her friends," said Police Commissioner Richard Dormer.
