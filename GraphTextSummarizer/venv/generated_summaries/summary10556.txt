"(Defense) Secretary (Chuck) Hagel welcomes the news of (Italian) President (Giorgio) Napolitano's decision to grant clemency to U.S. Air Force Col. Joseph Romano, and appreciates the Italian government's careful consideration of this matter," Pentagon spokesman George Little said in a statement Saturday. Washington has acknowledged making secret "rendition" transfers of terrorism suspects between countries but denies using torture or handing suspects over to countries that do. They say the United States has often transferred terrorism suspects to countries that practice torture. Napolitano pardoned Romano to "find a solution to an affair considered by the United States to be unprecedented" and to solve "a situation of great delicacy," Italian news agency ANSA reported, citing the president's office. Prosecutors said he was nabbed by a CIA team working with Italian intelligence officials.
