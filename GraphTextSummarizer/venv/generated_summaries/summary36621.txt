-- Carlos Tevez is wanted by clubs in Spain and Italy as well as England's Premier League should Manchester United choose to show him the door when his loan deal expires at the end of the month. On Sunday Tevez ran in the direction of Ferguson and United chief executive David Gill and cupped his hands to his ears after scoring in the 2-0 win over Manchester City that left the club on the brink of another Premier League title. Argentine international striker Tevez is clearly frustrated at United manager Alex Ferguson's failure to open talks regarding a permanent transfer to the defending Champions League finalists. Argentine striker Tevez is still hoping Manchester United will offer him a new deal at the end of the month. I don't know why, but Manchester (United) have not asked for any renewal (of the loan) nor signing him for next season."
