LAX AIRPORT Custom Hotel Working hard to prove that airport hotels needn't be dull, the Custom employs a private shuttle that takes guests to and from LAX while playing techno music over silent Greta Garbo movies. The lobby mixes the contemporary -- white metal-frame sofas and graphic-print rugs -- with black-and-white photos of film stars like Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. DOWNTOWN O Hotel This 68-room hotel sits in the heart of newly hot downtown L.A. Built in the 1920s, the steel-and-glass structure was recently renovated and now has a modern feel (think mood lighting that shines from under the beds and ergonomic desk chairs). 1697 Pacific Ave., 310/452-1111, jdvhotels.com, rooms from $179. 819 S. Flower St., 213/623-9904, ohotelgroup.com, rooms from $129.
