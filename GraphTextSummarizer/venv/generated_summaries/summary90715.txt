"You ought to look at at least immediately suspending visas for non-U.S. nationals," GOP Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana told Obama administration officials at a House committee hearing Thursday. His comments to reporters in the Oval Office came after a meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Tom Frieden, Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco and others. -- President Barack Obama said Thursday night that it "may be appropriate" for him to appoint a czar to lead his administration's response to Ebola. But said that doing so could make it tougher to determine whether passengers entering the United States from elsewhere had recently visited the region that's at the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. Obama pointed to those two as the leaders of the U.S. response to Ebola so far.
