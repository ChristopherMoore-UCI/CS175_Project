-- Mississippi's attorney general Thursday again asked the state Supreme Court to overturn some 200 pardons, including those of convicted murderers, issued by former Gov. Haley Barbour in January during his last days in office. In January, during his last days in office, Barbour issued pardons and clemencies to 214 people, including four convicted murderers and an armed robber, who were serving life sentences. Barbour, who also is former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has said that he believes in redemption and that people deserve second chances. "Our constitutional rights were violated," said Tiffany Ellis Brewer, Tammy Ellis' sister. In a statement after the court ruling, Barbour said it "reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state," but acknowledged that his decision has been difficult for many of the inmates' victims.
