-- FBI agents are traveling to Peru to study a laptop belonging to Joran Van der Sloot -- who was arrested twice in connection with the Natalee Holloway case, but was not charged -- according to a Lima court document. The Lima court document says the unnamed FBI agents will meet March 14 with two agents of the Peruvian National Police High Technology Crime Division at the Peruvian National Police Headquarters in Lima. Authorities found Flores' body in a Lima hotel room registered to him in June last year. Van der Sloot was the last person to be seen with Holloway. Van der Sloot's attorney and a representative for the Flores family are expected to be present March 14.
