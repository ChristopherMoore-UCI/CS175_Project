Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. Knight founded the successful Death Row Records in 1991, signing artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (since then known as Snoop Dogg and Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight, 49, faces up to 30 years in prison because he has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. Prosecutors said they will ask for Knight's bail to be set at $1 million and for a $75,000 bail for Williams, 43.
