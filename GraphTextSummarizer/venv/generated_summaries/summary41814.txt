Scottish champions Rangers are also in pot three, while the favorites will also want to avoid Portuguese side Braga, who put out La Liga's Sevilla in the result of the third qualifying round this week. Another potentially tricky hurdle might be English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur, who are in the third pot of eight. They are joined by British trio Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal, Spanish giants Barcelona, city rivals AC Milan and French side Lyon. Under Champions League rules they cannot face either of the other three English clubs at the first stage. Inter could face Real Madrid, now managed by Jose Mourinho, who led them to their triple Serie A, Champions League, Italian Cup triumph last season before departing to the Bernabeu.
