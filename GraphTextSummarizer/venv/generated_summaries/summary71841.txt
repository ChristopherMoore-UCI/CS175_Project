Islamic Jihad, the Fatah Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Nasser Salah al-Din Brigades issued a leaflet in Gaza claiming responsibility for sending three explosive devices to Ashkelon and Ashdod. Hamas, the movement controlling Gaza, has been vowing retaliation since one of the founding members of its military wing, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, died last week in Dubai. The Israel Defense Forces, in a statement Monday, said several Palestinian groups had claimed responsibility January 29 for a maritime terrorist attack after the detonation of two sea-born explosive devices about two kilometers (1.24 miles) off the coast of Gaza. Al-Mabhouh's brother, Fayek al-Mabhouh, said that preliminary results of Hamas' investigation of the death showed his brother was killed by electrocution and strangulation with a piece of cloth. Policemen and bomb disposal experts neutralized the explosives, according to police spokesman Miki Rosenfeld.
