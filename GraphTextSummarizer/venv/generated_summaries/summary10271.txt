Santana recalled the moments when he recorded a roughly three-minute video of North Charleston Police officer Michael Slager shooting Walter Scott as Scott was running away Saturday. Scott's mother, Judy Scott, told Cooper this week that she would want to thank Santana for coming forward. "Mr. Scott never tried to fight," Santana told CNN. Santana said when he first came on the scene while walking to his job he saw Slager on top of Scott, who was on the ground. When Santana's video begins, Scott starts running away from the officer, with Scott's back to Slager.
