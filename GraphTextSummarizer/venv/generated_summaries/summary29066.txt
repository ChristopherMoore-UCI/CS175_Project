White said that 14 guns were discovered at checkpoints around the country last week. A TSA spokesman said the agency reviewed airport surveillance camera videos of the incident and removed the screener from security duties while an investigation is under way. Travelers go through security at Ronald  Reagan Washington National Airport. "Appropriate actions will be taken once the investigation is complete," spokesman Christopher White said. -- A passenger who went through an airport security checkpoint -- before remembering that he had a loaded gun -- is facing charges after going back to report his error, authorities said.
