Real will start its Champions League campaign at home against Swiss side Basel before facing Bulgarian minnow Ludogorets and Liverpool. According to figures provided by UEFA, teams in the Champions League and Europa League shared more than $1.4 billion in prize money last season. Ronaldo has scored at least 10 goals in each of his past three Champions League campaigns and last year he set a single-season record with an astonishing 17. And Real, which won "la decima" last season, it's 10th European Cup, will face a struggle to handle the challenge despite its star-studded squad. No club has ever successfully defended the Champions League title since the competition was revamped in 1992.
