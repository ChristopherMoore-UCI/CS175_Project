Add to that the fact that Internet companies with a lot more sex appeal than LinkedIn -- including Facebook, Groupon, Pandora, Yelp and Zynga (makers of FarmVille) -- are all likely to go public within the next year, and you have LinkedIn taking the pole position in what will be a tidal wave of social media companies entering the public markets. Whereas in the 1990s, Web companies shelled out tens of millions of dollars on advertising to find users, today's social media leaders like LinkedIn acquire new users through network effects -- their services become more valuable to users when their friends sign up. Returning to LinkedIn, while today's story about its IPO may be about whether it represents a new financial bubble in the Internet sector, the story in years to come will be its symbolism in changing the world in which social media companies operate. Whereas Netscape's IPO symbolized the dawn of the dotcom boom, TheGlobe.com's epitomized the height of irrational exuberance and Google's ushered in a renaissance of tech innovation after the Internet bubble burst, LinkedIn's debut will be remembered as social media's arrival on the capitalist stage known as Wall Street. Aside from the almost inevitable historical significance, however, is the new dynamic that will be created for social media companies that IPO.
