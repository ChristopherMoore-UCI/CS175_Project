The United States is preparing to announce a decision "in the coming days" on assistance to Egypt, the White House said Tuesday, and U.S. officials told CNN military aid will be cut, though not all of it. Death toll rises as violence rages U.S. national security advisers recommended to the president last month that aid should be cut, U.S. officials told CNN in September. Last month, U.S. officials said Obama's national security team had recommended a cut in aid that included all foreign military financing to the Egyptian military, except funding toward security in the Sinai Peninsula and along the Egyptian border with Gaza. But after U.S. calls to the Egyptian military for restraint over the last few months were met with a heavy-handed crackdown on Morsy supporters, Obama canceled a joint military exercise and announced a new review of U.S. aid to Egypt. Any decision to cut aid would not preclude resuming the aid should Egypt make what the United States believes are positives steps towards restoring democracy, officials said.
