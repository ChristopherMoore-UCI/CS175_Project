The case has drawn attention -- and criticism -- from top Italian officials, who have questioned why Rome was not consulted before the operation, which was launched by Nigerian forces with support from Britain. Doctors conducted an autopsy on Franco Lamolinara on Saturday, immediately after his body arrived in Rome, said Dr. Paolo Alberello of the Forensic Institute of Rome's Sapienza University, according to Italian media reports. In a meeting Friday with his Italian counterpart, British Foreign Secretary William Hague "made clear that there had been a limited opportunity to secure the release of the two hostages, whose lives were in imminent and growing danger," said a joint UK-Italian statement issued by Britain's Foreign & Commonwealth Office. He and McManus worked for the construction and civil engineering firm B. Stabilini and Co., which is based in Abuja, Nigeria. -- An Italian who was killed during a failed hostage rescue attempt in Nigeria was shot four times, a doctor told reporters.
