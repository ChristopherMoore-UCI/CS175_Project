"That's certainly part of this huge puzzle," San Diego County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said of reports that the family crossed into Mexico and ate dinner and drank cocktails there. -- Mike McStay has come to this remote swath of Southern California desert to say goodbye. "Every available resource will be utilized in this investigation to identify the suspects involved in this heinous crime and bring them to justice," said Sheriff John McMahon. The family's locked, abandoned Isuzu Trooper was located four days later in San Ysidro, California, having been towed from the Mexican border. Mike McStay and other family members tried to keep the case alive.
