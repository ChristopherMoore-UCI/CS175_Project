Minister of Arts and Culture Paul Mashatile has announced a number of partnerships with local community leaders and artists in a bid to stimulate creativity in communities and help beautify areas. The regeneration of the area is one of the reasons that the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design has crowed Cape Town the World Design Capital -- a title the city will hold until the end of the year. "I think this is far more intrinsic and deeper than anybody anticipates and it's only going to be in years to come that we really see the critical impact that world design capital has had on Cape Town," says McGowan. This longer-term perspective is also on the mind of Alayne Reesberg, CEO of World Design Capital Cape Town -- the body which implements the requirements of the World Design Capital organization. "Our design industry is ready," says McGowan, who's also the founder of the Southern Guild -- a stable of local talent creating design art and investment pieces.
