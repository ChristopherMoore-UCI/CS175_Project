She began showing symptoms of memory loss a decade ago, but it took several years to get an official diagnosis of Alzheimer's, her husband, Joseph Sr., said. Last week, Fraley showed up at the Glen Park assisted living community for dementia and Alzheimer's patients, in Monrovia, California, and began to play. The support from people who've watched Fraley's video has been so encouraging to him and his family that he said he will continue to play at his mother's assisted-living facility, even after she passes away. Judy Fraley was a therapist and healer who taught for over 30 years at different high schools in L.A. and the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena until she started having memory problems. Fraley said hundreds of people have written to him, sharing similar stories of what they've gone through and how the video reminded them of their parents.
