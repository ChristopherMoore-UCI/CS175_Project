-- Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers Hall of Fame center fielder Donald "Duke" Snider died Sunday at a convalescent hospital in Escondido, California. "He was an extremely gifted talent and his defensive abilities were often overlooked because of playing in a small ballpark, Ebbets Field," said former Dodgers broadcaster Vin Scully, referring to the Dodgers' home in Brooklyn. Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig called Snider, "a key player during a special era in baseball, joining Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle to form New York City's unparalleled triumvirate of center fielders -- Willie, Mickey and The Duke." A statement released by the Dodgers' organization described Snider as one of "the game's more feared hitters." After retiring as a player, Snider returned as a minor league manager for the Dodgers.
