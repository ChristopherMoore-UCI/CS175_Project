At least, that's what a list of "myths and facts" issued Thursday by the TSA about pat-downs and other security measures would like you to consider. In its fact sheet, the TSA says that pat-downs only occur when a passenger sets off a metal detector or opts out of an X-ray scan. Another myth that the TSA tackled is that all children will receive pat-downs. He said the use of full-body pat-downs and advanced imaging scanners for airline personnel "just isn't an efficient use of our resources." Then there is the issue of whether the full-body scans, done in advance imaging technology, or AIT machines, are safe. Some see the pat-downs as a punishment for refusing to get scanned, but the TSA says that is not the case.
