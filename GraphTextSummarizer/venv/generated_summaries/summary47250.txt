Poland midfielder Jakub Blaszczykowski put the home side ahead from close range in the 23rd minute and Mats Hummels doubled Dortmund's advantage nine minutes later from the penalty spot, after captain Sebastian Kehl received a nasty kick in the face from defender Stephane Mbia. The English Premier League side needed a victory to guarantee their place in the knockout stage and they got the perfect start when Drogba scored in the third minute -- Chelsea's fastest ever Champions League goal. So Barcelona strolled through as group winners with an impressive 16 points, while BATE are eliminated in bottom place. The Ukrainian side had already been eliminated, but they inflicted a first defeat on the Cypriot side courtesy of goals from Luiz Adriano and Yevhen Seleznyov. In the other match, Italian champions AC Milan wasted a two-goal lead as Czech side Viktoria Plzen scored twice in the final minute to snatch an unlikely 2-2 draw.
