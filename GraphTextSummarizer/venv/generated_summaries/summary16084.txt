Between October 1, 2011 and September 30, 2012, English Premier League clubs spent over $123 million on fees to agents, who fill a dual role -- sometimes working for clubs, while also representing players. With as few as 25-30% of international transfers concluded using licensed agents, FIFA wants to ditch the system for regulating them. However, the regulation of agents is proving cause for concern for world governing body FIFA. "A possible new approach could be to regulate the conduct of clubs and players, and extend the scope of the regulations to include all kinds of intermediaries," FIFA said in November. " "I belong to a generation of agents that had to make a deposit of $219,000 to get the license," said Brazilian agent Paulo Teixeira.
