Lawmakers in the Philippines have called for an inquiry into allegations that public funds were used to "hide" homeless families at a resort during the Pope's recent visit. In an unrelated Senate hearing Tuesday, DSWD Secretary Dinky Soliman was asked about the issue, and confirmed that homeless families from the boulevard had been sent to the resort. The training course at the resort had been been funded as part of a program with the objective of "keeping families off the streets by training them how to live in a house," read the resolution, which was also sponsored by Rep. Antonio Tinio and Rep. Isagani Zarate. It claimed that during the World Economic Forum on East Asia held in Manila in May last year, families were relocated to another resort for similar training. The government's Modified Conditional Cash Transfer (MCCT) Program is described on a government website as a "complete package of assistance to street families ... with access to social services and economic opportunities for the improvement of their living conditions."
