"The results of the study show that professional footballers are getting taller and heavier per decade, with a small but significant rise in the BMI (Body Mass Index) over the four decades. "Successful teams appear to have players nearly two years younger on average than other teams," he said. Do taller players make better footballers? "Apart from the fact that taller players will be more successful at heading the ball both defensively and in attack, they will be able to close down or limit opposition players' ability to pass and distribute the ball. " Despite the findings, Nevill said it was not the end for shorter players, as there would always be cases where shorter and bulkier players could still succeed.
