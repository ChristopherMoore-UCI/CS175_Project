" Health care providers -- or family and friends -- caring for Ebola patients are often at the highest risk of getting sick because they are most likely to come in contact with the body fluids of sick patients, according to the CDC. "There needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood. "It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel," the International Air Transport Association said. Travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoiding contact with Ebola patients.
