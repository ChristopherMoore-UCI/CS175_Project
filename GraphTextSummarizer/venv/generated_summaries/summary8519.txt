According to the Bureau of Land Management's website, smokejumpers are deployed to help with fire suppression in rural areas. "Using high-performance aircraft and parachutes, the jumpers' primary mission is to be first on the scene when fires occur in remote areas. The Boise Smokejumpers can operate out of Boise or virtually any airport with adequate runway length and fueling capabilities, providing a long-range, large-payload, rapid response to an emerging or ongoing fire. Mark T. Urban of Boise was with the Great Basin Smokejumper Base and was doing a training jump about 45 miles east of Boise, the bureau said in a statement. It's believed Urban's parachute malfunctioned, according to Ken Frederick with the National Interagency Fire Center.
