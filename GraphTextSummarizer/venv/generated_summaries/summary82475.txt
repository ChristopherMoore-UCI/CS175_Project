Khalidiya has been a rebel haven as the rest of Homs city suffered intense fighting. Controlling the area of Khalidiya is crucial as it helps regime forces gain control of the city of Homs. Government forces took control of the Khalidiya neighborhood of Homs, Syrian state-run TV reported Monday. But on Saturday, dissidents reported violent clashes between rebels and government forces in Khalidiya. In turn, controlling Homs helps gain a handle on the main routes and territory between the coastal town of Tartus, on the Mediterranean, and the capital, Damascus.
