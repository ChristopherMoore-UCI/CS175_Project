" NASA officials had said the impact of the Centaur upper-stage rocket would result in plumes of dust of more than 250 metric tons. NASA had encouraged everyone around the country to host "impact parties," saying the plume of dust generated by the lunar impact would be visible through "mid-sized backyard" telescopes 10 inches or larger. Samuels is vice president of the Fremont Peak Observatory near Monterey, California, which had invited members of the public to watch Friday's NASA mission through its telescopes. After the impact, NASA officials called the mission a success, saying the satellite sent back a good amount of data that now will be analyzed. "So any time you can show them something that's never been done, and they say, 'Oh this is pretty cool,' I think they buy into that." NASA held an all-night party at Ames Research Center -- located just outside San Francisco -- which was directing the mission.
