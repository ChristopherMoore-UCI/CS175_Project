Rick Grantham, an entomologist at Oklahoma State University, said a similar swarm of crickets occurred last year. But on Tuesday, he found himself rushing after chirping hordes of crickets in store parking lots near his home. He suggests vacuuming loose crickets and varying the times that lights are on. "You can definitely smell dead crickets if there's enough of them in the parking lot," he said, describing the stench as unpleasant, but not quite as intense as a rotting animal. "Sometimes when they're younger, they do practice cannibalism, and when they get older, they do eat dead crickets," he noted.
