-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Friday that he will step down after his country's national elections due in May. "The way the Congress party failed in the semi-finals, it was a settled affair that Dr. Manmohan Singh will not be its face in the general elections. The scandal rocked Singh's government during its second term, when it also struggled with accusations of large-scale fraud in the sports, real estate and coal sectors. The 81-year-old Oxford-educated Singh has been prime minister for India's governing Congress party since May 2004. His party suffered a bruising defeat in regional elections in December, billed by the country's news media as an indicator of political trends ahead of the upcoming national vote.
