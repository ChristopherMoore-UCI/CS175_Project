Field teams collected Lesula specimens from hunters and monkeys freshly killed by leopards and once, a crowned eagle (the field worker had to wait for the eagle to leave its perch, says Hart). It is the closest settlement of any kind to the area of forest we were working in," says Hart. See Lesula's famous lookalikes "We never expected to find a new species there," says John Hart, the lead scientist of the project, "but the Lomami basin is a very large block that has had very little exploration by biologists. Hart's teams set up digital sound recorders in the forests to record the morning calls of the Owl Face and Lesula monkeys. "The challenge now is to make the Lesula an iconic species that carries the message for conservation of all of DR Congo's endangered fauna," says Hart.
