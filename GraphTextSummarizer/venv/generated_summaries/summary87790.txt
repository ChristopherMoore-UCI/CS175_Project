In a handy booklet called: "How To Write Telegrams Properly" published in 1929, Nelson E. Ross set out telegram etiquette, including an appeal to preserve politeness, regardless of word count: "A man high in American business life has been quoted as remarking that elimination of the word 'please' from all telegrams would save the American public millions of dollars annually," wrote Ross. In Britain, telegrams came to an end in 1982 and the queen now sends cards instead of the famous telegram congratulating centenarians and those celebrating diamond wedding anniversaries. Bruce Ismay, the head of the ship's owners White Star Line, sent this message to the headquarters in New York: "Deeply regret advise your Titanic sunk this morning fifteenth after collision iceberg resulting serious loss life further particulars later." Arguably one of the oldest victims of the digital age, telegrams were the fastest communication method from the 19th century. Unlike letters, many telegrams had the unique characteristic of typed capital letters and an abrupt "STOP" to mark the end of a sentence.
