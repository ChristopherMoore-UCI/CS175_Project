Prosecutors have requested that Chism not be allowed in any part of that hospital that is not securely locked; not be allowed to leave without prosecutors' consent; and not be left alone with female staff or patients, according to court documents. An official at the youth services facility had been warned by MacDougall in November not to allow Chism to be alone with female staff members, court documents say. Chism "took several steps to elude other staff who were believed to be observing him including but not limited to creeping along a common hallway crouched down out of view of observers," Essex Assistant District Attorney Kate B. MacDougall said in the affidavit. Police discovered Ritzer's body in a wooded area near the school, covered with leaves and debris, court papers said. -- Prosecutors building a case against a teenager accused of raping and killing a high school teacher say he apparently planned an attack on a female youth counselor earlier this month, according to court documents.
