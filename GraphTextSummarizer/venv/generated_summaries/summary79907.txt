SEAL training is "the ultimate test for a guy," said Chris Heben, a former SEAL with 10 years of experience carrying out missions in Africa, the Middle East and Afghanistan. The attrition rate for SEAL training is about 90%, Heben and Webb said. The discipline from SEAL training was intensely satisfying to Heben in his early 20s. In the Iran-Iraq war, SEAL teams conducted missions to counter Iranian mine-laying boats. Instructors deprive the participants of sleep, then let them hit the rack just long enough for REM sleep to begin, said Brandon Tyler Webb, a former SEAL who ran the sniper program at the Navy Special Warfare Command and was part of combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
