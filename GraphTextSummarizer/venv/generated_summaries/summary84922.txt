In July 2012, in a bid to attract golfers and tourists to the Casey Country Club in Illinois --a town with a population of just under 3,000 -- Bolin Enterprises operations manager Michael "Bo" Bohannon and the company's vice president Jim Bolin concocted the idea of building a golf tee of biblical proportions. It is not the first over-sized Bolin Enterprises construction -- last year the company produced the world's largest wind chime, a 55-foot long structure now proudly hanging in Casey. It will be sited on the 10th hole on the Casey course, although that is just the start for Bohannon and Bohin to put Casey on the tourist map. To maximize the potential pulling power of having the world's biggest tee in Casey, Bohannon is also thinking on a grand scale to market the town's gargantuan landmark. "We truly hope this will be a draw to golfers and visitors worldwide," added Bohannon.
