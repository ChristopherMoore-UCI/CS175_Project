Los Angeles County district attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons on Saturday denied a media report that a decision had already been made to charge Lohan. "We vehemently deny these allegations and, if charges are filed, we will fight them in court, not in the press," Lohan lawyer Shawn Chapman Holley said Saturday. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering a felony theft charge against Lohan after her stylist handed over the "one of a kind necklace" to police just before they were to search her apartment, according to the police and the prosecutor's spokeswoman. Lindsay Lohan's lawyer "vehemently" denied that the actress stole a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store last month. "As part of the grand theft investigation, detectives with the Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific area obtained a search warrant on February 1, 2011, for actress Lindsay Lohan's Venice residence, to search for the necklace," the statement said.
