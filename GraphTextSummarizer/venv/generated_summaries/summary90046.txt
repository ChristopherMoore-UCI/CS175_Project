Lupus is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects various parts of my body like my skin, my joints and various organs. At the time she was playing for the U.S. National Team and had begun feeling extremely fatigued; regular training sessions left her with joint pain and muscle soreness. I deal with fatigue and joint pain just like with lupus, but it also affects my skin, my eyes and my mouth. You've just begun to talk publicly about your battles with autoimmune disease. I do less Olympic lifts and more body-weight exercises.
