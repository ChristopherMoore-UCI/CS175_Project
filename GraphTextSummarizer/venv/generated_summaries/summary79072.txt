The world No. 2 has reached the final four at Roland Garros twice before and beat Kvitova, from the Czech Republic, in the semifinals in Stuttgart -- a tournament she went on to win. But Kvitova's only grand slam win to date came at last year's Wimbledon tournament, when she beat Sharapova in straight sets in the final. Maria Sharapova remains on course to complete a career slam after she set up a French Open semifinal showdown with Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova. Maria is playing really well, she can win the tournament." Kvitova, the No. 4 seed, dropped the first set against qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan, who knocked out defending champion Li Na in the previous round, but battled back to win 3-6 6-2 6-4. It ended Shvedova's hopes of becoming the first qualifier ever to reach the Roland Garros semis, and propelled Kvitova closer to her second grand slam final appearance.
