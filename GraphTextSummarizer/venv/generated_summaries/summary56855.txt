With more details emerging from domestic news coverage, many have viewed Zhang's plight -- and Nie's case -- as an egregious example of the flaws in the Chinese criminal justice system, including the use of torture, deficient due process and lax review of death sentences. "We can no longer afford to let Nie's case drag on." A mother's dogged pursuit Zhang now seals her most treasured possessions in a Ziploc bag: two old photos and several legal documents. Zhang was convinced that Nie was a victim of torture, after seeing her normally healthy son walk with a limp into the courthouse before the first trial. After the initial shock, Zhang had to endure more agony to locate her son's remains and deal with a failed suicide attempt and subsequent half-paralysis of her husband, who was crushed by Nie's execution. Carefully laying the contents from her Ziploc bag on a table, Zhang described each legal document as she recounted her six-year lone quest for justice: a copy of the verdict against Nie that detailed his "crimes;" a 2007 letter from the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, in which the nation's highest court instructed the Hebei high court to "process" her appeal; and most importantly, a printout of a written statement by Wang's lawyer on his client's confession.
