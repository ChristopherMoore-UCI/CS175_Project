"What you see is a very hefty response," said CNN Aviation Correspondent Rene Marsh. Delta spokesman Morgan Durant said, "It was a Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta, Georgia, flight. One runway was closed temporarily, causing delays for other flights as passengers on the two flights were questioned and their luggage was searched by bomb-sniffing dogs, officials said. Southwest Airlines Flight 2492 and Delta Flight 1156 landed safely at the airport and were searched by bomb disposal units, according to airline officials. F-16 fighter jets escorted two passenger planes into Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Saturday after a bomb threat made on Twitter was deemed credible, according to military officials.
