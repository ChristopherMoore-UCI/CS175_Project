-- A divided Supreme Court spent this week's final oral argument on health care reform Wednesday examining whether states would be "coerced" by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs by the risk of losing funding if they refused to take part. No federal court has ever ruled states have been unlawfully coerced when they accept conditions or strings attached to federal funds. The tricky point is that states are not forced to agree to the law's incremental Medicaid increases, spread out over six years. Medicaid, which operates on federal and state funding, would be expanded under the health care reform law, and 26 states filed legal challenges against what they contended was an unfair burden forced on them by Washington. The session concluded three days of public debate on the 2010 Affordable Health Act and focused on the contentious legal issue of federal versus state powers, in this case involving the Medicaid government-run health care for the poor and disabled.
