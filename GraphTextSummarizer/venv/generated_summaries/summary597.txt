Frank Lampard underlined his continued value to Chelsea by scoring both goals in their 2-1 win at Everton Sunday as they went third in the English Premier League. The victory lifted Chelsea above Tottenham Hotspur into third place in the standings, still 11 points behind leaders Manchester United, but with a game in hand. Sylvain Distin made a last-ditch saving tackle to deny Fernando Torres a third for Chelsea before Nikica Jelavic wasted a chance for Everton to equalize. " During his 12 years at the club, Lampard's goal tally from midfield has always proved a key factor in Chelsea's success and his well-placed 42nd minute header canceled out Pienaar's earlier opportunist effort. South African Steven Pienaar gave Everton a second minute lead but former England international Lampard turned the game around for the visitors.
