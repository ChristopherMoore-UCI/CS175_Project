Every effort to integrate Department of Defense and VA medical record systems has failed. Simply firing a couple of managers without replacing systems, structures and culture will not solve systemic problems. The scale of VA bureaucracy has grown dramatically. In the current nationwide series of Veterans Administration scandals, the real focus has to be on rethinking the system that is failing to serve our veterans and their families. The result has been an absurd process of transitioning from active duty health services to VA health services.
