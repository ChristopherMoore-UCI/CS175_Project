The 78-meter aluminum work entitled "Slipstream" was created by artist Richard Wilson to fill a wide atrium that passengers will cross when connecting to road and rail networks. "It's a very legible building," says Vidal, who describes his Terminal as a "piazza" to rival London's Covent Garden that will become a destination in its own right. Soft launch "Passengers can understand it very easily," says Vidal. There's more sculpture here, although on a less impressive scale -- one artwork resembles a tangle of windshield wipers. That's not to say it doesn't have its merits -- as airport buildings go, Queen's Terminal will certainly be among the most pleasant.
