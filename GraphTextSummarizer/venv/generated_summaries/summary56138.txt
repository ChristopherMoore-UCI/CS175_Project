While it is hardly necessary to return to the "just the facts" days of close-lipped cops, a moratorium on releasing and publicizing the identities of persons of interest before and until they become persons of suspicion may be the wisest and fairest approach. Unfortunately, even without the linguistic similarity, the important distinction between person of interest and suspect is too often lost on most Americans. Curiosity about the now often-used designation involves more than just the fact that "person of interest" was not part of law enforcement vernacular a few decades ago. Many Americans will recall the name of Richard Jewell, who police and many news organizations called a person of interest following the Atlanta Olympic Park bombing. The arrest of Raymond Clark in connection with the murder of Ms. Le may officially signal a move from interest to suspicion.
