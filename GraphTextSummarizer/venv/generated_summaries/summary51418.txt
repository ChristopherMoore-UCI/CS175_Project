The National Federation of State High School Associations announced earlier this month that it has partnered with USA football to endorse a program that promotes high school football player safety. " Jason said his team passed out new football helmets this season that are designed to minimize the risk of concussion more than old ones this season. A lot of schools in the Los Angeles area are requiring pre-season cognitive testing for football players, so that if a player gets a concussion, he can be re-tested and the results can be compared to the original screening, said Sidney Jones, athlete trainer and clinical coordinator at the Sports Concussion Institute. In a landmark move Thursday, thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the National Football League. There are approximately 1,100,000 teens playing high school football, according to The National Federation of State High School Associations.
