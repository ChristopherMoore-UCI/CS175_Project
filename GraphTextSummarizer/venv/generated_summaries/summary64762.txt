On their face, these programs might not look much alike, yet they share key elements, including an understanding of what local employers need and a focus on teaching relevant technical skills; a careful recruitment and screening process that helps ensure a good match between program participants and available jobs; and connections to resources that participants might need -- like child care subsidies and transportation assistance -- to complete training and succeed on the job. We must invest in research that will help us better understand the many types of programs that fall under the umbrella of "sectoral employment," improve their ability to serve job seekers, and, crucially, forge a path by which effective approaches to training may be brought to scale. First, a flexible and nimble organization that has the ability to make connections between local employers and job seekers and that can marshal money from public and private sources to provide needed training. Training cannot erase the job losses we have seen in the past year, but done right it could build worker skills and help American businesses compete in the global economy. But much more needs to be done to foster public policies that support effective sectoral programs -- and to expand our base of knowledge about successful approaches to training.
