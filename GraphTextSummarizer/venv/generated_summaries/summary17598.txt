Their bodies were discovered by the Fogels' 12-year-old daughter when she came home Friday night, a family neighbor told Israeli media. Nabil Abu Reudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, called the Israeli decision "wrong and unacceptable" in a statement reported by the official Palestinian Authority news agency Wafa. The Palestinian Authority and many international observers object to the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which the Palestinians want to be the basis of a future state. "Israel will not accept such a heinous murder and will act strongly to keep the safety of the lives of Israeli citizens and punish the murderers." The event was broadcast on Israeli television.
