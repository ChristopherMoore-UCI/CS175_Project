Crop failure and poverty leave people vulnerable to starvation -- but famine only occurs with political failure." Famine used to be a term equated solely with a large-scale shortage of food. It's no coincidence that the precise geography that have been labeled a famine and have met the technical designation of famine are precisely those areas where Shabaab has limited access, has harassed aid workers and has made it difficult for people to eke out a basic standard of living and existence. And that is what has happened in southern Somalia, where people have had to make heart-wrenching choices simply to stay alive. Stage 5, or famine, means that acute malnutrition rates are 30% or more, people do not have adequate calorie or water intake and mortality rates are greater than two adults or four children per day per 10,000 people. Famine represents a catastrophic failure of all the systems that people rely on to survive."
