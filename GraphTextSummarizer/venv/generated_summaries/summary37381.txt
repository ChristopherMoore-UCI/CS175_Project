Novak Djokovic ended one of the most remarkable winning streaks in sport after taking Rafael Nadal's Monte Carlo Masters crown on Sunday. "I went through pain, I went through a big challenge, mentally, physically,  emotionally, and in the end it was getting better as the tournament was going  on." Sunday's final was delayed by almost 45 minutes due to rain, but when play finally got under way it was Djokovic who took charge, losing just 12 points in the first five games and then wrapping up the set when Nadal double-faulted. " Djokovic has also overcome recent injury problems, having been a doubt for Monte Carlo after hurting his ankle on Davis Cup duty. Djokovic had been beaten by the 26-year-old Nadal in the 2009 and 2012 finals in Monte Carlo. Nadal, who had been sidelined for seven months, has now lost six of his 44 clay finals -- three of them to Djokovic, who will be hoping to stop the 11-time grand slam champion defending his French Open title when the season's second major starts at the end of next month.
