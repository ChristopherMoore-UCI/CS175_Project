Later, the FAA issued a notice prohibiting U.S. flight operations in the airspace over eastern Ukraine until further notice. -- Commercial airlines that usually cross eastern Ukraine on their flights to Europe, Asia and elsewhere are detouring away from the volatile region in light of Thursday's suspicious crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. Ukrainian authorities have closed many of the routes in eastern Ukraine, according to Eurocontrol, which counts Ukraine among its 40 member states. "We're taking a wide detour around eastern Ukraine," said Lufthansa spokesman Nils Haupt. Lufthansa had four scheduled flights Thursday that would usually cross over eastern Ukraine.
