Facing fierce winds and unrelenting waves, Caizergues beat the previous record set by American Rob Douglas by 0.97 knots -- an effort achieved in a sport where danger is always lurking. The wind speed can often reach up to 130km - making it the ideal place for breaking records. After taking up the sport 12 years ago, Caizergues has excelled by winning three world titles and two national championships and he now plans to break more records. " Ask Caizergues about his latest achievement and he gives a Gallic shrug and a small laugh, but this is no minor achievement for the Provencal-born star who has hunted down record after record. His latest triumph came in the salt marshes of Salin-de-Giraud where he was carried along by the Mistral -- a fierce cold wind which blows toward the Mediterranean Sea from the uplands in southern France.
