Join us October 29 for a Google Hangout on bullying 'Say those few kind words' Scheff, the parent advocate and author, believes parents and educators can also teach our kids to be "cybershields" for other children. In conversations with law enforcement, educators, bullying experts and parents, it's clear that while parents may be getting up to speed on some social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, there are plenty of other platforms popular with tweens and teens that parents don't know. The company also developed a parent guide to provide information about "how parents can help their teens ... have a great (and safe) experience on Kik. Sadly bullying can take place anywhere -- on or offline -- so it is important we, parents and users work together to fight it," the statement said. "I understand why kids do it, but there's way more negatives than positives that could possibly come out of it, and if I were raising a son or daughter, I would be like, 'Why do you care so much about people asking you these questions and demonstrating interest in you this way, because it opens you up for more harassment,' " said Hinduja, co-author of "Words Wound: Delete Cyberbullying and Make Kindness Go Viral," a book for teens to be released in December.
