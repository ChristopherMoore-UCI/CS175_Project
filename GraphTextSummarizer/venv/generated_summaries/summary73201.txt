So while it's impossible for the San Andreas to sweep California out into the ocean, the Geological Survey said, southwestern California is slowly -- very slowly -- sliding past the rest of the state toward Alaska. Peru, California, Chile and Iceland have all been hit by notable earthquakes in 2014, which has some wondering whether there have been an unusually large amount of strong earthquakes this year. The Geological Survey notes that many earthquakes go undetected "because they hit remote areas or have very small magnitudes." And because the Pacific Plate shifts about 2 inches a year, the Geological Survey said, Los Angeles and San Francisco will become next-door neighbors (though not for about 15 million years). Catastrophic earthquakes seem to strike along the southern San Andreas Fault about once every 150 years, the U.S. Geological Survey said, citing studies examining the past 1,400 years.
