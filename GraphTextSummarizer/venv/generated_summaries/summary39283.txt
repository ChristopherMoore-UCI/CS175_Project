A lucky 20% of the nation opens them both on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. -- 'Tis indeed the season to be jolly for Americans, who are experiencing their lowest levels of holiday stress in years, according to a new CNN/ORC nationwide poll. Americans may be feeling less stress this year in part because they're not dealing with the often messy hassle of putting up a natural tree, and the pressure to make sure far-flung extended family members get their Christmas cards in time. For most Americans, the holiday moment to look forward to is Christmas Day -- that's when 58% of the nation opens their presents. The poll suggests they've already decked their halls with boughs of holly, as only 30% of the public said they're feeling a great deal or fair amount of stress from all the things they need to do to get ready for Christmas.
