-- Two teenage girls accused of aggravated stalking in the case of a young Florida girl who jumped to her death no longer face criminal charges, lawyers said Wednesday. A member of the state attorney's office said he could not comment on cases involving juveniles and referred CNN to defense lawyers. Legal experts had said the charges filed in the case could serve as a "tipping point," inspiring similar felony charges against other suspected adolescent bullies. Attorney Jose Baez, the attorney for the younger of the two girls, said the state had dropped the felony charge against her in the bullying case of Rebecca Sedwick, who was 12 when she committed suicide in September. Months of cyberabuse reportedly drove Rebecca to climb up the ladder of a pair of silos at an abandoned concrete plant in September.
