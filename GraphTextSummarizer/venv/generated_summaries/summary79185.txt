Hamlin's cousin Kevin Jones has cystic fibrosis, a chronic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. At the age of 5, NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin knew something wasn't quite right with his cousin. The effects of watching Jones' struggle ultimately led Hamlin to establish the Denny Hamlin Foundation in 2008. Hamlin's quiet determination is clear on his face. One such hospital is the Children's Hospital of Richmond at VCU in Hamlin's hometown.
