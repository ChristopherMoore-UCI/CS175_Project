While high levels of corruption, an inefficient judicial system and an aging population remain challenges to Serbia's progress, it has the advantage of a skilled labor force, a strategic location at the center of Europe and free trade agreements with the EU, Russia and Turkey as well as member states in the Central European Free Trade Agreement. Neighboring states, meanwhile, fought to create new nation states outside the Yugoslav federation. Despite a pro-Western government under current President Tomislav Nikolic, Serbia has historically been a strong ally of Russia, which supported the state during its opposition to Kosovan independence.
