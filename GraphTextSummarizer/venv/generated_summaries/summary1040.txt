Jun Lin, a 33-year-old student at Montreal's Concordia University, was killed in late May in one of the city's grisliest crimes in years. "It is our wish to take this opportunity to turn a devastating situation into something positive that brings the goodness and peace back to society. The family thanked the people of Montreal, who stepped up to support their travel; and Concordia, which has set up an award in their son's name to assist Chinese students -- a move the family said "perfectly reflects Jun Lin's compassionate spirit. The mailings and the discovery of other body parts behind Magnotta's apartment triggered an international manhunt. Ian Lafreniere said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and included evidence of cannibalism.
