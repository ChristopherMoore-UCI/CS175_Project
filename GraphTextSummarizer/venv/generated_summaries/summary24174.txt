International flights of the airlines Cathay Pacific, Virgin Blue, Jetstar and Value were affected, said Bambang Ervan, spokesman of the Transportation Ministry. "Our team and also the (Bali's) Ngurah Rai Airport team is still monitoring the conditions at the airport," Ervan said. -- International flights to the Indonesian island of Bali were canceled Friday because of volcanic ash, according to a transportation official. Although the threat level was downgraded recently, it continues to spew out ash columns, according to the Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation agency. A volcanic ash monitoring center in Darwin, in northern Australia, issued a Notice to Airmen warning that the ash could affect aviation.
