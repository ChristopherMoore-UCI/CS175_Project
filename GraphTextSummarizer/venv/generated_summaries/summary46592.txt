Paul Romero, Jordan's father, said the first day of the actual ascent Monday required technical climbing in tough weather conditions, including ice and snow. The interview followed the first day of real climbing in Romero's attempt to become the youngest person ever to reach the summit of Everest, 29,028 feet (8,847 meters) above sea level. "Hi, Mom," Romero said with a wave of his hand during the interview broadcast on CNN from the advance base camp on Mount Everest in Nepal. " Before they started, Jordan said he wanted to climb Everest for himself and to inspire more young people to get outdoors. " Jordan's father and his girlfriend, Karen Lundgren, went to Kathmandu for the first time last year to see whether Jordan could make the Everest summit from the south face in Nepal.
