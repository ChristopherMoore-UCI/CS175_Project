Richard Anthony Franco, 27, was arrested at Berry's home late Monday by off-duty police officers hired by the Oscar-winning actress after two intrusions into her property on Saturday and Sunday, according to Los Angeles police. Berry, in a court filing seeking a restraining order against Franco, said police told her he "has a criminal history of violence, theft and drug offenses." It's not unusual for photographers to stake out positions around Berry's Los Angeles home to get shots of the Oscar-winning actress, but investigators didn't know what this intruder was trying to do, Faden said. Both times he claimed he was "there to see somebody," but left after a Berry employee ordered him out, police spokeswoman Sara Faden said. Investigators said Franco is the same man who intruded into Berry's yard two times last weekend.
