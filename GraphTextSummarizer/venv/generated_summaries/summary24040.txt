It's hard to predict exactly how bright Pan-STARRS will be, but you should be able to see it without binoculars or telescopes, said Don Yeomans of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program. Up first is Comet Pan-STARRS, which gets its funky name from the telescope credited with discovering it in June 2001: the Panoramic Survey Telescope & Rapid Response System in Hawaii. Comets are made up of water, ice, dust and other elements and minerals, all loosely packed together, Battams said. The comet will pass closest to the sun; March 12 and 13: The best dates to look for Pan-STARRS; it should emerge in the western sunset sky not far from the crescent moon. So, like Pan-STARRS, ISON's fate will be decided by the sun.
