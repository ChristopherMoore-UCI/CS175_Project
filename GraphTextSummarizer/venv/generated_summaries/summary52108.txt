Kvitova, who last weekend added the season-ending WTA Championships title to her July Wimbledon crown, gave the visiting Czechs a 1-0 lead when she beat Maria Kirilenko 6-2 6-2 in the opening singles rubber. Svetlana Kuznetsova drew on her vast experience to keep Russia in contention for a fifth Fed Cup tennis title in the final against the Czech Republic on Saturday. The 26-year-old, who featured in three of her nation's four winning line-ups between 2004 and 2008, helped Russia end the first day on level terms in Moscow after world No. 2 Petra Kvitova continued her remarkable year. Kuznetsova, ranked 19th, will take on the 21-year-old Kvitova in Sunday's opening reverse singles rubber in their first career meeting. But if I was playing that rubber in the year 2004, I think I would feel really tight and jittery," she told the Fed Cup website.
