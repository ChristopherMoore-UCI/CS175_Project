U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds scheduled another pretrial conference hearing for January 12, 2011, enough time for Anthony Chambers, the standby counsel for Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, to examine the documents. The pretrial hearing Thursday came after a federal judge delayed court proceedings for about a month to give AbdulMutallab time to prepare his legal defense. The federal judge in the Christmas Day bombing attempt case has granted the defendant's backup attorney access to case documents. Edmunds granted his request and appointed Chambers to be his standby counsel in case he needs help at any point in the proceedings. "We're going to review it and make the decisions as we go along," he said, noting it is unusual for him to be appointed standby counsel.
