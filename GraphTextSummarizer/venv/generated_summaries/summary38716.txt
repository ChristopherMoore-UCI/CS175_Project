From "enraptured bliss" to "depths of anxiety" "It is a little more than thirty-six hours since I saw you, and they have all been given to you, amid the perturbation I could not shake off," Harding wrote after what Robenalt said was a secret visit to Phillips in Marion, Ohio. Salacious details As outlined by Robenalt's book, Harding was married at the time and serving as Ohio's lieutenant governor. Even telephones were relatively new back then, so Warren Harding wrote Carrie Phillips smoldering love letters during their 15-year relationship that ended prior to his inauguration in 1921. In his book, Robenalt examines the possible historical impacts of the affair, noting that Phillips may have spied for Germany and influenced Harding against running for president in 1916 as the war approached. The affair ended four years later, as Harding ran for president in an election he won easily over Democrat James Cox.
