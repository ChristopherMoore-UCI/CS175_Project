I've met people like former NFL New Orleans Saints player Steve Gleason, who now, at age 36, with ALS, is completely paralyzed. The 53-year-old Californian is running a corporation, communicating and raising millions of dollars for ALS research, by tapping with his toes. It's a fatal, fast-moving neuromuscular disease that would paralyze my mother limb by limb. He uses eye-tracking technology to open doors, send e-mails, and tweet by blinking his eyes. With the tap of a toe or the blink of an eye, those with ALS are redefining what it means to be alive.
