Following Amazon's lead, T-Mobile teamed up with Chinese computer company Huawei to create the SpringBoard, a sub-$200 tablet positioned to undercut the glut of other Android slates currently shipping. As technology web site AllThingsD claimed, "Consumers don't want tablets, they want iPads." Amazon decided we aren't ready for cameras on tablets (or, at least, aren't basing our buying decisions on whether cameras appear on spec sheets). But Android tablets aren't selling. Even if it sucks when it finally debuts this fall, at $200 the Fire is priced low enough for casual consumers to risk an impulse buy â€” and now we see other companies chasing that same price-conscious buyer.
