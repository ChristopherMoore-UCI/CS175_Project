-- A luxury cruise ship collided in deep fog with a container ship off Vietnam, punching a hole in the container ship and knocking passengers off their feet, a passenger told CNN Monday. "The foghorn at the back of the ship had been going off consistently, throughout the morning," passenger Andrew Lock said Monday from Hong Kong about the incident, which occurred Friday morning when the Silver Shadow was about five miles from the coast. The couple and Lock say that passengers gathered a few of their possessions and headed to the muster stations. She says cruise employees repeatedly answered by saying that the cruise ship "had the right of way." Lock said he and his wife saw that the container ship was damaged.
