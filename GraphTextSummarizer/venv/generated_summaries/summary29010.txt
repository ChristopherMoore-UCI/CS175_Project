He adds that the Herero genocide in 1904 killed almost 75% of the population, and the event is a key moment in Herero identity. The Herero and Himba people are a pastoral, cattle-breeding tribe who migrated to Namibia several centuries ago. He explains that the style of dress has become an important part of the Herero women's identity.
