The consent agreement was backed by Mayor Dave Bing and Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder. City and state officials avoided a Thursday deadline to save the city from the threat of looming financial insolvency or a takeover of city government by Michigan. As the debates, negotiations and lawsuits raged this week, they did so without Bing, who was recently released from the hospital after serious intestinal surgery and won't return to work for two weeks. He or she could also sell off various city assets, from the water department to valuable art in the city's museum. Both Bing and Snyder said they want to avoid a state takeover, which in itself could be the first step toward the largest municipal bankruptcy in the nation's history.
