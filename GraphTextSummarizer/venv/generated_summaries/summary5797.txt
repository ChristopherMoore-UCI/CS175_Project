" Helicopters versus drones: The cost of the war on rhinos But Knowlton argues that, in this instance, killing one black rhino will protect the species throughout Namibia and that this idea is supported by scientists and conservationists around the world. Knowlton says the Namibian government has identified a handful of black rhinos that can be hunted. The Dallas Safari Club says the $350,000 paid by Knowlton will be donated to the Namibian government's black rhino conservation efforts. "After what I'm going through now, I understand why they decided not to do it." Knowlton says he does not yet when he'll schedule his hunting expedition to Namibia. Knowlton wants to preserve the black rhino's hide and then donate the rhino meat to needy communities in Namibia.
