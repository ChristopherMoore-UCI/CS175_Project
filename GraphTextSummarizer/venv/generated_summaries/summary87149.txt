Police detained Jaime "JH" Herrera in Culiacan, Sinaloa, said Eduardo Pequeno, the head of the anti-drug department of Mexico's Federal Police. Authorities trace his alleged criminal history to 1996, as a dealer of synthetic drugs in Los Angeles, and the following year began to produce methamphetamine in his hometown of Culiacan, where he carried out operations until 1999, the ministry said. Herrera was arrested Monday, as a result of intelligence work by federal police, Mexico's ministry of public security said. Herrera, 43, is a fugitive in the United States, where he is wanted on several criminal counts, the ministry said, without giving further details. Police have captured a man they allege is one of the main producers of methamphetamine for Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, authorities said.
