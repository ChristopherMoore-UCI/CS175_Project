Identity politics is on the line in Ricci and also in another forthcoming Supreme Court decision, a key case involving minority voting rights. And is he a man who remains eager to move beyond identity politics, as he suggested numerous times in the course of his campaign -- or not? Legislative quotas have been the remedy for persistent racial exclusion -- seats reserved for candidates who are the choice of minority voters.
