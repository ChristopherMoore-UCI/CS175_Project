Authorities allege Corchado, 28, was behind the wheel of an SUV that hit a car, sending the car into a Winter Park day care center and killing Lily Quintus, 4, on Wednesday afternoon. -- A man charged in the alleged hit-and-run death of a 4-year-old girl at a Florida day care center will remain in jail at least until a Monday hearing about bail, a judge in Orlando ruled Friday. At a hearing Friday, the judge gave the state until Monday to file a request that Corchado be detained until his trial. CNN's AnneClaire Stapleton, Ed Payne, Steve Almasy, Suzanne Presto, Carma Hassan and John Couwels contributed to this report. Williams said Corchado rented a black Mazda CX-5 on Wednesday afternoon after fleeing the accident.
