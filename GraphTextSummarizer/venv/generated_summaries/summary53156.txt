" The split verdicts for Hernandez, Teresa Jacobo, George Mirabal, George Cole and Victor Bello came two and a half years after the Los Angeles Times first reported salaries for them and others were well above the norm -- especially considering that Bell, situated about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, is a relatively small city of 36,000 people. Those boards were the Solid Waste and Recycling Authority, Surplus Property Authority, Public Finance Authority and Community Housing Authority, authorities said. "You are free to go sir," Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy said afterward. -- For years, prosecutors said, they padded their paychecks by virtue of their stature as leaders in Bell, California's city government. Oscar Hernandez was found guilty on five felony charges for the misappropriation of funds stemming from his years as Bell's mayor, by the same jury that also convicted four former city council members on various counts.
