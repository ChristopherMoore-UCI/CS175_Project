-- Oklahoma native Blake Shelton is the first entertainer to announce a benefit for tornado victims in his home state. The revelation came after he and his wife, Miranda Lambert, sang an especially poignant rendition of their hit "Over You," which the couple wrote as a tribute to Shelton's brother, who died when Shelton was a teenager. "I spent three Christmases at my sister's house in Moore, Oklahoma, and some of those helicopter views of the destruction, you could see her house a quarter of a mile away from there," Shelton said. "'Over You' was just the perfect song to fit, and maybe help some people heal and mourn and all those things," Shelton said. Shelton revealed he had a personal connection to the community with the most devastation.
