-- Investigators have found human remains at the site of a crash in northern Mexico believed to have killed Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera, but the family continues to hold on to a sliver of hope for a miracle. "I trust in God, and he gives me strength," said Rivera's mother, Rosa Rivera. Rivera's "I Love Jenni" reality show began airing on Telemundo's mun2 network last year. Yet Rivera's family says hope is the last thing to go. Born in Long Beach, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Rivera, 43, released her debut album in 1999, according to her website.
