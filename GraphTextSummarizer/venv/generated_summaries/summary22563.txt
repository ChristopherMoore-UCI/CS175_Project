In the United Kingdom, the National Poisoning Information Service received 647 phone calls and almost 4,000 online searches about the eating/swallowing of the contents of liquid detergent capsules, from health care professionals in the last year, according to an article published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal. New York City's poison hotline received its first call about the gel packs in April, and has received about 40 more since then, most from hospitals, said Health Department spokeswoman Chanel Caraway. Authorities in the United States and in the United Kingdom say there has been an uptick in phone calls and hospitalizations resulting from children who have swallowed or otherwise been exposed to the gel packs of highly concentrated laundry detergent, perhaps believing them to be candy. "Detergent manufacturers are re-emphasizing the importance of keeping single unit dose laundry detergent packets out of the reach of children, in the wake of recent reports about children accidentally ingesting these products," Brian Sansoni, ACI vice president, told CNN Wednesday. " In May, the U.S. poison centers highlighted the issue, urging parents to store concentrated detergents out of reach of young children.
