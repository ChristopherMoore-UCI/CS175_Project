But the elder politicians' relationship ended in bad blood when founding President Jomo Kenyatta forced out his vice president, Jaramogi Odinga, following a series of disputes. Kenyatta and Odinga are the sons of the nation's first president and vice president, respectively, bringing back memories of a political dynasty that dates to the 1960s. Odinga, who got 43.31%, had challenged the outcome in court on the grounds that it was flawed and marred by technical problems. Protesters took to the streets in Kisumu after the Supreme Court ruling Saturday that dismissed Odinga's petition and retained Kenyatta's victory. Most of the casualties suffered gunshot wounds, said Abbas Gullet, chief of the local Red Cross The rest of the country remained relatively calm after the ruling.
