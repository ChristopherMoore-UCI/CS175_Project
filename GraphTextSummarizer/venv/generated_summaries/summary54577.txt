Most people know that owning a home comes with tax advantages such as the deduction for mortgage interest, but they don't  know how much of an anomaly that is. Clearly, tax benefits for the mortgage interest deduction are flowing to middle and upper income taxpayers. President Bush's Tax Reform Commission documented that only 54 percent of those with mortgages benefit from the mortgage interest deduction. In 1986, an exception was made for home mortgage interest as a way to "encourage homeownership." In order to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, homeowners must itemize deductions and not take the standard deduction.
