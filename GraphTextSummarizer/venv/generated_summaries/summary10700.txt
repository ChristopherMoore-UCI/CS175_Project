But in its letter to Virginia Tech, the Department of Education said the school did not meet timely warning rules that were in effect on the day of the rampage. "We believe that Virginia Tech administrators acted appropriately in their response to the tragic events of April 16, 2007, based on the best information then available to them," Hincker said. -- Virginia Tech will be fined $55,000 for waiting too long to provide timely warnings about a shooter on the loose during a 2007 rampage in which 32 people died, the U.S. Department of Education said Tuesday. A December 2010 report said the school did not notify students in a "timely manner" -- as dictated by what is known as the Clery Act -- after a shooting that left two people dead at West Ambler Johnston residence hall on the morning of April 16, 2007. " "Because Virginia Tech failed to notify its students and staff of the initial shootings on a timely basis, thousands continued to travel on campus, without a warning of the events at" the residence hall, the education department said.
