Monsignor Kevin Quirk, the presiding priest over the 2008 canonical trial of Rev. James Brennan, read Brennan's testimony into the court record on Monday. He's accused of knowingly transferring priests from parish to parish despite allegations of sexual abuse of minors, including Brennan. During cross-examination, Brennan's attorney, William Brennan, no relation, asked Quirk whether he was aware of the sole alleged victim that came forward despite the archdiocese's making the allegations public via "television, newspapers and smoke signals. Two grand jury reports accused the archdiocese of failing to investigate claims of sexual abuse of children by priests. Brennan is accused of attempted rape in the 1996 incident and is currently standing trial in criminal court.
