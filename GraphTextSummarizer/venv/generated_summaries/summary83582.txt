Much of China-Russia trade is done along their border crossings in northeastern China. On a visit to St. Petersburg last June, Chinese president Hu Jintao told a gathering of business executives that China and Russia now seek to increase bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2015 and $200 billion by 2020. Vladimir Turkov is the general manager of Express Capital Trading, a company that exports steel from China to Russia. Last year, China overtook Germany as Russia's largest trading partner. Some 3 million people from China and Russia now visit each other's country annually.
