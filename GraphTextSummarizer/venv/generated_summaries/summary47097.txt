The 22-year-old from Brooklyn said he shows up for opening day at Luna Park every year. The park's operations team helped each passenger down "one by one," and the ride was closed the rest of the day for repairs, spokeswoman Erica Hoffman said. Riders on a New York roller coaster took the long way down Sunday after Coney Island's historic Cyclone got stuck in its track on opening day. "Safety is the number one priority for our guests here at Luna Park," Hoffman said. No one was injured in the mishap, which occurred about noon during the first run because of an "isolated mechanical issue," a Luna Park spokeswoman said.
