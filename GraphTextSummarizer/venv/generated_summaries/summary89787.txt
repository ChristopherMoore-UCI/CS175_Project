But a third term for al-Maliki, a Shia Muslim, is a red line for Sunni, Kurdish and even rival Shia parties. Iraq's new parliament convened for the first time on July 1 to elect a new speaker, but the session quickly descended into bickering between members of different parties and had to be rescheduled for July 8. But changing the status quo is a red line for the Shia because it has brought them to the helm of power for the first time in Iraq's modern history. There is a "vital" Iraq that Iran and the Shia will fight to protect. Iranian-backed Shia militias have already mobilized to confront the insurgents and they will likely lead the efforts to secure this vital Iraq.
