Manchester United have netted a sponsorship deal with American insurance giants Aon Corporation that will reportedly earn the Premier League champions a staggering $131 million over four years. "Today's announcement clearly strengthens our position as one of the biggest clubs in world football," Gill told the United Web site after unveiling the global partnership and principal sponsorship agreement. United chief executive David Gill did not reveal the figures involved but confirmed that the Chicago-based Aon brand will take over from another another U.S. company AIG on the club shirts from the start of the 2010/11 season. That would send United to the top of football's sponsorship income league ahead of the likes of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Chelsea. "While we are delighted that our brand will be showcased to over 330 million fans of Manchester United as well as the countless followers of football worldwide, we also are extremely excited about the opportunity to maximise the value of this partnership globally."
