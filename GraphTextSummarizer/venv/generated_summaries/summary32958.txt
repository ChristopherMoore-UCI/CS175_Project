The maritime area is home to messy mix of rival claims, with China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam disputing sovereignty of island chains and nearby waters. At the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised eyebrows when he drew a parallel between the current state of relations between Japan and China and that of Britain and Germany before the start of World War I a century ago. China, Japan and South Korea also dispute sovereignty of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea. Xinhua said that despite the "lame comparisons" made by Japan and the Philippines,  China had chosen a path of peaceful development and its territorial claims in the South China Sea have a "sound historical foundation." Chinese state media has called the Philippine president "ignorant" and "amateurish" after he compared Beijing's pursuit of disputed territory in the South China Sea with the rise of Nazi Germany.
