Hotel: Viceroy Miami Why it's cool: In a city loaded with cool pools, the pool at the Viceroy stands out. The two-acre pool deck -- with Japanese blueberry trees and swanky chaise lounges and beds -- features three types of pools: an 80-person hot tub, a wading pool, and a football-field-size swimming pool. Spectacular pools are a dime a dozen in Wailea, the southwestern shore of Maui with prime beach real estate, known for glamorous resorts. Hotel: Al Bustan Palace InterContinental Muscat, Muscat, Oman Why it's cool: After an extensive 18-month renovation, this InterContinental property in Oman reopened with a major pool upgrade -- which the roving pool butlers (you heard us) are more than happy to tell you about, after refreshing your rose-scented spritzer. The sharks, stingrays, massive Queensland grouper, and silvery jack crevalle are separated from the swimming pool by a six-inch clear acrylic wall.
