-- Rescuers combed through mangled wreckage early Sunday searching for survivors after two passenger trains collided in southern Poland, leaving at least 16 dead. Authorities are "almost sure there will be no living persons inside the wreckage," said Marcin Kopczynski, the duty officer. In addition to the fatalities, the collision Saturday night injured at least 60 others, according to the Polish State Fire Brigade. We approach very cautiously," firefighter Jaroslaw Wojtasik told CNN's Polish affiliate TVN. An American citizen was among the dead, said a spokesman with the U.S. Consulate in Krakow.
