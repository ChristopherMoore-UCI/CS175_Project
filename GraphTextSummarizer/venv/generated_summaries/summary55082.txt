Politics: Obama more emotional on spending cuts And some liberal Democrats likewise say 8% cuts in military spending are better than anything we might get on our own, so go for it. Slight problem: There's plenty of real work to be done, on the budget, on tax reform, on immigration, climate change and guns. If the politicians failed to come up with some kind of budget deal, the blunt instrument of across-the-board cuts in every area would await. And not only are these forced budget cuts considered acceptable, they're even applauded.
