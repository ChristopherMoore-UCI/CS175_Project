Find the right festival for you One of the best places to start is Jambase.com, an aggregator of all things related to music festivals and concerts. For example, Glastonbury in the UK is held on festival grounds that have been used as such for centuries. I've seen festival experiences come to an early and nightmarish end as a result of irresponsible drug and alcohol use. Since then, I've covered Lollapalooza, Pitchfork Music Festival, moe.down and other summer festivals, acquiring along the way a checklist of sorts that I wish I'd had before embarking on that first one. Musical tastes are pretty diverse these days, as most people enjoy several genres, and festival lineups reflect this.
