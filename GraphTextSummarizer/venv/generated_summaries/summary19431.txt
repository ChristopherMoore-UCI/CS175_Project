"George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardly Love and that during the course of the altercation he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall," Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case. Police were initially called to Love's off-campus Charlottesville apartment by a roommate who reported "a possible alcohol overdose," said Police Chief Tim Longo at the time. "George Huguely only learned that Yeardley Love had died when he was told that by a detective," attorney Rhonda Quagliana told reporters soon after Huguely's arrest. A medical examiner ruled that blunt force trauma killed Love, and authorities allege Huguely caused it during an altercation. Love had "a large bruise on the right side of her face which appears to have been caused by blunt force trauma," according to the document.
