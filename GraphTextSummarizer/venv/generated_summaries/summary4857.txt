An incredible 24-shot exchange ended with Djokovic hitting long and former U.S. Open champion del Potro took advantage to win the next three points, including the second match point, to force the decider. After Djokovic took the first set on a single break of service in the 12th game, eighth seed del Potro hit back to level by claiming his opponent's service for the first time. World No.1 Djokovic needed four hours 43 minutes, the longest men's singles semifinal in the tournament's history, to beat Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro, 7-5 4-6 7-6 6-7 6-3. Del Potro, apparently nursing an injury, had beaten Djokovic in the 2012 London Olympics bronze medal match on Wimbledon grass, and sensed another upset. Del Potro was still not finished and forced a break point, but Djokovic was not to be denied and closed out victory on his third match point with a backhand winner.
