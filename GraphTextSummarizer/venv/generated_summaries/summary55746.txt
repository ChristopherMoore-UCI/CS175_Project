" More than ever, Cornell said, Soundgarden wanted to make an album that was consistent with the aesthetic values he developed from listening to bands as a teenager. -- "I only ever really wanted a break/I've been away for too long," Chris Cornell sings on the new Soundgarden album, "King Animal," out November 13. " Listen to "King Animal" after Superstorm Sandy in New York, for instance, and someone might sense a storm raging in Cornell's wailings and the band's arrangements and complicated time signatures, how the mood darkens and saddens as each song progresses, drawing the listener deeper into tracks such as "Bones of Birds," the ode to nature "Taree," the water-logged "Rowing" and the comfort-seeking "Black Saturday" There is one lyrical reference to Soundgarden's time away from the rock arena, but you won't find any other explicit mentions of the band's breakup or of bygone fame on "King Animal," which Cornell said would be "inappropriate. We have to please each other, because if we like it, Soundgarden fans will love it.
