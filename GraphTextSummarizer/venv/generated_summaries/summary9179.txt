In a Metro-North medical history form from 1999, Rockefeller specifically answered "no" to a question asking whether he had difficulty sleeping, and at no point before the accident did any of his health care providers document a discussion with him regarding sleep problems, according to the NTSB's medical factual report of the investigation. The NTSB's investigation discovered during a post-accident sleep evaluation that William Rockefeller Jr. had "severe obstructive sleep apnea." "My client was fully cooperative with the NTSB investigation, including giving them access to his medical records and doctors," Rockefeller's attorney, Jeffrey Chartier, said Monday. As a result, the sleep specialist prescribed Rockefeller continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as treatment. The accident happened on December 1 when the train of seven cars derailed while traveling from Poughkeepsie, New York, to Grand Central Terminal in New York City.
