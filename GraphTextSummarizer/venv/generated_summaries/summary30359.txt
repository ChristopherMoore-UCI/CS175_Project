It's Rowena and her 5-month-old baby, waiting patiently in line for the latest distribution of relief supplies to arrive in Concepcion. Smoke is drifting along the seafront and flaming bonfires of debris are being fed by a group of local people under the watchful and mischievous eye of Jun Garilva. "Hey Joe," one of them calls in the ubiquitous greeting for white foreigners, which is a throwback to the U.S. military presence here during World War II. Unfailingly polite, always smiling, and ever courteous, she has become a symbol in my mind of the people of Concepcion and their grace under pressure. Leaving the Municipal Hall, I bump into Luna, a native of Concepcion who has come back to help coordinate the civil society response.
