States everywhere are cracking down, but New Jersey lawmakers have been pretty aggressive in recent years about going after texting while driving. "One of the great arguments my colleague made ... was that when you text -- you're the texter -- you are electronically in that car," New Jersey attorney Marc Saperstein told CNN affiliate WPIX. "You have the obligation to keep your eyes on the road, your hands on the wheel and pay attention to what you're doing," he told radio station New Jersey 101.5. -- Three New Jersey judges surprised phone owners everywhere Tuesday with a new message: You don't have to be texting and driving to get in trouble. But the New Jersey judges appear to be saying that texting someone who is driving could make you liable to a civil lawsuit, based on existing laws against distracting a driver.
