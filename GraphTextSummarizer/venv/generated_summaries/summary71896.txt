-- French police arrested 103 Croatian soccer fans Tuesday morning ahead of a match between Paris Saint Germain and Dinamo Zagreb, police officials said, amid fears of possible hooliganism. Those arrested can be held for up to 24 hours because they've breached an order issued by French Interior Minister Manuel Valls on Sunday that banned Dinamo Zagreb fans from coming to Paris, a police statement said. The Croatian fans are in the French capital as their club plays the Paris side in a Champions League match, due to kick off at 8:45 p.m. local time. Clashes broke out Monday night between about 50 supporters of the two clubs near the Place de la Bastille in central Paris, police said. This is not the first time Croatian football fans have been under the spotlight.
