"What we are seeing now more than ever is an increase in the amount of people over 40 looking for flatshares," Matt Hutchkinson from flatmate-finding service Spareroom said. Spareroom says it saw a 20% increase in the number of people looking for roommates in January compared to last year. Websites helping people find their ideal flatmates, such as Spareroom, Flatshare and Roombuddies are booming. In New York City, 2,500 room offers in shared properties were posted on advertising site Craigslist in the first four days of April. UK Census figures show that 15% of people living in London share their homes with people they are not related to.
