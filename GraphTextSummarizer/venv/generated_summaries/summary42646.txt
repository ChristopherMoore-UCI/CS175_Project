But there's another reason some Virginia political watchers are buzzing about the hypothetical: McDonnell's resignation, however unlikely, would elevate his lieutenant governor, Republican Bill Bolling, to the state's highest office. Here's what Virginia's own Republican governor had to say about Ken Cuccinelli ..." Bolling has even left the door open to voting for Cuccinelli's Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe, who, he kindly pointed out, "takes a more pragmatic approach to politics and to governing." And Bolling has made it abundantly clear he has little tolerance for the Republican running to succeed McDonnell -- Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. McDonnell's poll numbers fall as scandal unfolds An exasperated Bolling left the race, and Cuccinelli easily captured the GOP gubernatorial nomination in May with the support of roughly 8,000 delegates who showed up at the Richmond Coliseum to support him (and two other conservatives, attorney general candidate Mark Obenshain and a bombastic pastor named E.W. Jackson, the party's nominee for lieutenant governor). Here's the backstory: Bolling has served as lieutenant governor since 2006, and had long eyed this election year as his moment to make the leap to governor.
