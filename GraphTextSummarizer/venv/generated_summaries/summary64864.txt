A new document by Iran's supreme leader calling for the elimination of Israel shows that world powers must not rush into a deal on the country's nuclear program despite an upcoming deadline, Israel's Prime Minister said Monday. It says the "proper way of eliminating Israel" is for "all the original people of Palestine including Muslims, Christians and Jews wherever they are, whether inside Palestine, in refugee camps in other countries or just anywhere else, take part in a public and organized referendum." Mixed in with tweets insisting that Iran is committed to diplomacy on other issues, Khamenei posted a series of tweets slamming Israel. " While he and other Iranian leaders have spoken similarly of Israel in the past, the one-page document, packed with specific details, was new. " "We still have big differences with Iran's behavior vis-a-vis our allies, them poking and prodding at -- and creating unrest and sponsoring terrorism in the region, around the world, their anti-Israeli rhetoric and behavior," Obama added.
