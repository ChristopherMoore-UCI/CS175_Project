Hernandez suspects Villalobo, a businessman who family members say fought extortion from the gangs, was robbed and died from gunshot wounds. One of the most troubling cases for him came in a week ago: a 13-year-old girl with her throat slit ear to ear. At the morgue in San Pedro Sula, the second largest city in Honduras, a grim new tally greets Dr. Hector Hernandez every morning. Villalobo's aunt says that people in the roughest neighborhoods leave Honduras because they "don't have another option." Hernandez says he believes many families haven't claimed their loved ones' bodies because they believe their family members have migrated. In fact, Hernandez says the mere act of claiming a body or attending a funeral can make people here a target for gang members who stalk the morgue and cemetery looking for their next mark.
