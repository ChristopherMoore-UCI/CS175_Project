I went to the Museum of Fine Arts, where a gorgeous array of clothing by Yves Saint Laurent is on display until September 28. The famous Club Soda hosts concerts of all kinds, with big names like the Dandy Warhols (September 14) and Quebec-based groups like The Lost Fingers (September 6). Forming a picturesque green mound in the background of the city, Mont Royal offers spectacular views of Montreal from above. -- Given Montreal's proximity to substantially-sized American cities -- it's just over five hours driving from Boston, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut -- you might not think Quebec's largest city would be so different than these New England metropolises. Nightlife Rue Crescent is alive at night with bars and clubs, but don't miss Montreal's outdoor music festivals and events in the open air.
