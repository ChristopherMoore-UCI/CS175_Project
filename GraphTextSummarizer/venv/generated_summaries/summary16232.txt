Tony Beam, a Christian radio host in Greenville, gave Romney credit for running a respectable campaign and said that voters who dial into his show are primarily concerned about economic issues, not social ones. A triumph by the former Massachusetts governor in the first-in-the-South primary state has long been considered unthinkable by Republican insiders here, where Romney's northern pedigree and evolving positions on core conservative issues have been viewed with skepticism since his last White House bid in 2008. " State Sen. Tom Davis, a leading conservative voice in the state with close ties to the tea party movement, said Romney's impressive national campaign may be enough to carry him over the finish line in South Carolina. Romney has done more to help himself in the state by displaying a toughness in the presidential debates that have come to define the GOP race, said longtime Republican strategist Warren Tompkins, who advised Romney's 2008 bid. "It's gone even better this election cycle than I thought," said state Rep. Nathan Ballentine, one of only three elected officials here supporting Romney.
