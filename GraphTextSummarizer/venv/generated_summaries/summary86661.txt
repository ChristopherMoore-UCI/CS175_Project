Each  year after that it will cost $10 million  to keep it going, according to Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick. A court ruled in May that  Arpaio's routine handling of people of Latino descent was not tough enforcement of immigration laws, but instead amounted to racial and ethnic profiling. The sheriff's office had a history of targeting vehicles with occupants with darker skin or Latino heritage, scrutinizing them more strictly and detaining them more often, U.S. District Judge Murray Snow ruled. The money will come from the county's general fund, Gerchick said, and it's not clear if cuts are needed in other areas to find the money. Over the next 1Â½ years, the county will have to pay $21,943,107 for the monitor and the retraining, according to county budget records.
