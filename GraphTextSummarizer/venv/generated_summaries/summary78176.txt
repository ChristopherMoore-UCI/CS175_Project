After spending eight weeks in jail, Vega was ordered by Orange County Court Judge Robert Freehill to return the $13,368.48 she gained in gifts and donations while posing as terminally ill. Jessica Vega, 25, pleaded guilty last month to the scheme and was indicted on fraud and grand larceny charges as well as one misdemeanor. -- A New York woman who pretended to have terminal cancer to pay for an extravagant wedding and honeymoon has been ordered to give back thousands of dollars she received from sympathetic donors. "I am pleased that the community members, who felt so compelled to generously help a neighbor in need, will be given back their hard earned money," Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. The man Vega married, who was not named in the indictment, is not facing charges.
