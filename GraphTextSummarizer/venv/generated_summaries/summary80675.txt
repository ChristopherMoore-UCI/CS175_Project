Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47, were arrested Tuesday on suspicion of sexually abusing children. Burrell Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the organization said. Darrel Mohler, the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., is being held in jail in Marion County, Florida, charged with two counts of rape in a Missouri arrest warrant. Burrell Mohler Sr. did go through the group's registered youth worker program, but "his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs," the church said. Ramsey said he and Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, attended college together 50 years ago.
