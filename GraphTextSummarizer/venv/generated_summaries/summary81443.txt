"More training for staff in Haiti, more doctors, more nurses, more treatment centers, more medications, more toilets, more clean water." Since last month, when the outbreak began, the organization known by its acronym of PAHO -- the regional office of the World Health Organization (WHO) -- has distributed enough supplies to treat about 80,000 cases, he said. "We need to plan for up to half of those cases occurring in the next three months because of the explosive nature of this epidemic," the organization's deputy director, Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, told reporters in Washington. In Haiti's North Department, some PAHO staff members and other international staff and medical workers remain confined to their living quarters after civil unrest there this week, Andrus said. The Pan American Health Organization announced Tuesday it is increasing its planning to treat 400,000 cholera cases within the next year, up from a previous estimate of 270,000 over several years, as a result of the outbreak in Haiti. Haiti's public health infrastructure was weak before the outbreak, with 58 percent of the population lacking access to potable water, Andrus said.
