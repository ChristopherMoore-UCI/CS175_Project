The two most powerful Islamist groups in Syria -- the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra -- have spent much of the last year killing each other. ISIS' ability to withstand U.S. and allied strikes and to hold its ground will be decisive in shaping the attitudes of other rebel groups -- including al-Nusra -- as well as al Qaeda central and the al-Assad regime. So it would be a severe blow to al Qaeda if al-Nusra were to fold itself into ISIS. Everyone in al-Nusra in Syria follows the al Qaeda organization." Al-Zawahiri was both humiliated and eclipsed by ISIS' defiance of al Qaeda, appalled by its nihilistic violence and outraged by al-Baghdadi's impudence in declaring himself 'Caliph.'
