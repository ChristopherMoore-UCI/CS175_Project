Shrien Dewani, 34, has denied orchestrating the killing of his wife, Anni, in Cape Town in November 2010. But in August, he was declared fit to stand trial after undergoing psychiatric observation, according to South African media. He avoided extradition to South Africa on mental health grounds during a three-year court battle, but was eventually sent back in April to face trial. Family hoping for answers The victim's family say they are relieved that Dewani is now going on trial in Cape Town. In a plea deal with South African authorities, he said he was paid by Dewani to carry out the murder and to make it look as though the couple were the victims of a carjacking.
