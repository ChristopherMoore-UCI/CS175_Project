At the scene, officers found a gun resting on Gilbert Sr.'s chest, with his left hand covering it, NYPD Chief of Detectives Bob Boyce told reporters. Officers executed a search warrant at the son's apartment and found several pieces of potential evidence: magazine clips, loose rounds, a manufacturer's box of a Glock .40 caliber and a shell casing envelope with the serial number of the gun recovered at the crime scene, according to Boyce. His father, Thomas Gilbert Sr., 70, founded the biotech and health care-focused hedge fund, Wainscott Capital Partners Fund, in 2011. "Something just kaboom, just hit the floor loudly," said Christopher Kelly, who lives below Gilbert Sr.'s apartment, describing what he heard to CNN affiliate WABC. Gilbert Sr.'s Beeckman Place apartment sits on a quiet street that houses several diplomats.
