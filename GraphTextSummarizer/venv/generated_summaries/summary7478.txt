Forbes has previously been trained by Roger, Jeff and Floyd Mayweather Sr, who has been estranged from his world champion son for years, and sparred with Mayweather Jr. "It's more (a problem) with Floyd because he is Roger's boss. Mayweather was furious that his father Roger was training Forbes for a fight which could scupper his own hopes of a lucrative rematch with De La Hoya, who he beat by a split decision last May in the richest fight in boxing history. " Floyd Sr. has trained De la Hoya for all of his recent fights -- except the bout against his son last year -- but has said he might cross that line for the rematch. Forbes moved quickly to hire Jeff Mayweather, Roger's younger brother, after hearing Floyd air his grievances in the media. Floyd Mayweather Jr. was furious that his uncle was training his former sparring partner Steve Forbes.
