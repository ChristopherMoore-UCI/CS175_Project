Hishammuddin also announced Wednesday that Singapore-based engineering and technology company Boustead is "finalizing terms" for an oceanographic survey vessel, ROV and deep sea sonar. The exact search area is yet to be defined, as an international team of experts is reviewing the satellite, radar and other data that led to the conclusion that the plane flew into the southern Indian Ocean. Hopes of closure for the families of those on board were raised in early April, when a search team in the southern Indian Ocean detected pings that were initially believed to have come from the plane's flight recorders. And independent experts are studying the satellite data that have played a key role in guiding the search to see whether they agree with the official analysis that the plane ended up in the southern Indian Ocean. That's how long a private contractor will have to cover a remote area of the Indian Ocean a little smaller than the country of Sri Lanka where officials believe missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 ended up.
