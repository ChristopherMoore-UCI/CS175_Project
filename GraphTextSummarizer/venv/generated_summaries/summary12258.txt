It tends to be patients in palliative care, who are unconscious, which means the doctor can't ask what the patient wants, de Jong said. Palliative and hospice care are common end-of-life treatment alternatives in many countries, including the U.S.A. Its not clear if Santorum was including palliative and hospice care when he said 10% of all deaths in the Netherlands are the result of euthanasia. The candidate claimed that in the Netherlands physicians euthanize elderly Dutch patients against their will to hold down medical costs. The U.S. presidential campaign oddly put euthanasia in the Netherlands into the news limelight in February, after Republican candidate Rick Santorum criticized it to make an argument against socialized medicine. De Jong said she was afraid patients would snow the clinicians at their private practices with euthanasia requests due to the publicity.
