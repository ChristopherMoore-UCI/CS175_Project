"Women in Guatemala are dying as a consequence of the state's failure to protect them," Sebastian Elgueta, Guatemala researcher at Amnesty International, said in a statement. -- Guatemalan authorities must act to stop the high numbers of women being killed in their country and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice, Amnesty International said. The human rights organization Monday urged Guatemala to shore up its fight against impunity and address the more than 685 killings of women reported in 2010 alone. In a speech last year, Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom said his country has made strides in protecting women. On Tuesday, some 60 organizations will march down the principal streets of Guatemala City to commemorate International Women's Day, the state-run AGN news agency reported.
