Collins added that in her committee's hearing last month, it was revealed there have been 64 allegations of sexual misconduct by Secret Service employees over the past five years. The documents were made public while the office investigates reports of sexual misconduct by Secret Service personnel with prostitutes in Colombia ahead of President Barack Obama's visit to the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena this spring. "The vast majority did not involve alleged misconduct by Secret Service agents or officers," said spokesman Edwin Donovan. -- New documents made public this week about possible Secret Service misconduct include allegations of sexual abuse, domestic violence, drunken behavior and guns being accidentally discharged. "None of it is related to our investigation of Secret Service behavior in Cartagena," Hillburg said.
