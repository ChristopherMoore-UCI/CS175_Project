Mars will avoid prosecution if he stays out of trouble for the next year, gets eight hours of drug counseling, does 200 hours of community service and pays a $2,000 fine, according to terms of a deal accepted in court Wednesday. Mars and Monae announced Wednesday they will start touring the United States together in May. -- Singer Bruno Mars appeared in a Las Vegas, Nevada, court Wednesday morning to accept a "deferred adjudication" deal on a drug charge, his lawyer Blair Berk confirmed. The resolution of the singer's legal trouble comes three days after Mars won a Grammy for best male pop vocal performance and received a standing ovation for his onstage Grammy performance with Janelle Monae. Under the "deferred adjudication" agreement of the felony drug charge, the district attorney will not pursue the charge for 12 months as long as Mars complies with terms of their deal, Berk said.
