When outsiders would question Long's leadership, New Birth members would often cite Psalms 105, verse 15: "Touch not my anointed ones, and do my prophets no harm.'' New Birth members leapt to their feet to cheer Long as he vowed to fight the allegations. Long and New Birth are virtually synonymous. On Sunday, New Birth appeared to throw its support behind Long. Walton, the Harvard professor who saw the giant banner of Long behind the pulpit, says Long's stature at New Birth as God's anointed inspires fierce devotion.
