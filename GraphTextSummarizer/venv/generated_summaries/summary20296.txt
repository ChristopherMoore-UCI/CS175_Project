Fast-moving waters washed away small villages in this area, according to community leader Malek Samad. The worst-hit area appears to have been the Sorubi district, located in Kabul province. The water destroyed a hospital and its ambulance, many shops and vehicles, not to mention wiping out hundreds of cattle. -- Flash flooding ravaged areas around Afghanistan's capital, killing more than 70 people and destroying dozens of houses
