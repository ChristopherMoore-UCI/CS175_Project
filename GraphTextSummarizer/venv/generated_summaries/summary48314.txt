The death toll has almost doubled in a month's time; reported deaths in the three countries in mid-June was 350. As of July 12, the cumulative number of Ebola virus cases in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone was at 964, including 603 deaths. In April, the outbreak spread to Conakry, Guinea's capital, and to neighboring countries Liberia and Sierra Leone. High numbers of new Ebola cases and deaths in Africa are prompting increased efforts to contain the deadly outbreak. A coordination center is being established in Conakry, Guinea, where the World Health Organization is sending epidemiologists, communications experts and other support staff.
