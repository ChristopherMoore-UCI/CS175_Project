We will also air a series of stories about the fastest growing form of addiction in America: prescription drugs, from "gateway pills" like Adderall to heavy duty painkillers like Vicodin and Oxycontin. Celebrities and prescription drug addiction We will hear from former addicts about how they turned their lives around, including TV sports anchor Pat O'Brien, who is sitting down with Piers Morgan, and ex-NBA great Chris Herren, who is talking to Brooke Baldwin. In appearances on "Starting Point" with Soledad O'Brien and our daytime "CNN Newsroom" shows, he will examine the latest breakthroughs in the brain science and biology of addiction and how they have given rise to promising new anti-substance abuse drugs. As anyone who has struggled with it or had a loved one who did can tell you, addiction does not discriminate based on talent or fame or wealth or race. Abuse of legal drugs is also an increasing source of accidental deaths, a subject that our medical team plans to follow up on in the coming months.
