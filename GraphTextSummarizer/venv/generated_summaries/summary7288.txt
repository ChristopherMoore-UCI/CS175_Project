Langley, who started the day at five-under-par, dropped all the way to even before recovering to finish the day three-under, where he is now tied for third place with Luke Donald, Billy Hurley III, Bo Van Pelt and Ben Martin. Langley, Donald and Hurley all completed their rounds for the day while Martin and Van Pelt have played through holes four and five respectively. The Belgian was tied for second with 327th-ranked Antonio Lascuna of the Philippines, who finished 90th in the Kuala Lumpur tournament last year. Overnight co-leader Matt Kuchar made double-bogey on holes four and six before play was halted, dropping him down to joint 16th position at one-under-par. The Englishman, a former world No. 1, followed up his opening round of 65 with a 66 to end the day four shots clear of European Ryder Cup teammate Nicolas Colsaerts.
