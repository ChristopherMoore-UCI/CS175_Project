-- You might assume New York is the American capital of income inequality -- what with its multibillion-dollar mayor, its highly paid Wall Street execs and its persistent poverty. But if you compare every county in the United States, Manhattan has only the third-highest estimated level of income inequality. And is one U.S. capital of income inequality. The parish, tucked into the northeastern corner of the state, is the subject of my latest Change the List project because CNN readers voted earlier this summer for me to cover income inequality in the place where it is most extreme. These numbers come from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, which uses a wonky measurement called the Gini Index to measure income inequality.
