35 years of 'Rumours' In 1975, the three remaining members of the group -- the two McVies and drummer Mick Fleetwood -- added guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks. McVie's lush, smoky voice can be heard on many of the band's biggest hits, including "Say You Love Me," "Don't Stop" (trading vocals with Buckingham), and "Think About Me." Fleetwood Mac's success brought with it a number of romantic complications -- the McVies divorced, Buckingham and Nicks split up and Fleetwood had an affair with Nicks -- much of which was alluded to on their records. McVie, 70, became part of Fleetwood Mac after the departure of founding guitarist Peter Green in 1970. The "Rumours" are true: Christine McVie has returned to Fleetwood Mac. "Christine McVie has rejoined Fleetwood Mac and there may be an announcement about a potential tour for all the Macsters down the road," Rosenberg said.
