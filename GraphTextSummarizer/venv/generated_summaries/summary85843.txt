Twitter is now a social publishing and news discussion platform more than anything, and MySpace is attempting to position itself as a destination for young people to discover new music, movies and games. First it announced a new version of the front page that will make it easier to access photos, videos and other information without using other websites or programs. Many of Twitter's users rarely visit the website at all; they instead use desktop software or third-party interfaces on other websites to access their tweets. (Mashable)  -- Twitter's number of monthly unique visitors finally surpassed that of MySpace in August. Both appeal to brands that want to reach new people, but they're very different tools for very different kinds of brands.
