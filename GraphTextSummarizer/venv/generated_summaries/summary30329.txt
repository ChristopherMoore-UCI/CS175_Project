"In situations where there may be several incidents involving a single carrier over a short period of time, FAA inspectors increase their oversight, which we're doing now," FAA spokesman Lynn Lunsford said. On December 22, a Boeing 737 overran a runway amid heavy rain at Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston, Jamaica, injuring 91 passengers. -- The FAA said Friday it is heightening scrutiny of American Airlines after the carrier had three landings go wrong in December. In the December 13 incident, an MD-80 landing at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina touched down and went off the left side of the runway. And on December 24, an MD-80 en route from Chicago, Illinois, struck a wingtip landing in Austin, Texas.
