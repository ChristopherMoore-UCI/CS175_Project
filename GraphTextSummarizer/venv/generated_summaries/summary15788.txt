In 2002, Polgar finally defeated Garry Kasparov, who had previously described her as "talented but not greatly talented,'' explaining that "women by their nature are not exceptional chess players ... not great fighters," in a 1990 interview with The New York Times. She is soft-spoken, modest and very feminine ... " Today, Polgar says that, if it was strange for chess pundits to see a young girl catapulted to the top, it was strange for her too. But I focused on chess," Polgar said. " In chess, women's tournaments are only open to females, but women may compete in tournaments for men. Polgar's father firmly believed that, since chess is a purely mental competition, women ought to be able to perform at the same level as men.
