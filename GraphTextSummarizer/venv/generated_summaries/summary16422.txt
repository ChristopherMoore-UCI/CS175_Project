Fourteen years earlier, a much different Fidel Castro greeted a much different pontiff when thousands were introduced to Pope John Paul II, who made the historic first papal trip to Cuba in 1998. Having been invited by then-President Fidel Castro, John Paul famously urged the country "to open to the world, and the world to open to Cuba. " "There was a kind of love affair between John Paul and Latin America," said CNN Senior Vatican Analyst John Allen. He was greeted upon his arrival by Cuban President Raul Castro and the nation's clergy, including Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega. In Cuba, though John Paul helped warm church-government relations, the nation's ties with religion have remained complicated.
