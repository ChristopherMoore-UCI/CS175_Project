"I was really surprised that there wasn't already a film out about Chavez's life, so that's why I spent the past four years making this and hope the country will join me in celebrating his life and work," Diego Luna said during Tuesday's screening of "Cesar Chavez: An American Hero" in New York. Farm workers here can be fired if they tried collective bargaining," Kennedy said after the "Cesar Chavez" screening. After seeing farm workers harvesting the country's food unable to afford feeding their own families --  let alone the deplorable working conditions they faced --  Chavez decided to act. A national holiday in honor Chavez? To help facilitate that change, Luna and the film's cast -- Michael Pe√±a as Chavez, America Ferrera as his wife, Helen, and Rosario Dawson as labor leader Dolores Huerta -- have been trekking all over the country promoting the film and a petition to make Chavez's birthday on March 31 a national holiday.
