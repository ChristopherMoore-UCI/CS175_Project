Besides Lyme disease, ticks can also transmit other illnesses such as babesiosis and Colorado tick fever. Why you should be afraid of Lyme disease Symptoms Fever, headache, fatigue and a rash called erythema migrans are all typical symptoms of Lyme disease. Lyme disease, which comes from a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common illness spread by ticks in North America and Europe, according to the Mayo Clinic. The CDC recommends wearing insect repellent with at least a 20% DEET concentration and avoiding wooded areas with high grass areas where ticks are most often found. About 300,000 Americans each year are diagnosed with Lyme disease, according to new estimate released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week.
