Those responsible for committing torture in Nepal can no longer assume they are beyond the reach of the law in other countries. -- A Nepalese army colonel will appear in a British court Saturday to face torture charges linked to his alleged actions during his country's civil war, authorities said Kumar Lama, 46, is accused of two counts of torture at an army barracks in the Nepalese Kapilvastu. The victory transformed Nepal from a monarchy to a republic after 239 years of autocratic rule. Nepal summoned the British ambassador in Kathmandu on Friday to protest against the arrest, according to state-run Nepal Television. Nepal has failed to prosecute anyone for torture committed during the civil war in the nearly seven years since it ended, the Human Rights Watch statement said.
