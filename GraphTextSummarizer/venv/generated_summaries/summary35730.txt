On July 16, he said, ISIS blew up a vital bridge connecting Dhuluiya to the predominantly Shiite town of Balad about 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the west. -- A Sunni town north of Baghdad that has been surrounded by ISIS for more than two months came under heavy attack on Monday, local police and residents said. Since June, al-Jibouri said, the southern part of Dhuluiya has been besieged and under constant attack by ISIS. They accused the Iraqi government of a double standard, apparently a reference to the fact that about a week ago, Iraqi troops broke the ISIS siege in the town of Amerli, which is predominantly Shiite. Al-Jibouri said the bridge was a lifeline for the town and even though Balad is a Shiite town, its local officials and residents have supported and assisted residents of Dhuluiya throughout the siege.
