That verdict brought an abrupt end to a six-week trial that drew intense media hype for its elements of family drama and mystery over what happened to young Caylee Anthony. While Anthony was cleared on the more serious charges, the jury of seven women and five men did convict her on four counts of misleading law enforcement agents who were investigating Caylee's whereabouts. They said they wanted the day to be about Caylee and not about Anthony being released from jail. The other involves a search group that wants Anthony to repay expenses they incurred looking for Caylee. Most of those who waved placards in the jail parking lot were there to voice their opposition to Anthony's release, but they did so peacefully.
