-- French President Francois Hollande mourned the deaths of four French soldiers and an Afghan interpreter killed in a suicide bombing and said his plan to withdraw combat forces by year's end will start next month. After he took office last month, Hollande visited French troops in the same region where the soldiers died. " "The decision that I made to accelerate the withdrawal of French combat forces from Afghanistan will begin in July. The bombing occurred in Kapisa province, where most of the 3,300 French troops have been operating in Afghanistan. " French troops deployed under the NATO-led command have been operating in Kapisa province for years.
