-- U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn announced Thursday that he will retire at the end of the current congressional session, ending his six-year term two years early. "As dysfunctional as Washington is these days, change is still possible when 'We the People' get engaged, run for office themselves or make their voices heard. That's how I saw it when I first ran for office in 1994, and that's how I still see it today," he wrote in Thursday's statement. Before his time in the Senate, Coburn served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1995 through 2001, according to a biography on his website. In the meantime, I look forward to finishing this year strong.
