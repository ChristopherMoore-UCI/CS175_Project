When House Republicans moved to impeach him for perjury in 1997 and 1998, Clinton painted his opponents as partisan zealots who were using the constitutional process for crass political ends. On Wednesday, former President Bill Clinton is in the news as he receives a Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama. After Obama won office, Clinton made his peace with the President and in 2012 was one of the most effective advocates for the White House by articulating a powerful critique of Republican economic policies. Understanding that presidential legacies evolve in real time, Clinton has remained a forceful presence in the Democratic Party. Not only does Clinton want to demonstrate his political skills, but he remains devoted to a Democratic Party that is strong and effective -- which in his mind would be the best proof that his term in office helped to revitalize a party that had been politically devastated in the Age of Reagan.
