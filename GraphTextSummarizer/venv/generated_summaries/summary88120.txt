While Romero's heroic transformation from quiet priest to outspoken archbishop is inspiring, he's not the only Catholic killed for speaking out against injustice, oppression and human rights violations during the 12-year civil war in El Salvador. Responding to pleas for help from Romero, Ford left for El Salvador, only to learn about the archbishop's death while en route. But the lack of an official stamp of sainthood has not stopped Catholics from honoring the four churchwomen of El Salvador. Like many Catholics, I applauded the news this week that Pope Francis had formally declared Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero a martyr, paving the way for his beatification, the final step before sainthood. To me, Romero is already a saint, and I am lucky enough to have made a pilgrimage to San Salvador to see the chapel where he was slain while celebrating Mass and to his nearby living quarters, where his blood-stained clothes remain.
