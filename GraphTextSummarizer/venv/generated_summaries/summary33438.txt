-- The judge in the murder case of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin has denied a prosecution's motion for a gag order, but noted the court could reconsider if attorneys in the case write or say anything considered prejudicial. "At this time, there is no demonstrated need to restrict free speech," Seminole County Circuit Judge Kenneth R. Lester wrote. The decision -- which was made public Tuesday -- rejects, among other things, prosecutor concerns over a lack of juror impartiality due to the amount of media coverage surrounding the high-profile case. George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer accused of wrongly killing Martin on February 26, was released last week on $150,000 bail, 10% of which was put up to secure his release while he awaits trial on a second-degree murder charge. Critics have accused him of racially profiling and unjustly killing Martin, though Zimmerman told police that he shot Martin in self-defense.
