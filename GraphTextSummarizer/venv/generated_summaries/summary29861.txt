Americans have many positive memories of Clinton name, given the booming economy of the late 1990s during Bill Clinton's presidency. Bill Clinton was attacked as "slick Willie" by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and Hillary Clinton has faced similar criticism. Although he did relatively well in the final election (with many Americans believing that he did actually defeat George W. Bush) he didn't generate much energy once the campaign started. As she learned in 2008, Bill Clinton is not always easy to control. Hillary Clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election.
