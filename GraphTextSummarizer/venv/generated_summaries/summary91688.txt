U.S. law currently does not allow Guantanamo detainees to be moved to the United States, a provision that has impeded the administration's efforts to close the prison, since detainees cannot be tried in civilian courts or moved to American prisons. "We are very pleased with the progress we have been making," the senior administration official said, adding that the government was appreciative of efforts by foreign governments to accommodate detainees. Amid the firestorm over the decision to release five Guantanamo Bay detainees in exchange for captured American soldier Bowe Bergdahl, the Obama administration is continuing its efforts to close the controversial prison in Cuba. Recent efforts to do so are focusing on the establishment of a Periodic Review Board to intermittently decide whether detainees not currently facing charges can be transferred to their home country or to a third-party country willing to take them. According to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on Thursday, the board ensures that detainees are "regularly getting a fresh look," and getting the chance to have someone hear their case.
