"China's economic success over the last 30 years has been built on cheap capital, cheap labour, cheap energy and cheap land but this has now produced huge imbalances and inefficiencies that are causing more and more problems." "When reforms began 30 years ago, the investment rate was around 25 per cent of GDP and the economy grew at around 10 per cent a year, but now we are investing half of GDP for the same rate of growth; that tells you something about capital efficiency," says Mr Huang of Barclays Capital. Instead, growth will probably be 8 per cent or less, accompanied by persistent price rises -- HSBC predicts average consumer inflation of 5 per cent from 2011 to 2015, compared with 2 per cent from 2001 to 2010. But minimum wages are rising more than 20 per cent a year in many areas, and land is increasingly scarce and expensive. Slowing global demand for cheap Chinese exports, rising production costs and unsustainable levels of debt have combined to crush some of the country's most savvy entrepreneurs.
