"The Iranian government will stop at nothing in its shameless persecution of the Baha'is in Iran," said the commission's chairman, Leonard Leo, in a written statement. Its faculty comprised volunteer professionals who once taught in Iran but lost their jobs after the revolution because they are Baha'is. "It's not enough that authorities already have a policy in place preventing Baha'is from attending Iranian universities -- the government is now systematically trying to dismantle the Baha'i community's internal initiative to ensure that its youth have the opportunity to get an education beyond high school." Baha'i cemeteries, holy places, and community properties are often seized or desecrated," the commission says. The effort is a serious initiative to help Iranian Baha'is gain the right qualifications for trades and professions and the bachelor's degrees issued by the school have been accepted by some Western colleges, the Baha'is say on their website.
