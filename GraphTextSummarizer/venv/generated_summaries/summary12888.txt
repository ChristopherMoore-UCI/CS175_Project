Triesman accuses FIFA members of seeking bribes for votes The Sunday Times also submitted evidence to the UK House of Commons hearing alleging that FIFA vice-president Issa Hayatou of Cameroon and Jacques Anouma from the Ivory Coast were paid by Qatar. It has also asked The Sunday Times newspaper to provide details about further claims that two more FIFA executive committee members were paid $1.5 million to vote for Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup. FIFA has already suspended executive members Amos Adamu and Reynald Temarii following similar accusations ahead of last December's World Cup ballot. FIFA said on Wednesday that its secretary general Jerome Valcke had written to Football Association chairman David Bernstein asking for a complete report from Triesman on the statements that he made as well as "any and all documentary evidence at his disposal in relation to those statements." FIFA has requested evidence from England's Football Association following claims from its former chairman of corruption by four top-level members of world soccer's governing body.
