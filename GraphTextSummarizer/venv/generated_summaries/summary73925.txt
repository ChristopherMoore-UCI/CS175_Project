The American ended on 286 in a group including British Open runner-up Adam Scott of Australia, Masters champion Bubba Watson, 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell and fellow former major winners Geoff Ogilvy and Ben Curtis. Defending champion Keegan Bradley of the U.S. closed with 68 to tie for third with Sweden's Carl Petterson and Englishmen Justin Rose (66) and Ian Poulter (69). McIlroy broke the streak of 16 different winners in the past 16 majors as he followed his third-round 67 with a six-under-par 66, becoming the first player from his country to win the event. Veteran Vijay Singh could not keep up his strong form of the first half of the tournament as the 49-year-old Fijian closed with 77 to tie for 36th along with 1995 winner Phil Mickelson 36th alongside Woods' 2009 conqueror Y.E. Yang of South Korea. And, in similar fashion to his eight-shot victory at last year's U.S. Open, the 23-year-old showed no nerves as he bounced back after struggling in the season's first three majors.
