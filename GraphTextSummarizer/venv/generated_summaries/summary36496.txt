On Thursday word emerged that Gadhafi's pick for U.N. ambassador had defected to Egypt -- a day after Libya's foreign minister fled to London and told the government there that he had resigned. Citing unnamed British government sources, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday that a senior adviser to one of Gadhafi's sons was in London for secret talks with British officials. CIA operatives have been in Libya working with rebel leaders to try to reverse gains by loyalist forces, a U.S. intelligence source said. Koussa did not tell the Libyan government he was planning to quit before he arrived in Britain, Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said Thursday. Misrata, Libya's third largest city and the final rebel stronghold in the western part of the country, was under siege by pro-Gadhafi forces.
