-- Florida prosecutors have offered teenager Kaitlyn Hunt a new plea deal -- one that would keep her out of jail, even if she'd have to admit wrongdoing -- tied to charges she's facing for having sex with a then-14-year-old girl, a state attorney said Wednesday. Sheriff: Case is about age, not gay rights Jim and Laurie Smith have told CNN affiliate WPEC that they twice warned Hunt, who was then 18, to stop. Bruce Colton, state attorney for Florida's 19th judicial circuit, told CNN that his office offered Hunt the latest plea deal in July. Hunt's family says their relationship was consensual, though in Florida a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to give consent to sex. " The case generated buzz when Hunt's family went public on Facebook, detailing their daughter's case and essentially accusing the victim's family of going after their daughter because she is gay.
