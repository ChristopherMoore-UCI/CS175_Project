The 18-year-old Belgian made only his third first-team appearance for City, and could do nothing as goalkeeper Shay Given's reflex save from Rooney's close-range flick hit his arm and fell into the path of Giggs, who made no mistake to put United ahead. -- Carlos Tevez scored twice against his former club as Manchester City claimed  a 2-1 derby triumph over bitter rivals Manchester United in the first leg of the English League Cup semifinal on Tuesday night. Mancini took off the man of the match with just over 10 minutes to play, and City had to hold on as United surged forward in search of a second away goal ahead of the second leg at Old Trafford on Wednesday next week. Veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs put United ahead in the 17th minute at City's Eastlands Stadium with his first goal in a Manchester derby since 1996, but Tevez leveled from the penalty spot three minutes before halftime and headed the winner in the 65th minute. The Argentina forward, who left United in acrimonious circumstances after rejecting a new contract at the end of last season, scored in either half to give new manager Roberto Mancini victory over Alex Ferguson in his first derby in charge.
