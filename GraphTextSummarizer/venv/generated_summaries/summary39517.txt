In a move that drew fire from medical marijuana advocates, federal authorities raided 26 medical marijuana dispensaries in 13 Montana cities, saying they have probable cause to believe that the businesses are involved in large-scale trafficking. " Sherer said, "there is no doubt the raids were times to take advantage of a vulnerable political time for Montana patients." Authorities did not disclose items that were seized pending the filing of search warrant returns in federal court. Reid said he has written Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer and said the issue is now one of states' rights. The search warrants executed Monday are the culmination of an "18-month, multiagency investigation into the drug trafficking activities of criminal enterprises," Michael Cotter, U.S. attorney for the District of Montana, said in a statement Tuesday.
