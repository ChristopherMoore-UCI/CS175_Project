-- While many Western leaders have distanced themselves from the often controversial Winter Olympics, Chinese President Xi Jinping has been an enthusiastic guest in Sochi. "This period of Sino-Russian relations has the strongest foundation, the highest trust, and the greatest regional and global influence," said Xi, according to a transcript provided by Chinese state media. Xi has been eager to demonstrate his commitment to Russia, choosing it as the destination for his symbolic first foreign visit both last year, when he took office, and again this year. "After 30-plus years of reform, China has entered deep water," said Xi. In an exclusive interview with Rossiya, Russia's state news channel, a smiling Xi declared he was "absolutely satisfied" with the development of China-Russia ties.
