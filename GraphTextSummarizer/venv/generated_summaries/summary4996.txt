The remains of a fifth body were located west of Cedar Beach, Long Island, approximately one mile from where the other corpses were discovered in December, according to Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. The four bodies have since been identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut; Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Erie County, New York; Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York; and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine. -- Police say they have discovered more human remains on a Long Island, New York, beach near where the corpses of four women were discovered last year. "There may be clues available now with this body that will help the homicide investigation and will help it move forward," Dormer said. The bodies were found in various stages of decomposition, and at least one could have been there for as long as two years, Dormer said.
