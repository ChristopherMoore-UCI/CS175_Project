Attorney General Eric Holder is endorsing a plan to reduce sentences for certain drug offenses, which he says could reduce the federal prison population by more than 6,500 inmates in five years. Joining with conservative lawmakers and governors, Holder has pushed for reduced reliance on prison for certain nonviolent drug offenders. Holder says penalties would still be tough for violent criminals while finding ways to reduce the costs of the federal prison system. "This overreliance on incarceration is not just financially unsustainable -- it comes with human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate," Holder says in prepared remarks.
