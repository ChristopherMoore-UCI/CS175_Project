The move to strip funding comes after a conservative activist secretly taped a NPR fundraising executive criticizing Tea Party supporters and saying public radio would be better off without federal money. NPR's listeners are largely "wealthy" and "well educated," claimed Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee. Markey argued that many local public stations would not be able to attract a sufficient audience and fundraising base to survive keep without easy access to NPR's signature programs, such as "All Things Considered." Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, circulated a letter to House members earlier in the week citing press reports that he said demonstrated that James O'Keefe -- the conservative activist who set up the taping -- "deceptively edited" the video to target NPR. It would wipe 'Lake Wobegon' right off the map," said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts.
