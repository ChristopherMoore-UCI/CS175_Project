And Vieira, who helped France to World Cup glory on home soil in 1998 -- coming on as a substitute to set up Emmanuel Petit's goal in the shock 3-0 final win over Brazil -- is convinced it will not be too long before an African champion is crowned. Cameroon lacked in that department during its disastrous 2010 campaign, where the "Indomitable Lions" had been expected to do well in the first World Cup held on African soil. The Super Eagles were just two minutes away from becoming only the second African team to reach the last eight at their debut World Cup, but let a 1-0 lead slip against Italy before conceding again in extra-time. Patrick Vieira knows what it takes to win football's greatest prize -- and the former France star believes Africa is close to claiming a historic first World Cup title. and I really hope they will win the World Cup in the near future because I think that will help African football to develop even better, even more," says Vieira, who was born in Senegal but moved to France as an eight-year-old.
