Video: Teen bullied during anti-bullying interview On Christmas break, the police came to her home to tell her that photos of her were sent to "everyone." Every child has to feel safe at school," Clark said in a You Tube video posted Thursday. The video has garnered the attention of many including the premier of British Columbia, Christy Clark. The Canadian teen, her face obscured from the camera, held a stack of cards each filled with messages in black marker. At this point the viewer may have no idea that they are about to be led on the most agonizing journey, one that pushed the premier of British Columbia to issue a stern warning against bullying, a journey that has birthed a Facebook page with thousands of people commenting and many offering condolences.
