-- Call it a case of high tech meeting low tech, really the lowest of tech. Satellites are locating penguin waste, which is easier to find than the penguins themselves British scientists are using pictures from high-powered satellites to pinpoint emperor penguin colonies in Antarctica. "We can't see actual penguins on the satellite maps because the resolution isn't good enough," said mapping expert Peter Fretwell. Now we know exactly where the penguins are, the next step will be to count each colony so we can get a much better picture of population size," said penguin ecologist Phil Trathan. "Using satellite images combined with counts of penguin numbers puts us in a much better position to monitor future population changes over time.
