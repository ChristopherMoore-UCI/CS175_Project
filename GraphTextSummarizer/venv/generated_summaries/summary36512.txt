SKA South Africa project director Bernie Fanaroff said: "It has already attracted a lot of young people into science and mathematics in South Africa and from other African countries and it's attracted a lot of top-rate scientists." "This is a an exciting time for astronomy in Africa," he said, "inspiring young people toward education, having the skills to develop economies on the continent and build infrastructure." Govender added: "When we train an engineer to do a job, they gain the right skills, meaning they can go out and contribute to the country's economy in a number of different ways. While South Africa boasts the best resources on the continent, it is just one of the nations leading the way in the pan-African astronomy drive. Other countries are focusing on training the next generation of astronomers, with the University of Nairobi in Kenya, for example, offering an undergraduate course in astrophysics, designed to train young people to work in observatories. Observatories of all shapes and sizes are scattered across Africa in locations such as Burkina Faso, Namibia, Nigeria and Egypt to name a few.
