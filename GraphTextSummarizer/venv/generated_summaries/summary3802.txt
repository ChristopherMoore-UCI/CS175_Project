Benfica and United are level on nine points, but the Portuguese side will go through as the group winners if they beat Romanian minnows Otelul Galati in their final group game in Lisbon next month. They have a better head-to-head record with United, who must gain at least a point at Swiss side FC Basel to qualify for the last 16. City's illustrious city neighbors Manchester United are also making heavy weather of qualifying from Group C as they were held 2-2 at home by Benfica. But a casual clearance from United goalkeeper David de Gea led to Benfica's equalizer as Bruno Cesar's cross slammed into Rio Ferdinand and fell to Argentina veteran Pablo Aimar, who gratefully accepted the chance. Basel, who beat Otelul Galati 3-2 on Tuesday, will go through with a win over United.
