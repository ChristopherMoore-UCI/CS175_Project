Twenty-five soldiers in the Indian Army are missing, said Army Lt. Col. J.S.Brar. At least 375 people were being treated for injuries at hospitals in the city of Leh, said Officer Farooq Ahmad. The death toll has risen to 112 as a result of flash floods and landslides in a town in northern India, a police official said. The rain came shortly after midnight and took sleeping residents by surprise. The town is nearly 310 miles (500 km) from Srinagar.
