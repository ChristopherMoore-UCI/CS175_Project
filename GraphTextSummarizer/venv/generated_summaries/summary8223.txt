High school teachers were among the first to embrace the idea, realizing students would have to have mastered material before moving levels. Principal Gould is quick to point out that the initial drop in test scores was expected, since many kids were placed in lower levels to make up for gaps in their educations. "Our hope and goal is that when this year's test scores come out and the following year's, that progression will just continue to increase," Gould said, adding that test scores don't paint the whole picture. The move to do away with grade levels throughout the Adams County School District began three years ago. And since school board members are are limited to two four-year term limits, the unanimous support may wane if standardized test scores don't improve.
