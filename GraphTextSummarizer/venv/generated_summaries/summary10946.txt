Perhaps The New York Times' T Magazine should have had Stephen Hawking interview Jaden and Willow Smith. "Every single thing about this Jaden and Willow Smith interview is nuts," Gawker observed. Jaden said he's reading about quantum physics; Willow said she's been immersed in "ancient texts." Willow said she's gotten better at "caring less what everybody else thinks, but also caring less and less about what your own mind thinks, because what your own mind thinks, sometimes, is the thing that makes you sad." Jaden agreed. Jaden has appeared in a handful of movies; Willow had a hit single with "Whip My Hair" in 2010, which came out just before she turned 10.
