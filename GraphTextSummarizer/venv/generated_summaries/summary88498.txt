Chevy's Fresh Mex Chevy's makes a big deal out of the "fresh" in its name, and with good reason -- no cans in the restaurant, fresh salsa blended every hour, fresh avocados smashed every day for guacamole, and watch-them-made tortillas. You shouldn't have to resign yourself to paying for restaurant meals with a future cardiac risk. We love: Chicken & Fruit -- grilled chicken and a garden salad, plus wedges of fresh orange, honeydew, watermelon, and cantaloupe. Its use of trans fats to cook its French fries kept it from landing higher on our list, but the rest of the fried food is trans fat-free. All oils are trans fat-free, and the Mexican-style fare has lots of healthy options including Grilled Fish Tacos.
