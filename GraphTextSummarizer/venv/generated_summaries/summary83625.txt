Compared to developed countries, or even to some major emerging countries, burdened by aging populations, financial crises, widening budget deficits, faltering faith in politics and growing social demands, Africa has become the world's last "New Frontier", a kind of "it-continent". Africa has a vast reservoir of natural resources. However this coincides with a worrying rise in inequality, which deepens the divisions between countries and within them. We must prioritize regional integration; the reduction of inequality between and within countries; the employment of our young people and the governance of our natural resources. In a world of growing food demand, Africa is home to two-thirds of the world's unexploited arable land.
