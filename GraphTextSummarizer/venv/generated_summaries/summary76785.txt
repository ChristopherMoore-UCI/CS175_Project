"We were doing our march as we usually do when women dressed in civilian clothes stopped us," said group member Katia Sonia. She said other members had heard the women were detained as they made their way to the Mass. The Ladies in White have asked to meet with Pope Benedict XVI when he makes his first visit to Cuba in a week. But 52 other women, including group leader Bertha Soler, who did not arrive at the church for Mass, were unaccounted for, Sonia said. Sonia said she recognized the women as state security agents. The organization, "Damas de Blanco" in Spanish, is composed of the family members of Cuban dissidents, many of whom have been jailed.
