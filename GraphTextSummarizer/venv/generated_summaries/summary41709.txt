Also, Sprint ID packs are, of course, available only to Sprint customers, but Android devices are now available on every carrier. Sprint views Sprint ID not just as a service for the packs it decides to offer, but a platform through which others can create and offer their own custom Android skins. Sprint aims to ease the setup process with Sprint ID, a service launched this month for the carrier's new mid-range Android phones. The IT or telecom department of a large company like FedEx or Merrill Lynch might use Sprint ID to deploy an Android skin for its employees that would include access to in-house proprietary tools or information. This may sound limiting to experienced smartphone users, but it's probably a good enough starting point for most beginning Android users, especially if you just got your first-ever phone that goes beyond what a basic feature phone or messaging phone can do.
