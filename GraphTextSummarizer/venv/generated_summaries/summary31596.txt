"I feared there would be problems with a lot of people coming from Somalia to a little town," says Borlange resident Patrik Andersson. He has managed to bring together a team of Somali football players, none of whom had ever skated on ice before, and take them to the Bandy World Championships starting in Russia this weekend. Last May Sweden experienced its worst riots in years following the death of a 69-year-old man who was shot by police earlier while wielding a machete in the Stockholm suburb of Husby, which has a large number of immigrant residents. Somalia's entry is a contest that makes David versus Goliath look like a fair fight, as the novices take on the powerhouses of a sport played between two teams of 11 on an ice rink the size of a football field, using hockey sticks and an orange ball. Why not get them to play the local game, Bandy -- a close relative of ice hockey?
