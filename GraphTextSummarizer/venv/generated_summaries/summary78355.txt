The elder Benigno, an opposition leader, was shot dead upon return from exile in the United States in 1983, as he attempted to lead a movement to push longtime dictator Ferdinand Marcos out of power. But Benigno Aquino already has made some waves, naming a retired Supreme Court chief justice to lead a truth commission that will look for graft and possibly prosecute Arroyo. He is the son of two revered figures in Philippine life, former president Corazon Aquino and her husband, Benigno. Enter the younger Aquino, who like her, sports signature yellow clothing and talks of restoring power to the people. Benigno Aquino III has been sworn in as president, the country's 15th, after winning election in May by a landslide.
