Overall, the number of VA facilities under investigation has expanded to 26, the agency's Office of Inspector General said Tuesday. Separately, Sen. Marco Rubio sought to advance a proposal that would change federal rules to make it easier to fire VA executives. The list in Phoenix was part of an alleged scheme designed by VA managers there who were trying to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans were forced to wait months to see a doctor, according to a recently retired top VA doctor and several high-level sources. At a Senate hearing last week, the inspector general said his investigation so far found a possible 17 deaths of veterans waiting for care in Phoenix but added there was no evidence that excessive waiting was the reason.
