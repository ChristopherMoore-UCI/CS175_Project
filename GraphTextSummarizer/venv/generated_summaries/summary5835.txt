In addition to traditional competitions such as wrestling and kok boru (in which two teams of horsemen try to push a headless goat carcass into a goal), performances and folk games kept crowds active. "Games give powerful impetus to rebirth ... original national sports, spiritual self-awareness and historical memory of nomad nations of the world. " As nomadic peoples have become minorities in modern societies, the six-day games were organized to showcase vanishing traditions and culture. These were just some of the highlights of last week's first-ever World Nomad Games, held near the shores of Lake Issyk-Kul in Cholpon-Ata City, Kyrgyzstan. The games were sponsored by the Kyrgyzstan government.
