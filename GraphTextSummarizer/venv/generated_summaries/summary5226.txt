-- Despite his personal problems, golfer Tiger Woods received another accolade as he was voted PGA player of the year. US Weekly's report followed a National Enquirer article before the crash that the athlete was having an affair with New York nightclub hostess Rachel Uchitel, an assertion she vigorously denied, according to The New York Post. The statement mentioned the six tournaments Woods won in 2009 but made no mention of the infamous car accident and infidelity scandal that pushed the golfer to take an indefinite hiatus from pro golf. "The recognition by [his] peers is one of the highest compliments a PGA Tour member can receive," PGA Commissioner Timothy Finchem said in a press statement Friday. Last week on his Web site, Woods admitted to infidelity and said he was taking a break from golf to focus on his family.
