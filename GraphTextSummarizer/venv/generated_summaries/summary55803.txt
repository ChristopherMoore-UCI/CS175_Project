Arizona GOP rebukes McCain for not being conservative enough Former Sen. Jon Kyl, who represented Arizona in the Senate for three terms and whose own conservative credentials were rarely called into question by Republicans, stood by McCain. Do you remember when McCain got in a rhetoric shoving match with Senate rookie Ted Cruz of Texas? Those who adopted the resolution cited a legislative record that they say is insufficiently conservative on issues such as immigration reform and funding Obamacare. During that tussle with the tea party faction of the Senate, many of the Republican faithful -- both in Arizona and around the country -- made it known that they preferred the confrontational approach on issues such as whether to fund Obamacare. But I've seen McCain surrender before -- to right-wing Republicans in his home state when his political career seems jeopardized.
