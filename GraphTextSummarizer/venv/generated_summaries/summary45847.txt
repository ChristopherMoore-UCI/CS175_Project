However, Bahrain government spokesman Abdul-Aziz al Khalifa told CNN Saturday that al-Khawaja was receiving "the utmost care that is available" and was seen "very recently" by international human rights organizations. The Interior Ministry's general inspector said that "all policies and procedures of the prison facilities in Bahrain meet international human rights standards, and all detainees have consistent and reliable access to professional medical care," according to a statement from Maj. Gen. Tariq H. Al Hasan, a spokesman for the ministry. "Mr. al-Khawaja is in stable care. Abdulhadi al-Khawaja is protesting the life sentence he received for his role in the anti-government unrest that continues to embroil his country. He has been provided the best medical care," al Khalifa said, adding that the hunger striker has been observed around the clock by three doctors -- one, Danish -- for the past three weeks.
