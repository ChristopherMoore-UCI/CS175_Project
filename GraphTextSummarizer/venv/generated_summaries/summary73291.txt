The bike production project did not take off, but the idea of a Cairo to Cape Town bike race did, and in 2003, the first Tour d'Afrique race took place, setting a Guinness World Record for the fastest human-powered crossing of Africa. The Tour d'Afrique Foundation, the company's development arm, has teamed up with many African groups, such as the South Africa-based Happy Africa Foundation, to distribute donated bicycles to students and health workers in several countries. The four-month road trip will take them through nine countries until they reach Cape Town, South Africa, on the continent's southern-most tip. "I wanted to start producing bikes for Africa that would help kickstart development -- sort of like China and India with their bikes," he said. While the tour may provide an opportunity for some to take an adventure in Africa, the group's founders are keen on giving back to local communities by donating bikes to individuals or organizations in the continent, supporting projects that promote bicycle awareness and raising funds for cyclists' favorite charities.
