The player will collect raw materials to make potions that restore health and enhance spell abilities. As the game progresses, Finn discovers the ability to cast new spells, which the player casts using the Move controller. "Sorcery" is now available for the PlayStation 3, and only uses the Move motion controller, navigation controller and Eye camera. Switching spells is quick and very responsive. Players are supposed to aim higher for foes located on a higher level than Finn, but those shots don't seem as consistent as level ones.
