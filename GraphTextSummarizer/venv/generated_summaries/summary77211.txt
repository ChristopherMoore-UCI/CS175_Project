For five years, I've been writing "Maggie & Me," my memoir of surviving Thatcher's 11 years in power. There are more police than mourners -- their backs facing the coffin, not in protest At exactly 10am, and with surprising speed, Maggie's hearse, flanked by half a dozen police on bikes, exits the chapel at Westminster. At 9am on the dot, I find a place right opposite Big Ben near Westminster Abbey. At various points, Maggie turned her back on me but I won't do that to her today.
