Dallas police Saturday said DNA evidence has provided a breakthrough in an investigation of nine sexual assaults in South Dallas this summer. WFAA said a sexual assault was reported near an abandoned store in the same area early Saturday. Police asked for the public's help in locating Van Dralan Dixson, 38, who is named in an arrest warrant for aggravated sexual assault. Dallas police had said officers were "saturating" the area of the attacks and that a task force had been created to investigate the crimes. Police have said a single suspect was believed responsible for attacks on nine victims from June 22 through September 1.
