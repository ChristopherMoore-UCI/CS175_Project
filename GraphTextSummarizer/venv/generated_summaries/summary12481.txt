"Modern people here in Tanzania associate indigenous food with poverty and being poor," says RESEWO founder Freda Chale, referring to the increasing popularity of fast food. By raising awareness into growing indigenous plants, the team hope to get people harnessing these plants as year-round sources of food on their doorstep. The nutritional and medicinal value of indigenous plants is being forgotten across the continent and the slow food foundation now work in over 10,000 gardens in Africa, including RESEWO's headquarters. "We started working with schools to make sure youngsters grow up valuing these vegetables," says Fabia Schundia, a RESEWO founding member. Mussa's school is putting African traditions back on the menu in a new era of indigenous school meals.
