"Providing foreign terrorist groups with material support in any form," wrote Chief Justice John Roberts, "furthers terrorism by straining the United State's relationship with its allies and undermines cooperative efforts between nations to prevent terrorist attacks. The key plaintiff in the appeal is the Humanitarian Law Project, a Los Angeles, California-based non-profit that says its mission is to advocate "for the peaceful resolution of armed conflicts and for worldwide compliance with humanitarian law and human rights law." Groups listed as "foreign terrorist organizations" by the State Department include al Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah. The court also said the law does not extend the ban on material support to domestic groups. The activity in question can be banned only if "coordinated with, or controlled by foreign terrorist groups."
