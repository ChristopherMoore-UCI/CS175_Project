A report from the UK's Financial Services Authority concluded the rate-fixing scandal was of the "utmost seriousness." Between 2005 and 2009, when Diamond was in charge of the investment branch of Barclays bank, traders were influencing the pricing of rates which impact up to $800 trillion of securities. -- Barclays bank took out large UK newspaper ads Saturday to say sorry to "all Barclays customers and clients" in the wake of a rate-rigging scandal which has hammered its reputation. E-mails revealed as part of the rate-fixing investigation showed traders were seeking beneficial rates for their trading positions. Barclays was fined $450 million by British and American regulators last month after admitted some of its trading desks purposely under-reported its interest rates. The scandal involves a lending rate, known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is set every morning by banks posting the rate at which they are willing to borrow with the British Bankers' Association.
