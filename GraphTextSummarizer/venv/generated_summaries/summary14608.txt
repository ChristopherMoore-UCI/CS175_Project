Parents: Amanda Bynes makes 'great strides towards recovery' CNN's Jane Caffrey and Carolyn Sung contributed to this report. The troubled 27-year-old has been released from an inpatient treatment center more than four months after she was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold, attorney Tamar Arminak said. Her parents said in September that Bynes was "making great strides towards recovery" from mental illness. In September, Bynes was moved from UCLA Medical Center to a private facility for "specialized treatment" at the recommendation of "the skilled health care professionals of UCLA," Bynes' parents said in a statement. At the time, the "Easy A" star had several legal troubles, between the alleged DUI and three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment window in May.
