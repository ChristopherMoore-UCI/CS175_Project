His alleged violence towards vulnerable women was so extensive, repeated over so many years, extended beyond sexual violence and perversions, to alleged forced miscarriages, starvation, and other forms of behavioral control. But what is mindboggling in Castro's case is the breadth and depth of sexual violence he is accused of perpetrating against these three women. So besides the concepts of batterers and sociopathy, what is striking in Castro's case is the degree of sexual sadism. Case law records prosecutions of men charged with kidnapping women for hours or days at a time to sexually abuse them. Male batterers often grow up in families fraught with strife, conflict, neglect and violence.
