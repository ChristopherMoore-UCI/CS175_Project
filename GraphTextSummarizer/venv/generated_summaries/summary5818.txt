The council says it prefers stricter legislation for assisted suicide, but it is also giving Parliament a second option for a complete ban on organized assisted suicide. Recent cases have drawn more attention to "suicide tourism," in which people who can't legally seek assisted suicide in their home countries travel to Switzerland, where it is allowed. "The Federal Council firmly believes that, by determining these duties of care, the negative aspects and abuse of organized assisted suicide can be prevented, and 'suicide tourism' can be reduced." Purdy, who has said she wants the option of assisted suicide if her condition deteriorates, wanted to know at what point her husband might be prosecuted if he accompanied her to an assisted suicide clinic. At least 117 Britons have traveled abroad for an assisted suicide since 2002, at an average of two a month, according to Dignity in Dying, which advocates giving terminally ill adults the option of assisted suicide.
