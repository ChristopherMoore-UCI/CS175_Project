And that's how it went for the next hour, the men joking while I tried to breathe and wondered if today was going to be my last day on Earth. After leaving the lodge, I was scheduled to take a puddle jumper to Balmaceda, a town near the lake's opposite shore. When high winds forced the pilot to cancel the flight, the lodge owner patched together a plan B: His wife would drop me off in the closest village, where an acquaintance would pick me up and shuttle me the final four-hour stretch to Balmaceda. They were bomberos, or firemen, they told me, on their way to a conference in Balmaceda. After spending the night with a local family, I made it to Balmaceda the next day.
