Hoffman, who was nominated for Academy Awards four times, won the Oscar for best actor in 2006 for his portrayal of writer Truman Capote in "Capote." In the late morning, friends of one of the greatest actors of his generation began streaming through the bronze doors of the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, the 116-year-old landmark that hosted the funerals of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Lena Horne. Six pallbearers carried Hoffman's coffin into the church's Baroque-style interior, where friends such as Cate Blanchett, Meryl Streep, Louis C.K., ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer and director husband Mike Nichols, Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Brian Dennehy, Michelle Williams and others awaited. " Hoffman's longtime partner, Mimi O'Donnell, held their young daughter atop the church's marble stairs as traffic was momentarily halted on Park Avenue and quiet enveloped the normally bustling thoroughfare. A spokeswoman for the New York medical examiner's office said Wednesday a determination of the cause and manner of Hoffman's death is pending further study, including toxicology reports.
