At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum said the voice service will be free and begin rolling out to users within the next few months. -- WhatsApp, the globally popular texting app that Facebook just acquired for a whopping $19 billion, is adding phone calls to its list of services. It has 40 million users in India and another 38 million in Brazil, two countries highly coveted by tech companies such as Facebook for their large populations and emerging mobile customer base. Currently, WhatsApp offers unlimited text and voice-mail messages between users. Voice service will come first to Apple devices and Google's Android operating system, with Windows phones and Blackberry to follow.
