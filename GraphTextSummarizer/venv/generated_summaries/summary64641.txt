-- After learning what was going on across the nation in regulating food and drink, especially the edict by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg banning large sugary drinks, I could clearly see we needed a way to prevent government from placing additional regulation on small business owners in Mississippi. The ideas for restrictions are endless: limiting the size of soft drinks, requiring calories to be posted, prohibiting toys in kids' meals, prohibiting fast food restaurants in certain neighborhoods, and more. Many men and women have worked long hard hours just to make a living, and adding additional regulations and costs could simply force them out of business. If the market demands healthier choices, then business owners will meet the need. A judge has invalidated Bloomberg's ban on sugary drinks bigger than 16 ounces, which is a good move.
