"The characters have to be a little bigger than life, but it's a fun challenge, and the essence of the characters is still there," said Carl Jones, former executive producer of "The Boondocks" on Adult Swim, who serves as the director and an executive producer for "Black Dynamite." "Obviously, with a cartoon, you can do more things than you can do in live action," Jones said. The new "Black Dynamite" is still set in the 1970s, but the 10-episode cartoon series is more like "Shaft" than a sendup of blaxpoitation, said Michael Jai White, who supplies Black Dynamite's voice and serves as a producer. As in the film, the polyester pants suit-garbed Black Dynamite is a former CIA agent, a lover and a kung fu fighter. In another episode, a parody of "King Kong," Black Dynamite goes after an albino ape that scaled the iconic Watts Towers in Los Angeles. To parody the cheap, hastily produced blaxploitation films, "Black Dynamite" actors intentionally chewed up scenery or performed awkwardly.
