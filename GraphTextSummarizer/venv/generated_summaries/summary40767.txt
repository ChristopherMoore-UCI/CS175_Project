"Kate expectations," declared popular British tabloid, The Sun, with an article detailing the treatment that Catherine, 30, was receiving for hyperemesis gravidarum, a condition that causes more severe nausea and vomiting than typical morning sickness. The Times also led with news of Catherine's hospital dash, splashing a picture across its front page of a concerned William leaving London's King Edward VII hospital last night. UK tabloid the Daily Express, in a "royal souvenir special" edition, ran a piece speculating that it was more likely that Catherine was carrying a girl, or twins, citing research that linked those outcomes to morning sickness. The revelation that Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, was pregnant came after she was admitted to hospital in London on Monday afternoon suffering acute morning sickness. The paper's Sarah Lyall observed that "speculation began virtually the moment Kate Middleton said 'I will' to Prince William in April 2011, leaving an industry of tabloid newspapers and gossip magazines with a big black hole where their wedding coverage used to be." Lyall said those who had previously -- and incorrectly -- guessed something was afoot because Catherine was drinking water instead of wine at some official dinner could now finally claim to be right.
