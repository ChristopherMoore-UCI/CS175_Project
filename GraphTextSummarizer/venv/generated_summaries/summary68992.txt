"Most physicians would say that the reason blood pressure is so important is that higher levels of blood pressure cause kidney disease, and kidney disease cause higher levels blood pressure, and there's a vicious circle," he said. Although doctors have blamed hypertension for causing common forms of kidney disease in African-Americans, new research shows that high blood pressure may not be the chief cause. It is still important for people to treat hypertension, which can speed up the weakening of kidneys in people with kidney disease, Freedman said. Many kidney doctors had theorized that African-Americans developed kidney disease more often than whites because they might not get to see their doctors as often, had more severe high blood pressure and faced other environmental stressors, Freedman said. Genetic screening would be most useful for people who have close relatives on dialysis, meaning they are at high risk, or individuals who want to donate kidneys, he said.
