CNN Exclusive: How Paul Ryan sharpens debate skills Second, Biden is a more erratic performer than Ryan and so more likely to make a blunder. With millions of dollars spent on negative ads and the Internet awash with silly stories about dogs on cars and old speeches, it's nice to know that uninterrupted, rational debate spread over just 90 minutes can still make such an impact in contemporary American democracy. A good drinking game to play during the debate would be to take a shot every time Biden says "literally," another if he mispronounces someone's name, and another if he forgets Paul Ryan's. Hence, Biden vs. Ryan is worth tuning in to. Biden vs. Ryan is far from Lincoln vs. Douglas, but the spirit lives on.
