Ordinary people in Burma feel betrayed by India and they see China as backing the generals." Thailand, another Myanmar neighbor, buys about 30 percent of its gas from Myanmar, estimated to have been worth $3.3 billion in 2008. China is building pipelines to ship oil and gas from Myanmar to Yunnan province and is Myanmar's second-largest trading partner -- it is keen to tap Myanmar's mineral, timber and other natural resources needed for its booming economy, analysts say India also has been investing in Myanmar's power sector as it looks to secure future energy supplies. Maung Zarni, a research fellow on Myanmar at the London School of Economics, told CNN: "China and India both have a serious influence on Burma... both provide billions of inward investment into the country and they are dealing with a junta that is not accountable to anyone, and that serves the interests of Chinese and Indian investors." But according to Debbie Stothard, of the Thailand-based Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma, the competition between India and China serves only to stymie the cause of democracy in Myanmar. Many regional observers say that the generals of the Myanmar military junta, who have remained largely isolationist for 50 years, are more likely to listen to and accept pressure from China and India than either the West, the U.N. or ASEAN, the political and economic organization.
