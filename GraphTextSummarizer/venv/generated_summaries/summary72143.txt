The "Nothing Compares 2 U" singer, 45, announced her split from fourth husband, Barry Herridge, on Monday, 18 days after the two tied the knot in a well-planned December 8 drive-through wedding in Las Vegas. " In addition, O'Connor owns up in the interview that she went on a frantic hunt for cannabis on their wedding night. Now, O'Connor tells Britain's Sun tabloid, "I don't think I will even date anyone." "We ended up in a cab in some place that was quite dangerous," O'Connor is quoted as telling the Sun. It was going to be a coffin for both of us, and I saw him crushed," she says of Herridge, 38.
