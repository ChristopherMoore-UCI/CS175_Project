sites show acceptable chemical levels in water Elected officials have been reluctant to take on industries that contribute millions of dollars to political campaigns and also employ tens of thousands of people in the state, which is dependent on these high-risk, high-reward industries. The federal government has also failed to protect West Virginia residents from deadly chemical and coal accidents. Manchin said, however, that he would push for legislation that would require inspections of chemical tanks near water. Neil Berch, an associate professor of political science at West Virginia University, said the latest incident raises the same debate that followed past chemical spills -- as well as questions about the erosion of mountains from mining and deadly accidents relating to coal, including the Massey Energy Upper Branch Mine explosion of 2010, whicht killed 29 miners. Local West Virginia officials are signaling that more oversight is necessary and numerous local and federal investigations have been launched.
