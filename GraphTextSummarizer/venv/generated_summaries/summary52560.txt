If trends come in cycles, maybe it's time to bring Miranda Priestly, Andrea Sachs, and the "clackers" at Runway magazine out of the fashion closet. Weisberger has written three novels since "The Devil Wears Prada," but this is her first return to the cutthroat world of Runway magazine. Andy is now editing The Plunge, the hottest bridal magazine around, alongside Emily, her one-time Runway nemesis turned current BFF. "Revenge Wears Prada" picks up eight years after Andy parted ways with Miranda on bad terms. The novel -- a roman Ã  clef partly based on Weisberger's own experience as second assistant to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour -- told the story of Andrea "Andy" Sachs, an aspiring journalist dealing with the increasingly unreasonable demands of her fashion editrix boss Miranda Priestly.
