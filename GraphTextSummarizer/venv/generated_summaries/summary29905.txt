Reports of shark sightings have gone up off the coast of Massachusetts in recent years, especially around areas where seals congregate. "This conclusion was reached after examination of the injuries and testimony from (the victim)," said Reginald Zimmerman, a spokesman for the office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. Great white sharks range from 12 to 21 feet and weigh nearly 3 tons. "Apparently I was the only one on Cape Cod who hadn't heard of the shark sightings," Myers told CNN's Piers Morgan on Tuesday night. Myers has a cast on his left leg because his tendons were severed and 47 stitches on his right leg, where the teeth of the shark left several puncture wounds.
