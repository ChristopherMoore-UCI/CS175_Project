In his weekly radio address Sunday, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg detailed the city's relief and rebuilding efforts, including the Rapid Repairs program, which sends teams of inspectors, electricians, carpenters and contractors building-to-building to identify repairs needed, help building owners make repairs and get them reimbursed by the federal government for repair work. In New York state alone, Sandy inflicted about a $30 billion "economic loss," Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. More than 369,000 people in New Jersey, New York, and Connecticut have registered for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which will total more than $455 million, FEMA said. Gas rationing continues in New York City and Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties. "After two weeks of the recovery phase, we've achieved a new normal for life in post-Hurricane Sandy New Jersey," Gov. Chris Christie said of his state.
