But the Arizona charity said Tuesday that their snub netted much more than what Wal-Mart had offered after an outpouring of local donations came from those concerned about the store's effect on union jobs and small businesses. According to a 2008 study by West Virginia University economics professor Russell Sobel, Wal-Mart has had no real impact on the number of small businesses in the United States. The local spate coincided with Black Friday demonstrations at Wal-Mart stores over pay, schedules and health care. " "Since 2009, Wal-Mart has donated more than $345,000 to local Tucson organizations that are supporting the community's needs," it said. Casa Maria Free Kitchen, a Tucson-based food bank, rejected a $1,000 donation from Wal-Mart, joining a chorus of voices demanding better pay, fairer work schedules and affordable health care.
