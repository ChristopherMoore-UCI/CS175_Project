But while America's first black Supreme Court justice, the first African-American Oscar winner and the U.S. military's first African-American pilots are well known, you may never have heard of Walter Morris or his role in American history. "You could walk down the street in the main post exchange area and in the summer the door would be open and you could look in and see white soldiers and prisoners of war from Germany sitting at the same table drinking, smoking," Morris said. Morris was the sergeant for a unit of black soldiers at Fort Benning, Georgia. "They didn't think colored soldiers had the intestinal fortitude to jump out of a plane in flight," Morris remembered. But by the time he left the Army, Morris would become the first "colored" man ever to earn the U.S. Army Airborne Parachutist Badge.
