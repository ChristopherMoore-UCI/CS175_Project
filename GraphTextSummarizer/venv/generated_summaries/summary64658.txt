It just felt like the perfect mesh of the kind of movie I wanted to do, and getting to do it with funny women. Feig: Katie (Dippold, the screenwriter) was originally inspired by movies like "Running Scared," where these guys riding around with hot girls on the back of their mopeds -- thinking: 'That's not fair, why can't women have that kind of life?' Feig: I wanted to do a follow-up to "Bridesmaids" in the same tone that allowed me to do the same style of comedy I wanted to do, and I wanted to work with funny women again. Review: 'The Heat' CNN: Every so often, someone (most recently, Jerry Lewis) will make a statement that women cannot or should not do comedy. We didn't want women acting like guys.
