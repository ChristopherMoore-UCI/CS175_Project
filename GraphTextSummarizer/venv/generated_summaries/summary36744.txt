Obama's "core coalition" won't defeat ISIS without Mideast nation White House lawyers must determine whether a plan to go after ISIS further, which could include airstrikes on targets inside Syria, would require a vote in Congress. President Barack Obama told congressional leaders on Tuesday he has the authority to carry out his planned strategy against ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria without authorization from legislators, but he asked for their support to show the nation was united. The White House said it's continuing to seek a "buy-in" from Congress on any plan to defeat ISIS, though officials say that doesn't necessarily mean a vote on military action. Obama launched the current air campaign against ISIS in Iraq, which has included more than 100 strikes against the militants, without specific approval from Congress beyond the President's power to protect American interests abroad and help alleviate humanitarian situations. "If this is going to be a prolonged fight against ISIS, it seems to me that there is no way to avoid coming to the Congress for an authorization for the use of military force, which comes before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee," said Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the Democratic chairman of that panel.
