That's why Mitt was the last in 16 years of Republican governors for stereotypically liberal Massachusetts. In July of 2005, he penned an op-ed in the Boston Globe saying that his "convictions have evolved and deepened during my time as governor" -- the once staunch defender of a woman's right to choose began describing himself as "firmly pro-life" just in time to hit the national conservative circuit. In contrast, Mitt was MIA from Massachusetts much of the time when he was governor. Under Rudy's leadership in New York City, crime and welfare rolls were cut in half, ahead of national trends. The plan wasn't just a signature achievement, it was considered a political asset in running to succeed President George W. Bush.
