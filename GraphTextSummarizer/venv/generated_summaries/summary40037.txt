-- The images of Neda Agha Soltan's death on the streets of Tehran transformed her into an icon for Iran's opposition movement. While Iran has charged prison officials with torturing to death some of those detained after the demonstrations, no one has been charged in any of the deaths during the protests. But very few know of Ramin Ramezani, who was killed five days before Neda during last year's post-election demonstrations in the Iranian capital. Zahra Ramezani said she called Ramin's cell phone every hour but no one answered. " Human rights groups say around 80 people were killed during Iran's 2009 post-election protests, while Iran's government puts the number at about half of that.
