The controversial legislation, often called DOMA, defines marriage for federal purposes as unions only between a man and woman, and excludes same-sex unions, even those valid under state law. In court documents filed Tuesday, New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman challenged the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. My office will fight every day to defend the fundamental guarantee of equal protection under law for all New Yorkers." In a statement from his office Tuesday, he said, "The State of New York has long recognized out-of-state, same-sex marriages, and the enactment of the Marriage Equality Act further cements our state's position on this critical civil rights issue. He goes on to say that the law is an "improper intrusion on the traditional role of states in defining marriage."
