The Virgin Group has gone on to grow very succesful businesses in sectors ranging from mobile telephony, to transportation, travel, financial services, leisure, music, holidays, publishing and retailing. The equity of Virgin Music Group -- record labels, music publishing and recording studios -- was sold to THORN EMI in 1992 in a $1 billion deal. The next move was into the music industry, setting up Virgin as a music retailer and then branching out into music production. Conceived in 1970 by Richard Branson, the company started out with a magazine four years before that, which Branson began while still at school. The first recording was the 1973 smash "Tubular Bells," by Mike Oldfield.
