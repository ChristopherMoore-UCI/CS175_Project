El Ni単o, characterized by warmer water in the equatorial Pacific, increases strong wind shear in the Atlantic, which reduces the intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes and prevents other systems from becoming powerful enough to be named storms. "We are currently seeing strong trade winds and wind shear over the tropical Atlantic, and NOAA's climate models predict these conditions will persist, in part because of El Ni単o," said Gerry Bell, NOAA's lead hurricane season forecaster. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season runs from May 15 through November 30. -- How will El Ni単o affect hurricane season? "El Ni単o decreases the vertical wind shear over the eastern tropical Pacific, favoring more and stronger tropical storms and hurricanes," Bell said.
