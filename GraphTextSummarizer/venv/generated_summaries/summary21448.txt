The International Crisis Group last month said that the "failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a genuinely representative political system in Baghdad risks turning Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle. Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. "The country is at a crossroads," said Martin Kobler, U.N. special representative in Iraq. A total of 712 people died and 1,633 more sustained injuries "in acts of terrorism and acts of violence," the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq said. -- More people died violently in Iraq in April than in any other month in nearly five years, the United Nations said Thursday.
