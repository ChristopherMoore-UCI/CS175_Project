When shown the email during the course of the investigation, Coach Payton stated that it referred to a 'bounty' on Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers." A statement last week from the NFL on the website NFL.com added that the violations "were compounded by the failure of Coach Payton to supervise the players and coaches and his affirmative decision starting in 2010 (a) not to inquire into the facts concerning the pay-for-performance/bounty program even though he was aware of the league's inquiries both in 2010 and 2012; (b) to falsely deny that the program existed; (c) to encourage the false denials by instructing assistants to 'make sure our ducks are in a row;' and (d) to ignore instructions from the league office and club ownership to ensure that no such program existed." "When interviewed in 2012, Sean Payton claimed to be entirely unaware of the program, a claim contradicted by others," the statement said. " An NFL investigation found the team had an "active bounty program" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons in which "bounty" payments were given to players for hits that hurt opposing players and knocked them out of the game. The NFL found evidence that bounties were put out on quarterbacks Brett Favre of the Minnesota Vikings, Cam Newton of the Carolina Panthers, Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers, and Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals. Meanwhile, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday he's focusing on punishments for players.
