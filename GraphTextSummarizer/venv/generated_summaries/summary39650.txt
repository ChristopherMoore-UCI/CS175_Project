The 28-year-old German, who won the Monaco Grand Prix earlier this season from pole, edged out the Red Bull pair of Mark Webber and three-time defending champion Sebastian Vettel in the second session at Silverstone. Rosberg's time of one minute 32.248 seconds edged out Webber, who earlier this week announced he would be quitting Red Bull and F1 at the end of the season. Mercedes occupied their usual position at the top of the practice time sheets Friday as Nico Rosberg recorded the quickest lap head of this weekend's British Grand Prix. Webber has claimed podium positions in his last four races on the track and once again showed his liking for its high speed straights and corners. His Mercedes teammate and crowd favorite Lewis Hamilton claimed the fifth best time in drying conditions after morning rain had rendered the first runs largely irrelevant.
