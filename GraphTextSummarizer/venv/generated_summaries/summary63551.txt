The killing spree, which officials said took place late Saturday into early Sunday, is one of the nation's worst since the end of the civil war in 1996. Authorities have blamed the killings on the Zetas Mexican drug cartel, which has been linked before to the Kaibiles. President Alvaro Colom said Tuesday that the former members of the Kaibiles, as the military group is known, had a hand in the massacre that led to a state of siege being declared in the province of Peten. He was picked up on a triple murder charge related to the mass killings in Peten, officials said. The woman said the group that attacked the farm consisted of more than 50 armed men in fatigues, who had Mexican accents.
