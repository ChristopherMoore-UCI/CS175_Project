In a news release issued Thursday, the day the legislation was introduced, Farnese said that "it gives Philadelphia's law enforcement community an important new tool that will help curb gun violence and keep illegal weapons out of the hands of criminals. In the midst of intense national gun debate, lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a tougher gun law -- but only for the city of Philadelphia. It also will require training for many first-time gun owners and bans some individuals with mental health issues from gun ownership. In Maryland, the legislation includes a ban on assault-style weapons and sets a 10-round limit for gun magazines. The proposal was made on the same day that neighboring Connecticut and Maryland passed sweeping gun legislation.
