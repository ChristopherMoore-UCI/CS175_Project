-- A fire broke out Wednesday night on Alabama's Mobile River after two barges loaded with natural gas exploded not far from where a once listless Carnival cruise ship was docked, authorities said. The Mobile Fire-Rescue Department, on its official Twitter feed, reported that it had "units on the scene on east side of Mobile River where a fuel barge has exploded and is on fire." Three people who were burned were transported to a local hospital, fire department spokesman Steve Huffman told CNN. The Triumph has been based at the BAE Shipyard in the Port of Mobile since an engine fire in February left it crippled and adrift in the Gulf of Mexico with more than 4,200 people aboard. A 1-mile safety zone has been set up around the barges, U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr.
