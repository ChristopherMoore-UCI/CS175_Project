Investigation a 33-year long roller coaster ride After attending high school in the Camden, New Jersey, area, Hernandez moved to Manhattan at the age of 18, sharing an apartment in the city's SoHo neighborhood with his older sister. Case 'awakened' America But district attorney spokeswoman Erin Duggan said Wednesday's indictment was "the outcome of a lengthy and deliberative process, involving months of factual investigation and legal analysis." "We believe the evidence that Mr. Hernandez killed Etan Patz to be credible and persuasive, and that his statements are not the product of any mental illness," she said. He then took a job as a stock clerk at a corner convenience store in Lower Manhattan for about a month before returning to his mother's south Jersey home in the summer of 1979, according to family members and police. Describing Hernandez as having been a quiet young man, relatives say his demeanor changed upon his return to New Jersey. Though his whereabouts after 1979 remain murky, family members say he at one point returned to New York.
