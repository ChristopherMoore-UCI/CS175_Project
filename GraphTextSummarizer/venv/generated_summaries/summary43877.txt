The 10 missionaries, including group leader Laura Silsby, were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association. Conviction on the kidnapping charge would carry a maximum penalty of life in prison; the criminal association charge would carry a penalty of three to nine years, according to a former justice minister. Coq told CNN he had been hired by Eric Thompson, husband of Carla Thompson, one of the arrested missionaries, on behalf of the families. "I know that they have been looking at other lawyers," said Phyllis Allison, mother of one of those detained, Jim Allen. The Americans were turned back a week ago as they tried to take the children across the border into the Dominican Republic without proper documentation.
