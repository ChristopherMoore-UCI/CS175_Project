Now, according to Sitko, who wrote about her meeting for World Vision, Nway can talk a little about her loss. A year later, many fields remain unplanted; supplies are short, and the lack of drinking water complicates recovery efforts, World Food Programme officials say. Nway doesn't know, though, where she would attend school as she gets older, Sitko said. Pam Sitko, the aid worker, said Nway -- like thousands of people in Myanmar -- is slowly recovering one year after Nargis demolished their country. "After all of her pain and loss, she really is a spunky girl," said Sitko, who works with World Vision International, a humanitarian group.
