And I'm certain that black woman are described with more adjectives than anyone on the planet: Black woman, African-American, bossy, strong black woman, articulate black woman, working mother, black entrepreneur, black single mother, straight ally, LGBT-friendly, divorcee, feminist, liberal and now even black-ish woman. Black people were forefathers of this nation: slaves, soldiers, scholars and dedicated women and men who helped create these United States of America. It took a few minutes to calm down and understand that in Latin America, La Negrita is a term of endearment, a compliment meaning something closer to beautiful black woman. "I bet your country would never have a holiday honoring black women," a friend in Costa Rica joked one day, when I asked her why everyone was celebrating. No matter what label the world may choose to describe me, one thing I never doubt is that I am a strong black American woman, whose heart beats with the African and Caribbean blood of my ancestors.
