Smith was accused of trying to help Gabriel's mother, Elizabeth Johnson, wrangle custody of the boy from his father, in order to adopt the little boy herself. -- An Arizona jury found Tammi Smith guilty of forgery and conspiracy to interfere with custody Thursday in the 2009 disappearance of 8-month-old Gabriel Johnson, whose whereabouts remain unknown. She later told police she handed over the child under Smith's direction, and prosecutors said Smith falsely wrote the name of her cousin on a paternity document as Gabriel's possible father. Johnson is still awaiting trial on charges of kidnapping, custodial interference and child abuse. Smith maintained she did not know where the child was, and that she had nothing to do with the couple who supposedly received Gabriel.
