The shootings happened at 3:30 p.m. at the Arapaho station in Richardson, Texas, according to DART spokesman Mark Ball. Richardson Police spokesman Kevin Perlich told reporters during a press conference at the scene. The DART officer received non-life threatening gunshots to her bulletproof vest and her arm, Ball said. "A DART female officer had been alerted by a bus operator about an issue with a customer, so she went to the station to meet the bus," Ball said. A shooting suspect and one of three people he shot Tuesday at a Dallas Area Rapid Transit station just north of Dallas have died of their wounds, officials said.
