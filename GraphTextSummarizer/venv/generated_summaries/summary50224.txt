"Suburban residents saw the number of jobs within a typical commute distance drop by 7%, more than twice the decline experienced by the typical city resident (3%)," Elizabeth Kneebone and Natalie Holmes wrote in the study's summary. A new study from the Brookings Institution says the number of jobs within a typical commute distance for residents in major metro areas of the U.S. fell by 7% between 2000 and 2012. To foster growth that is truly regional in its reach and that does not exacerbate inequality or leave low-income and minority residents behind, communities will need to coordinate and collaborate as they plan and implement policy decisions that affect metropolitan development patterns." Tuesday's New York Times was filled with letters complaining about a subway fare increase and crowds at all hours in the New York system. The Brookings study comes as metro areas are coping with increased stresses on infrastructure.
