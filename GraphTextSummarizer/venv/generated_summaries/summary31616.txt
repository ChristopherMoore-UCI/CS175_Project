-- Environmental activists have declared an early success at the start of their annual high seas showdown with Japanese whalers in Antarctic waters. Each year, environmental groups like Sea Shepherd pursue the Japanese hunters in an attempt to disrupt the whaling. Sea Shepherd said Monday that the Japanese fleet's harpoon ships are "separated by hundreds of miles." The anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd Australia said its ships had split up the Japanese fleet in the Southern Ocean and chased it out of the main Antarctic zone. But Japanese authorities say the hunt is still on.
