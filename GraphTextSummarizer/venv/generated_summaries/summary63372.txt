The commission compared its findings in the Guatemala research with similar research that involved intentionally exposing inmates in Terre Haute, Indiana, to gonorrhea in 1943. The research reaffirms much of what is already publicly known: that between 1946 and 1948, U.S. researchers intentionally infected non-consenting subjects in Guatemala with STDs, in what the commission called a "clearly unethical historical injustice." -- A U.S. presidential commission has uncovered more details regarding human experiments conducted by American researchers in Guatemala in the 1940s in which the subjects were exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. Research with human subjects is a sacred trust. Among the commission's findings was that many of the same researchers in Terre Haute were also involved in the Guatemala research.
