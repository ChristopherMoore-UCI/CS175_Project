The court decision clears the way for Scott's administration to focus on projects other than high-speed rail, the governor's spokesman, Brian Burgess said. "I know that states across America are enthusiastic about receiving additional support to help bring America's high-speed rail network to life and deliver all its economic benefits to their citizens," LaHood said after speaking with Scott on Friday. " But LaHood said the funds were specifically allocated for high-speed rail and can't be switched to other projects. Scott has said that he believes there would be a greater long-term benefit to the state if the money were used for other infrastructure projects. -- The Florida Supreme Court ruled Friday that Gov. Rick Scott can reject $2.4 billion in federal money that would have funded a proposed high-speed rail system in the state.
