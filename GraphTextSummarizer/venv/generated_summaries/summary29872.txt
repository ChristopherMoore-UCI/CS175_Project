-- Violent crime in the United States declined 6% last year, according to statistics compiled by the FBI and released Monday. In non-violent crimes, the FBI said property crime declined 2.7%. In other violent crime categories, aggravated assaults were down 4.1%, rape declined 5%, and robbery dropped 10%. The FBI compiles the figures from about 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the country, but does not provide explanations for changes in levels of crime. Criminologists anticipated the continued decline after preliminary figures for the first half of 2010 were released this spring, showing a 5.5% drop in violent incidents reported to police.
