Since last week's Boston Marathon bombing, some people have called for placing more surveillance cameras in America's cities. History has shown repeatedly that broad government surveillance powers inevitably get abused, whether by the Gestapo, the Stasi, or our own FBI, which engaged in unlawful surveillance (and blackmail) of "dangerous" people like Martin Luther King Jr. Should we trade off the cost of human police (or schools, or roads, or lower taxes) for even more robotic surveillance eyes? It is to Davis' great credit that as police commissioner he didn't want a police state. Police on every corner might be one thing, but police who can instantly see your identity papers and constantly track you are another.
