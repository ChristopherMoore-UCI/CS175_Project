Thomas's foundation stepped in, buying Noah several knee devices -- a new one for each new leg he needs as he grows. Thomas was rushed to a hospital where he spent the next two weeks -- undergoing several surgeries on what was left of his legs and, along the way, discovering what would become his life's work. Noah Parton, 6, got prosthetics from foundation started by Jordan Thomas, right. While there, Thomas visited other amputees. That's especially tough on child amputees, who will outgrow several limbs before adulthood.
