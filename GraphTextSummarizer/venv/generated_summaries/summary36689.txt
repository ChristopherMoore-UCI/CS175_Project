-- One of India's most prolific writers, novelist Anita Desai proves to be a "Global Connection" herself. I see India as in so many segments of time and experience -- the India (Old Delhi) I grew up in and went to school and university in, then the India (New Delhi) to which I returned as an adult with young children, trying hard to replicate the India I had once known but in a changed landscape. Born in Mussoorie, India, the novelist, short-story writer and children's author is the daughter of a Bengali father and German mother. CNN: How has India changed in your lifetime? CNN: What does India mean to you? Anita Desai: I may think of myself, after so much travel and so many dislocations, as "stateless" but the truth is that wherever I am, I am Indian, and wherever I go, I carry India with me.
