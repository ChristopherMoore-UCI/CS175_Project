-- Russian President Dmitri Medvedev launched a technology tour of California Wednesday morning, visiting Cisco Systems for the company's announcement of a $1 billion investment in Russian projects, and sending his first Twitter message. He's also scheduled to meet at a coffee shop with Russians working in Silicon Valley and then deliver a speech to Stanford University students. "Greetings to everyone, I'm at Twitter and this is my first message," the Russian leader tweeted from Twitter headquarters in San Francisco. Medvedev also posted a photograph of the "view outside my hotel window" in San Francisco and another of himself greeting Twitter employees from the new @KremlinRussia account. But at Cisco Systems headquarters in San Jose, Medvedev's visit was serious business.
