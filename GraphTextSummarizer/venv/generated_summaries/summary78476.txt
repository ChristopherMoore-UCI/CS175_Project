The biggest haircut of the year Even halfway around the world in Madrid, Jennifer Aniston set American beauty, fashion, and entertainment press on fire when she debuted her new above-the-shoulders haircut during a press call for Just Go With It in late February. The bride emerged in a custom Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress that is forever etched into the memories of millions. The actress hit the red carpet on her Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 press tour in July in chic cropped hair and a series of dramatic designer looks by Oscar de la Renta, Rafael Lopez and Bottega Veneta (shown). Alexander McQueen breaks records The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in New York houses a fashion exhibition every spring, and this year the late British designer Alexander McQueen was its subject. The 400-piece line made its debut at the opening of a Missoni for Target pop-up shop in New York, but the store had to shut down almost immediately because it completely sold out.
