The gunman who killed at least two people and then himself in an office building in southern California is a 48-year-old man from the nearby town of Norco, authorities said Saturday. Those slain Friday were Henry Serrano, 56, of Walnut, California; and Robert Lindsay, 53, of Chino, California, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said. " Two nearby schools, Walnut Elementary School and Olive Middle School in Irwindale, went into lockdown during the incident, said Laura LaTurno with the Baldwin Park superintendent's office. The victims were employees from Southern California Edison, as was the gunman, the company said in a statement Saturday. "This is one of the most horrible days in our company's history," Ted Craver, chairman and CEO of Southern California Edison, said in a written statement Friday.
