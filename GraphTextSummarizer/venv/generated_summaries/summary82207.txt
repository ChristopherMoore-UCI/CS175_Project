Dr. Kao isn't expecting fall allergies in his home state, South Carolina, to be very bad -- a welcome change. Although the South suffers from weed and mold spore allergies in the fall, Gerald Kress, an executive with SDI Health, which operates Pollen.com, says the North and Northeast gets hit particularly hard by ragweed -- and 2009 is shaping up to be a banner year for ragweed pollen. Kress expects the number of people suffering from autumn airborne allergies to increase between 2 and 5 percent over last year. In 2008, Greensboro had higher-than-average pollen counts, its residents were taking more allergy medications, and the city didn't have enough allergists for its population, according to the report. The list is an annual research project that identifies the 100 most challenging places to live in the U.S. with allergies.
