"It is truly a miracle of God that she is with us today," Police Chief Jerry Dyer said. "We beat the odds today," Dyer said, adding that often abduction victims aren't found until it is too late. She was taken to a hospital for an examination, Dyer told reporters, initially saying the girl was "frightened" and "traumatized" but in good condition. The vehicle was described as being a late 1970s or early 1980s model Ford or Chevy pickup, either dark brown or reddish-brown in color, Dyer said earlier. Police had received a report shortly before the incident of a man with a similar description and vehicle exposing himself to young girls nearby, the chief said.
