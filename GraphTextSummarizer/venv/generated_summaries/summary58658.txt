When I was writing a profile of Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau for the Times, I went to City Hall to interview Koch about him, because they had been close political allies for many years. Unlike so many other politicians who never discussed sexual orientation in public, Koch had the longest and strongest pro-gay rights record of any public official of his generation, dating all the way back to 1962, when he first called for the repeal of the New York state law prohibiting sodomy. And whenever I told Koch that someone had asked me for a political favor, he said, 'Tell them to forget it!'" One afternoon, many years after he had left City Hall and long after I was reporting on him, I received a frantic phone call from a family friend. When Edward Irving Koch died early Friday morning in a New York hospital at  age  88, it had been almost a quarter of a century since he had left office. When he took office, the city was a violent place, teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, and he and New York Gov. Hugh Carey did more than anyone else to revive it.
