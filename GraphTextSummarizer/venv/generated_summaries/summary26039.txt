But what do actual socialists think about Obama? " Why socialists hate Obama's health care bill Those who call Obama a socialist, though, point to his policies.

Quagliaroli was not persuaded by the arguments of other socialist leaders who reject the idea that Obama is a socialist. Social Security, Medicare, unemployment benefits -- all reflect socialistic values, says Van Gosse, an associate professor of history at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who has researched socialist movements in the United States and Latin America.
