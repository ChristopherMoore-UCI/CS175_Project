The Navy issued a statement Saturday, saying, in part, "production of videos, like the ones produced four to five years ago on USS Enterprise and now being written about in the Virginian-Pilot, were not acceptable then and are still not acceptable in today's Navy. When the videos first came to light the "leadership" of the Enterprise was "directed" to make certain future videos were appropriate, the Navy said. The paper also posted a link to some of the material, but edited it so that expletives were censored and some identities of junior Navy crew were disguised. The Pentagon said Tuesday that Defense Secretary Robert Gates knows about the bawdy videos but is leaving the fate of Honors up to senior Navy leaders. The Navy will also investigate the role other senior officers played in the video scandal, Adm. John Harvey, commander of the U.S. Fleet Forces Command, said.
