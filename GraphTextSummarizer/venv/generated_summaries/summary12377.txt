"I would suspect that on every dive we've ever been on, we've probably run across something no one's ever seen," says Alvin expedition leader Bruce Strickrott. He adds that Alvin played a crucial part in demonstrating that hydrothermal vents in the ocean are capable of sustaining living organisms. Alvin also made an exploratory survey of RMS Titanic in 1986 and investigated the aftermath of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill and associated environmental implications. "From a scientific standpoint, Alvin was instrumental in bringing people to the hydrothermal sites and finding life, particularly down by the Galapagos in the '70s," he says. "From the late '60s and on into the '70s, Alvin was starting to ramp up as a tool and when they took people down to the vents and they were able to see life down there, I think that's when its value really took off.
