Opinion: Keystone XL pipeline makes sense Perhaps most serious, the State Department report fails to take into account the actions needed to prevent catastrophic climate change. The CEO of major tar sands producer Cenovus admitted that his company's plan to triple production in coming years was contingent on more pipeline capacity. Below that price, the report actually finds that Keystone does make a difference in driving tar sands production and greater carbon pollution. The desperate push over this pipeline shows how badly tar sands producers need Keystone XL. That's not possible if we maintain the status quo, much less bring online more and exceedingly dirty sources of fuel such as tar sands oil.
