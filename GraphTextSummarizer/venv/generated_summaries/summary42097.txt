Hanson's art is on display at the Aloft Hotel in Kansas. That summer, Hanson started selling his note cards along with his mom's baked goods at the foot of their driveway in Overland Park, Kansas. " "Everyone who hears his story and who sees his work finds their own hearts changed," said Adam Hamilton, senior pastor for the United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kansas. By the end of the summer, Hanson had raised $15,000, which he gave to charity. To learn more about Hanson and his art, visit his website at JeffreyOwenHanson.com.
