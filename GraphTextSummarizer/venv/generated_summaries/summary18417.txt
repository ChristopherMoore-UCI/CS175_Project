-- As Spain struggles with its economic problems, business owners such as Manuel Rodriguez are hoping the country's new conservative government will push through pre-election promises for corporate tax breaks and cutting red tape. Manuel Rodriguez, who heads a century-old family business, Guitarras Manuel Rodriguez and Sons, says he hopes the new leader is aggressive in implementing economic reforms. His business, which manufactures Spanish classical guitars, has survived Spain's recent economic pain while other competitors have had to close. Rodriguez believes his chances of surviving the tough climate are being dented by the country's high business taxes and rigid labor laws. Rodriguez wants to hire again -- Spain has 21.5% unemployment, with 45% among youth -- but says the country's corporate regulations need to be overhauled to enable this.
