President Bashar al-Assad's regime, in statements and through official media, has routinely insisted that "armed terrorist groups" are to blame for the bloodshed. The result is jarring: a world forced to watch as Syrian security forces appear to continually broaden their wrath, with international initiative after initiative faltering in their efforts to resolve the crisis. Many of the young boys and girls came home traumatized, their nails pulled out by Syrian security forces. They became the first citizens believed to have broadcast their own destruction, live via social media.
