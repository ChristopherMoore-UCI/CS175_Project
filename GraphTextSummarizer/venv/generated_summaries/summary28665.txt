-- Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the world's longest-serving monarch, celebrated his 84th birthday Monday, giving the Southeast Asian country some much-needed cheer after months of devastating flooding nationwide. Last week, Human Rights Watch urged the amendment of Thailand's lese majeste laws after 61-year-old Ampon Tangnoppakul was sentenced to 20 years in prison for sending four SMS text messages considered offensive to the Queen and the monarchy -- a case that also drew the concern of the European Union. "The severity of penalties being meted out for lese majeste offenses in Thailand is shocking," said Human Rights Watch's Asia Director, Brad Adams on the HRW web site. But talk about the future role of the monarchy -- most especially if it's deemed less than supportive -- has been hampered by Thailand's lese majeste laws, which ban criticism of the monarchy. The U.N. Special Rapporteur has recommended the amendment of Thailand's lese majeste laws.
