-- Myanmar's ruling junta announced Wednesday a new election law that disqualifies pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from participating in upcoming national elections. "We are also troubled the law appears to bar National League of Democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi from running. Suu Kyi, the face of democracy in Myanmar, also known as Burma, was placed under house arrest in 1989. The United States considers Myanmar's military regime repressive for cracking down on political opponents, the most prominent of whom is Suu Kyi. "Instead of passing laws that strip away more of their rights, the Myanmar authorities should immediately release all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi, and remove restrictions on their political activity."
