The man accused of being the ringleader of the alleged coup plot, Albert Matapo, was arrested in 2007, as were six other suspects: Nyasha Zivuku, Oncemore Mazivahona, Emmanuel Marara, Patson Mupfure, Shingirai Mutemachani and Rangarirai Maziofa. -- Zimbabwe's High Court ordered the immediate release Tuesday of six former army officers accused of plotting to topple President Robert Mugabe. They were accused of plotting to violently topple Mugabe and replace him with the country's defense minister, Emerson Mnangagwa. In July, the High Court dismissed the case because the alleged coup plotters had not been brought to court for trial within six months, as required by law. The defendants appealed to the High Court to throw out the re-indictment.
