"When I first got into neonatology the most common problem -- and still the most common problem -- that we take care of is premature babies or babies with respiratory distress," said neonatology director Dr. John Buchheit, a 17-year veteran at Children's. Last year, the hospital created a wing of private rooms that is quieter, darker and easier to control for the massive influx of babies suffering from drug withdrawal. As a result, the number of babies born with NAS at East Tennessee Children's Hospital doubled from 2010 to 2011. State caseworkers are called in to handle the worst cases of babies suffering from NAS. In the meantime, the hospital has become a pioneer in the treatment of babies with NAS.
