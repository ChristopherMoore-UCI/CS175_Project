Senegal could have had more goals to show for their superiority in the first half, but striker Kalidou Yero wasted several chances and Oman keeper Omar Al Abri saved from Sadio Mane and Moussa Konate. And as Oman committed more numbers to attack, Senegal settled the result on the counterattack when Sane escaped down the right and shot past Al Abri. Waleed Al Saadi had a shot deflected behind and Mohammed Al Balushi shot narrowly wide from the resulting corner. -- Senegal claimed the 16th and final place in the Olympic men's soccer tournament after a 2-0 win over Oman in Monday's playoff in England. Senegal finished fourth in the African Under-23 Championship to qualify for the playoff, while Oman won a three-team Asian tournament.
