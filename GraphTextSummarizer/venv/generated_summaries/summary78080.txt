Any such unexpected policy changes may have significant impact on businesses, and are interpreted as one of the biggest risk factors of doing business in China. This competitive weapon piggybacks on another factor: Chinese customers are the most active online shoppers in the world, shopping an average of 8.4 times online each month, far outpacing American customers, who shop 5.2 times. That Alibaba is a Chinese company has important implications and begs the question: Will China become the next Silicon Valley, a breeding ground for the next generation of technology giants? Home to a huge number of factories, manufacturers, suppliers and customers, China is also called the "World's Factory." Because of the reasons above, I don't believe it is realistic to compare China to Silicon Valley.
