There is still money in Donetsk, once a relatively prosperous city built on manufacturing and steel. On the southern fringes of Donetsk, in the shadow of a huge steel plant, a cacophony of barking overwhelms the dull thud of artillery fire. Some people in Donetsk are traveling to nearby government-held cities like Mariupol to try to register for their pensions, but such trips bring risk and expense. Inside the office block, a puppy -- mostly black Labrador - is recovering from a broken leg and shrapnel wound. Now, like the people of Donetsk, they hardly notice them.
