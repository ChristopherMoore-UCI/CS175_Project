-- Wright County Egg, one of two Iowa farms at the center of this past summer's salmonella outbreak and massive egg recall, won federal approval Tuesday to sell to consumers eggs produced at two henhouses. "The agency will work with Wright County Egg officials to assure appropriate steps are taken before permitting resumption of shipping to the shell egg market from other houses and farms. In the summer, the FDA found what it termed "deplorable" conditions at Wright County Egg after the company conducted a nationwide voluntary recall of shell eggs that it had shipped since May 19, 2010. " Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Hampton, Iowa, have worked to correct problems so that they could again ship shell eggs directly to the table. "During the outbreak, I said that FDA would not agree to the sale of eggs to consumers from Wright County Egg until we had confidence that they could be shipped and consumed safely," said Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg in a statement.
