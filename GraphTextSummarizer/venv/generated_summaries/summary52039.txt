Lamb-Creasey says the message came from a Facebook account under the name "Misty Hancock" that featured an image of Atlanta rapper T.I. as its profile picture. On Facebook, users can message other users who are not their friends. Anna Lamb-Creasey says it took several weeks to find a message from Clayton County police telling her to call them. Clayton County police did not immediately return a message Tuesday seeking comment. They told WSB they had tried reaching Lamb's family in more conventional ways, including visiting several physical addresses, but were unsuccessful.
