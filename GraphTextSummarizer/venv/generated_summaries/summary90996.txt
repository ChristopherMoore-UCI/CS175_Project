-- A Bahrain court sentenced prominent activist Nabeel Rajab to three years in prison "for participating in illegal rallies and gatherings," a government spokesman said Thursday. Rajab already was serving a three-month sentence for posting a Twitter message critical of Bahrain's prime minister last month, his lawyer, Mohammed Al-Jishi, said. " "Like many others in Bahrain, Nabeel Rajab is a prisoner of conscience, jailed solely for peacefully exercising his right to freedom of expression and assembly," Sahraoui said. "Rajab's participation in these marches and provocation of his supporters have led to severe acts of violence; including fueled rioting, road blocking, arson, acts of sabotage targeting public and private properties, the use of petrol bombs and IEDs, amongst others," said a statement from the president's office of the Kingdom of Bahrain. "The only reason for targeting Rajab is to prevent him from continuing his legitimate and peaceful human rights work," the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said in a statement Thursday.
