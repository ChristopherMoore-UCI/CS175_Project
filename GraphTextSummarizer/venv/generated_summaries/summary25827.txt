Francis said the cross represents God's response to evil in the world and that the answer to evil "is the cross of Christ -- a word which is love, mercy, forgiveness." "Christians must respond to evil with good, taking the cross upon themselves as Jesus did," Francis said at a nighttime ceremony marking the Stations of the Cross, also known as Way of the Cross or Via Crucis, at Rome's Colosseum. -- Pope Francis marked his first Good Friday as the head of the Roman Catholic Church, asking the faithful to follow Jesus' lead. Francis already has repeatedly veered from tradition -- from the white papal robes he wore on the Vatican balcony the night of his election, to his choosing to ask for the crowd to pray for him first before he offered a blessing of his own. The Vatican Press Office responded Friday to "questions and concerns" related to the pope's washing the young offenders' feet, especially those of two females, calling it a "simple and spontaneous gesture of love, affection, forgiveness and mercy.
