Acevedo was arrested after a friend helped facilitate his surrender in the parking lot of a convenience store in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, according to New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. "While we knew it was a snowy evening and the defendant was speeding, our investigation has developed additional information concerning the nature of Mr. Acevedo's conduct leading up to the fatal crash," said District Attorney Charles J. Hynes. -- The suspect in a hit-and-run crash that killed a Brooklyn couple and their baby has now been charged with second-degree vehicular manslaughter, the Kings County District Attorney's office announced Tuesday. Julio Acevedo, 44, was indicted last week, accused of hitting a livery cab carrying Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21, on March 3. According to police, Raizy Glauber was pregnant, and the couple's son was delivered prematurely by cesarean but died the next day.
