but that doesn't mean Woods won't still be a talking point in Masters week. The Asian invasion Adam Scott became the first Australian to win the Masters last year but how long will it be before the first Asian winner of golf's most prestigious prize? It was the second time the Spaniard had triumphed at Augusta, having won the Masters in 1994. Matsuyama won the leading amateur prize on his Augusta debut as a 19-year-old in 2011 and already has a top-five finish on this season's PGA Tour. Whether it is clips of his famous chip-in back in 2005, or reams of column inches detailing his four Masters wins, Tiger's absence certainly doesn't mean he'll be absent from the debate.
