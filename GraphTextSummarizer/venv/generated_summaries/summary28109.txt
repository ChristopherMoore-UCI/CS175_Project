"This is just the beginning, and al Qaeda attacks will spread quickly in March. Experts warn that al Qaeda is planning to conduct powerful attacks in six Yemeni provinces. Air raids on militant positions since the attack have left at least 42 militants dead in Abyan province, security officials said. The militants seized large amounts of weaponry -- including rocket launchers, mortars, armored vehicles and tanks -- and appeared to have had help from within the security apparatus, according to Yemeni officials. Meanwhile, U.S. trainers are helping the Yemeni government in its effort to retake al-Kowd, the town in Abyan closest to the military base where Sunday's attack occurred, two Yemeni security officials said.
