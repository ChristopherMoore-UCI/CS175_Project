Calling Medicaid and Medicare "wildly successful programs," Brinkley said that the Republican Party has been trying roll them back for decades. It would radically overhaul Medicare and Medicaid while lowering top tax rates. Should familiar yet costly "essentials" -- entitlements like Medicare, the nation's health insurance program for seniors, and Medicaid, which provides health insurance for the nation's poor -- be phased out or dramatically overhauled? President Obama on Wednesday laid out his plan for long-term deficit reduction, renewing his call for ending the Bush-era tax cuts for families making more than $250,000 while strengthening Medicare and Medicaid. Ornstein also criticized calls for dramatic overhauls of Medicaid and Medicare, especially as seen in the Ryan plan.
