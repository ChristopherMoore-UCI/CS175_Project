However, Google's share may be even bigger, possibly up to 8 to 12 percent, if you account for traffic offloaded by Google Global Cache deployments, Arbor Networks' Craig Labovitz claims. The number is even more incredible if you consider that internet traffic is growing at a staggering 40 to 45 percent each year, and Google is still gaining market share. Now, only one global ISP handles more traffic, and a lot of that traffic is Google's traffic, anyway. According to online security company Arbor Networks, Google now represents an average 6.4 percent of all internet traffic. This is a new record for Google, as it gained more than 1 percent of all internet traffic share since January.
