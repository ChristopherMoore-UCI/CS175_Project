The 146 pilots and flight attendants filed suit in Tokyo District Court on the first anniversary of JAL's filing for bankruptcy protection. " The airline's chairman, Kazuo Inamori, said Wednesday JAL had a "bright outlook." "We all have worked hard to reduce costs and, as you know, we have achieved a financial result far exceeding the rehabilitation plan," the 78-year-old chairman said. "We will depart from the past and create a new JAL," airline president Masaru Onishi said, expressing JAL's "gratitude for the chance given to us a year ago." "In that sense, we have a bright outlook for JAL's reconstruction," he said after a visit to maintenance crews working on a jumbo jet. "We decided to employ the logo design using JAL's original trademark crane motif to symbolize our determination returning to the challenging spirit we had at the foundation of this company," said Onishi.
