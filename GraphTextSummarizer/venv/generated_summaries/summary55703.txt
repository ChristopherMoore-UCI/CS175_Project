The collapse Tuesday at the University of Technology Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology construction project happened two weeks after union officials shut the site down over concerns about diesel fuel leaking from the crane, the Morning Herald reported, citing union official Brian Parker. It was not immediately clear if that reported leak had anything to do with Tuesday's collapse, but firefighters believed diesel fuel was involved in the fire, the Morning Herald cited Turner as saying. The worker steering the crane escaped down a ladder as it burned overhead, The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported, citing acting Fire Superintendent Josh Turner. No one was injured in the Tuesday morning incident, crane operator Lend Lease said. The fire and collapse drew hundreds of gawkers onto the streets to record the incident with cell phone cameras.
