Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested after a break-in was reported to police. Meanwhile, authorities in Cambridge announced they have created a panel to advise police on racial issues as a result of Gates' arrest. The woman who made the 911 call that led to the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. never referred to black suspects when she called authorities for what she thought was a potential break-in. Obama last week first said police "acted stupidly" in arresting Gates after he presented identification that showed he lived in the home. "We see ourselves as America's classroom." Speaking to CNN by phone, Murphy said she was trying to clear Whalen's name after she's come under attack by bloggers and in chat rooms, accused of racial profiling when she first called police.
