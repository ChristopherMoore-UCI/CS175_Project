Al Jazeera English managing editor Al Anstey called for the charges to be dropped, saying the allegations were "unjust and unacceptable. In addition to Greste, British journalists Sue Turton and Dominic Kane and Dutch journalist Rena Netjes were named on the charge sheet, according to Al Jazeera. The eight Al Jazeera journalists include three -- Australian Peter Greste, and Eygptians Baher Mohamed and Mohamed Fahmy -- who have been held by authorities since December 29, the network said in a written statement. Of the other Al Jazeera employees named, Al Jazeera identified them only as Egyptian producers and engineers working for the network in Doha, "all of whom refute the charges against them," the statement said. Egyptian authorities have served Al Jazeera with a charge sheet that identifies eight of its staff on a list of 20 people -- all believed to be journalists -- for allegedly conspiring with a terrorist group, the network said Wednesday.
