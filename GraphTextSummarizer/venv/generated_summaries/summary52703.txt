The higher-end restaurants and bars (including a new wine bar), some of the pools, and a VIP roof bar with panoramic ocean views and private outdoor Jacuzzi tubs are reserved for Grand Oasis guests. Pro: Like other Sandos resorts, this one is eco conscious: The spa resort: Grand Sirenis Riviera Maya To say the Spa Grand Sirenis is tech-forward is an understatement. Soaring down highway 307 from the Cancun airport to the Riviera Maya is like peeling away stress palm tree by palm tree. Con: Some upscale restaurants and several pool areas aren't accessible to guests staying in the less expensive Iberostar hotels, including this one.
