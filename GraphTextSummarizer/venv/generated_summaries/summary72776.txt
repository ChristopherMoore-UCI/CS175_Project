Smallholder farming spells big business From the economic side, opportunities for smallholder farmers are exponential. Smallholder farming, a term used for small scale or family farming, is in fact the best way to describe 500 million farms globally where two billion people live and work. "When we talk about smallholder farmers, we are talking about the farmer who owns one to five acres of land, using rudimentary means of farming, who is not able to easily access finance," says Olok. In southern Sudan, Rabha Elis Bandas, director and founder of the Women's Development Group, decided to take matters in her own hands after she was tired of watching local farmers suffer waiting for food aid during Sudan's civil war. "All evidence in small scale farming, family farming on small plots of land, show it is one of the surest ways to relieve poverty," says Stoddart.
