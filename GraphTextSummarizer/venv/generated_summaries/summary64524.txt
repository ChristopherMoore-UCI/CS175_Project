After setting a Guinness World Record for noise at an outdoor stadium in September, CenturyLink Field went seismic during Monday Night Football, registering as an earthquake at a recording station about a block from the stadium. In the magnitude 1-to-2 range, according to John Vidale, a professor at the University of Washington and the director of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. Vidale said his staff recorded five separate seismic events during Seattle's 34-7 pasting of New Orleans -- a match-up of two of the NFL's top teams. Seattle fans did this once before. The most intense episode came late in the first quarter, when Seahawks defensive lineman Michael Bennett returned a Saints fumble 22 yards for a touchdown. In 2011, a Marshawn Lynch touchdown shook the earthquake recording station too.
