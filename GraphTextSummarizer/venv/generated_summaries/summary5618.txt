In her lavishly illustrated new book, Globes: 400 years of exploration, navigation, and power, Sumira traces the history and making of globes and showcases dozens of fine examples drawn largely from the collection of the British Library. Even the typography and colors of a globe are indicative of the time and place of its origin, says Sylvia Sumira, a London-based conservator of ancient globes. There are records of globes being brought on ships during the age of exploration, but they probably weren't used for navigation, Sumira says. In the book, she writes that in the 17th century, globes were sold as "handsome objects of status and prestige to a comfortable merchant class." Not that ancient globes don't convey some useful information. Contrary to the popular misconception that nobody knew the Earth was round before Columbus, the ancient Greeks described the making of globes (in verse, no less) in the third century B.C.
