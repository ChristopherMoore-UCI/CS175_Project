Watch answers to swine flu questions » Through a partnership with the community medicine program at La Universidad Autónoma de Guadalajara, the 3½ -year-old foundation trains local health care workers who are chosen by villagers and arms them with medical kits and medicines so they can take care of their own. But the founder and CEO of the Arizona-based Tia Foundation, a nonprofit that strives to bring health care solutions and strategies to rural Mexico, can think of no more important time -- what with the swine flu scare -- to take the journey. The Tia Foundation -- "tia" means aunt in Spanish -- targets the poorest of villages, places that generally lack basic health care facilities, not to mention vehicles to get to hospitals hours away, and where the people, often unschooled and malnourished, are more susceptible to disease, Libman said. Kathy McCraine, a freelance journalist and photographer, saw evidence of this when she traveled in 2007 and 2008 to Mexico to write a story for Thunderbird Magazine, a publication for alumni of the Thunderbird School of Global Management, which Libman attended in Glendale, Arizona.
