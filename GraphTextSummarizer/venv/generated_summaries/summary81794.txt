There's reason to believe that some pieces were spared, according to Qais Hussain Rashid, the director general of Iraqi museums at the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism. Also, reports began to surface about a month ago that ISIS militants were burning thousands of books and manuscripts from museums, libraries and universities in Mosul. The Prime Minister's comments came after a video was released by ISIS purporting to show militants smashing and shattering pieces at a museum in Mosul. During the reopening of the Baghdad Museum on Saturday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi made one thing clear: The artwork that epitomizes Iraq's culture and history will not be wiped away by anyone or anything, including ISIS. If the reports of book burnings are confirmed, the U.N. cultural agency said, "this would be one of the most devastating acts of destruction of library collections in human history.
