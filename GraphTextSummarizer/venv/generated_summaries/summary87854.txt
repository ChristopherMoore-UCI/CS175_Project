In neighboring Yobe state on Sunday, gunmen on motorcycles stormed a mosque in Gumsa village during prayers and abducted the local chief, residents said. They also burned a local traders market, several homes and a church, said residents who survived the Sunday attack on the remote Christian village of Daku in the district of Askira Uba. "The gunmen looted food items and money left by traders while fleeing the attack," eyewitness and resident Andrew Musa said of Sunday's violence. "The gunmen burned the police station and a telecommunications mast in the village before fleeing into the bush with the chief," resident Kaka Bunu said. Nearly 20 suspected Boko Haram gunmen opened fire on market vendors in Nigeria, killing 15 people in Borno state, witnesses say.
