They do it because they want to honor black people, they want to take in black culture and expression, and they can't do so without putting on blackface. Whether it is the original white "Amos and Andy" or white fraternity/sorority girls and boys, blackface is always about mocking black skin and presenting stereotypical black behavior. No one then or now who uses blackface cops to saying, "I intend to dehumanize black people." So whether it's racist caricatures on Mexican stamps or Australian doctors, the signs and symbols of demeaning black people are universal. The message: Real black people aren't good enough at being themselves.
