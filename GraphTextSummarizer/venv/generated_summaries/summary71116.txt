" Next year, Yvonne is planning to enter Elizabeth on the women's professional tour, at the same age that Serena and Venus Williams turned pro. -- Elizabeth and Mary Profit will not be taking center court at the U.S. Open women's doubles final to face Venus and Serena Williams, but they share many of the athletic qualities that have made Venus and Serena the most dominant sisters in tennis history. Elizabeth learned how to test her blood sugar levels before the age of 3 and two years later, she began administering insulin injections on her own.

Elizabeth is 13 years old and holds a top ten ranking among 14-year-olds in Southern California.
