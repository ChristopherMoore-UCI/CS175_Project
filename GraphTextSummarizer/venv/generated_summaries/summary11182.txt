Armed robbery suspect Justin Terrell Gordon was captured about 100 miles north of the Choctaw County jail on Saturday evening after breaking out along with cellmates Gemayel Culbert and Demarcus Woodward, according to Sheriff Tom Abate. Local authorities using tracking dogs tracked the escaped inmates about a quarter of a mile down state Highway 17 in Butler, Alabama, where Abate said they were either picked up or had a vehicle waiting for them. The three were locked down together in a single cell around 2 a.m. Saturday when one started screaming, saying another of them was very sick, Abate said. Abate said the jailer, who was choked, was treated and released at an area hospital Saturday morning. Authorities found Woodward, 23, who is accused of killing a work release inmate, early Monday in Tuscaloosa.
