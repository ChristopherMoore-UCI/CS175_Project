The $20 million project was intended not only to serve as a habitat for marine life, but also to boost tourism in the Pensacola region. The boat is carrying a team of local dive industry professionals -- along with an underwater cameraman -- who arranged Wednesday's trip to show that the Gulf oil spill has not affected the prized dive site, the USS Oriskany. So the Pensacola team plans to post video of Wednesday's dive on the Internet to show people that the oil spill has not impacted this Gulf Coast community. No oil was expected to impact the shores of Pensacola beach and beyond through the weekend, Escambia County's disaster response team said Thursday. -- As the "H2O Below" charter boat leaves the dock and heads into Pensacola Bay, it is chock full of divers.
