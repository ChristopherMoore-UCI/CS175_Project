Bellucci next faces either world No. 2 Novak Djokovic, who is unbeaten in 29 consecutive matches this year, or Spanish sixth seed David Ferrer -- the losing finalist in Monte Carlo and Barcelona last month. The 23-year-old became the first Brazilian since Gustavo Kuerten in 2003 to reach the last-four stage in the Spanish capital as he followed up his earlier shock win over British fourth seed Andy Murray. The world No. 3 triumphed 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 against the Swedish fifth seed in one hour 42 minutes After successive titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, Nadal's progress has been simpler this week following a third-round walkover when rejuvenated former world No. 4 Juan Martin del Potro pulled out with a hip injury. Australian Open finalist Li will take on Czech 16th seed Petra Kvitova for a place in Sunday's title match. Her last meeting with Gorges ended in disappointment in Stuttgart last month when the 21-year-old Azarenka had to retire hurt with a shoulder injury after winning the first set.
