He hid from Israeli forces in villages near Tulkarem, using his family members to send coded messages to Hamas operatives "in order to lead the Hamas terror organization in Tulkarem, finance his and other militants' terrorist activity and purchase weapons," the IDF said. -- Israeli forces have arrested a wanted Hamas leader accused of planning one of the worst suicide attacks on Israel, the Israeli military announced Wednesday. Israeli military and security forces nabbed Jabar -- identified as the head of Hamas in the Tulkarem area -- in a West Bank village near Tulkarem overnight Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces said. According to IDF, Jabar recruited the person who dispatched the suicide bomber, introducing him to the head of the Hamas in Tulkarem at the time, Abed Sayad. Its military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, has admitted responsibility for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians as well as attacks against the Israeli military.
