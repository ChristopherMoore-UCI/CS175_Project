Note lets family know 9/11 victim went down fighting Named defendants included the museum, New Jersey, the city of New York, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Father Brian Jordan, a Franciscan priest who ministered to workers clearing the area after the attacks, led a ceremonial blessing of the cross. Federal Judge Deborah Batts of the Southern District of New York ruled Thursday that display of the beams is permissible because they bear historical importance. -- A New York judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed by a group of atheists, ruling that a pair of World Trade Center beams in the shape of a cross can be included in a memorial museum of the 9/11 terror attacks. "We are confident that we will eventually win this case and that cross will be removed, or atheists will be allowed to have our own symbol in there," he said. "For some of these people, [the cross] had symbolic significance," he continued, referring to first responders.
