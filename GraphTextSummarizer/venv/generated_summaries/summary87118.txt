U.S. Marshals, working with Los Alamitos police and Mexican authorities, were able to match Ettima's description to that of the man in custody in Mexico, authorities said. Los Alamitos police asked the U.S. Marshals task force for assistance the day after Hardwick-Street was killed, and the federal authorities put Ettima on their 15 Most Wanted fugitives list in February. Nearly 110,000 fugitive felons were apprehended last year by U.S. Marshals task forces, nine of them from the agency's 15 Most Wanted List, the statement said. "Capturing him was one of our highest priorities." Ettima's arrest "is the first step in bringing justice to the victim and those affected by this brutal crime," said Los Alamitos Police Chief Todd Mattern. Two of Hardwick-Street's grandchildren, ages 8 and 3, were present at the time of her slaying, according to Los Alamitos police.
