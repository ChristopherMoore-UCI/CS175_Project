-- Jury selection in the case of Casey Anthony, who is charged in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, continued Tuesday as attorneys removed several people from the viable jury pool. Meanwhile, outside the courthouse, the parents of Casey Anthony are working to obtain trademarks for "Caylee Anthony" and "Justice for Caylee," according to their attorney, in a bid to prevent people from selling products that use their granddaughter's name. Jury selection is taking place at the Pinellas County courthouse in Clearwater, Florida. Mark Lippman, who represents George and Cindy Anthony, said they have also sent a demand letter, the first step in filing a claim for libel, to CafePress, a California-based online retailer that markets such products. Attorneys on both sides struck several jurors Tuesday, whittling the potential pool of vetted candidates to just 11 -- six women and five men.
