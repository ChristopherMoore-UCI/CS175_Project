In Saturday's late match, fifth-placed Athletic Bilbao beat Basque rivals Real Sociedad 2-1 to move five points clear of Sevilla, who host Champions League hopefuls Villarreal on Sunday. Lionel Messi scored a record 50th goal this season as Barcelona bounced back from midweek Spanish Cup heartache to maintain an eight-point lead in La Liga on Saturday. Real got the better of Barca for the first time this season with a strong defensive effort in Valencia, but went all guns blazing in Saturday's return to the Mestalla. With arch-rivals Real Madrid following up Wednesday's extra-time Copa del Rey triumph by thrashing third-placed Valencia 6-3 earlier, the pressure was on Barcelona to respond. The two-time world player of the year became the first player to reach the half-century mark in a Spanish season as he moved past Real Madrid's Hungarian legend Ferenc Puskas in a 2-0 win over Osasuna.
