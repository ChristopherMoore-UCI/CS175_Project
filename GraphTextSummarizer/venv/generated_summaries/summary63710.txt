"The TC community deplores these hateful acts, which violate every Teachers College and societal norm," said an e-mail Wednesday to faculty and students from the college's president, Susan Fuhrman; and dean, Tom James. -- Three professors and a former professor at Columbia University's Teachers College received hate mail this week, the New York Police Department said. (A swastika is the right-angles cross symbol used on Nazi Germany flags). The fourth, a former professor who is an African-American, was sent a manila envelope containing an image of a noose, according to NYPD deputy commissioner Paul Browne. Columbia University's Teachers College is once again the target of a hate campaign.
