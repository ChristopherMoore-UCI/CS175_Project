"In theory REDD is a system to provide incentives for countries not to cut their forests," Katerere said. Critics of the REDD program argue that it allows richer countries to meet -- to buy essentially -- some of their emissions obligations without cutting them at all. REDD say that more than 30 models of how the program should work have been put forward by countries, groups of countries and NGOs. Proposals to reduce emissions from deforestation were first introduced by the governments of Papua New Guinea in December 2005 at the COP11 talks in Canada. Yemi Katerere, head of the U.N.-REDD program explained to CNN how the REDD program proposals would work.
