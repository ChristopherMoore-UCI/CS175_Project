Without a political and economic plan tackling the motivations driving ISIS sympathizers within Syria and Iraq and globally, limited military action will keep ISIS alive and open the door to retaliation. Now that military action is a reality, instead of merely jumping on the bandwagon, the UK should use its position as a major European country and a key ally of the United States to push the coalition towards formulating a long-term strategy that is indeed comprehensive and that offers a realistic plan for what happens in Syria and Iraq the day after ISIS is eradicated. The UK has become one of the latest Western countries to enter the coalition fighting ISIS, with Parliament voting Friday to endorse British military engagement in Iraq through airstrikes. The UK is basing its involvement in Iraq on the legitimacy granted by the democratically elected Iraqi government's request for international intervention to aid it in fighting ISIS, a scenario that cannot be duplicated in Syria. But ISIS has set roots in both Syria and Iraq, and has erased the border between the two countries in areas under its control.
