Bo is not among the 2,270 party members elected as Party Congress delegates. -- After much speculation, it is now official: The Communist Party of China (CPC) will convene its 18th Party Congress in Beijing during the "latter half of this year," a party official announced this week without giving specific dates. The other influential politician is Bo Xilai, the former Party chief of Chongqing who was dismissed last April for "serious breach of Party regulations." He earlier served as party chief of the prosperous provinces of Fujian and Zhejiang and Shanghai, China's financial center. Instead, selections are made by a coterie of communist party cadres after drawn-out negotiations and horse-trading behind closed doors.
