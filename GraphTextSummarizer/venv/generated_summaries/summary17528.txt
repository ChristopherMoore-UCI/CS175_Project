For its part, the United Nations has set up the first-ever U.N. emergency health mission, the Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, to deal with the "the unprecedented outbreak" of Ebola, the agency said. Even before the first case on U.S. soil, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, urged President Barack Obama, a Democrat, to appoint one federal official to lead the U.S. strategy to address the worldwide Ebola outbreak, especially in Africa. Not surprisingly, there's bureaucratic red tape that has slowed government response to Texas' Ebola case and its attendant concerns. " CDC Director Frieden applauded the U.S. domestic response and cited how Texas has successfully established an incident management system. "We feel the current structure we have in place is sufficient." On Friday, Lisa Monaco, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser, said the U.S. government has been "enhancing our domestic preparedness to respond" to cases like Texas.
