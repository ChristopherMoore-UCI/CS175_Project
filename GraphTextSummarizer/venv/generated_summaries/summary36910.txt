"Service members with critical occupations and important foreign language skills are not necessarily mutually exclusive groups because some critical occupations, such as cryptologic linguists and interrogators, require an important foreign language skill," the report said. But the GAO noted that the number of people with critical skills and occupations might be even higher because of problems compiling the information. "Our calculation includes the cost to the services to recruit a new service member, provide him or her with basic training and graduate the service member from initial skills training in the occupational specialty in which a service member had been separated," the report said. And the report released Thursday says that 40% of those service members had skills in a "critical" occupation or foreign language such as Arabic, or both. Of the cases examined by the GAO, 39%, or 1,442, service members who were removed under the "don't ask, don't tell" policy held "critical occupations" such as infantryman.
