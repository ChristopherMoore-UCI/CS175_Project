He had a degree in aeronautical engineering from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California. He was the co-pilot for both SpaceShipTwo's first glide and first powered flight, the bio said, and logged more than 1,600 hours as test pilot and test engineer in Scaled aircraft. "This was a test flight, and test flights are typically very well-documented in terms of data," NTSB Acting Chairman Christopher A. Hart said. The two test pilots had logged many years of flight experience each, according to biographies of the men. Siebold had worked for Scaled Composites since 1996, according to his biography on the company website, and had 17 years and more than 2,000 hours of flight experience.
