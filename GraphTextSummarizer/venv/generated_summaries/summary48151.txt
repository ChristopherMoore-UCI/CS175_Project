Davis was convicted in 1991 of the 1989 murder of Savannah police officer Mark MacPhail. But surely the citizens of Savannah and the state of Georgia want justice served on behalf of MacPhail, the police officer. But the board ignored those principles in denying Davis clemency. Instead of the American system's presumption of innocence and a requirement that the state prove guilt, Davis' evidentiary hearing began with the court presuming guilt and required the condemned to prove his innocence. -- Only the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles stood between life and death for Troy Anthony Davis, and the core principles of American jurisprudence should have been the board's guide.
