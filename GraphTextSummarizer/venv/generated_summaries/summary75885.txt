The Heath Department said in its statement, "We have no reason to believe that other children or school employees are at increased risk of staph infection." "Hospitals are taking it seriously and need to continue to improve the way they prevent and treat staph infections," he said. The death of a 12-year-old student in Brooklyn from the staph infection MRSA has prompted fear among parents and students throughout the New York City school system, forcing officials to respond. "There's often no way to know how an individual person got the infection," said New York City Health Commissioner Tom Frieden.
