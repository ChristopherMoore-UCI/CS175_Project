Two subsequent reviews have backed up Hurst's conclusions, finding that advances in the science of arson investigation since Willingham's trial rendered obsolete most of the signs that fire marshals pointed to as evidence of arson in the case. In Willingham's case, Perry's office says the governor was briefed on a last-minute filing by Austin-based fire science expert Gerald Hurst that found the deadly blaze was likely not arson, but he refused to grant a stay of execution for further investigation. Aides to Perry, who allowed Willingham's execution to go forward, started off with general questions about how things were going at the commission, a relatively new agency, Bassett said. Perry's campaign dismissed Bassett's accusations Wednesday, repeating the governor's characterization of Willingham as a "monster" who had sent his three young daughters to a fiery death. Perry is now seeking the Republican nomination for president, and Bassett says the Willingham case is a window into Perry's leadership.
