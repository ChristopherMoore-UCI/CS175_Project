President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were among the mourners who gathered at a memorial service in Charleston for the veteran legislator. On Friday -- as his body made a final return to the state he loved -- Sen. Robert C. Byrd was remembered as a political titan, champion of the poor, and defender of the Constitution. Clinton recalled an occasion when, soon after he became president, he told Byrd that "if you pave every single inch of West Virginia, it's going to be much harder to mine coal." Byrd was "somebody who knew how to keep the faith with his state, with his family, with his country and his Constitution," Obama said, standing before a packed, sun-splashed state capitol. Over the course of his long public career, Byrd came to be "seen as the very embodiment of the Senate," Obama said.
