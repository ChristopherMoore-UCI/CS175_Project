" "'Movement' is a very Joy Division record with New Order vocals, whereas by the time "Power, Corruption & Lies" came along, it was a proper New Order record. On previous tours Hook's group played the two Joy Division albums, material New Order rarely performed. New Order was formed in 1980 by Sumner, Hook and drummer Steven Morris, who had previously been in melancholy post-punk band Joy Division until the death of singer Ian Curtis. However, Sumner, Morris and Gilbert reformed four years later without him and are now touring and planning to release new material under the New Order name. Even spending three decades on the road together seems no barrier to disharmony, as Peter Hook and his former New Order bandmates are finding out.
