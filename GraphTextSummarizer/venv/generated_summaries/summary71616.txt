Muller hopes the connections his images forge will motivate people to think beyond their preconceptions about sharks. " "White Mike" as he's sometimes called, says his highly successful commercial work has helped him see the power of photography, but rather than promote celebrities or products, he's using his skills to help advocacy organizations like WildAid, Sea Shepherds, EarthEcho, and Shark Spotters in South Africa. It bolsters the attention he's received as a commercial photographer, a spotlight he's leveraging to raise awareness about critically diminishing global shark populations. He swims among sharks without the protection of a cage to make studio-quality, intimate photos of these beautiful creatures. He says he's also got a number of books in the works, based on his photos of sharks.
