In an interview with the BBC's Today programme on Friday morning, Justin Welby said that the amount of Church money indirectly invested in Wonga was about £75,000 out of investments totalling £5.2bn. The Archbishop of Canterbury said he was "embarrassed" and "irritated" that the Church Commissioners had indirectly invested in Wonga, the payday lending firm that he has vowed to "compete out" of business by encouraging credit unions to be set up in churches across the country. The church, which claims to have a strong ethical investment policy that explicitly bans companies involved in payday lending, invests in Accel Partners, the US venture capital firm that led Wonga's 2009 fundraising. The Church has played an increasingly active role in the debate over ethical banking in recent months, both as an investor and because Archbishop Welby was an outspoken member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. (Financial Times) -- Lambeth Palace has ordered an independent inquiry into investments made by the Church of England's £5.2bn investment fund after the Financial Times revealed that it had indirectly invested in Wonga, the payday lender.
