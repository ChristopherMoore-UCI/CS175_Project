Sydney Harbor Sydney prides itself on holding what it claims to be the most spectacular New Year's Eve celebrations in the world. Revelers enjoy a warm summer's evening on the water here, with firework displays and street performers for those onshore. The fantastic sound of African drums beat out at this New Year's celebration in Cape Town. Kiribati prides itself on being the first nation to celebrate the New Year, even changing the name of one of its islands before 2000 to Millennium Island to mark the fact it would be the first country to enter the third millennium. If you're willing to brave the chilly winds, a cruise on the River Thames will provide spectacular views.
