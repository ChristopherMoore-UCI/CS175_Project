Omar's message comes as Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr, which ends the fasting month of Ramadan, and less than a month before the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan, which took place after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. -- The Taliban fight against American and NATO troops in Afghanistan "is forging ahead like a powerful flood," according to a purported online message posted Saturday by the Taliban's elusive leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar. A message from Mullah Mohammed Omar, seen here in 1996, appears on a Web site the Taliban frequently uses. We can consider any option that could lead to the achievement of this goal." Omar also released a statement in December last year. When contacted by CNN, the U.S. State Department said it had no direct response to Omar's comments, which take a swipe at President Obama.
