"It took him nearly three hours to arrive here at the hospital," Dr. Gilberto Albuquerque, general surgeon and hospital director, told CNN on Friday. "The knife crossed his head just behind the optical nerve, got very close to the olfactory nerve and (was) just a fraction from the gustatory nerve. Motorcycle taxi driver Juacelo Nunes de Oliveira was at a party in a bar in the city of Agua Branca, in northeastern Piaui state, last Sunday when he got into an altercation. According to Albuquerque, the knife stopped only when it got stuck in the man's lower jaw. The surgery to remove the knife was very delicate, since any slip could have breached arteries and led the patient to bleed to death, Albuquerque said.
