As for the brutal heat, Qatar says its stadiums will contain advanced, open-air cooling systems that will keep World Cup players and fans comfortable. There also have been allegations that Qatar has used slave labor -- mostly migrant workers from Nepal -- to build Lusail's infrastructure. "It's very much an opportunity to build a vision of the future," said Barry Hughes, senior vice president at HOK, the global architectural firm that designed Lusail's Marina Mall shopping center. That's essentially what the government of Qatar and its developers are trying with Lusail, an ambitious planned city on 28 square miles of waterfront desert along the Persian Gulf. Meanwhile, Lusail continues to rise slowly in the Qatar desert.
