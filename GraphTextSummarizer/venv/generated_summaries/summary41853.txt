Watch scenes from Tea Party Express rallies » Seldom seen on stage are the two gurus of the tea party movement, veteran politico Sal Russo and his protégé, Joe Wierzbicki. No one on the tea party express seems concerned with the vocal fringe of the crowds that come with offensive signs -- besides Nazi imagery, a poster of Obama as an African witch doctor has become popular -- or the numerous conspiracy theories that float around most tea parties. Tea partyers are a creative lot, and many in the crowd express themselves by way of their clothing and signs. If the tea party movement has an architect, it is Joe Wierzbicki. In Elko, Nevada, over a Basque supper of oxtail, lamb and sweetbreads, Russo assesses the tea party movement.
