Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 tore apart Thursday in the sky over Torez. A surface-to-air missile, possibly fired by pro-Russian rebels, took down the jetliner as it traveled from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, the United States said. Non-living items on board included aircraft parts, diplomatic papers and flowers, according to a cargo manifest released by Malaysia Airlines. -- A cargo manifest showed that two dogs were among the casualties of the doomed Malaysian jet that fell from the sky in eastern Ukraine this week. Debris and bodies remain strewn across the countryside in eastern Ukraine.
