Johnson and Graham had been married for a little more than a week when Cody Johnson died on a hiking trail in Glacier National Park. An affidavit supporting the charges against Graham states that she told police she decided to travel with Johnson to the hiking trail the evening of July 7 and an argument ensued. Jordan Linn Graham was arraigned Friday in a U.S. District Court in Missoula, Montana, about 130 miles south of where her newlywed husband Cody Johnson fell to his death on July 7. The affidavit also states that Graham texted a friend that same night her husband died, saying in the message that she was going to talk to Johnson about having "second thoughts. Michael Donahoe, Graham's lawyer, said last month that Johnson pinned his wife down at one point during their argument.
