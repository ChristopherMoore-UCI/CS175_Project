This group will decide to buy or not buy General Motors vehicles based on what they know, hear and even feel about GM's future. While one must keep in mind that consumers don't always do what they say they are going to do, the import of this is clear: Bankruptcy puts a damper on consumer confidence and vehicle demand. But the question should be asked: Is the hammer the task force is holding over the head of the GM stakeholders in an effort to get concessions, the same hammer that will drive away consumers and require the federal government to make larger and larger cash infusions or see GM founder? And if GM languishes in bankruptcy it is hard to imagine consumers flocking to buy its new vehicles. Jack Nerad says bankruptcy would drive car buyers away from GM and imperil suppliers.
