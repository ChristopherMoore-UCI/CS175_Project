The remaining $300 million will go to Libyan victims of the bombing in Libya by U.S. warplanes in 1986. Tripoli sought the protection to encourage U.S. companies to invest in Libya without fear of being sued by terrorism victims or their families. The deal is to be followed by an upgrading of U.S. relations with Libya, including the confirmation of a U.S. ambassador, which was held up until the payments were made. U.S. business executives hope the new relationship will lead to billions of dollars of new investment in Libya, a country rich in petroleum reserves but lacking a developed infrastructure. It also compensates Libyan victims of U.S. airstrikes in the 1980s.
