Pope Francis used a punch to make a point about the limits of free expression, but he ended up on the defensive because of it -- with a Vatican spokesman saying it was "in no way intended to be interpreted as justification for the violence and terror that took place in Paris last week." In an email, Vatican spokesman Thomas Rosica told CNN that "the Pope's expression is in no way intended to be interpreted" as somehow justifying last week's violence, and he pointed out that "the Pope has spoken out clearly against the terror and violence that occurred in Paris and in other parts of the world. "Pope Francis has not advocated violence with his words on the flight," the spokesman said. The Paris magazine became a terrorist target after publishing one such cartoon years ago, and after last week's attack, it placed Mohammed on its cover, this time showing him crying and holding a sign with the rallying cry "Je suis Charlie," French for "I am Charlie. Notably, in the same conversation, Francis steadfastly denounced the terrorists' killings and the idea that anyone -- as the France attackers apparently did -- could pretend to justify such violence in the name of God.
