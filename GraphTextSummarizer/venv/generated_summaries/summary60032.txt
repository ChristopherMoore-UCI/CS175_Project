Asked if Obama tipped his hand by rejecting a U.S. ground invasion against ISIS three years after bringing home combat forces from Iraq, Hagel said, "We're not going to go back into Iraq the same way we came out of Iraq a few years ago." Biden's warning to ISIS: 'We will follow them to the gates of hell' Instead, he advocated Obama's broad-based strategy that calls for a new and more inclusive Iraqi government, an international coalition supporting it and limited U.S. military action like the airstrikes launched last month at ISIS targets in the north. A Vietnam War veteran, Hagel provided a robust defense of President Barack Obama's approach to ISIS jihadists in Iraq and Syria when interviewed Wednesday by CNN National Security Correspondent Jim Sciutto. Asked whether Obama meant "containment" when he said earlier Wednesday that the goal was to manage the ISIS threat, Hagel said, "No, it's not contain. If Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to escalate the fighting there, he would face further consequences on top of U.S. and European Union sanctions imposed so far, but "we're not going to get into a military engagement, a war, over this with Russia," Hagel said. "There's no question in my mind" that the Obama administration approached the ISIS issue with a "sense of urgency," Hagel said, adding that possible airstrikes on the jihadists' positions in Syria were among the options the Pentagon has presented to the President for further steps.
