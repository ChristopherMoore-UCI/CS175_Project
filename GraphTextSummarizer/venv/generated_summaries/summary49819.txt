Vettel failed to make it into Q3 for the first time since 2012 as he suffered with engine software problems, but his new teammate Daniel Ricciardo shrugged off the champion team's preseason struggles by being second fastest behind Lewis Hamilton. Hamilton is one of the early favorites for the title, and his Mercedes team lived up to its billing as Nico Rosberg qualified third ahead of McLaren rookie Kevin Magnussen and Ferrari's two-time world champion Fernando Alonso. Romain Grosjean, who was seventh overall last year, will start 21st on the grid ahead of teammate Pastor Maldonado -- who couldn't even set a time after coming into Q1 late due to a power unit problem. " Magnussen outshined veteran teammate Jenson Button after the 2009 world champion failed to make it to Q3, though he was promoted to 10th after Williams rookie Valtteri Bottas was given a five-place penalty for changing his gearbox. The German will be back in 12th place after a dramatic qualifying session on Saturday in which wet weather added to the uncertainty created by the radical design changes for this year's cars.
