-- President Barack Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney face off on Wednesday in the first of three presidential debates. Obama: 'They're making me do my homework' Romney advisers are correct that voters are likely to walk away from the debate talking about distinctive moments -- audible sighs, body language, repeated use of phrases such as "lock box" -- rather than factoids about Medicare Advantage or sequestration. "We also saw in reports that Mitt Romney and his team have been working on zingers and special lines for months," Obama spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters over the weekend. A Quinnipiac poll of Ohio likely voters released last week, for instance, showed Romney losing women to Obama by a staggering 25-point margin. And when it comes to foreign policy, more voters trust Obama than Romney, polls show.
