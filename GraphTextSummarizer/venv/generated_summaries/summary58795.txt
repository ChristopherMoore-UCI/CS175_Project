More recent versions of the PicoBrew machine moved to custom AMTEGA controller boards and a number of custom parts, some rendered by Geiger himself. The PicoBrew has more potential clients in commercial craft breweries. The two teamed up with Microsoft software architect Avi Geiger in the fall of 2011. With the level of specificity provided by the PicoBrew, the founders state that users should be able to turn out recipes "precisely on spec." One source in the Kickstarter video, Matt Linecum of Fremont brewery, notes that the machine could be used for quickly testing the quality of ingredients before committing to their use in a full batch.
