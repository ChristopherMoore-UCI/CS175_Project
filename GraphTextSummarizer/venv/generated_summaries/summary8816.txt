The then-student, Dharun Ravi, is on trial on a 15-count indictment for allegedly spying on and intimidating his roommate, Tyler Clementi, because Clementi was gay. Ravi said that he was "creeped out" by the September 19 romantic encounter between Clementi and another man, which he suggested he witnessed -- via his hidden camera -- with several others. Huang said it was her understanding that Ravi planned to broadcast another liaison, without Clementi's knowledge, for others to see. And amid testimony Monday by Detective Douglas Rager of the Rutgers Police Department, the defense lawyer noted that Ravi cooperated fully when investigators talked with him for the first time after Clementi's death. One of Ravi's high school friends, Michelle Huang, testified Monday at his trial in a New Brunswick, New Jersey, courtroom.
