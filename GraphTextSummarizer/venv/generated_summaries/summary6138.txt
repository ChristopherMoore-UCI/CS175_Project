Slideshow: Travel + Leisure's list of the scariest runways According to aviation experts, mitigating factors range from the truncated length of runways to unique atmospheric and meteorological conditions, dramatic geographical settings, heavy air traffic, or a combination thereof. While Bhutan is the most extreme example -- only eight pilots in the world are qualified to fly into Paro -- a number of the world's airports, from St. Maarten in the Caribbean to Madeira Airport in Funchal, can present challenges for pilots. In fact, this is a completely normal -- however nail-biting -- landing at Paro Airport, set 7,300 feet above sea level. There's a sobering saying among pilots: "Any landing you can walk away from is a good landing." Pilots had to battle crosswinds and fly a complicated curved approach, all while dodging mountains and high-rises.
