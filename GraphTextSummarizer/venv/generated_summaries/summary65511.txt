Even as Capitol Hill remained consumed by the government shutdown, House Democrats hoping to jump start the stalled debate over immigration reform put a new proposal on the table Wednesday. "They want Congress to take on this issue." Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-California, said he has no doubt there are enough House votes to pass a bill that "fixes our broken immigration system, including provide a path to legal residency and ultimately to citizenship to millions of people who work hard everyday in this country. But it's uncertain whether the measure will ever be up for debate on the House floor, since Republican House Speaker John Boehner is the one who would need to schedule a vote on the matter -- something he hasn't done yet. But we are introducing a comprehensive reform bill that provides that space for compromise that takes the very hard and tough work that was done in the Senate and takes the very detailed and specific work that was done in the House and so, we put them both together," Garcia said. Still, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Democratic minority leader, described the bill as "100% bipartisan" because it combines measures that have gotten support on both sides of the aisle in the House and the Senate.
