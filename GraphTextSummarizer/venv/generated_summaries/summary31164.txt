Baraka, considered a founder of the 1960s Black Arts movement, died in New Jersey's  Beth Israel Medical Center after a short illness, according to agent Celeste Bateman. But he had no protected legal interest in the maintenance of the position of poet laureate of New Jersey. " A self-described "poet icon and revolutionary political activist," he was named poet laureate by then-Gov. James McGreevey, on the recommendation of the state's Council for the Arts, in 2002. Baraka refused the governor's request to resign, saying his work was neither anti-Semitic nor racist. Poet Amiri Baraka, who lost his post as New Jersey's poet laureate because of a controversial poem about the 9/11 terror attacks, died Thursday, his agent said.
