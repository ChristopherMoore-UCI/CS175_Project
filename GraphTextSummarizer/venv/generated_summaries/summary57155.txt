Instead, Bridges commissioned Los Angeles bespoke tailor Johnathan Behr to build custom suits for actor Jamie Dornan, who plays the successful CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings with a sexual appetite for bondage and discipline in the film adaptation of the book, opening Friday. Behr broke into Hollywood costume design thanks to Bryant, who hired him to build suits and coats for "Mad Men" Don Draper and Roger Sterling: power players like Grey who wear their control over others on their sleeves. Bridges showed Behr a Canali suit ad from a fashion magazine, and Behr instantly understood the look: subtle, dark and elegant with a fitted, slim cut to show off Grey's sculpted physique, Behr said. While Behr went to work on the suits, Dornan worked with a trainer in Vancouver to physically prepare for the role of Grey, whose fitness obsession is another manifestation of his domineering character. The ability to steer the outcome, Behr said -- a characteristic that fans of the trilogy will immediately identify with Grey in his pursuit of naive Ana.
