On July 23, two high-speed trains crashed in China's coastal Zhejiang province, leaving 39 dead and 192 injured, making it one of China's deadliest rail accidents in recent years. The accident happened as concerns and criticism mount over China's railway safety and its fast development of rail systems. Eleven other managers and workers of the operation control and power supply sections also received penalties, including job reassignment and demotions. Xinhua News Agency, quoting a report released by the investigation team, reported that Tang Zhihua, chief dispatcher of the Line 10 operation control center, was removed from his post. -- A train collision in a tunnel in Shanghai's subway Line 10 last month was caused by human error, said state media, with 12 people disciplined over the incident.
