-- Several Syrian rockets landed early Wednesday in the Mount Hermon area of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, on the border with Syria, the Israeli military said. Four U.N. peacekeepers were released Sunday, five days after they were seized by armed men while patrolling between Syria and the Israeli-occupied territory. It's not the first time Syria's civil war has spilled over into the Golan Heights area. Tensions in the area have been heightened recently and Israel has twice conducted strikes against Syria. The two countries signed an armistice in 1974, following the Yom Kippur War, and U.N. forces have been stationed there since.
