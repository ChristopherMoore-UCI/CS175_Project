There will be more kidnappings," the Iowa Republican said Tuesday on CNN's "New Day." President Barack Obama ordered a review of how the United States handles overseas kidnappings of American citizens by terrorists, including how the families of captives are kept informed. The administration has not indicated a willingness to negotiate or pay sums of money in exchange for hostages, a practice some governments have used to win the release of captives by ISIS. But...we do have to be as compassionate and as open and as accommodating to these families who find themselves in this incredibly tragic situation," he said, suggesting that having "a single point of contact that can give real answers in real time" to the families would be helpful. "I do think though that they need to improve their coordination between the agencies and do other things possible to help get these hostages free," he told CNN's Chris Cuomo. Rep. Steve King said he agrees that the Obama administration needs to change its response to hostage situations but doesn't think the United States should go down the route of negotiating or paying ransoms.
