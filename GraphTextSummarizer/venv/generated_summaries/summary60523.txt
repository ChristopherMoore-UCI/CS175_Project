Here are some of her recommendations and what makes each wild place special, in her own words: Gaylor Lakes Trail, Yosemite National Park, California Yosemite National Park is my favorite place on Earth, and the area near Tioga Pass is my favorite place in Yosemite. Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts Cape Cod is my childhood wilderness, where I came to love both nature and the outdoors because of my parents' affection for the place. Gaylor Lakes offers an array of wonders -- five shimmering blue, subalpine lakes, views of Yosemite's high peaks, colorful spring wildflowers like lupine and monkey flower, and ruins of the Great Sierra silver mine. The first three-quarters of a mile is all uphill, but you are rewarded with stunning views of Yosemite's high country at the top, including the Cathedral Range, Kuna Crest and Mount Dana as well as middle Gaylor Lake. In college, I drove across country every summer, visiting national parks and other wild areas.
