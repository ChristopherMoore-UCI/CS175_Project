All that said, how many more domain-registration companies can you name without a Google search? Samsung Instead of focusing on a single product, Samsung used funnymen Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd basically to say "Samsung" a lot while pretending to fight over who will get to be in the commercial. Once the darling of the Android world with its Droid phones, Motorola has faded as Samsung's Galaxy S III has become arguably the chief rival to the iPhone. It also showcased the store's emphasis on selling mobile gadgets instead of TVs or home electronics. But that didn't mean we didn't take notice of which Web and tech companies shelled out the big bucks to nestle in between ads for corn chips and beer in black bottles. And to let the world know Rogen would wear a diaper for Samsung.
