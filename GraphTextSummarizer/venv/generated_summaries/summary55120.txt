Since the attention Bart received after he allegedly "rose from the dead," more information has surfaced about Bart's "home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial," Sherry Silk, executive director of the Tampa Humane Society said in a release. Still, after meeting with Bart's owner Thursday for about 40 minutes, Silk said she has to act in the best interest of the cat, which in her opinion means keeping the cat at the Humane Society. Likewise, Humane Society veterinarians believe the feline was buried for a time. The neighbor returned the cat to Hutson, who brought the cat, who was covered in open wounds and dehydrated, to the Humane Society for help. "All of Bart's injuries are consistent with him being hit by a car," Silk said.
