FAA Administrator Randy Babbitt disclosed the latest incident in a statement saying he is prohibiting scheduling practices that may be contributing to fatigue. Paul Rinaldi, head of the controller's union, said Saturday his union and the FAA agree that fatigue and scheduling must be addressed. The incident occurred at the Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center during the midnight shift early Saturday morning, two days before the FAA is expected to conduct meetings on air traffic control safety and professionalism, the FAA reported. "We are taking important steps today that will make a real difference in fighting air traffic controller fatigue," Babbitt said. David Grizzle, the FAA's chief counsel, was named acting chief of the unit during a search to fill Krakowski's post. Saturday morning, Grizzle briefed LaHood and Babbitt about the latest incident.
