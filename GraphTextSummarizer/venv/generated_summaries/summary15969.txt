"My job in IT (information technology) has helped me a lot with automation of the telescope and the actual detection of new comets." The latest Comet Lovejoy was found on August 17, 2014, from Lovejoy's home in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. "It is very exciting from the point of view, not just from the point of finding a named object, but from the point of view the time spent developing the comet searching system has paid off," Lovejoy said. Comet sleuth Terry Lovejoy had just pinged me on Facebook Messenger answering my request for an interview. I told Mr. Lovejoy I would email him my questions and dashed outside.
