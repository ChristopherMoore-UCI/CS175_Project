In 1992 she set up Midori & Friends, a non-profit organization that brings musical education to young people in New York City. But music is and remains her first love and the way in which it connects people and stirs emotions is something she believes is one of the most powerful aspects of music. The world today might be unrecognizable from the world of Bruckner or Bach, but for Midori the way people feel and respond to music and emotions remains the same. She moved to New York to study at the Juilliard School of performing arts and has lead a life entwined with music. Being given the opportunity to learn more about different people and experience different places was only one part of this education.
