-- A Canadian woman accused of stalking Alec Baldwin began sending "a series of annoying and unsolicited communications" to the actor after having dinner with him in fall 2010, according to a criminal complaint filed Monday. Genevieve Sabourin, 40, was arrested by New York police Sunday on five misdemeanor counts of harassment and stalking after she appeared at Baldwin's Manhattan home. "As you know, stalking is a serious issue, so we've turned this matter over to the New York Police Department," Baldwin's publicist told CNN on Monday. She sent Baldwin a dozen e-mails last week that added to his stress, the complaint said. Until then, she must keep away from Baldwin, 53, and not send him any e-mails or text messages, the judge ordered.
