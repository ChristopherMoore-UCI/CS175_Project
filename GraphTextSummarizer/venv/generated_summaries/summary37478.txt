He got his photo and a letter that said: "Your kind message to Col. Moammar Gadhafi, leader of the great first September revolution, has been received with great appreciation." Schlamowitz, a devout Jew, even received a Christmas card from the Muslim Gadhafi. Among the likes of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Yasser Arafat and Hosni Mubarak is Moammar Gadhafi, whose ignoble death last month earned Schlamowitz himself a bit of instant fame. Schlamowitz's collection -- he says he has more than 6,000 letters and autographed photos -- had been written about before, but after Gadhafi died, everyone became curious about why an 81-year-old American corresponded with the despot. Schlamowitz put the typewritten words into the album, alongside photos of Gadhafi, autographed in red ink. Gadhafi wrote several times more; one letter attacked America for practicing terrorism with its support of Israel -- not what a Jewish man who also had letters from Israel's Golda Meir, Yitzhak Rabin and Moshe Dayan would want to read.
