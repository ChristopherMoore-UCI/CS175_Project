Strauss-Kahn: I didn't know there were prostitutes at sex parties Two women who accompanied Strauss-Kahn on a third trip to Washington said they considered themselves libertines, not prostitutes, but would not turn down a "present. Strauss-Kahn on Tuesday denied knowing any of the women at the sex parties were prostitutes, saying he was told by Paszkowski that they were "libertines" who liked sex. Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn conceded Wednesday that his approach to sex is rougher than that of most men, as he took the stand for a second day in his trial in France on aggravated pimping charges. His words followed testimony from two sex workers about his behavior at sex parties he's accused of organizing or encouraging in Europe and the United States. Jade told the court she had refused to have sex with Strauss-Kahn at the Tantra club, "because it was a butchery."
