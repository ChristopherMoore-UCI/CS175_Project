Just ask Tiger Woods, who lost a tooth when a camera hit him in the face while cheering Vonn onto the podium in Italy last month. I just wish the weather was a little bit better." Golfer Woods, undaunted by his dental disaster last month, once again turned up to support Vonn. The 30-year-old came to this year's World Championships, in Beaver Creek, Colorado, having just set the all-time record for wins on the regular, season-long women's World Cup circuit. And she maintained some of that momentum to finish third in Tuesday's super-G, her opening event, behind Slovenia's Tina Maze and victorious Austrian Anna Fenninger. Before Fenninger's run, Vonn had temporarily led the field with 1:10.44.
