-- A 2-year-old boy who was reportedly the son of Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson died Friday of injuries he suffered after allegedly being abused, police said. Nelson Peterson did not identify the boy by name except to say he was not Adrian Peterson Jr. The 2012 NFL Most Valuable Player himself did not elaborate on what happened when addressing reporters earlier Friday, at which time the child was in critical condition. Peterson's father, Nelson Peterson, told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that the injured toddler is his grandson and Adrian's son. Patterson called authorities about 5:45 p.m. Wednesday to report that a 2-year-old was choking in his Sioux Falls apartment, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. A judge set his bail at $750,000 cash during his initial court appearance Friday, according to Clemens.
