In addition, sympathy for Strauss-Kahn may be eroded, King said, by allegations from French politician Anne Mansouret, who said following Strauss-Kahn's arrest that he attacked her daughter, French journalist Tristane Banon, in 2002. -- Reaction to the arrest of International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn ranged from concern to outrage to sadness Tuesday in France, where one politician said he was the victim of a "lynching" and others cautioned against what they see as a rush to judgment. Underscoring the cultural differences between France and the United States, many French recoiled from images of Strauss-Kahn, who is charged in the alleged sexual assault of a New York hotel housekeeper, in handcuffs and in court -- photographs that would be prohibited under French law to protect the presumption of innocence. "If you are pro-Sarkozy, you are happy," French teacher Paul Verite said Tuesday. "I think that for Americans it's the normal procedure, so there's nothing shocking about these pictures, but in France it's true that these pictures are very shocking for us, because in France we don't have the right to show images of a man who is charged but not yet convicted," French resident Veritas Galabova, who works in finance, told CNN on Tuesday.
