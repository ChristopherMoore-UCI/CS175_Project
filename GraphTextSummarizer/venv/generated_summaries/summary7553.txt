-- A New York man released on parole last month pleaded not guilty Wednesday in connection with the stabbing of two children in Brooklyn, one of whom died, authorities said. "These two innocent children were subjected to unimaginable violence and terror in that elevator," Kings County District Attorney Kenneth Thompson said in a statement. St. Hubert was arrested one week ago around the same time that New York Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce identified him by name publicly for the first time as the suspect in the attack. Police initially said Mikayla was in critical condition. Nine days later, police believe he encountered PJ and Mikayla inside an elevator at a public housing complex in Brooklyn.
