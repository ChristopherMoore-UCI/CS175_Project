" Greeks set election date amid possibility of bank panic That view is echoed by former EU Commissioner and one-time UK Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson. With a staff of more than 90,000 to consider and operations in more than 80 countries to oversee, Shell CEO Peter Voser has admitted that he must plan for what the markets say is an increasingly plausible outcome to a tragedy well into its third year. "Saving Greece means throwing good money after bad, but not saving Greece means possible huge and fatal capital outflows from the periphery as well," he said. He says Greece's chances of keeping the euro are 50-50 and hinge less on political goodwill than financial support from the European Central Bank. "For many years it used to be taboo, but so many people are talking about it, it's not a possibility that can be ignored anymore," he said.
