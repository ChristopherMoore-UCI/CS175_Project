In a compelling series about women and work, Wharton School professor Adam Grant and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes. Apparently Rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about Canada: Kim Campbell became the country's first female prime minister in 1993. But underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration: The bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015, a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias. It's overt: There are more men on corporate boards named John, Robert, William or James than there are women on boards altogether. Our nation, our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men.
