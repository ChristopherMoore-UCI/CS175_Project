-- A skydiving instructor on a tandem jump in Mississippi died and his student was critically injured after their parachutes failed to open, the Lamar County sheriff said Sunday. The body of James "Jimmie" Horak, Jr., 66, was found Saturday in heavy mud in a swampy wooded area about a mile from the airport in Lumberton where they planned to land, Sheriff Danny Rigel said. Neither company could be reached for comment Sunday. Deputies had to carry Horak and the student for a "considerable distance" to get them out of the woods, and the student was then airlifted to Forrest General Hospital in nearby Hattiesburg, Rigel said. Horak and the student landed on leased hunting land, and a hunting club member who knew the jumpers were missing then found them, Rigel said.
