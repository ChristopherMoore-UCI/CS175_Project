Second half goals from Marat Izmailov (51st minute) and a 64th minute free kick from Emiliano Insua earned Sporting Lisbon a 2-1 win over Metalist Kharkiv. An injury-time counterattack earned the away side a fourth when Markel Susaeta unselfishly squared the ball to Iker Muniain who swept the ball past a helpless Mathias Schober -- who replaced the injured Hildebrand at halftime. Australian striker Brett Holman put the home side ahead on the stroke of halftime with a deft side-foot volley from a corner kick. Colombian striker Falcao headed home from Gabi's free-kick to give the home side an early ninth minute lead before Mame Diouf put the German side back on level terms seven minutes before the break sliding in to meet a Lars Stindl cross. Spain's third representative in the quarterfinals, Valencia didn't fare so well, going down 2-1 away to Dutch side AZ Alkmaar.
