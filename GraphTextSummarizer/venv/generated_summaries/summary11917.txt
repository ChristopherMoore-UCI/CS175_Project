I won't let you out of my country with those films unprocessed.'" Just after the game had been abandoned, Teixeira had watched aghast as a Chilean pundit told a local radio station how he had seen the flare hit Rojas, so turning the knife into Brazil's unprotected back. On the Monday evening, Globo ran the scoop -- showing pictures that proved Rojas' play-acting -- in a program called "Jornal Nacional", a copy of which CBF boss Teixeira showed to FIFA after flying to their headquarters in Switzerland. "In 1993, Sao Paulo coach Tele Santana and the club president traveled to the Chilean capital Santiago to ask Roberto to work at the club as the goalkeeping trainer," Viviane Rojas, his wife, told CNN. In a planned incident, Rojas -- a highly-respected goalkeeper who was playing for Brazilian side Sao Paulo at the time -- had used a razor blade hidden in his gloves to cut his own head while lying on the floor. In the Chile penalty area, goalkeeper Roberto Rojas was prostrate on the floor, seemingly hit by a flare that was still fizzing and pumping smoke into the sky just inches from him.
