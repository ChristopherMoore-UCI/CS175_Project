The appeals court affirmed the lower court's ruling, saying the turkey baster doesn't constitute reproductive technology. Bruce argued that she used "noncoital reproductive technology" to get pregnant, and Boardwine was technically a sperm donor. She also thought that because they never had sex, she was entitled to be the boy's sole parent, according to court documents. Boardwine initially was hesitant when Bruce approached him in 2010 with the turkey baster idea, the court document says. Boardwine was awarded joint legal custody and visitation.
