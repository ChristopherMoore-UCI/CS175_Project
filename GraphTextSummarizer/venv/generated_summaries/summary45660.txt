Kandahar was the headquarters for the Taliban during its five-year rule of Afghanistan and was home to Taliban Supreme Leader Mullah Omar. The Taliban have been responsible for dozens of attacks on girls' schools and female teachers, but even they condemned this attack. It's not the first time girls in Afghanistan have been targeted for attending school. During that time, girls were forbidden to attend school. About 6 million children attend schools throughout the country, 2 million of whom are girls, according to government figures.
