"This office understands that the currently released audio tape of approximately 15 minutes is a portion of approximately one (1) hour of overall audio recording of Mr. Donald T. Sterling and Ms. Stiviano, and is in fact legitimate," Nehoray said in a news release. now V. Stiviano, the woman who was a regular courtside presence at Los Angeles Clippers games next to owner Donald Sterling, is attracting more attention than the players. If authentic, the recordings seem to reflect Sterling's embarrassment and frustration with Stiviano over her associating with African-Americans at Clippers games and posting such pictures on her Instagram account. "Ms. Stiviano did not release the tape(s) to any news media. Artist, Lover, Writer, Chef, Poet, Stylist, Philanthropist," Stiviano's Instagram bio says.
