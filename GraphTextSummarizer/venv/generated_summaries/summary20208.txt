He read psychological journals, fitness blogs and books about weight loss to learn the underlying causes of obesity and proven strategies that worked for other people. When he got home, he took the family shopping for sweaters, warm gloves and other gear so they could spend more time outside and less time watching movie marathons and eating popcorn. Trotter, who spends a lot of time on the road, realized that he'd be more mindful about his food purchases if he stopped using plastic. As Trotter first started his weight-loss quest, he joined a program that provided protein shakes and pre-made meals, but quickly realized "I didn't have the money or the desire to eat out of a box my entire life." After several months of avoiding all the foods that were bad for him, Trotter said he realized he was obsessed about honey buns, cheese puffs and all the willpower-busting snacks he couldn't have.
