-- The family of deceased Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi will file a war crimes complaint against NATO with the International Criminal Court, a lawyer representing the family said Thursday. Members of the family believe NATO's actions led to Gadhafi's death last week, said Marcel Ceccaldi. In a statement Thursday, a NATO official said, "At no time during Operation Unified Protector has NATO targeted specific individuals." NATO responded that it "conducts its operation in strict conformity with the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions." The news came as the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to end NATO's military operations in Libya.
