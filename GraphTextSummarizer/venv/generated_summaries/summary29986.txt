Both the Hobby Lobby case -- which concerned the intersection of women's rights, religious freedom, and Obamacare -- and the Harris case, about the future of labor unions, were 5-4 decisions. Or is it, as the dissenters, led by Justice Elena Kagan, said, a vehicle to starve unions of the dollars they need to survive -- and negotiate precisely these kinds of contracts? And, she asks, "how does the Court divine which religious beliefs are worthy of accommodation, and which are not?" The same kind of conflict undergirds the union case. Is this, as Alito (again) held, simply a matter of preserving the freedom of speech rights of these employees? "The owners of many closely held corporations could not in good conscience provide such coverage," Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority, and to force them to do so would violate federal law.
