The sentences handed to Mohammad Saalli Shibin -- who authorities say negotiated for the release of pirate-held hostages and vessels in return for ransom -- follow his involvement in arranging ransoms for two dramatic, high-profile pirated vessels. That came just about one year after Shibin was captured in a raid in Somalia by Somali forces working with the FBI. Three other alleged pirates charged with the deaths of Americans Jean and Scott Adam of California, and their friends Bob Riggle and Phyllis Macay of Seattle, are scheduled to go on trial and will face potential death sentences. During negotiations for the four Americans, Shibin remained on shore and determined the size of the ransoms to be demanded, and he did not board the yacht himself, authorities said. -- A Somali man who authorities say is the highest-ranking pirate ever brought to the United States for prosecution was given 12 life sentences Monday by a federal judge in Norfolk, Virginia.
