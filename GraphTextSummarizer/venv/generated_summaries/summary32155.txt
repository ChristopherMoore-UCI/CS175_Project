Charlie's early '90s-era high school experience touches on drugs, alcohol, sex and abuse, and at the time of its publication, the book was one of many examinations of the darker side of the teen experience, said Vicky Smith, children's and teen editor for Kirkus Reviews. In the late '90s, "there was this wave, of what it felt like to a lot of people who worked with kids and books, of really depressing books," Smith recalled. " She was one of those kids "who listened to college radio," she joked, and while she might have wished to identify with love interest Sam or witty Patrick, it was the sensitive but openhearted Charlie with whom she connected. In a series of letters addressed to an anonymous reader, Charlie describes the disorientation of losing a friend to suicide, the ways high school can feel like an experiment in isolation, and, at the heart of the story, his bond with older students Sam and her stepbrother, Patrick. " Add in the strong reaction from schools and libraries -- "Perks" is no stranger to the American Library Association's list of frequently challenged books -- and the book was "viral" before anyone even knew what that was, Smith said.
