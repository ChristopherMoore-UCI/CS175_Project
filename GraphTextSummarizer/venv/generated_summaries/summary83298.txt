-- The future of English Premier League club Portsmouth was in doubt Friday after it was forced to go into administration with debts of around $90 million. The south coast side are the first Premier League side to call in administrators since the division was formed 18 years ago, fueling a financial boom in English football on the back of lucrative TV rights. The club has passed through a succession of owners this season but efforts to find a fifth broke down Tuesday when present owner Balram Chainrai confirmed the club would opt for administration to avert a winding up order from the UK government. Portsmouth are not the first football club to run into financial problems as a consequence of debts wracked up in pursuit of success on the field. Portsmouth's Chief Executive Peter Storrie said it was an "extremely sad day" but admitted going into administration had "kept the club alive and given someone an exceptional opportunity to take this great club on with fresh investment."
