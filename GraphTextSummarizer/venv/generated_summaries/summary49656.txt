Ryan and Storey say more testing needs to be done to assess how the particles released during washing affect the water supply, but they're confident a product could be on the market within the next two years. "We found out, rather wonderfully, that it works particularly well on denim jeans," she added while pointing out that there are more pairs of jeans than people on the planet. Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King's College London, and an adviser on the project, says air pollution is a major challenge in the 21st century and such initiatives could help. Ryan estimates that a pair of jeans weighing 500 grams could absorb around two grams of pollution. Other projects blending science with art followed before she met Ryan in 2005 collaborating on the Wonderland project where they explored sustainable ideas for packaging and environmentally-friendly fashion, which in turn inspired their latest venture.
