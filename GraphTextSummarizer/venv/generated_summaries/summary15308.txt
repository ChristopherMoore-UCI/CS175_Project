She has since gone on to amass 21 individual World Cup downhill wins and been crowned overall World Cup champion three times. Atherton narrowly missed out on a fourth World Cup crown this year -- she finished second to compatriot Manon Carpenter -- but she's setting her sights predictably high for 2015 targeting another World Cup and World Championship double. The friendly sibling rivalry has bred numerous individual wins, sometimes at the same World Cup events. It's an attitude that hasn't done her any harm so far with Atherton enjoying her most successful period in the sport in recent seasons, completing the World Championship and World Cup double in 2013. In 2004, aged 16, Atherton clinched the UK senior downhill title and four years later won her first World Championship.
