While continuing other work, including writing books and the film scores for "Rosemary's Baby," "Performance," and Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam War epic, Krause ventured into pristine landscapes across the world. Now in his 70s, Krause is resolved to keep up his field work, if need be by capturing soundscapes with digital recorders tucked into his pockets or tiny mics attached to his shoulders to avoid arousing unwanted attention. -- He provided the sense of dread to Martin Sheen's journey upriver in "Apocalypse Now," but for musician and "soundscape ecologist" Bernie Krause the authentic sound of the wild can be more disturbing than any synthesized film score. While some in the scientific community remain skeptical of Krause's ideas, they have been adopted by university courses in the U.S., and aided the study of ecology. Crouching in a pitch-black jungle while a jaguar growls nearby or recording the sound of ants "singing" is a long way from Krause's early career as a musician.
