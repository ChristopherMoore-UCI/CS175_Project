Thanks to a tough-loving accountability group, her personal trainer Shaun Lloyd and her own dedication, Riser has achieved what she calls her goal: proving that middle-aged women can lose weight. " And so began the mental transformation, unlocking Riser's determination and belief that she could lose weight. Riser had spent years avoiding fitness establishments out of embarrassment. That's definitely been important." Riser credits her family, friends and personal trainers for helping spur her lifestyle changes. "People say that when you get older, it's harder to lose weight," she said.
