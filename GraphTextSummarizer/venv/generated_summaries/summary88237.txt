Gourjian's former law firm, headed by lawyer Mark Geragos, raised the possible conflict of interest before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Pastor at a hearing Tuesday. Murray is also represented by Houston lawyer Ed Chernoff and J. Michael Flanagan of Los Angeles. "We have a great amount of respect for Mr. Gourjian, but it is our duty to disclose his participation in our past representation for Mr. Jackson," Geragos and Geragos attorney Pat Harris said. Murray, who is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the death of Michael Jackson, wants Gourjian to replace Joseph Low, who left the defense team earlier this month. The Geragos firm represented Jackson for two years starting in 2003, when he was charged with child molestation.
