-- Students at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee held a vigil Sunday night to remember a basketball player who was stabbed to death earlier in the day. "For Shannon to be killed in the prime of her life is tragic and senseless," said FAMU President James Ammons. Police found Shannon Washington with a knife wound to her neck in her apartment early Sunday morning. " Washington transferred to the university from Illinois Valley Community College and was expected to play in the fall as a shooting guard. Authorities have charged a friend, 20-year-old Starquineshia Palmer, with first-degree murder in the death.
