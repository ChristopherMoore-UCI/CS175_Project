Former Feyenoord coach Mario Been left the club after a disappointing season yielded a 10th place finish in the league and saw the one-time European champions humiliated 10-0 by PSV Eindhoven last October. Barcelona confirmed Thursday on their website that they had been successful in their pursuit of the 22-year-old, who had been linked to a number of other top European clubs. -- Champions League winners Barcelona have signed Chilean star Alexis Sanchez from Serie A Udinese on a five-year deal. The 33-year-old left-back has been signed as a replacement for Portugal international Fabio Coentrao, who departed Lisbon for Real Madrid earlier this month. Elsewhere, Dutch coach Ronald Koeman returned to football Thursday after agreeing to take the reigns at Dutch first division club Feyenoord.
