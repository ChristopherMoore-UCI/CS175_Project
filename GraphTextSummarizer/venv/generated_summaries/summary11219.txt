The first phase of Project Brabham is to raise enough capital to run a Brabham team in the World Endurance Championship for sports cars in 2015. " With the ambitions of Project Brabham and a third generation of racing talent, is there a chance we could one day see a Brabham racing a Brabham in F1?

That's the aim for the family of the late three-time world champion Sir Jack Brabham, whose eponymous team still roars with resonance through motorsport history. "Brabham sits alongside Ferrari, McLaren and Lotus because of what dad achieved," David Brabham, Sir Jack's youngest son, tells CNN.
