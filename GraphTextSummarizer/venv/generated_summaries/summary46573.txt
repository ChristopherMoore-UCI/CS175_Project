The Dreamliner relies on electricity to power more functions than previous Boeing airliners, and that takes a lot of battery power. Growing pains aren't unusual Other aircraft, including the Airbus A380, have had problems during rollout, said University of Dayton professor Raul Ordonez, an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing Dreamliner development at Boeing's Seattle headquarters. It's going to be "a big mess, cost Boeing a lot of money" and embarrass carriers that fly the 787, said aviation historian David T. Courtwright, a professor at the University of North Florida. Even if Boeing engineers get lucky and find the answer to the problem now, it might still take at least a couple weeks "to get up and running," he said. "That's aviation," says airline pilot Patrick Smith of the aviation blog Askthepilot.com.
