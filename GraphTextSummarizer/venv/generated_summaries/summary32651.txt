Andrew Getty, the 47-year-old grandson of J. Paul Getty, died Tuesday afternoon in his home in Los Angeles, according to a statement from his mother and father. Where the Getty family fortune came from Gordon Getty is one of three sons of J. Paul Getty, the oil tycoon who was thought to be the richest man in the world at the time of his death in 1976. Getty's death "appears to be natural (causes) or an accident," Ed Winter, assistant chief in the Los Angeles County coroner's office, told CNN affiliate KTLA Tuesday night. A female friend was at the home where Getty died and is cooperating with investigators, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Some medication had also been recovered from Getty's home, though investigators don't know if Getty was currently taking it or what his medical history was, Winter said.
