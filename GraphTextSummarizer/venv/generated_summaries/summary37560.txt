The FIA president went some way to addressing that criticism this week by sending a letter to an umbrella group of human rights activists in Bahrain. -- Formula One has returned to Bahrain amid conflicting views about the sport's place in a country where political tensions are running high. "Many people in Bahrain no longer see Formula One as a sport, but as an organization which supports a repressive regime," said a protest group comprised of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, the Bahrain Press Association, the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights and the Campaign Against Arms Trade. Bahrain maintains that has worked to resolve political differences, and the government argues the race will bring benefits to many Bahrainis. Some unfortunately believe that continued unrest on the streets affords them a political advantage, when it results in greater divisions between communities in Bahrain.
