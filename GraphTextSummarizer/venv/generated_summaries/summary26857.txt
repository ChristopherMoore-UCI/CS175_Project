But that passion for international football has cooled, especially for young English players, according to World Cup winner Patrick Vieira. " England expects Vieira's view that young English players were somewhat ambivalent about playing for their country might give the FA pause for thought. "But clubs like City, Manchester United and Chelsea will also always try and sign the exceptional player," added Vieira, when asked if the English Premier League champions were no longer interested in signing players such as Atletico Madrid striker Falcao, who is expected to leave the Spanish club next summer. Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri has not been recalled for France's upcoming friendly against Japan and World Cup qualifier against Spain even after serving a three-match ban imposed by the French Football Federation. City particularly liked the way aspiring NBA players spent much of their day within an academy environment, which helps them "to learn how to behave as an individual", said Vieira.
