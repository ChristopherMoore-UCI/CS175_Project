A federal judge in Los Angeles sentenced Patrick Cau, 40, on Monday, ordering him to pay $304,495 in restitution to United and $8,838 to the Los Angeles Police Department. Authorities said Cau, a German national also known as Patrick Kaiser, made eight bomb threats in late 2012 and early 2013 to United after being fired by the airline. Officials evacuated planes, re-screened passengers and searched bags and cargo, but did not find explosives. Most of the phone threats targeted United jets on his old route between Los Angeles and London. The bomb threats disrupted law enforcement agencies and inconvenienced passengers.
