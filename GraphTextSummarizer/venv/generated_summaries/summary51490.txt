In Tunica County, Mississippi, officials are expecting the the river to crest at 48 feet on Tuesday -- which will be a record since the levee was built along the county's riverbanks in the mid-1930s, county spokesman Larry Liddell told CNN. Some who live where the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers meet said it has helped. The state's department of transportation prepared a list of possible road closures, but as of Thursday afternoon, only one road was closed, Mississippi State Route 465 in Warren and Issaquena counties between U.S. Highway 61 and Eagle Lake, the agency said. On Thursday, 11 Mississippi counties along the Mississippi River were declared federal disaster areas in anticipation of major flooding, Gov. Haley Barbour said. He warned that without punching a hole in the levee, massive flooding would threaten to inundate communities throughout the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys.
