" Walton, too, cautions against the perception that maintaining natural hair means standing against chemical straighteners or straight hair overall. But Walton can vividly recall the days when straight hair meant beautiful hair, and if she couldn't be seen with it straight, she'd rather not go out at all. Hair will split after a period of time, and that's sometimes where thinning hair comes from." That conversation inspired Walton to take action, and she soon found herself researching ways she could work with the kind of hair she was born with. Nikki Walton, a 29-year-old licensed psychotherapist whose own journey to hair acceptance has grown from a passion into a business, knows that hurdle all too well.
