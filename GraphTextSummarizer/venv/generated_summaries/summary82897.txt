Goody says that in company tests, their head wraps offer 42 percent more hold than wraps made from fabric, jersey or plastic. When running on a treadmill, a typical sports bra might reduce bounce by about half; tests show that the Shock Absorber reduces it by 78 percent. Boob bounce Cause: Researchers at the University of Portsmouth in England have found that during high-impact activities like running, breasts move not just up and down, but also in a repetitive figure-8 pattern that is barely controlled by most standard sports bras. Solution: While nylon, cotton, jersey, polyester and Spandex headbands may stick to thick, textured hair, they can slide off a sweaty head of fine hair. It sounds perverse, feels miserable and leads to chafing, discomfort, weakened breast tissue and even an unstable stride, found the researchers.
