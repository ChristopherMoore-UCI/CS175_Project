About 350,000 customers across 12 states and the District of Columbia will be suffering in this heat without the benefits of electricity, including power for their air conditioning and for refrigeration to keep their food edible, according to a CNN count from Friday night. Most recently, two people died and eight were injured when a storm struck Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains National Park on Thursday night, park officials said. The hardest-hit state continues to be West Virginia, where about 167,000 customers had no power Friday night. Another three heat-related deaths were reported in Rock County, Wisconsin, according to Chief Deputy Coroner Louis Smit. On Friday afternoon, temperatures topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit from Chicago to Kansas City, Missouri, and Columbus, Ohio, and many places in between.
