Blake Pollack, who befriended Robertson 1Â½ years ago and has helped drive him to media interviews all week, helped pull off the surprise, suggesting they stop by a car dealership after lunch to pick up some brochures and start researching cars. Robertson and Pollack were joined by Evan Leedy, the college student who set up a GoFundMe page on Robertson's behalf. After reading about Robertson's commute in a Detroit Free Press article that went viral, Leedy was moved. Comments on the page from people donating money suggested the story of Robertson's dedication to getting to work had tapped into a deep well of public feeling. When the online donations rolled in,  Robertson, Pollack and Leedy met together for the first time this week.
