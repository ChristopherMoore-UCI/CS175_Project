-- Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro became the second player in the world's top 10 to withdraw from the French Open when a viral infection ruled him out of Sunday's championships in Paris. Despite his exit in the third round, he will always remember his time in the Italian capital after meeting with the Pope, a fellow Argentine, last week -- an experience del Potro said he would "never forget". Zheng will play Romina Oprandi of Switzerland in the quarterfinals, while Wozniacki must work out how to rediscover the form that took her to April's Indian Wells final ahead of Sunday's French Open. Del Potro reached the semifinals of Roland Garros in 2009 and the quarterfinals last year -- only to be beaten by Roger Federer on both occasions. The latest loss was all the more humbling given that Zheng had been on court four hours earlier to see off American qualifier Mallory Burdette in the first round.
