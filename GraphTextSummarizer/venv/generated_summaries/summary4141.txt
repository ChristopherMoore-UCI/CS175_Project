-- NASA scientists revealed Friday a first-of-its-kind image from space showing reflecting sunlight from a lake on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. "This is the first time outside Earth we've seen specular reflection from another liquid from another body," said Ralf Jaumann, a scientist analyzing data from the Cassini unmanned space probe. The photo comes from the spacecraft Cassini, which has been searching for this kind of reflection since it began circling Saturn in 2004. Jaumann said he was surprised when he first saw the photos transmitting from Cassini, orbiting Saturn about a billion miles from Earth. "The temperature on Titan's surface is something like minus-180 degrees Celsius," he said.
