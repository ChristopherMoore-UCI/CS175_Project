" Still, there is a large cadre of former Bush donors who backed Romney in 2012, and the former Florida Governor now can test their willingness to come back into the fold -- even as a Romney run hangs as a possibility. By giving himself a year to begin the courtship of activists in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early states, former New Hampshire GOP committeeman Tom Rath said, Bush "is taking these issues on and letting them play out -- and they typically lose a lot of their punch when they are played out and discussed over time... Of equal importance, Bush now has a long lead time to confront the most formidable challenge facing his bid: winning over core Republican activists in the early states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina who vehemently disagree with his moderate stance on immigration reform and his support for Common Core educational standards. " Longtime Iowa political observer Craig Robinson, said Bush's announcement caught many Republican activists in Iowa off guard because he has spent so little time there, but it was viewed Tuesday as a wise move. "I've spoken with Mitt Romney, who I consider to be a great friend and a great leader, about 2016, and I've always been under the assumption if people he trusts like Jeb Bush decide to run that he would not decide to do that," he said.
