" Online customer reviews are now big business and, according to Margaret Ady of TrustYou, a company that tracks and aggregates reviews in the hospitality industry, online opinion is now the No.1 factor in influencing consumer choices. " While hotels and restaurants have been paying attention to online reviews for the past five or more years, Ady says it's only relatively recently that companies are starting to see them as a valuable marketing tool. It's become the most trustworthy source of information for most travelers and peer reviews are really driving bookings," Ady told CNN. " Online reviews are also becoming a powerful marketing tool for companies, with a spread of opinions not only showing up the strengths and weaknesses of a given service provider but also those of its rivals. Peer reviews have now changed the marketing landscape for hotels, restaurants and holiday destinations.
