Beatty and Gallina say their new mission is more than just providing veterans with accessible homes; it's about encouraging communities to get involved with those who served their country. Beatty and Gallina know that projects such as adding ramps or renovating bathrooms can make a big difference for veterans and their caregivers. When the house was finished, Beatty and Gallina decided to "pay it forward" to help other disabled veterans. "There's thousands of veterans right here in our midst," Beatty said. Beatty and Gallina believe that working with community members makes a big difference to veterans, who can often feel isolated and socially withdrawn.
