Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told a French magazine that "there haven't been any tangible" signs that U.S.-led airstrikes in his country have weakened ISIS, despite assertions Wednesday by America's top diplomat that "significant progress" has been made in derailing the Islamist extremist group. U.S. Central Command said that between Monday and Wednesday of this week, there were 14 coalition airstrikes in Syria -- all of them near Kobani, the city near the Turkish border that in recent weeks has become a key battleground in the ongoing fight -- in addition to 11 such strikes inside Iraq. Airstrikes mark shift in coalition focus to ISIS 'capital' Yet al-Assad said in his Paris Match interview, which took place on November 28 in Damascus and will be published in full Thursday, that the U.S.-led military campaign has limited use because "you can't end terrorism with aerial strikes. " After first striking ISIS targets in Iraq, the U.S.-led coalition went after the group inside Syria in September. Kerry says anti-ISIS coalition has made progress U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, however, offered a very different view of the anti-ISIS fight Wednesday.
