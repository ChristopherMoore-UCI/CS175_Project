Before it brings a TV or phone to the United States, Lenovo will focus on improving its brand through PCs, and on building relationships with U.S. cellular carriers and retailers, Yuanqing said. The company will take a different approach, however, when it expands in the U.S., Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing said in an interview here. Pinching pennies delays the U.S. expansion because Lenovo can't accumulate enough profit to fund development in other areas like smartphones or TVs, he said. U.S. retailers have suggested that Lenovo should price its computers $50 below competitors' comparable systems, advice the company has heeded because it hasn't achieved a strong brand in America, Yuanqing said. Lenovo Group has grown significantly in the U.S. in the last few years thanks to its aggressive pricing and the 2005 acquisition of International Business Machines' PC division, which has catapulted Lenovo's sales to corporations.
