Isaac told police Gillespie owed him $2,000 for work he claims he did for her, said NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. During questioning, Browne said, he implicated himself in Gillespie's death. The incident was caught on surveillance cameras inside and outside the elevator, and police have the videotapes, Browne said. "This is as bad as it gets," Browne told CNN's Don Lemon. Authorities believe Isaac initially sprayed the woman with a flammable liquid, presumably gasoline, and continued to spray her as he followed her back into the elevator, Browne said.
