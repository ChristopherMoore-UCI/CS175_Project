You would easily get a child or infant in it," Aldridge said, though he added that research by the Smithsonian, the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag. It was the second auction in less than a year at Henry Aldridge & Son for Dean, who was a 9-week-old baby when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912. The 17 items belonging to 97-year-old Millvina Dean sold for about $8,000 on Saturday, according to auctioneer Alan Aldridge -- not enough to pay for two months at her nursing home. But the bidder who bought the Dean item with the closest connection to the doomed voyage returned it to her after the sale, Aldridge said. The canvas bag might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, Aldridge said.
