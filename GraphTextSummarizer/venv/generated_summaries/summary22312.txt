Leno and Laberge met through Leno's USO comedy tour with the "Today" show's Al Roker. " Once they were done taking turns behind the wheel -- and after a pit stop for some barbecue -- Leno handed the keys to the Hellcat over to Laberge. Leno hoped to take his mind off some of that with the simple gift of a joyride in a 2015 Dodge SRT Hellcat through the open roads of Fort Campbell, Kentucky. " Laberge was on foot patrol in Afghanistan when a suicide bomber detonated himself on the street where Laberge was standing. Leno added on "Today" Wednesday that he "wanted to do something a little bit different" to show his gratitude to servicemen and women.
