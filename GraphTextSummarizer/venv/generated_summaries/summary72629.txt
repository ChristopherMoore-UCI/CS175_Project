"What we are witnessing is a sea change in Iranian political culture and political discourse that cannot be ignored if [incumbent Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad comes to power, nor should it be too expecting of massive changes if [challenger Mir Hossein] Moussavi comes into power," said Dr. Hamid Dabashi, professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Literature at Columbia University in New York City.
