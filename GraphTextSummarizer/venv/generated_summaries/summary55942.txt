Vice President Joe Biden opened the door Wednesday to a potential presidential primary challenge to former secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary. " Both Clinton and Biden have made no secret of their interest in running in 2016, but Clinton allies have been building an organization that encompasses many of the key strategists and operatives in the Democratic field, and she holds a significant double-digit lead in every poll of the potential field. Biden doesn't always come in second — that position in Democrats' hearts is often held by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a liberal icon whom many progressives see as their only alternative to Clinton. "Yes, there is a chance" he would challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016, he said on ABC's "Good Morning America. In the meantime, the vice president has friendly remarks for Clinton — he called her a "really competent, capable person and a friend."
