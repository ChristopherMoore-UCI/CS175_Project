-- A theater company from South Sudan is translating Shakespeare into the local dialect for the first time, before performing the play at London's Globe Theatre. The South Sudan Theatre Company (SSTC) is helping to develop that culture by performing Shakespeare's tragedy "Cymbeline" in Juba Arabic -- a language spoken widely in South Sudan. Although English has been named South Sudan's official language since the country's independence, Juba Arabic is still a lingua franca in much of South Sudan, says Ngbangu. Juba Arabic is a pidgin form of Arabic that takes its name from the South Sudanese capital of Juba. Ngbangu says they plan to perform Cymbeline in Juba before taking it to London in May.
