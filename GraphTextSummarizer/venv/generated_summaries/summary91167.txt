" "The View" has been in a state of flux for the past year, with longtime personalities Joy Behar and Elisabeth Hasselbeck taping their final shows in mid-2013. -- Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy are weathering changes at "The View" changes with a smile. Jenny McCarthy was added to the "View" panel last July, but it appears that she, too, is leaving.
