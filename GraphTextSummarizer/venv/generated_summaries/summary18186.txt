According to Livestrong, Armstrong has helped raise nearly $500 million, including $6.5 million of his own, for cancer research, treatment and support in his role as Livestrong founder and has helped "dispel the stigma and misconceptions about the disease." "I personally hope that Livestrong is stronger than Lance Armstrong because they have done -- and continue to do -- amazing work for people with cancer," he told CNN in a telephone interview. Armstrong founded the Livestrong charity in 1997 after his own successful treatment for testicular cancer that had spread to his brain and lungs. So far, Armstrong's woes haven't affected the charity's ability to raise money, according to Livestrong spokeswoman Katherine McClane. Armstrong walked away as chairman of the Livestrong cancer charity "to spare the foundation any negative effects as a result of controversy surrounding my cycling career," according to a statement posted to the group's website.
