Michael Keaton's prize for best actor in a comedy or musical seemed to signal a big night for "Birdman," which also won for best screenplay. That's because after a year that movie pundits considered among the more dismal in both overall quality and box office returns, there hasn't been a movie showing big-footed momentum heading into awards season. Voters for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group of about 90 who write about movies and TV for the international press, have very little connection with or bearing upon the thousands of actors, directors, cinematographers, producers, writers, directors and other movie trades people who'll be voting on the Academy Awards. But "The Grand Budapest Hotel" scored the best comedy or musical Globe, while "Boyhood" won for best drama. The topical jokes from co-hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler -- including a couple of pointed (and not too shabby) impressions of a lascivious Bill Cosby -- landed deftly enough, though the running gag featuring Margaret Cho as a grim-faced North Korean representative of the Hollywood press may have gone on slightly longer than it needed.
