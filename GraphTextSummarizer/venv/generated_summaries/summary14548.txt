The prominence of fast food franchises is one of the issues that bothers Emanuele Esposito, an Italian chef who has worked in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for six years. When Esposito first moved to Saudi Arabia, he only planned to stay a couple of years, but six years later he has no plans to leave. "The country has developed a lot in food and hospitality, but there's still a lot of American influence and fast food," said Esposito. "Before we launched, Saudi Arabia didn't have any forum for people to review and recommend restaurants." Alongside the Saudi and Middle Eastern restaurants, there are Italian restaurants and Japanese has really taken off in the last few years.
