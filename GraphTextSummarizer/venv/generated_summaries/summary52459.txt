"The best sound in the world is Leo's laugh, but the absolute worst sound in the world is him crying over his mom when she's dying." Leo Klink takes solace in the fact that his mom leaves behind something beyond her husband and son. Because her dream was for Leo to get a college education, friends have set up a fund to help that can be accessed at the Leo Klink Fund Facebook page. It was the Hawaii state high school soccer championship, and Klink, a senior on the underdog Kalani Falcons, had state power Punahou in his sights. Hiroyo Klink was in that ambulance, and the last person she wanted to know that was Leo. " When good things happen, Leo always says "we." "He's the most unassuming star," says Aundrea Toner, one of Leo's longtime coaches.
