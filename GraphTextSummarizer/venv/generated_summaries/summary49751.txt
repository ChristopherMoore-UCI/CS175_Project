"But more older people also means an increased demand on health care and social security systems." The WHO itself marked World Health Day with festivities at its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. " Leaders and nonprofit organizations took to Twitter to mark World Health Day and toast the WHO, whose constitution was enacted April 7, 1948, to affirm its mission as the "directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system." "If we can ensure that people are living healthier as well as longer lives, the opportunities will be greater and the costs to society less," WHO Director-General Margaret Chan said in the foreword of the "Global Brief for World Health Day 2012." The U.N. itself also chimed in, with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urging civic and private leaders to devote "attention and resources to ensuring that people everywhere have the chance to grow older in good health." The WHO said it is important that older people are engaged in their societies and in their health, and that citizens and governments are similarly committed.
