The safety board said unoccupied CTA trains are "routinely left powered up" while stored at the repair yard. But CTA spokesman Brian Steele disputed that, saying trains are typically powered up prior to going into service. Steele said the CTA has inspected about half of the 600 to 700 cars in its fleet without finding similar damage. -- Federal accident investigators issued two "urgent" recommendations to the Chicago Transit Authority on Friday urging action to prevent another crash similar to one this week in which an unoccupied CTA train collided with another at a station, injuring 33 people. The actions recommended by the board need "to be addressed expeditiously to prevent a recurrence," NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman wrote in the letter to Forrest Claypool, president of the CTA.
