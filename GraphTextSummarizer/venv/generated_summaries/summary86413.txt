The trailer debuted at Comic-Con this weekend, and according to the Sydney Morning Herald, Miller said during the Comic-Con panel that this film packs in a lot of mileage. Where the 1979 film starred Mel Gibson, this time around, Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron are at the helm. "I love chase movies; I think they're the purest form of cinema," Miller said. George Miller, who directed the original, is back on board for this one. "Mad Max: Fury Road" is scheduled for release May 15.
