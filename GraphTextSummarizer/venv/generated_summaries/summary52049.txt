-- South Korean President Lee Myung-bak held a special meeting Thursday morning to discuss an urgent plan to evacuate South Korean construction workers in Libya. A spate of attacks and violent break-ins have been reported at some construction sites in Libya amid growing anti-government protests and violence. Almost 600 companies rely on business in Libya, exporting goods such as ships, cars and heavy industries, a lucrative market worth $1.4 billion last year. The Middle East is a substantial and important market for South Korean construction companies. The South Korean government has advised its citizens to cancel all nonurgent travel to Libya.
