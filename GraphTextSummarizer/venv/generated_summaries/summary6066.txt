Aides caution that Rubio hasn't made up his mind yet, and that these preparations will be just as useful for a Senate campaign if he decides to run for reelection. Attendees included Al Cardenas, former chairman of the American Conservative Union and a supporter of both Rubio and Jeb Bush; Dirk Van Dongen, chair of Rubio's D.C. steering committee; Matt Keelen, a major Rubio donor, and Geoff Verhoff, a D.C. lobbyist and a member of Rubio's D.C. steering committee. Sen. Marco Rubio is on track to run for president if he decides to jump in the race, an aide tells CNN. "Florida's going to be the number one state in a presidential election and in the U.S. Senate election, and whether you're running for reelection in the Senate in a race that could cost 100 million, or you're running for president, you need an incredible effort just for the reelection," he said. While the freshman Florida senator gathered donors and staff at the posh Delano hotel, at least 10 Republican hopefuls were addressing potential Iowa caucus-goers and former governors Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney criss-crossed the country meeting with voters and Republican officials.
