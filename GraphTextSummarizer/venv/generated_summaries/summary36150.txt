Gore said that successful political activism online can decrease the influence of money from special interests. But he and Parker noted that, in the next generation of Web activism, there needs to be a way to strengthen engagement beyond merely putting a digital signature on an online petition or clicking "like" on Facebook. Gore joined Sean Parker, the mind behind Napster and founding president of Facebook, on a two-man panel at the digital festival Monday during which both decried the influence of money in politics and pointed to the Internet as the answer. "My hope is that the Internet can do for the political process what it did for the copyright industries." Parker is a backer and board member of Votizen, a site started in 2010 to help users parlay their social networks into political activism. Gore, who in addition to his well-documented environmental activism is a technology investor and founder of Current TV, pointed to recent examples of Web-enabled activism -- from the Web's role in democratic reform in Egypt to successful protests of the Susan G. Komen Foundation after it pulled funding for Planned Parenthood.
