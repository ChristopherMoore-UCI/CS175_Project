After Katy Perry posted a picture of her and Hillary Clinton, it only took Vice President Joe Biden a few days to one-up the former secretary of state. When Clinton said she hadn't driven a car in nearly 20 years, Biden was quick to profess his love of American sports cars and even suggested that not being able to drive the new Corvette could be the one reason he doesn't run for president. It's not the first time Biden has trumped Clinton news with a little "news" of his own as speculation simmers about whether they will run for the presidency in 2016. But the day Clinton's book was released, Biden brought up his own encounters with world leaders and the frequent flier miles he has racked up as vice president -- more than 900,000. "What a Q-T," Perry captioned the Instagram photo of her and Biden, who is a fan, a White House official told CNN.
