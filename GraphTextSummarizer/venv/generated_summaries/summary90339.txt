A car bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant in Hafriya about 35 km southeast of Baghdad on Wednesday afternoon, according to police and health officials. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the recent attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda. Violence has dropped dramatically in Iraq since the peak of Sunni-Shiite clashes in 2006 and 2007 and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country in December 2011, but insurgent attacks against civilians and security forces persist. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki Tuesday night to reaffirm U.S. support of the Iraqi government, al-Maliki's office said. A car bomb targeting a security convoy exploded near two hotels in central Baghdad, killing a person near the scene of the blast and wounding seven others.
