The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Denver by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers and U.S. Attorney John Walsh and announced in a joint press release, alleges Bella Homes scammed more than 450 unsuspecting homeowners across the nation, including five in Colorado. "Bella Homes gave false hope to desperate homeowners, taking advantage of their desire to do anything to save their homes," said U.S. Attorney John Walsh. The company also told homeowners they would have an exclusive option to "repurchase their homes in three years for 90 percent of its fair market value and receive credit for 60 percent of the rent paid to Bella Homes," according to the release. Bella Homes also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors to minimize the negative impact on homeowners and provide a list of homeowners in the Bella Homes program, according to court documents. -- Bella Homes LLC, a real estate investment company, and its principals are being sued by the federal government and the state of Colorado for allegedly preying on homeowners in foreclosure.
