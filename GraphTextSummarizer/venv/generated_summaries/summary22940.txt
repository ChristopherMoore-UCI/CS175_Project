-- India's Mars Orbiter Mission successfully entered Mars' orbit Wednesday morning, becoming the first nation to arrive on its first attempt and the first Asian country to reach the Red Planet. India's Mars Orbiter Mission is in the company of NASA's two Mars rovers on the ground, a European orbiter and NASA orbiters including the MAVEN, which has been there since Sunday. Once nears Mars' orbit, India's spacecraft had to execute a series of complicated and critical maneuvers. The spacecraft launched on November 5, and has traveled over 650 million kilometers to enter Mars orbit. Some space observers noted that India's Mars orbiter cost less than the $100 million budget for the space thriller film "Gravity."
