The program is designed to see how Wi-Fi can help relieve wireless data congestion on AT&T's network. The pilot program will offer free Wi-Fi access to AT&T wireless and broadband customers using smartphones, laptops, and other Wi-Fi enabled devices. The telephone company has been investing in its network to improve capacity and network coverage. And in the first quarter, AT&T handled 53.1 million Wi-Fi connections on its network, which is nearly five times higher than the same quarter last year. One of the biggest advantages of Wi-Fi is that it's already in most devices.
