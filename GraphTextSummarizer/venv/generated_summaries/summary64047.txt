"Whether you're a consumer or run a business, the Postal Service continues to offer a good deal during a time when we're all looking for ways to save," said spokesman Stephen M. Kearney. "The Forever Stamp is always honored for a 1-ounce letter with no need for additional postage," Kearney said. Under law, the price of stamps is not allowed to rise faster than the U.S. consumer price index, which measures inflation. The Postal Service said the price increase was necessary because of rising production costs. The U.S. Postal Service announced Tuesday a 2-cent increase on first-class stamps, effective May 11.
