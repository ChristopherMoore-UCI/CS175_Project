The killing of Laurens County Deputy Kyle Dinkheller was captured on the deputy's dash camera just outside Dublin, Georgia. The state's high court had also denied Brannan's request for an appeal on the basis that it is unconstitutional to execute a person with his medical conditions and combat history. Brannan was scheduled to die of lethal injection at 7 p.m. ET Tuesday at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson. In a petition filed Monday with Butts County Superior Court, Brannan's attorneys requested his life be spared because "executing American combat veterans whose service-related mental impairments played a role in subsequent violent conduct violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and analogous provisions of the Georgia Constitution." Attorneys for the 66-year-old Brannan had hoped his sentence would be found unconstitutional.
