"If you look at severe head injury victims who go on to make a good recovery -- and I'm not saying all do -- it will always be a story of years," Peter Hamlyn, a consultant neurological and spinal surgeon and expert in the field of head injuries in sport told CNN in June. The French racer, driving for the now defunct Marussia team, was left with severe head injuries when his car skidded off track in wet conditions and collided with a recovery vehicle. The difficulty with complex head injuries is that there is no predictable prognosis or timeline for recovery. After emergency brain surgery in France and nine months in hospital, Schumacher has been moved to the family home near Lake Geneva in Switzerland to continue his rehabilitation. Schumacher's son Mick, who is beginning his own racing career in go-karts, had been among the skiing party when the F1 star fell and hit his head on a rock at the French Alps resort of Meribel.
