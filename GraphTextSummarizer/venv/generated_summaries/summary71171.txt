-- Craig Fugate, the Federal Emergency Management Agency administrator, told CNN the agency is in "good shape" to support the recovery in Oklahoma and in other disaster zones, such as rebuilding after Superstorm Sandy in New Jersey and New York. -- Moore, Oklahoma, Mayor Glenn Lewis said Wednesday that the last six people missing from this week's tornado have been accounted for. The seven child victims at Plaza Towers Elementary were in a classroom -- not a basement -- and they did not die from flooding, Moore Fire Department Chief Gary Bird told CNN on Wednesday. "I have six councilmen, and I need four votes to get it passed," Mayor Glenn Lewis told CNN on Wednesday. -- Insurance claims related to damage from Monday's tornado and storm in metropolitan Oklahoma City are likely to top $2 billion, said Collins.
