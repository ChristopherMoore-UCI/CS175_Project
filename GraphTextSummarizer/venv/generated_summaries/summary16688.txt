Scott Walker brought his Midwestern swagger to New Hampshire on Saturday, leading a crowd of activists to cheers as he sought to draw a contrast to his top-tier rival in the unofficial GOP presidential race, Jeb Bush. Walker's more private itinerary included meetings with New Hampshire business and political leaders, including Massachusetts' former senator, Scott Brown, who resides in New Hampshire and ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate seat in the state last year. Answering a question from another audience member, Walker laid down his staunch opposition to Common Core, a set of testing standards that Bush defended as usual during his visit to New Hampshire on Friday. Activists gathered at Concord High School for a training event that was hosted by the New Hampshire GOP and headlined by Walker's appearance. On Saturday, he also put on a cap handed to him by an audience member with the logo for Gun Owners of New Hampshire.
