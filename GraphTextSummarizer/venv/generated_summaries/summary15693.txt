The U.S. State Department also criticized Iran's treatment of Baha'i followers in a report last year. The European Parliament passed a resolution in January that criticized Iran's treatment of Baha'is. "As Iranian human beings, we are ashamed for what has been perpetrated upon the Baha'is in the last century and a half in Iran," the letter says. Members of Baha'i -- who say they are targeted in the predominantly Shiite nation because of their faith -- have faced arrests and other oppression over the years. Baha'i -- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- claims to have 5 million members across the globe and about 300,000 in Iran.
