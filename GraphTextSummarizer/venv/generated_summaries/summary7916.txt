Writer-director Paul Haggis ("Crash,") who adapted "The Next Three Days" from a 2008 French thriller, "Pour Elle," clearly has Alfred Hitchcock's wrong-man-in-wrong-place psychological archetype in mind as John weaves all over Pittsburgh. -- "The Next Three Days" follows an ordinary guy named John (Russell Crowe) as he executes a wildly complicated plan to spring his wife, Lara (Elizabeth Banks,) from prison, where she has been locked up for a murder she says she didn't commit. First, however, he does some Internet homework that leads him to Damon (Liam Neeson,) an ex-con-turned-author who provides expert advice on the art of escape. So, spurred by love, despair, and belief in his wife's innocence, John turns to desperate measures. It also sets up the movie's real strength, which is generating escalating waves of plot tension and misdirection as John, heeding advice, makes his jail-busting moves.
