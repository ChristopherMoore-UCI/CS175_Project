How can there be peace when the Department of Justice found black residents in Ferguson were preyed upon for years by a corrupt Police Department? It is more convenient to say the violence began when rioters threw bricks at police and not when a city's Police Department began terrorizing its residents. Sen. Paul's rationale falls apart when you consider that John Henry Crawford III was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Ohio while on the phone talking with the mother of his two children. This comes on the heels of Mayor Rahm Emanuel establishing a $5.5 million reparations fund for victims of former CPD commander John Burge. We criticize Baltimore's mayor for not "restoring order" as if paying victims of police brutality nearly $6 million in a four-year span is "order." Now, some people are partially blaming the 2013 movie "The Purge" for the uprising in Baltimore as if the 1996 riots in St. Petersburg, Florida, happened on a different planet.
