But it looked like Wiz, who was born Cameron Jibril Thomaz, wasn't too stressed about the situation as he tweeted a pic of himself in jail with the caption "Jail selfie." He has been cited for simple possession of marijuana in the past, including in 2012 before one of his concerts in North Carolina. He also tweeted a picture of the barred jail door saying "Free Trap Wiz." According to TMZ, the rapper -- who has a well-documented penchant for toking -- was arrested early Sunday morning at a Texas airport after a "green leafy substance" was found during a security check. MTV reported that he was released after a few hours and charged with being in possession of 0.5 grams of marijuana.
