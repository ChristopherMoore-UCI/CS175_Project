Fears about the spread of swine flu during Hajj extend across the whole Middle East region and governments have been quick to publish guidance. The latest cases highlight concerns that the Hajj pilgrimage will hasten the spread of swine flu. But concerns must persist about countries with large Muslim populations and higher levels of swine flu infection. Saudi Arabia has already put in place quarantine facilities at major airports in the country so that pilgrims suspected of carrying swine flu can be safely isolated. In the UK, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Web site report that around 25,000 British Muslims attend Hajj every year.
