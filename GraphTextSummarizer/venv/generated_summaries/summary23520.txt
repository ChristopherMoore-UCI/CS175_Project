The forensic geologist was brought into the case to analyze the lighting conditions in Pistorius' home, specifically the main bedroom and connected bathroom. Valentine's Day card Pistorius cried and his voice trembled as prosecutor Gerrie Nel challenged his account of what happened the night he shot and killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. The Olympic and Paralympic athlete said he was "overcome with a sense of terror and vulnerability" before he shot through a closed bathroom door last year, fearing an intruder was inside. The prosecution contends that Pistorius shot Steenkamp intentionally after a heated argument, which Pistorius has repeatedly denied. The defense ended its re-examination of Pistorius by giving the court a piece of evidence: the Valentine's Day card that Steenkamp wrote to Pistorius.
