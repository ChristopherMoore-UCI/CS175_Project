These safeguards will cut mercury pollution from power plants by more than 90% and dramatically reduce our kids' exposure to mercury, as well as cancer-causing substances such as arsenic and chromium. By cleaning up or retiring coal plants and transitioning to clean, renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, we can protect our economy, create jobs and attain cleaner air for our families. The good news is that last year, the Obama administration set historic mercury and air toxics standards to curb mercury pollution from new coal-fired power plants. On Wednesday, the Senate will vote on whether to overturn the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. Mercury from coal-fired power plants rains down into our rivers, streams and oceans, where it can contaminate the fish we eat.
