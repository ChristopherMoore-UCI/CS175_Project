John King: Obama at odds with himself on immigration Boehner's haul Denham and McClintock epitomize the challenge that lies before House Speaker John Boehner regarding immigration reform -- a divided party with divergent views on immigration. Rosemary Jenks, executive director of Numbers USA, a group that favors a reduction of immigration, said McClintock is more in line with Republican voters' views. "(California's representatives) can't let somebody else, who doesn't have a stake in this, determine the outcome." But giving McClintock cover, however, is the local chapter of the Chamber. "I've seen it in my own home district where families have been torn apart," Denham said, describing the current maze of immigration laws and enforcement. His congressional neighbor and fellow Republican, Rep. Tom McClintock, couldn't disagree more.
