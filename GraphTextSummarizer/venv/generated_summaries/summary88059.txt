Retired Gen. Mark Kimmitt said smaller al Qaeda affiliates are coalescing into a more organized base. "This group is still potentially a pretty virulent threat, unfortunately." Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, is considered the most dangerous al Qaeda affiliate. New questions were being asked Wednesday after a video surfaced showing what looks like the largest and most dangerous gathering of al Qaeda in years. Al-Wuhayshi is the No. 2 leader of al Qaeda globally and the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Asked by Blitzer why al Qaeda would release such a video, Bergen speculated that the group did it for propaganda purposes.
