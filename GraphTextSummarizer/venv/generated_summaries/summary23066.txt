As families prepare for air travel this coming Memorial Day weekend, United Airlines won't be offering early boarding to families in coach with small children. Previously, families with small children flying coach were allowed on aircraft before general boarding, a convenience for moms and dads trying to herd their kids across the friendly skies. As a policy, American Airlines also does not specifically allow families with children to get on aircraft before general boarding. "We figured it would be better to simplify that process and reduce the number of boarding groups," said United spokesman Charles Hobart. JetBlue offers families traveling coach with children under age 2 to board early, the airline said.
