They want to protect children wrongly identified as orphans from being moved out of the country or falling victim to child traffickers. -- There's nothing like images of infants and children in distress to make outsiders yearn to help, which is why the unfolding story of Haiti's orphans -- the most  helpless of earthquake victims -- has kept people riveted. The oversight of children in the system has been lousy in Haiti, de Bono said, and parents -- burdened by hardships -- have been known to leave their children in orphanages on a temporary basis. These worries, and the desire to rejoin children with their loving family members, are not lost on U.S. lawmakers who came out Tuesday in support of a more efficient adoption process for Haiti. Despite the large number of orphans, as of last summer, Haiti had only about 100 licensed orphanages and 67 cr√®ches (orphanages licensed to perform adoptions), according to the Haitian Adoption Authority, or IBESR.
