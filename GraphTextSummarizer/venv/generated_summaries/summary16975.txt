The man police suspect made the video, Montreal resident Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, was captured in Berlin on Monday after an extensive international manhunt. It's clear in this case how social media has been changing all aspects of crime: how it is conducted, how it is reported and how the public becomes involved. The rapid expansion of social media means people can share pretty much everything online shortly after it happens, even video of a real dismemberment. Clearly law enforcement agencies aren't about to start accepting cash from the public to download graphic videos they have obtained during their investigations. Some who have viewed the recent video in this new disturbing twist in social media crime may regret it.
