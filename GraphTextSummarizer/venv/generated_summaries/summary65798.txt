British Airways has opened an extra call center manned by volunteers to help customers, the Monday statement said. The airline said it has also made agreements with 40 other carriers to rebook customers free of charge during the strike period if their British Airways flights are canceled. The industrial action is over planned changes to cabin crew conditions, which British Airways says will save the carrier more than Â£60 million (approximately $90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew levels to be cut, changes that it has said will damage customer service and the BA brand. "Around 60 percent of our customers will be able to fly as planned and many thousands more can be rebooked onto alternative BA flights or onto rival airlines.
