"There are ... well-documented cases of individual children being tortured and executed, and entire families, including babies, being massacred," U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said at the time. " "What is most disturbing about the findings of this report is not only the sheer numbers of children killed in this conflict, but the way they are being killed," co-author Hana Salama said in a statement. Teenage boys were most likely to be the victims of targeted killings, according to the report, entitled "Stolen Futures: The Hidden Toll of Child Casualties in Syria. And what's worse, deaths of children are "mounting," the report said. More than 11,000 children have been killed in the nearly three-year civil war in Syria, including young boys and girls who were tortured and executed, according to a report from a London-based think tank.
