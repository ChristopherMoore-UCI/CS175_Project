Balotelli marked his first outing since March 7 with the second seven minutes after halftime with a cool finish following a pass from strike partner Diego Milito. Fiorentina drew 1-1 at Parma to maintain eighth place on goal difference from Genoa, who were held by the same score at home to bottom club Livorno. Rodrigo Taddei missed a late chance to double the lead as Claudio Ranieri's team extended their unbeaten Serie A run to 22 matches. Former Italy striker Antonio Cassano scored in the first minute and fellow forward Giampaolo Pazzini made it 2-0 in the 55th before the 14th-placed Verona side lost defender Santiago Morero following a second booking in nine minutes. Second-placed Roma kept in touch with six matches to play following a 1-0 victory at mid-table Bari, where striker Mirko Vucinic returned from illness to net the winner in the 19th minute.
