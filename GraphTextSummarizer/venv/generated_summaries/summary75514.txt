Highway 20, which connects Montreal with Toronto, was shut in both directions for hours. -- Two people died Thursday when a fireworks plant exploded near Montreal, federal police in Quebec said. "You could see the fireworks going off," said Stacey Hylen, who was bicycling with her husband and 5-year-old daughter to a nearby school to watch her 10-year-old participate in a mini triathlon. The plant is located a mile north of the school in the town of Coteau-du-Lac, nearly an hour's drive southwest of Montreal. Soon, police and fire vehicles arrived, but firefighters were initially unable to approach the buildings, which continued to be rocked by explosions.
