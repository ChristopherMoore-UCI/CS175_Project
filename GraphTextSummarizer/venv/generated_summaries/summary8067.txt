Wall Street Journal Europe "circulation programs were fully disclosed and certified," the company said in a statement. The British agency that audits circulation figures does not differentiate between papers that are sold at face value and those distributed in bulk -- unlike the American agency, the Journal said. Langhoff and a Journal circulation department employee named Gert Van Mol also directed thousands of euros to ELP in side deals, the newspaper said Thursday, citing unnamed "people familiar with the matter. The accusations against Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal Europe were first reported by Nick Davies, a reporter for the Guardian who has been investigating scandals at News Corp. newspapers for several years. " ELP partner Nick Van Heck said the company had invoiced for services it had actually provided, but that the invoices went to "different organizations and not to the Wall Street Journal Europe," the paper reported.
