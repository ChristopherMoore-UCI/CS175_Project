A Coast Guard MH-65 Dolphin helicopter and the Coast Guard Cutter Cushing were sent to the area to search late Saturday. The FBI is investigating why Tien Phuoc Nguyen, 26, jumped overboard while on a cruise with his family, a Coast Guard news release said Sunday. The U.S. Coast Guard is searching off the coast of Puerto Rico for a Canadian who witnesses say jumped off a cruise ship Saturday night. Adventure of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean International cruise ship, was about 15 miles east of Mona Island, Puerto Rico, when Nguyen jumped into the water, the Coast Guard said. The cruise ship, which was sailing to San Juan, immediately turned around to search for the missing passenger, a statement from Royal Caribbean International said.
