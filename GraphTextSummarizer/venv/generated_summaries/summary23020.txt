In January, dozens of Air Force officers at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana charged with maintaining nuclear missiles, were accused of cheating or turning a blind eye to cheating on a competency test. In another 2013 incident, 17 officers at Minot Air Force Base were stripped of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles after their unit performed poorly on an inspection, with one officer investigated for potential compromise of nuclear launch codes. Regarding personnel at nuclear facilities, the report found issues with accountability, morale and recognition, as well as a rapidly aging civilian workforce in some areas, and a lack of promotion opportunities for nuclear officers in the Air Force. That was a recommendation made by Air Force Secretary Deborah James, along with members of Congress earlier this year, who said the missions deserved higher level of leadership. In his remarks Friday, Hagel noted that while President Barack Obama's administration is moving away from reliance on nuclear weapons, that arsenal remains a key part of the U.S. military.
