Though initially reported missing, the English bulldog that was the mascot for sports teams at Louisiana Tech University actually died of heatstroke, officials said Wednesday. " The university, in Ruston, said in a statement that since becoming the mascot in 2008, Tech XX got superior care and a loving home from Sexton's team. "Tech XX was a member of our immediate family and a daily part of our lives for the past four years," Patrick Sexton said in a statement. His predecessor, Tech XIX, was retired in 2007 because of health concerns after suffering heatstroke, the university said on its website. The veterinarian that kept Tech XX said a now-fired employee left the dog outside on Sunday.
