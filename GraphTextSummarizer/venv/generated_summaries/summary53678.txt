-- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev welcomed Cuban President Raul Castro to Moscow on Thursday, marking the first time any Cuban leader has visited Russia's capital since Fidel Castro made a trip there 22 years ago at the end of the Cold War. After the collapse of Soviet Union, ties between communist Cuba and ex-communist Russia cooled. Cuban President Raul Castro reviews honor guards after arriving Wednesday in Moscow, Russia. In 2001, then-Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Havana, Cuba, to begin new talks with the former Cold War ally. The visit, during which Medvedev also met with Raul's ailing brother, Fidel Castro, was part of a regional tour to Venezuela and Brazil, sending a poignant message to the United States that Russia is quickly gaining support in its backyard.
