More than 100 vehicles were set on fire Sunday night just in the northern suburb of Husby, Stockholm police press officer Kjell Lindgren told CNN on Wednesday. " Police officers are there to maintain order according to laws that apply to everyone and to keep residents safe, Reinfeldt said. Tensions have been brewing since May 14, when police shot dead a 69-year-old Husby man who had a machete, the newspaper said. Reinfeldt said the trouble reflects a broader problem in Swedish society; more should be done to support education and help young people into work, he said. The disorder led Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt to issue a statement Tuesday appealing for calm.
