Asked whether crude oil prices may rise again, Lundberg said, "It certainly is possible at any time." -- After nearing the all-time record, gas prices in the United States are sliding downward, with another drop possible in the next few days, according to a survey published Sunday. " However, whether the drop is more or less than a dime depends on several factors, including what crude oil prices do next and whether flooding in the Southeast, which has caused transport delays, does not worsen, she said. The Lundberg Survey found the average price of a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline nationwide was $3.91 as of Friday, publisher Trilby Lundberg said. Here are some other average prices in a panel of large cities: -- Salt Lake City $3.67 -- St. Louis $3.74 -- Houston $3.79 -- Atlanta $3.91 -- Boston $3.98 -- San Francisco Bay area $4.17
