Opinion: Debate coach -- Obama, heat up; Romney, stay cool Romney was one of the two big surprises of the night. He was unusually flat, failed to go after Romney on point after point (47%, Bain, corporations are people, etc., etc.), rarely looked Romney in the eye, and seemed annoyed. My hunch is that no one has talked to him like this since his election (except maybe Bibi Netanyahu), and he was shocked that Romney denied he had ever proposed a huge cut in taxes (which he has). Opinion: Romney wasn't stellar, but Obama fell short In this case, Democrats are already charging foul against Romney for misstating facts.
