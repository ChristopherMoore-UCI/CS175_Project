Even the name of the city where it happened is disputed, with pro-Irish nationalists calling it Derry and pro-British unionists calling it Londonderry. The pro-British Ulster Unionist Party has called for IRA victims to be compensated by the British government. Last year, Prime Minister David Cameron described what happened in Londonderry as "unjustified and unjustifiable," following the release by the British government of a damning report that reversed decades of official explanations for the 1972 killings. " Bloody Sunday is widely accepted as fueling support for the IRA (Irish Republican Army) during the early years of what became known as The Troubles -- 30 years of violence between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. The British government said Thursday it will pay compensation to the relatives of those killed and wounded by British soldiers in the Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland in 1972.
