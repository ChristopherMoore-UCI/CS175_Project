-- President Barack Obama plans to nominate James Comey to replace Robert Mueller as FBI director, officials familiar with the nomination process said Wednesday. If nominated and approved by Congress, Comey will replace the man who will have led the FBI for the past 12 years -- officially starting the job days before the September 11, 2001, terror attacks and later seeing the agency through terrorism and other high-profile cases. Mueller's term had been set to expire in September 2011 -- per the 10 years that FBI directors typically serve -- but, at Obama's request, Congress approved a two-year extension. " "But if he's nominated, he would have to answer questions about his recent work in the hedge fund industry," Grassley said, referring to Comey's time with Bridgewater Associates. Currently, Comey is a board member of HSBC Holdings and a Hertog Fellow in national security law at Columbia University's law school, his profile on the school's website says.
