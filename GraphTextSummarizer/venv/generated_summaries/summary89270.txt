Messages that encourage demonstrations will be screened, and organizers of illegal protests will face heavy penalties, the Iranian Labor News Agency reported, citing Tehran Police Chief Ahmadi Mogadham. The 147 detainees at Kahrizak Detention Center were held with 30 additional inmates for four days in a 750-square-foot room lacking proper ventilation, the parliamentary report found, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency. A report released Sunday by an Iranian fact-finding committee found that 147 detainees held after last summer's post-election protests were stuffed into a small room, deprived of adequate food and subjected to other mistreatment, Iranian media reported. The fact-finding committee blamed former Tehran prosecutor Saeed Mortazavi for the decision to send the detainees to Kahrizak -- usually reserved for rapists and other dangerous criminals -- instead of Evin prison, which had informed Mortazavi that it had the space for them.
