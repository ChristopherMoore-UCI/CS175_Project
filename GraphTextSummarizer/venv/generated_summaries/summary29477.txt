In the capital Lagos, home to 17 million people, there is a new premier golf development called Lakowe Lakes "When you look at the trajectory of growth of golf as a sport in Nigeria, I think for many years to come will outstrip supply," says managing director Wale Odutola. However, some environmentalists are concerned that the construction of golf courses in Cross River State could be damaging to the tropical rainforests that stretch through the region. "An up-to-date standard golf course becomes relevant in an economy like ours in Nigeria, that is growing rapidly," Cross River State's governor Liyel Imoke told CNN. "We need to get the PGA of Nigeria stronger," he told CNN. The yuppie generation is here, and they play golf.
