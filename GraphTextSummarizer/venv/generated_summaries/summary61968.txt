Chapman was elected to the public board of the pro-government The Young Guard of United Russia on Wednesday, according to Russian news agency reports. -- Anna Chapman, one of the Russian sleeper agents deported by the United States in last summer's spy swap, will be giving the dour face of Russian political life a bit of flash and glamour. The organization, which is the youth branch of Russia's ruling United Russia party, held a congress in Moscow on its fifth anniversary and reshuffled its leadership. The country's powerful prime minister, Vladimir Putin, is chairman of the United Russia which controls more than two-thirds of seats in the Russian parliament, the State Duma, as well as most local legislatures across the country. Chapman is one of the 10 Russian spies in the United States swapped last July in exchange for four Russian prisoners -- a transfer that conjured the politics and tensions during the Cold War.
