" Some in the science field sought to go beyond the "tweetstorm" to explain why #shirtstorm was not just about Taylor's sartorial choice but highlights the larger issue of dismissive attitudes toward women in STEM, or the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In a Time op-ed, Cathy Young highlighted that several women worked alongside Taylor to get the Rosetta Project off the ground, an accomplishment for women that didn't get nearly the attention that Taylor's shirt garnered. Taylor shouldn't be the one apologizing, according to London Mayor Boris Johnson. "Dr Taylor deserves the applause of our country, and those who bash him should hang their own heads and apologise." In his Telegraph column, Johnson wrote that the "unrelenting tweetstorm" in response to Taylor's shirt, coupled with the scientist's emotional response to it, was a cruel act of public shaming.
