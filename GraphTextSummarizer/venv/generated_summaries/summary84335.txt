The courtroom cast included celebrity photographer and reality TV star Markus Klinko, whom defense lawyers tried to paint as a revengeful ex-boyfriend who turned her in to immigrations agents. Real's rulings frustrated defense efforts to press Klinko about why he hired the private investigator who dug up the evidence that prompted immigration agents to begin their probe of Romero's marriage. "The defense attempted over and over again to taint Mr. Klinko with malicious and false smears," said Klinko's lawyer, Lisa Bloom. The 28-year-old actress-model began sobbing as Klinko testified against her Wednesday, outlining his romantic relationship with Romero that he said began after she married Ross. Romero began dating Klinko a month later, and they lived together for several months, the complaint says.
