House Speaker John Boehner and those who support unrestricted gun rights should take a long look at photos like this -- or talk, just once, to mothers who've lost loved ones to gun violence -- before they utter one word about gun control laws. I've spoken to neighbors, athletes and colleagues, those who own guns and those who never have, about the gun issue, and all seem to fall in the middle. We are smart enough to do both: to understand that gun ownership comes with huge responsibility. So, I don't quite buy the hard line we're told exists between those Americans for and against gun control. Congress should come up with its own common-sense solutions to curb gun violence if it doesn't like what's on the table.
