Egypt's new authorities can count on the support of several Gulf countries, and the Egyptian military, as an institution, is expected to play a significant role in pushing forward on several projects designed to improve the Egyptian economy. Thousands of their supporters and members are either on trial or detained by the Egyptian state -- the most famous trials have resulted in scores of death penalty verdicts being recommended by Egyptian judges. That may mean that the polarization of Egyptian society will continue for the foreseeable future. In a country where the majority live either under or close to the poverty line, and youth (who make up the majority of the population) unemployment is incredibly high, minute changes may not be enough to bring genuine stability to this country. The outcome is in little doubt -- el-Sisi can count on the support of the state's main institutions, various media apparatuses, the political and economic elite, and a substantial proportion of the Egyptian population.
