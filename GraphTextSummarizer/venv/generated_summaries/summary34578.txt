Turkish president: ''Worst-case scenario' in Syria becoming reality Syrian rebels first overran the Syrian border gate at Bab el Hawa last summer, flushing out government forces after days of fighting. Iri said the explosion hit the last Turkish border gate before Syrian territory. Hundreds of American, German and Dutch troops have been sent to Turkey to operate the Patriots, which the Turkish government says are designed to protect Turkey from the threat of Syrian ballistic missiles. When fighting erupts across the border, Turkish authorities periodically close schools that are close to Turkish territory. In October, five Turkish civilians were killed when Syrian troops shelled the Turkish border town of Akcakale.
