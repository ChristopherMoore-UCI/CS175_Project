Statistics from the World Intellectual Property Organization show that already more patents originate in Japan than in the United States, that South Korea overtook Germany to take third place in 2005, and that China is poised to overtake Germany, too. Back in 1980 the Chinese economy accounted for just 2.2% of global economic output, one third the size of Germany's share. Finally, there's competition, the original killer app that sent the fragmented West down a completely different path from monolithic imperial China. That explains about half the catching up that we have witnessed in our lifetimes, especially since the onset of economic reforms in China in 1978. By 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund, the Chinese share will be 18%, six times larger than Germany's.
