Defending Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic has been named as the top men's seed for this year's tournament, with French Open winner Maria Sharapova heading the women's singles seedings. The Wimbledon women's singles seedings reflect the current WTA Tour rankings, with world number one Sharapova selected top. She is followed by world number two Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, with reigning Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova seeded fourth. Meanwhile, two-time Wimbledon champion Nadal was named as the flag carrier for Spain at the London 2012 Olympics on Wednesday. However, the Scot's preparations suffered a blow on Wednesday when he was beaten by Janko Tipsarevic at The Boodles exhibition tournament in Buckinghamshire.
