In announcing his decision, Holder blasted Congress for imposing restrictions on the Justice Department's ability to bring the men to New York for civilian trials -- a course of action he promised in 2009. " "Our civilian justice system has a proven capacity to handle complex terrorism cases," Clutter said. " A number of Democrats and civil liberties activists have expressed dismay at the idea of holding military trials, warning that such a move represents a dangerous breakdown in the U.S. judicial system. Holder promised Monday that the administration will continue working to shut down the facility and lift the restrictions on civilian trials imposed by Congress. The decision is a sharp reversal for the Obama administration, which wanted the terror suspects to have federal civilian trials.
