Randal Milch, general counsel and executive vice president at Verizon, said the telecom giant supported the plan to end government collection of data but added that the new rules "should not require companies to store data for longer than, or in formats that differ from, what they already do for business purposes." "If Verizon receives a valid request for business records, we will respond in a timely way, but companies should not be required to create, analyze or retain records for reasons other than business purposes," he wrote. Congress would have to approve the plan; this week, the House Intelligence Committee introduced similar legislation that would end government collection of phone data. Several legal challenges have been mounted against the NSA programs, and some of those cases could reach the Supreme Court in coming years to set up a judicial review of the constitutional limits of government surveillance in the post-9/11 era. The shift came after the collection program, administered by the National Security Agency, was revealed by former government contractor Edward Snowden. Officials said the White House-proposed changes would require a federal court to grant its approval before the government could obtain phone records from carriers.
