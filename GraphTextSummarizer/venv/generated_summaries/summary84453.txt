West Ham, which was beaten 5-0 last weekend by Championship side Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup, was blown away in emphatic fashion. The two teams will meet in the second leg at Upton Park on January 21. The 32-year-old, whose contract was set to expire in June, was reportedly courting interest from a whole host of top European clubs. The 26-year-old, who has been named World Footballer of the Year in each of the previous four years, is hoping to retain the Ballon D'Or on January 13. But he gave a brief indication of his return to fitness with a fine second individual effort.
