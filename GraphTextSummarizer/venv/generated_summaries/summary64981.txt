Lynch (then best known as the director of "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet") and Frost -- who had written for "Hill Street Blues" -- created an eerie story starring Kyle MacLachlan as FBI agent Dale Cooper, who had come to the Pacific Northwest town of Twin Peaks to investigate the murder of a high school girl named Laura Palmer. The original show ran on ABC in 1990 and 1991 and spawned a 1992 theatrical film directed by Lynch, "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me." The offbeat TV series, created by David Lynch and Mark Frost, will be returning to television in 2016, according to a strange (of course) video posted on Showtime's YouTube channel. "What more can I say -- 'Twin Peaks' with David Lynch and Mark Frost on Showtime in 2016!" According to a press release from Showtime, "Twin Peaks" will be a limited series of nine episodes.
