The 14-year-old racehorse, one of the greatest steeplechasers of all time and a two-time Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, made his dressage debut at London's Olympia Horse Show on Tuesday. Having spent a career streaking past thousands of spectators lining a racecourse, Kauto Star appeared a little unprepared for an indoor arena crowd as he took his first, dainty dressage steps at Olympia. Dressage, which involves horse and rider working together to produce a complex "dance" routine marked by judges, is how Kauto Star has been spending retirement since his last National Hunt race in 2012. Owner Clive Smith sent Kauto Star to Collett's Wiltshire yard in December 2012, against the wishes of the horse's longtime trainer, Paul Nicholls. "He's changed shape a lot since we got him," Collett told Horse and Hound magazine in the build-up to Kauto Star's demonstration dressage test at Olympia.
