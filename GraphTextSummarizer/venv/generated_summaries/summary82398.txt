Meanwhile, the Mexican consul in Seattle, Eduardo Baca, has written a letter to Pasco Police Chief Robert Metzger expressing "deep concern over the unwarranted use of lethal force against an unarmed Mexican national by police officers. It was this misfortune that distressed Zambrano-Montes in the days before he and police in the town of Pasco clashed in February, in a confrontation that ended with officers firing a total of 17 bullets, hitting Zambrano-Montes several times and killing him. According to the group, the federal prosecutor's office will provide remedies and suggestions to Pasco police on their practices and procedures. The tape shows Zambrano running across a street with police in pursuit before he was fatally shot. Ken Lattin told reporters, "We do know this from the preliminary autopsy report, there were no shots in the back." Kennewick police belong to a team of local law agencies, called the Tri-City Special Investigative Unit, that is conducting an independent investigation of the police shooting of Zambrano-Montes in Pasco.
