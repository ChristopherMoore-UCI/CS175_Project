The 767 aircraft -- Amerijet flight 840 -- landed about two hours later without incident at Miami International Airport. The plane was sent to a secure area of Miami International and was being inspected, according to the Miami-Dade Police Department. It's unclear why the plane continued to Miami after the body fell out, rather than returning to Santo Domingo. -- The body of an apparent stowaway fell from the wheel well of a plane taking off Thursday from the Dominican Republic, a Federal Aviation Administration official said. FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the FAA is investigating the incident.
