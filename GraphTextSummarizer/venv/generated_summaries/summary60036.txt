-- You had to feel sorry for the home team when host country Brazil got trounced 7-1 by Germany in their World Cup final match on Tuesday. Opinion: Why weeping Brazil fans applauded Germany's team Tears, puns and a Twitter record @mickmcavoy  The last time I saw a Brazil this bleak it was getting directed by Terry Gilliam @Ihnatko ‚ÄèThis seems like the right time to use the classic "Yank down the opposing teams' pants and then run back to the bus and split" play. If only there was a German word for schadenfreude Pop culture references @jearle "Brazil, the Lannisters send their regards." - Germany. How do you say, "Brazil got their ass kicked" in Portuguese?
