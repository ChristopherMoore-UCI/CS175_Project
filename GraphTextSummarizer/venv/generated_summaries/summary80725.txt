On another front for the busy White House, Obama on Saturday named U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch to succeed outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. "What I am ruling out ... would be sort of a large-scale public firing," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday. He barnstormed into action following Tuesday's midterm elections, pushing his priorities before Republican leaders can frame their agenda for the new Congress, which convenes in January. Those mulling their futures include one of Obama's longest-serving aides, senior policy adviser Dan Pfeiffer, a 2008 campaign alumnus, who had several health scares last year. Many people had expected David Plouffe, Obama's campaign guru, to return to a White House role after the election.
