However, Bin Hammam announced he would compete for the role of FIFA chief on March 18 and has not spoken with Blatter since. A lot of fans today have grown up and they have only known Mr. Blatter as head of FIFA, or head of the administration of FIFA, so I think change is not the wrong thing." Blatter's presidential rival vows reform Bin Hammam, who has been at the summit of Asian football since 2002, also said greater transparency is needed among the game's decision makers. Bin Hammam -- a 61-year-old FIFA executive committee member -- confirmed last week he would run against Blatter in the election, the first candidate to do so since Africa's Issa Hayatou was defeated by the Swiss in 2002. -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter said he would step aside as the head of football's global governing body in 2015, if he wins the June 1 presidential ballot. "You know very well that I am a candidate for the next four years as FIFA president but these will be the last four years for which I stand," Blatter, 75, told a UEFA congress in Paris.
