-- An Air Force officer who served as a branch chief for the service's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response program was arrested and charged with sexual battery over the weekend. The Defense Department reported 3,192 allegations of sexual assault involving service members in 2011. Krusinski's arrest comes as the Pentagon has been under closer scrutiny from Congress over its handling of sexual assault cases in the uniformed services. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel discussed the matter Monday with Air Force Michael Donley, according to the Pentagon. "Secretary Hagel has been directing the Department's leaders to elevate their focus on sexual assault prevention and response, and he will soon announce next steps in our ongoing efforts to combat this vile crime," Little said Monday.
