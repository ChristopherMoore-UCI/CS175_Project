In August, the International Atomic Energy Agency --the U.N. nuclear watchdog -- estimated that since declaring its nuclear program, Iran has processed 10 metric tons of uranium to 5% purity, the level used for nuclear power plants. U.S. officials outline possible deal Two senior U.S. administration officials said that, under the potential deal, Iran would agree: -- to stop enriching nuclear fuel to 20% purity; -- to render unusable most of its existing stockpile of such fuel; -- to agree not to use advanced IR-2 centrifuges, which can enrich nuclear fuel five times faster than older centrifuges; -- not to activate a plutonium reactor at Arak. Iran has always maintained its nuclear program is for purely peaceful purposes, despite repeated findings by U.N. weapons inspectors that the country appeared to be conducting nuclear weapons research.
