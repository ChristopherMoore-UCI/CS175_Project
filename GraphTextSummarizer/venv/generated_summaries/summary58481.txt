Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last month. -- Former NFL star Darren Sharper and a friend told other people that they had sex with two women in a New Orleans apartment in September without "their knowledge or permission," an application for an arrest warrant that was released Thursday revealed. Sharper turned himself into Los Angeles authorities last week. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. Prosecutors in New Orleans intend to charge Sharper, 38, and Erik Nunez, 26, on two counts of aggravated rape.
