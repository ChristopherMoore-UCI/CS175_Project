Parodi, director of hospital operations at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, in a statement. -- Another patient is being tested in the United States for possible Ebola exposure -- this time, in California. There is no FDA-approved treatment for Ebola, and Emory will use what isolation unit supervisor Dr. Bruce Ribner calls "supportive care." In July, two Americans, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly, became infected with the virus when working with Ebola patients in Liberia. All necessary precautions are being taken to safeguard other patients and staff, the hospital said.
