It turned out that when we restricted our analysis to "picture friends," we found evidence that overweight people cluster on Facebook. In fact, the reason we looked just at picture friends is because we think it is these real-world connections that are most likely to be the paths through which emotions and behaviors are transmitted from person to person to person. The bonds we renew in person between friends and family as we visit during the holiday season get reactivated online after we all go home. Of course, picture friends and real-life friends are likely to be one and the same. But what about your Facebook friends who are real friends -- the old-fashioned kind you had over to dinner at Thanksgiving?
