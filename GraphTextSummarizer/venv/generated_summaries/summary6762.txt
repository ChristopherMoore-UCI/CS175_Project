Scores of people were killed during the siege that coincided with last week's start of the holy month of Ramadan, according to reports by opposition groups, including the Syrian Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees of Syria -- a loose coalition of groups that organize and document protests. Anti-government fervor caught on nationwide as more protests were met with tougher crackdowns. In Saraqib, residents reported hearing heavy gunfire and seeing troops break down doors of local businesses during a search of the city for opposition activists, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. At least eight people were killed on Thursday in the ongoing security crackdown on anti-government demonstrators, activists said. About 200 people had been arrested in Saraqib since troops seized the city earlier in the day, according to the Syrian Observatory group, which cited reports from opposition activists in the city.
