"We manage wild bears for a healthy and thriving population," said Dan Prenzlow, regional manager for wildlife with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning. They established a scent trail by late afternoon, said spokesman Randy Hampton of Colorado Parks and Wildlife. The bear was then chased away by the teen and other campers at the site. Hampton estimated that there are 12,000 black bears on Colorado's 23 million acres of public land.
