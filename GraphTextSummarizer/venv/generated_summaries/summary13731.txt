Prosecutors say that on July 23, 2007, Komisarjevsky and an accomplice, Steven Hayes, invaded the home of Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, molested one of their daughters, and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. Komisarjevsky's long rap sheet, in particular, suggest that he was a troubled young man with a penchant for nighttime burglary and crystal meth. "That was the first time I'd seen something as exotic as that." Komisarjevsky confessed that he only broke into homes at night and never during the day -- a point stressed by prosecutors in the 2002 trial. Dr. William Petit, although severely beaten, managed to escape and crawl to a neighbor's residence. One of his former attorneys, William Gerace, said that Komisarjevsky came from a close, religious family.
