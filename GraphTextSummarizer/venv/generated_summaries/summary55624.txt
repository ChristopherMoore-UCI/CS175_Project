While MacFarlane kept himself off-screen in "Ted" (he merely provided the profane voice of Mark Wahlberg's fuzzy pal), here he puts himself front and center as Albert Stark--a cowardly and inept sheep farmer in the backwater town of Old Stump, Arizona, circa 1882. Ashamed by Albert's lily-livered lack of courage, his schoolmarm girlfriend Louise (Amanda Seyfried) dumps him for Foy, the dandy proprietor of the local mustache shop, played with literal whisker-twirling glee by Neil Patrick Harris. Albert is encouraged to try and win Louise back by his sexually frustrated, dim-bulb best friend (Giovanni Ribisi), whose prostitute girlfriend (Sarah Silverman with a bottomless grab bag of blow-job one-liners and bodily fluid gags) withholds sex while doing unprintable acts in her day job. Still, MacFarlane manages to make the film his own, goosing Brooks' original formula with hard-R raunchiness and post-modern mischief.
