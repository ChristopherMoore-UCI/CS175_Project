Their journey will take them across the globe via the ports of Cape Town, Abu Dhabi, Sanya, Auckland, ItajaÃ­, Miami, Lisbon, and Lorient -- eventually finishing in Galway, Ireland in July next year. "Down there you are pretty much running on luck anyway," explains Mike Sanderson, who is this year captaining 'Team Sanya'. In each port, separate small races are being held, giving the teams the opportunity to win points, and the event the chance to win over more spectators. Organizers say it's one of the most demanding team sporting events in the world, with participants this time around set to face countless challenges in the months ahead like their predecessors. In Alicante, several events such as concerts were held to coincide with the start of the race, and more are due to be held in the other ports.
