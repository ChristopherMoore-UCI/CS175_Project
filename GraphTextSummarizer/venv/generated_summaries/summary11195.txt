Opposition parties have long supported shuttering nuclear energy in Germany To make up for the loss of nuclear energy, the German government will begin to switch to renewable energy and increase investments in energy research, the government website said. "But we will not be able to do without conventional power plants, above all cutting-edge gas power plants for a long time," said a statement published in May. Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was damaged in a March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which has spewed large amounts of radiation into the environment. "New fruits of new research should contribute to making the energy transition more efficient and easier on the ecology. " In March, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced she would rethink a plan to extend the lifespan of her country's nuclear power plants.
