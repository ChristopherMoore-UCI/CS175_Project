Carlo Ancelotti has left PSG to take over at Real, while former French national team coach Laurent Blanc has replaced the Italian in Paris. Blanc has been out of work since stepping down as France coach after Euro 2012. Blanc will have players such as Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Brazil captain Thiago Silva at his disposal at the Parc des Princes. "Paris Saint-Germain is delighted to announce the appointment of Laurent Blanc as coach for the next two years," read a PSG statement. Ancelotti will look to deliver an historic 10th triumph in Europe's premier club competition for Real, having won the competition twice as coach of AC Milan.
