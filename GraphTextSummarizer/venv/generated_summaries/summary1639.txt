If Holmes' enters such a plea, he would waive all medical confidentiality and will have to turn over the name of any doctor or psychologist who may have treated him, according to Colorado law. Earlier this month, Holmes' lawyers tried to have Colorado's insanity defense laws changed. -- A judge on Tuesday entered a standard plea of not guilty for James Holmes, the man suspected in a mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater, after he and his attorneys said they were not ready to enter a plea. At his preliminary hearing in January, police who responded described hellish scenes inside the theater and described finding Holmes, dressed in body armor, standing outside, seeming "detached from it all," according to Officer Jason Oviatt. "If he enters the not guilty by reason of insanity plea, he's going to be examined by state doctors and any statement he makes to those state doctors are given to the prosecution for potential use later," Beller said.
