South Africa had been banned from international rugby for decades, but suddenly found themselves back on the international scene after the 1995 rugby World Cup was awarded to South Africa. Mandela wanted to find a way to unite all the people of South Africa -- something only the power of forgiveness could produce. Civil wars have destroyed many African nations, and South Africa seemed destined for the same fate. Mandela was sentenced to life in prison for his participation in several bombings around South Africa; some were deadly. After his release, South Africa suffered some of its most severe political violence as Mandela and the white minority struggled to find a peaceful transition to a "one man, one vote" system.
