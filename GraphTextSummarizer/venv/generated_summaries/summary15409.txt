" The police report says officers responded to the 911 calls of "threats to a police officer" to the 120 block of Vermilyea Avenue where they found Paulino with a knife in his hand. -- A man who called New York City's 911 center twice early Sunday, threatening to "kill some cops," was later shot and killed by police when he charged at responding officers with a knife. " Nine witnesses told investigators they saw him continue to charge at police with a knife before he was hit with the Taser gun, according to the police report. When Paulino continued to lunge at them, the officers fired their weapons, hitting him several times in the upper body, police said.
