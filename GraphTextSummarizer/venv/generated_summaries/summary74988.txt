The man whose bag was flagged, told authorities that he had honey packaged in five bottles, Deputy Michael Whorf, spokesman for the Kern County Sheriff's Department told CNN. -- The substance that spurred an evacuation at a California airport Tuesday was simply honey, the Kern County Sheriff's Department said. The man told authorities that he was on a flight from Bakersfield, California, where he had visited relatives, back to his home in Milwaukee, and was carrying the bottles of honey back with him. The 31-year-old man cooperated with authorities and was released with no charges against him, Whorf said. The preliminary tests using the swabs indicated the presence of the explosives TNT and triacetone triperoxide, known as TATP, Whorf said.
