-- "I'm not a machine, and like everybody I have better moments than others," Rafael Nadal told CNN in Shanghai. " Taking time out of the game earlier this summer to recover from tendonitis in his knees, Nadal missed out on defending his 2008 Wimbledon title, won in an epic final match against world number 1, Roger Federer. After a year disrupted by injury, it was a moment of candor from the down-to-Earth 23-year-old, whose winning ways on the court had at times made him seem invincible. Making his comeback just before the U.S. Open in August, he played into some form to reach the final of the Shanghai Masters tournament in October. My work is playing tennis and it's my hobby too, you know, so not everybody can work in one of his hobbies, so I feel lucky for that," he told CNN.
