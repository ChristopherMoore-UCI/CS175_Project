I mean large, physical structures and buildings that allow players to defend, attack and punish the enemy. Each structure costs "rift energy," a universal source of power harvested from different planets, much like oil on Earth. If you are looking for more speed and maneuverability, the Hawk is a transformer-like vehicle that switches from armored robot to nimble aircraft quickly. These items and many more can be called down and placed on the battlefield for maximum damage or protection. "Build and Battle" allows players to call down hardware from a ship circling high above the planet.
