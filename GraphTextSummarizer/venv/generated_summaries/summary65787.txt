This is the fifth year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. One of the top 10 will be voted CNN Hero of the Year by the public and receive an additional $250,000. The top 10 -- remarkable everyday people changing the world -- were revealed Thursday by CNN's Anderson Cooper. All were nominated by CNN viewers inspired by their hard work and commitment. The live tribute show, hosted by Cooper at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, will culminate in the announcement of the CNN Hero of the Year.
