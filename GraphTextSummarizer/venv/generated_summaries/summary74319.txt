Through a dedicated, TV-optimized version of Siri and a smart TV UI based on trademark Apple simplicity and aesthetics, Apple could advance the state of TV usability. Last week a former Apple employee reportedly said that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs would have "lost his mind" over Siri, and that employees are embarrassed by the virtual assistant. In a final, non-beta version of Siri, Apple's virtual assistant would be better equipped to parse the nuances of human dialog. Sure, a lot of his answers just regurgitated the same pat, familiar themes we've heard from Cook and other Apple executives: When Apple CEO Tim Cook took the stage at the All Things Digital Conference Tuesday night, he wasn't just answering questions from Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher â€” he was also dropping hints about the future of Apple's product roadmap.
