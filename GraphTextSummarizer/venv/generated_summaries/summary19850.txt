It's just not right," said Daniel Womack, owner of Claxton Chrysler Dodge Jeep in tiny Claxton, Georgia. Claxton Chrysler Dodge Jeep is at the literal and figurative heart of Claxton, Georgia. Chrysler LLC doesn't understand its market, said loyal customer Jerry Akins, 64, who has bought three vehicles from Claxton Chrysler. All of the dealer's major lending banks called and said they would no longer work with Claxton, general manager Doug Shontz said. Over the years, Claxton Chrysler has sponsored Little League baseball and Pee Wee football, supported beauty pageants and donated to local charities, Shontz said.
