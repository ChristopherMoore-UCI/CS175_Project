" Both Shiffman and White believe traditional data and civil society patterns can be as valuable for data analytic forecasts as cyber data that's more prevalent in developed countries. Last year White and his team integrated similar patterns of large data analysis to help Kenyans prevent violence during last month's elections. Shiffman suggests useful data in less developed countries can be found in "economic data -- what people are buying in stores, what cars are they driving, what kind of phones are they using, refugee flows, the direction of their move, mobile use. "As interrupters of violence, by using the nuances such as data analytics we now have the technology to prevent, interrupt and break these cycles of violence. "As observers of patterns, data, and focal points, we look at violence as an epidemic that can ultimately spread," White said.
