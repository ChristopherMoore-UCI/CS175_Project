Turkey has been going on the offensive against Kurdish separatists based across its border in northern Iraq with bombings and incursions. The military statement claimed the the strike was in the Sinat-Haftanin area of northern Iraq, where many militant training camps are situated and there are no civilian settlements. Earlier this month, Turkish police detained dozens of people in a wave of raids focused on pro-Kurdish media organizations. Their path was blocked by soldiers and then four planes bombed them," said the official, Yunus Urek of the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party. Turkish air force jets launched the strike late Wednesday after unmanned aerial vehicles showed a group moving from Iraq toward the border with Turkey in an area "mostly used by terrorists," a statement from the military general staff said.
