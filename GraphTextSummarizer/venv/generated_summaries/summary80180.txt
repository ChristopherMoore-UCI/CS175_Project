This is how the morning goes for Captain Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), who copes with an angry wake-up call from his ex-wife and then has to face down a storm on takeoff. The first thing he does when he wakes up in hospital is reach out to his supplier for a little extra-medicinal support (he's played by John Goodman with much the same gusto he brings to "Argo"), but Whip refuses his offer of booze and goes on the wagon for a spell. It's not too often we find such questionable characters at the heart of big budget movies like this, and there's a lived-through-it quality to the movie's observations on alcoholism that helps "Flight" transcend its occasional cliches and even its cop-out sentimental ending. With its spectacular plane crash -- I would rate it fractionally behind the air disasters director Robert Zemeckis staged in "Cast Away" and Joe Carnahan in "The Grey," but still more than gut-wrenching enough to make you think about taking the train, next time -- "Flight" immediately raises the stakes on your typical addiction drama. Zemeckis squeezes maximum suspense out of Whip's wobbly sobriety -- the mini-bar has never looked so sinister -- but even he has trouble disguising the hollow dilemma propping up John Gatins' story: Is it okay for a pilot to be drunk in charge of an aircraft?
