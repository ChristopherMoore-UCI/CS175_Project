Watch what pilot said as plane had trouble Â» The F/A-18 Hornet crashed after "a succession of emergencies" that began with oil-pressure problems in its right engine during a flight off the Southern California coast, said Marine Col. John Rupp. The pilot, whose name has not been released, is grounded pending further review, which Marine officers said was routine. While controllers aboard the aircraft carrier that launched the jet urged the pilot to land at a nearby Navy airfield at North Island, squadron officers relied on "incorrect assumptions and inaccurate data" to guide him back to the plane's base at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station. Alles said the officer was an "above-average" pilot who "just made a poor decision." Dong Yun Yoon lost his wife, children and mother-in-law in the crash and another unoccupied house also was destroyed. That left the jet relying on its other engine, which previously had been giving mechanics electronic indications of a problem with its fuel-flow system, Rupp said.
