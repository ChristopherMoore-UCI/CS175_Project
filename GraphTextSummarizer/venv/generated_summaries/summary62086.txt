In addition to the river cleanup, Pregracke has launched a floating classroom barge, where his staff educates high school students and teachers about the damages of pollution on river ecosystems. Throughout the year, Pregracke's flotilla travels on rivers throughout the Midwest. "I just want to be known (as) a hardworking American." Ultimately, Pregracke says, his message is about much more than cleaning rivers. Together, they organize community cleanups along rivers across the country. "We do everything in our power to get people excited about it," Pregracke said.
