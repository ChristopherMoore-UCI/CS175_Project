The first rule would put the burden on U.S. food importers to ensure their foreign suppliers are meeting U.S. food safety standards. "By holding overseas producers to U.S. food safety standards, the new rules would establish a level playing field that would also benefit U.S. businesses, farmers and food processors." The Center for Science in the Public Interest also said, "Today's long-delayed announcement that the FDA is moving forward on regulations to increase the safety of imported foods is good news and, if finalized, will lead to safer foods. The rules also propose a preferred vendor program of sorts, giving foreign food companies incentives to comply with U.S. safety standards. " The current food safety system in the United States relies on FDA inspectors at ports of entry around the country physically inspecting food and detaining items that may pose a hazard to the American public.
