Konare said Mali security forces have formed the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State to work as a transitional government. The latest uprising began to take root late last year but gained momentum in January, when the rebels began attacking towns in northern Mali. The ongoing violence between these rebels and security forces has compelled tens of thousands of Malians to flee into neighboring countries and created turmoil in Toure's administration. The military has only said that "he is safe." Ping said Toure was in still in Mali and was apparently "protected by his royal guard." The United States gives Mali's government roughly $140 million in aid each year.
