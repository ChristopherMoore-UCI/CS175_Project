Nissan produces about 20% of its cars in Japan, but CEO Carlos Ghosn would like to see that reduced. "I don't think it's so much a penalty for companies, because large companies have the possibility to off-shore production." Despite the ongoing travails in Europe, Ghosn predicts 2012 will be a record year for the automotive industry. "Yes, Europe is going to be a problem ... but Japan's going to be better than last year," Ghosn said, as the world's third largest economy recovers from the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the subsequent energy problems, as the nation's nuclear plants went off line following the Fukushima nuclear disaster. "The U.S. is in recovery more (and will sell) 1 million additional cars compared to last year," Ghosn said. The move of Infiniti's headquarters to China is designed to help Nissan capture the luxury car market, a segment which has seen "20% to 25% growth on a yearly basis," Ghosn said.
