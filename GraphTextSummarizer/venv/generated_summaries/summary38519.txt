We also have a number of comic books coming that will probably end up as movies or television series or so forth. Entertainment, with my partner Gill Champion, we're working on quite a number of new movies, television series and even a live action show. Three of the new superheroes, and I can't say too much right now, but the working titles are "The Prodigal," one is called "The Annihilator," and one is called "The Retaliator." Cargill: When fans see Marvel characters making record-breaking (box office) money like this, they assume it's made you a billionaire. So I loved the idea of them shouting -- because I'm a very corny guy -- "Avengers assemble!" Cargill: Obviously with a project of this magnitude, compromises have to be made along the way.
