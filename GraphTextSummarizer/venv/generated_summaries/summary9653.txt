A U.S. military spokesman, Lt. Col. Eric Bloom, said the strikes are typical of al Qaeda in Iraq attacks. -- The toll from a series of explosions across Baghdad climbed to at least 64 dead and 360 wounded Wednesday, Iraq's health minister Saleh Mahdi told state television al-Iraqiya. Despite a series of recent bombings, "overall security is good" and "attack levels [in Iraq] remain at historically low levels," Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said Wednesday. According to the committee, the government commission said in a statement that the attackers had "contacted the station and selected it to be the exclusive platform for their inhumane practices with the purpose of disrupting Iraq's national unity and to inflame religious discord. The blasts across the capital Tuesday included 14 car bombs, two roadside bombs and mortar attacks in at least 17 neighborhoods, most of them in Shiite areas, police said.
