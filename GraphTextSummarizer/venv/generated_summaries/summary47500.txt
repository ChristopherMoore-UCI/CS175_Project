" Meilutyte's next major meet is next month's world championships in Barcelona, where she has a busy program competing in the 50m and 100m breaststroke, plus the 50m and 100m freestyle. Only eight years after that frightening experience, Meilutyte became her country's maiden Olympic gold medalist in swimming by upsetting the reigning world champion in the 100-meter breaststroke at London 2012. Rudd said a breakout performance from Meilutyte had been "brewing for a while" and that there was nothing sinister behind her incredible improvement -- Chinese teen Ye Shiwen had to rebut accusations of possible drug use after her own world-record performances at London 2012. And yes, Meilutyte will continue to represent Lithuania, the former Soviet republic -- though she is sometimes asked if she wants to switch nationalities after spending four years in Britain. In a sport where half a second is a sizable progression, Meilutyte shaved about two seconds off her personal best in London, raising her level when it mattered most.
