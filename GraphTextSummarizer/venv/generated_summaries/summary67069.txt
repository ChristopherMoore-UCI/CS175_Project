We expect social media to shed light on a person's personality, especially when, as in the case of Colorado shooting suspect James Holmes, we're trying to explain the unexplainable. About 81% of 18- to 29-year-olds in the United States use social media at least occasionally, said Lee Rainie, director of the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project. In a Pew survey from November, two-thirds of respondents (67%) said that staying in touch with current friends is a major reason they use social media, and half gave similar importance to connecting with old friends. I have over 400 friend requests in which a quarter of those are ppl mocking the real killer to gain attention and this was all AFTER the identity of the real killer was revealed ..." James P. Holmes, who lives in the Denver area, left a similar note on Facebook, albeit in a more wry tone. Former colleague shocked that Holmes is theater shooting suspect It's impossible, of course, to draw broad conclusions about his mindset based on the fact that he didn't share online.
