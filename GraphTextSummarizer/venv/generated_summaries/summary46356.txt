They were connected to the Buynaksk militant group, which had previously been linked to other militants behind bombings in late December in Volgograd in southwestern Russia, the source said. Russia launched a search for anti-government militants in the run-up to the Winter Olympics in Sochi. The attacks on Volgograd's public transit system fueled security concerns ahead of the Sochi games. Russian security forces have carried out a number of operations in Dagestan in recent weeks. Two other people were arrested last week on suspicion of transporting the suicide bombers to Volgograd.
