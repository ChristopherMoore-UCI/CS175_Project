There's more money -- a lot more -- for a dam project on the Ohio River and millions of cash for Colorado flooding repair projects. Congress OK'd $450 million for rebuilding projects in flood-struck areas of Colorado. He tells CNN's Chris Frates the new money -- which more than triples the original $775 million -- will save the federal government many millions because contracts won't be canceled due to work stoppages. And Sen. Lamar Alexander, who's a key figure on the committee that oversees what water projects get what money, says he and another senator asked for the cash. And the wealthy widow of a late U.S. senator will receive a year's pay as a death benefit.
