"Our team had bad luck in stage 10, but after that Bjarne (Rjiis) said that we needed to fight for a stage victory," he told the official Tour de France website. When two-time winner Alberto Contador was forced to quit the Tour de France after a painful crash the outlook looked bleak for the Tinkoff-Saxo team but since his departure a new star has emerged in Polish rider Rafal Majka. Majka is one of a number of young riders making a big impression in the 2014 Tour, but it is still being led by Italy's Vincenzo Nibali, who finished third on stage 17, pulling away from his nearest rivals on the final climb. Majka, who finished sixth in this year's Giro D'Italia, first made his mark on the Tour in the Alps, winning at the Risoul ski station last Saturday in fine style, a major boost for his team after the loss of Contador to a broken shin on Bastille Day, July 4. The 24-year-old was a last-minute inclusion in its squad for the Tour, but has seized his opportunity with both hands, claiming his second stage win Wednesday and the second in a row for Tinkoff-Saxo.
