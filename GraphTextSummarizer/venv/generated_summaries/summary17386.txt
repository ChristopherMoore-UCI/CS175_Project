The company is banking on new games to help get more Wii U's into homes. The popularity of "World of Warcraft," "Neverwinter," and other massive multiplayer online games has opened up the field for new MMOs to try their hand. Mobile gaming, both on its own and as a companion to console gaming, will get more attention this year as many games produce one-off titles for smartphones or incorporate gameplay into tablets. With Sony leading the sales pack with the introduction of its PlayStation 4 console, they will be looking to hold their lead and offer more titles to keep fans interested. It is also likely that fans will get glimpses of games like "Driveclub" and a possible new title for the "God of War" franchise.
