-- An intimate black-and-white photograph of Princess Diana as a teenager is to go under the hammer in Amherst, New Hampshire, later this month, an auction company said Friday, The photograph -- which may never before have been seen by the public, RR Auction says -- offers a glimpse of the future wife of Prince Charles lying down, perhaps on a bed, wearing a light sweater or top. The only indication of date is a stamp on the back of the print saying 26 February 1981 -- two days after the engagement of Diana, then 19, and Prince Charles was announced by Buckingham Palace. Bidding for the image, described by RR Auction as an "uncommon early 10 x 8 glossy news photo of a young Diana lying in bed," opens on January 17 and starts at $200. Diana, Princess of Wales, was fatally injured in a car accident in Paris in 1997, a year after she and Prince Charles divorced. Another man is half seen in the foreground, but there is no clue as to who he or Diana's other companion might be.
