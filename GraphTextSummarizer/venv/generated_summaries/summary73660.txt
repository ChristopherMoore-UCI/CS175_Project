China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hong Lei emphasized this on Wednesday. Vietnam continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities "illegal" and in violation of international law. The drilling area does have the basic conditions and potential for oil exploration, Wang Zhen, deputy director of CNPC Policy Research Office, told Xinhua. When China dispatched the oil rig on May 2 to begin drilling near the Paracel Islands in the South China Seas, the move kicked off a series of confrontations between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in the area. The operation by the Chinese company is located in indisputable coastal waters of the Xisha (Paracel) Islands, which falls well within China's sovereignty," said Hong.
