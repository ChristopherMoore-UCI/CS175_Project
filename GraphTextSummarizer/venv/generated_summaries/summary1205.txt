Dr. David Greenfield, the director of the Center for Internet and Technology Addiction, says around 90% of Americans would fall in the category of overusing, abusing or misusing their devices, according to a recent nationwide telephone survey he did with 1,000 people in conjunction with AT&T. "The analogy that I use is right before they go to bed, the last thing they do before they pass out is check their phone and the minute they open their eyes, they check their phone," said Greenfield during an interview. Signs you are truly addicted Greenfield, who is also author of "Virtual Addiction: Help for Netheads, Cyber Freaks and Those Who Love Them," says fewer people would actually be classified as addicted to their devices. " 61% of respondents in the survey said they regularly sleep with their cell or smartphone turned on under their pillow or next to their bed, and more than 50% feel uncomfortable when they leave their smartphone at home or in the car, or when they have no service or their phone is broken. "Just like drinking and driving, people have a very poor perception of impact, so, in other words, people will be doing their normal thing," he said. To fall into the addicted camp, Greenfield also says your smartphone use has to have "some deleterious impact on a major life sphere, whether it's an impact on your work, your academic performance, your home life, primary relationship, parenting, legal status.
