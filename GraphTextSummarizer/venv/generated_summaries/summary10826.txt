A joint session of the newly elected Congress would be convened to open and count electoral votes. Throughout this past spring and summer, Ron Paul's devoted supporters worked furiously to elect their own as electors at state party conventions. A handful of states have "faithless elector" laws on the books designed to punish electors who switch their votes, and some two dozen states require electors to pledge to vote for the state's winner. After the unresolved presidential election of 1824, when none of the four candidates achieved an Electoral College majority, the House met the following January to decide the outcome. Many recent electors have mulled switching their votes and little can be done to stop them, said Robert Alexander, an Electoral College expert at Ohio Northern University.
