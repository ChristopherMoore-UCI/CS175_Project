The ruling came in the wake of a recent case of cow slaughter in Malegaon, where two men have been charged for killing the animal and and selling its meat. If we get an information of a cow slaughter, we can quickly go to the resident's place and check whether it is there or not", Mahesh Sawai, Deputy Superintendent of Malegaon Police told CNN. Maharashtra is not the only Indian state to tighten its laws on cow slaughter. Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister has promised that he would do all to devise a country-wide law against cow slaughter. Police officials believe this is the only way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law.
