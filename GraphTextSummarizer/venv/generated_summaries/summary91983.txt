CNN was not involved in the Associated Press' litigation to gain release of the Newtown 911 calls, but I applaud the court's decision in support of open government and public access to government records. We filed a lawsuit for access to the Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts, and we have recently gone to court to gain release of all records and data relating to the death of Valdosta, Georgia, teen Kendrick Johnson. And maybe one day those stories will make a difference and prevent future tragedies and suffering of other families. We can never learn the truth about our society and its ills and inspirations without full access to public documents. Yet I fully believe that access to public records is crucial, even if painful.
