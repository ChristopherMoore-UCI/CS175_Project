John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York topped the list of airports with the most claims of thefts from luggage, followed by Los Angeles International, Orlando International and Miami International, according to the data. "We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work," said Patrick Gannon, police chief of Los Angeles International Airport. Inside a plane at Miami International Airport, baggage handlers are going on a shopping spree with passengers' bags. Police set up a hidden camera inside the belly of a plane last year and caught baggage handlers rifling through luggage and stealing various items. The Miami-Dade Police Department set up the camera as part of an ongoing police investigation into luggage thefts by the very airport workers who are supposed to get bags safely onto planes.
