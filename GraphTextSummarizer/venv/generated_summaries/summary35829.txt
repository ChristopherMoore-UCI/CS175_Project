Albania's current president, Bamir Topi, met Saturday with prominent U.S., U.K. and European diplomats. "Yesterday was a terrible day for Albania," U.S. Ambassador Alexander Arvizu said Saturday. On Friday, Berisha vowed that there would "be no early elections" and that "general elections will be held in 2013," a rebuttal to a proposal being pushed by the opposition Such entrenched stances, the strong language and Friday's violence came as diplomats outside Albania continued to push for a peaceful solution to a southern European nation's stalemate. Despite international calls for calm and negotiations, Albania's ruling government continued Saturday to levy sharply-worded rhetoric against its opposition and arrested 113 people following a massive Friday protest that turned violent, state-run media reported. Three protesters were killed -- all shot at close range, according to Tirana Military Hospital emergency chief Sami Koceku.
