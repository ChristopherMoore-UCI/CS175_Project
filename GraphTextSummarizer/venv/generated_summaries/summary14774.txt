Entrepreneur Ashar Aziz has donated the remaining half of the $1 million Babar Suleman and his 17-year-old son Haris were hoping to raise for a Pakistan charity that helps poor children go to school. " Aziz said, "Since this is a cause I also believe deeply in, it was only appropriate that I help complete my old friend and class-fellow's humanitarian mission." Cookie Suleman, Babar Suleman's wife and Haris' mother, was "really, really touched," according to Danial Noorani, spokesman for The Citizens Foundation, the parent organization of Seeds of Learning. In an interview with CNN affiliate WISH TV in June, only days before the pair set off, Babar Suleman, also a pilot, spoke of the importance of the work done by the Pakistan charity. "I felt that the best way to honor this brave father and son duo was to complete their mission of raising $1 million for the charity that was dedicated to providing free education for the underprivileged." The money raised, he said, would help open schools "for underprivileged children who otherwise would not have a hope of getting an education and may even end up in the wrong hands.
