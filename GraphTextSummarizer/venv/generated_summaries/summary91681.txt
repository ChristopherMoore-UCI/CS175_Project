But the new pumps, like the one from the Savannah River site, have the advantage of being appreciably larger, making them potentially more useful for spraying water or a possible end-game scenario involving encasing nuclear reactor cores in concrete. "I use the pump every day at the river site, but they're trying to avert a situation that worsens each day," said Jerry Ashmore, the owner of Ashmore Concrete Contractors that supplies concrete for the Savannah River facility. But the decision was made to transfer it to Japan -- along with several other such large pumps, from around the world -- in order to deal with a disaster that has been brewing since a March 11 earthquake and tsunami wreaked havoc at the plant and stoked fears about massive releases of radiation. For weeks, similar concrete pump engines have been used at the embattled power plant, as a conduit for water going into reactors and spent nuclear fuel pools. Typically trucks this massive are used in large projects using concrete, such as the construction of bridges or high-rise buildings.
