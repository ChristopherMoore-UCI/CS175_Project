This suggests that the big challenge for Abe on Wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the TPP in a way that convinces the American people that the trade agreement is not about enriching U.S. corporations and outsourcing U.S. jobs, but strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the United States and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of China. But the immediate battle in Congress is not over the TPP directly, but something called trade promotion authority, or "Fast-Track." Trade promotion authority, which would allow trade agreements such as the TPP to come before Congress without amendment, has been on the books for decades. But even if trade promotion authority passes, the fight over the TPP is far from over. Provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before Congress can grant final approval to the TPP.
