It is just a question of how much." La Cour Vahl said that people who come to Greenland can witness firsthand the results of climate change. The effects of climate change have "put us on the map," la Cour Vahl says. "While doubt still prevails as to the speed at which the volume of the ice is declining and the complex relationships between causes of temperature increases," the site reads, "there is one thing that is certain: New ice will continue to be created on the ice sheet, and there will still be enormous amounts of ice to admire in Greenland for the next many generations. "Greenland has been a major concern because there is a lot of ice sitting on land, and it's melting a lot faster than we thought it was going to," said Keya Chatterjee, director of international climate policy for the World Wildlife Fund. "But we've seen quite an increase in cruise tourism and an incremental increase in land-based visitors." La Cour Vahl said Greenland gets about 30,000 cruise visitors per year, a four-fold increase in the past decade.
