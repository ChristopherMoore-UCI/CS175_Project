NATO says the long-term goal of its missile shield  is "to merge individual Allies' missile defense assets into a coherent defense system, providing full protection for NATO European populations, territory and forces against ballistic missiles threats. We certainly are not contributing to that." Tensions between Russia and NATO member countries have been mounting since Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and claims its military has been involved in the ongoing violence in eastern Ukraine. Denmark has slammed as "unacceptable" comments by Russia's envoy to Denmark that joining NATO's missile defense shield would make Danish warships "targets for Russian nuclear missiles." Conversely, Deputy Foreign Minister Alexey Meshkov told Tass news agency that Russia was "deeply concerned" about NATO drills near its border. In April 2014, NATO foreign ministers said they had "decided to suspend all practical civilian and military cooperation between NATO and Russia" over the issue.
