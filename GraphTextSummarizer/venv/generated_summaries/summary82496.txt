70 medical facilities across the country have been attacked over the last nine months, 60 by government forces, Amos said, citing statistics from Physicians for Human Rights. Amos urged the Security Council members to ensure all parties in Syria follow what they have outlined in resolutions: end indiscriminate use of weapons, protect children from violations, lift sieges on city and allow unhindered humanitarian assistance. " The U.N. has identified air bombs, car bombs or mortar attacks on or near schools at least 35 times since February, resulting in the death of at least 105 children, Amos said. Other children, sometimes as young as 5 years old, are being trained at military camps, Amos said. Nearly 200,000 people have been killed in the 3-year Syrian conflict and one million injured, Amos said, describing a war zone with three combative parties fighting each other with no regard for the thousands of civilians and children caught in the middle.
