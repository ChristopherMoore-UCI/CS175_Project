K-9s raise alarm while looking for signs of missing Arizona girl, 6 A massive volunteer search over the weekend failed to locate the girls, and authorities have suspended the volunteer effort. Authorities: Tennessee girls 'within inches' of kidnapper who turned gun on himself Agents from the FBI and the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigation joined the search on Saturday, authorities said. Abben said the volunteer effort was suspended because authorities did not feel there was a benefit in having more people search. The girls -- 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins and 10-year-old Lyric Cook -- were last seen by their grandmother on Friday when the two, who are cousins, left to go on a bike ride, authorities said. Authorities began dragging Meyers Lake over the weekend for a sign of the girls.
