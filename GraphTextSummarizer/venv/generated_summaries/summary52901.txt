Lohan can leave jail after she posts a $300,000 bond, but she must be fitted with a SCRAM alcohol-detection bracelet within 24 hours, Los Angeles County Superior Court spokesman Allan Parachini said. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident, she was charged with cocaine possession. -- A judge granted Lindsay Lohan bail Friday night, overturning a decision earlier Friday that sent the actress to jail until a probation revocation hearing four weeks away Lohan cited his daughter's court-approved trip to New York during Fashion Week, saying she stayed alone in a hotel room, which opened her up to bad influences. Judge Patricia Schnegg granted Lohan's bail after her lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, filed a writ of habeas corpus just before court closed Friday afternoon, Parachini said.
