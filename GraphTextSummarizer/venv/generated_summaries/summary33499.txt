It's not like young women look up to Anastasia Steele, the "Fifty Shades" heroine. That was before "Fifty Shades of Grey" came along. I had the passing thought that "Fifty Shades of Grey" could be a learning experience. In anonymous Internet murmurings, some say despite all the trappings, "Fifty Shades of Grey" depicts an assault on a woman, rather than consensual bondage. Girls much younger than my daughters will surely find a way to see "Fifty Shades of Grey" -- either in theaters, on cable, or online.
