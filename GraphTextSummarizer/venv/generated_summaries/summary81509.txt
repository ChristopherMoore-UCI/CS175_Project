Part of a new road safety campaign, the site was developed in response to reports of a high number of road traffic incidents affecting British tourists and expats in popular destinations, such as Thailand, Australia and Spain. According to the WHO's most recent report on global road safety statistics, in 2010 Thailand had an estimated 38 road traffic deaths per 100,000 people, making it one of the world's deadliest places to be on the road. "Helmet-wearing campaigns," would help to reduce the carnage on the country's roads, said Avi Silverman, from the Make Roads Safe campaign, along with "better road infrastructure -- safe crossing points and more pavements -- properly enforced speeding legislation, better post-crash care and better coordination among regional countries all suffering the same problem." CNN's Meng Meng contributed to this report. "In contrast 1,901 people were killed in road accidents in the UK in 2011. The report says 74% of Thailand's road traffic deaths were attributed to motorcycle accidents.
