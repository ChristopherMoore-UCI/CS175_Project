Attack at Syria funeral: 'Children's bodies were maimed and burnt,' witness says The town has been without power for 10 months, and residents are suffering water shortages because shelling has destroyed water pipes, he said. The two boys suffered from marasmus, a type of acute malnutrition that can very quickly lead to death if not treated, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Al-Muadami said the town has been under siege by Syrian troops since last November and that the situation there is "disastrous. "In large parts of rural Damascus, for example, people are dying because they lack medical supplies and because there are not enough medical personnel to attend to them. They also go hungry because aid can't get through to them on a regular basis," said Magne Barth, head of the ICRC's delegation in Syria.
