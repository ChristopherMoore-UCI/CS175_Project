-- Former football star Deion Sanders and a third person also were cited for misdemeanor assault in an incident this week that resulted in Sanders' estranged wife being arrested and taken into custody, according to a statement Wednesday by the Prosper, Texas, police department. "Further investigation of the circumstances prompted the responding officers to cite Mr. Deion Sanders and Ms. Dianna Boswell with Class C Simple Assault," it continued. The statement said police responded to a domestic disturbance call Monday afternoon at a residence in the Dallas suburb where Sanders, 44, complained he was assaulted by Pilar Sanders, 38, and another woman identified as Dianna Boswell, also 38. Pilar Sanders was booked into jail Monday night on suspicion of assault family violence, according to booking records at the Collin County Jail. Pilar Sanders also filed a separate suit against her husband and his daughter, Deiondra, after she called her stepmother a "gold-digging (expletive)" and "the number one gold digger of the year" in Twitter posts.
