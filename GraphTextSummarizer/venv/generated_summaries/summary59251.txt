Officers responding to a call of shots fired at the school about 2 p.m. found that the student allegedly confronted Horry County Police Officer Erik Karney and drew a gun, the statement said. "Horry County Police did locate and seize items consistent with the construction of pipe bombs and other incendiary devices" at the home. -- A southeastern South Carolina school reopened Wednesday, a day after a student opened fire at a school police officer and bomb squads dismantled several pipe bombs. Robert Kegler of the Horry County Police Department said Tuesday the bullet struck a wall and shrapnel hit Karney's face. Teal Britton, spokeswoman for Horry County Schools, confirmed to WMBF that metal detectors were not used on students entering the school Tuesday morning.
