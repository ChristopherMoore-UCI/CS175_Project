A victory in the Dunn case would give Corey a chance to rehabilitate her image with constituents who actively call for her resignation -- especially in light of allegations that she disproportionately overcharges African American defendants (notably her aggressive handling of the Cristian Fernandez and Marissa Alexander cases). -- Michael Dunn will stand trial for the shooting of Jordan Davis -- again. They will have one job: to determine whether the state proves, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Michael Dunn did not have reasonable fear of imminent great bodily harm when he fired the shots that took Jordan Davis' life. The Dunn case unquestionably has social and political overtones as it is one of several recent cases where a young, unarmed black man has been killed. So if Michael Dunn, who had complained about the volume of music coming from Davis' SUV, is already sentenced to life in prison, why bother with another trial?
