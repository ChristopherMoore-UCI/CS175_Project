The Vatican has said confidential documents were found in Gabriele's apartment in Vatican territory. Last month, the Vatican gave Cardinal Julian Herranz a "pontifical mandate" to uncover the source of hundreds of personal letters and confidential documents given to Gianluigi Nuzzi, an Italian journalist and author of "Sua Santita," a book that translates to "His Holiness" and includes the documents. Butler Paolo Gabriele, 46, was arrested last week and accused of illegal possession of confidential documents. Pope Benedict XVI's spokesman has denied the pontiff will resign over the arrest of his butler on suspicion of leaking confidential documents, the Vatican press office said Thursday. When he became Vatican secretary of state, Bertone "did what normally happens," said the Rev. Thomas Reese, author of "Inside the Vatican."
