-- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Wednesday that those behind the deadly blast at Moscow's busiest airport were hoping, in part, to prevent him from attending the World Economic Forum. "If people don't understand how to work, we'll find other people," Medvedev said, according the RIA-Novosti news agency. Earlier Wednesday, Medvedev fired top airport security officials. Moscow is observing a day of mourning for the victims Wednesday, with flags flying at half staff. Medvedev blamed security violations.
