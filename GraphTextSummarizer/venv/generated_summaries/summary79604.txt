Chestnut claims the "Coveted Mustard Yellow International Belt" and wins a one-year supply of hot dogs from Nathan's, the sponsor of the annual event, which has been held on the corner of Surf and Stillwell avenues in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn since 1916. Chestnut, who hails from San Jose, California, set a record with Wednesday's feat of eating 66 hot dogs, the event's organizers said. Chestnut, 23, weighing 215 pounds, had broken Kobayashi's 2006 record by downing 59Â½ hot dogs at a qualifying contest in Phoenix last month. He was receiving acupuncture treatment Wednesday morning to relieve pain in his jaw after wisdom tooth surgery. Chestnut -- veins throbbing in his forehead -- wolfs down a dog on his way to the title and a world record Wednesday.
