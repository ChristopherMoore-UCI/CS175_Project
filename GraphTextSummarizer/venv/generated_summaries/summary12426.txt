Sen. Rand Paul surprised members of the Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday when he threatened to force a vote on a declaration of war against ISIS as an amendment to an unrelated bill dealing with clean drinking water around the world. "We will now have the opportunity to engage in meaningful, transparent debate ion the U.S. military mission against ISIL, as I've been calling for since military action began nearly four months ago," said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, a leading advocate for Congress to vote on an AUMF. Finally, on Wednesday, the committee would reconvene in open session for a more full debate and votes on AUMF language and amendments. The unexpected move by Paul, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, prompted Democrats to quickly counter with proposals of their own and launched a spirited debate inside a small, camera-less committee room in the Capitol about the role Congress should play in approving military strikes. The Kentucky Republican, frustrated that Congress hasn't voted to formally okay the military operation already underway against the terrorist group, said he hoped his move would "shame" the Congress into action.
