Wearing running gear or branded Boston Marathon jackets, many wandered up to police barricades where early in the day volunteers checked bib numbers and handed out finishing medals. One of the women at the checkpoint hanging medals around runners' necks was volunteer Kathy LeClair from Chester, New Hampshire. "I was crossing the finish line and about to receive my medal right when the bomb went off," said Osborne, who flew in from Salt Lake City to run her first Boston Marathon. There, LeClair spent the morning greeting and hugging runners who had been affected by the bombing. An employee of TD Bank, LeClair had come to Boston on Monday afternoon to attend a corporate training class on Tuesday.
