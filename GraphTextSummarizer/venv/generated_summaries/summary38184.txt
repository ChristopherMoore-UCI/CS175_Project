'Huggable Christie previews presidential road map With former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush announcing last month plans to "actively explore" a run, and 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney telling donors and supporters he's seriously considering it, Christie's path to the nomination looks to have narrowed, as both Bush and Romney would vie for the same universe of establishment-minded donors and voters as Christie. Christie has said before that running against Bush would be "stressful" because "you don't like to run against people who are your friends." New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie again insisted he hasn't yet decided whether to run for president, but his family won't be able to veto him if he does decide to jump in the race. Christie said he's asking himself three questions: "Is it right for me, is it right for my family, is it right for the country â€”Â in that order. " Christie has repeatedly said he hasn't made up his mind on 2016, but has made no secret of his interest and his supporters are moving to build the operation he'll need if he does decide to jump in the race.
