Carlos Balsas, 41, of Tempe, Arizona, is charged with terroristic threats, bomb threats and several other offenses, police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien said. An Arizona man accused of threatening to blow up Philadelphia's Liberty Bell was charged Sunday, police said. Later,  two black backpacks were found in front of the Liberty Wheels wheelchair and scooter rental shop in downtown Philadelphia. Authorities say Balsas claimed to have explosives as he entered the historic site. Police said a bomb squad was called in and secured the scene but found that the bags did not contain explosives.
