The other incident occurred about 8:30 p.m. Monday at the Tom Bradley International Terminal, airport police said, Three plastic bottles containing dry ice were found, but only one had exploded, police said. There was no political motive or agenda,"  Los Angeles police Deputy Chief Michael Downing said. The man arrested in the dry ice explosions at Los Angeles International Airport is a baggage handler who thought the simple bombs were "a game" and "a funny kind of joke," police said Wednesday. "We want to reassure the traveling public, visitors and employees that LAX is safe and secure,"  Los Angeles Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said. He was arrested after police interviewed his co-workers, Downing said.
