"Then the engineering studies will take another few months (six to nine) and the construction should take two and a half to three years maximum to be completed." If permission is granted, Santalo believes the building will be the first of many large skyscrapers that will spring up across Africa in the coming years. "Africa will have, in the next 15 years, thousands of towers," Santalo said. Santalo added that Morocco's stability, favorable landscape and the fact that it was at the gateway between Europe and Africa made it an attractive location for such a large development. The project is slated for the picturesque city of Casablanca in Morocco and is being proposed by Dubai-based construction firm, Middle East Development LLC, in conjunction with French architects Valode & Pistre. "Our goal is to start the soil testing in June 2015," said Amedee Santalo.
