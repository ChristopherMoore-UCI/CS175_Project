" Media reports have said that Bird's credit card was reportedly used Wednesday in Mexico, but Fleming said the family is baffled by these reports. -- Wall Street Journal reporter David Bird left his New Jersey home Saturday evening, hoping to take a quick walk before it rained. For the past several days, authorities and dozens of volunteers have been scouring the area around Bird's Long Hill home to find the missing 55-year-old father of two, who was known to walk the trails around his house. "We have every reason to believe that he just wanted to go for a little stroll," longtime family friend Jacquie Petras told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. Bird was a recipient of a liver transplant nine years ago and requires medication twice a day, his sister-in-law Chris Fleming said.
