Mexican authorities say they gunned down notorious cartel leader Nazario Moreno Gonzalez on Sunday. Authorities received numerous reports that Moreno remained alive, Rubido said Sunday, On Sunday, Mexican authorities said fingerprint tests had confirmed that Moreno was really the one they killed this time, but they were still awaiting DNA test results. The group began splintering soon after authorities announced Moreno's death in 2010, and a similar spinoff organization known as the Knights Templar effectively took La Familia's place as the dominant group in the region. Federal authorities initially said they couldn't provide physical evidence because Moreno's body had been collected by fellow cartel members after clashes. In 2010, then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon's government trumpeted Moreno's death, announcing that he'd been killed after two days of shootouts between armed forces and criminals.
