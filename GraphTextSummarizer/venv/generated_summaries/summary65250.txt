"You couldn't teach it in schools, you didn't have university departments for Amazigh research, or have Amazigh TV stations or radio," said Mazigh Buzakhar, a Tripoli-based Berber activist. Their real crime, according to Buzakhar and Amnesty International, was advocating for Berber cultural rights, evidence of which was found by police in the form of banned Amazigh texts, smuggled from abroad, in their home. Any broader recognition of Libyan Amazigh cultural rights would require overcoming greater barriers than the legacy of Gadhafi's suppression and scapegoating, said Buzakhar. Written in Tamazight, Arabic and English, it has a print run of 3,000, and a focus on promoting Amazigh culture and language, by reprinting ancient works of poetry, as well as more modern works by writers such as Said Sifaw al-Mahrouk. "Tilelli" is just one element of the flowering of Amazigh culture to have taken place in the wake of Gadhafi's downfall.
