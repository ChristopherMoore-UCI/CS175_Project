TH: Probably the most exciting was this January when we got back to the South Sandwich islands, we placed a camera there last year and this is the first breeding data from that whole archipelago and because it's so hard to get to, no one's ever done a year's worth of observations on penguins. I've become one of the nearly million citizen scientists working to help penguins in the Antarctic region through data analysis on hosted through Zooniverse, a crowdsourcing science platform. TH: We put timelapse cameras all around Antarctica and sub-Antarctic -- South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands, South Shetlands -- all along the Antarctic peninsula. Passionate penguinologist Tom Hart, a junior research fellow in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford, is the man behind Penguin Lifelines -- a collaborative international project researching the threats faced by Antarctic penguins. It turns out now, it's really easy to collect data on this scale, we've cracked the logistics problem.
