A trial court handed down a death sentence last year for Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, on charges of murder, conspiracy and waging war on India. India blamed the attacks on the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, a Pakistan-based terror group allied with al Qaeda. Authorities said Kasab was trained by the organization, which was banned in Pakistan in 2002 after an attack on India's parliament. Convicts on death-row in India reserve the right to challenge the sentencing in the nation's Supreme Court. The city's High Court upheld his conviction and sentence, lawyer Ejaz Naqvi told reporters.
