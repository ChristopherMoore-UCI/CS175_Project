A U.S. expert told CNN that radioactive particles most likely concentrated in that area in the first days of the disaster, as plant operators tried to vent the damaged reactors. Tokyo Electric immediately cordoned off the area and is investigating both the cause of the high radiation and how it will affect the recovery work, company spokesman Naoki Tsunoda said. Was said the use of a gamma-ray camera could help identify whether the source of the radioactivity was reactor waste products, bits of nuclear fuel or both. -- Workers at the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant have discovered a radioactive hot spot far more lethal than anything previously recorded at the damaged facility, the plant's owner reported Tuesday. The disaster has caused Japan to rethink its commitment to nuclear energy, and Germany has since announced plans to abandon atomic power entirely by 2022.
