Ninety-eight crew members were rescued from the Athena early Wednesday, while 13 remain on board to keep the fire under control and pilot the ship to port, the agency's Claire Johns said. -- A fishing ship whose crew had to be rescued from a fire is limping to port in the United Kingdom, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency told CNN Wednesday. "Hopefully tomorrow when the firefighters come on board (it) will be completely extinguished and cleared and then we will know more about what happened," Sue Philbrow told CNN by e-mail from the Faroe Islands, where the ship is registered. The container ship Vega -- which happened to be nearby when the Athena caught fire -- is accompanying the ship to Falmouth, England, where both ships are due Thursday night, she said.
