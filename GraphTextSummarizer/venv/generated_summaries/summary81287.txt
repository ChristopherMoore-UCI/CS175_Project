-- Formula One team Hispania Racing (HRT) have called up reserve driver Christian Klien for Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix after regular first choice Sakon Yamamoto withdrew through illness. HRT team principle Colin Kolles confirmed the change via Formula One's official website: "It looks as if Sakon Yamamoto has food poisoning, and he doesn't feel well. "Because of this, Christian Klien will be driving the car this Friday (in practice) and the rest of the Singapore Grand Prix." For Austria's Klien, it will be his first Formula One race since driving for Red Bull Racing during the 2006 season. The 27-year-old Klien first made his breakthrough in Formula One with Jaguar in 2004, before spending two years with Red Bull. Meanwhile, former Renault boss Flavio Briatore believes seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher has made a mistake by returning to Formula One.
