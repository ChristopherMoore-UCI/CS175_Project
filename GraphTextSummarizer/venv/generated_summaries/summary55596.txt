Dr. Jack Kevorkian is as opaque a person as I have ever met. And, we had officially begun my sit-down interview with Dr Jack Kevorkian. By the end of the interview, Dr Jack Kevorkian was smiling a lot and thanking me for spending a day with him. As he shuffled away, I couldn't help but think Kevorkian still invoked strong emotions in people -- but I also hoped that if the moment of his birth was the worst of his life that he had some good moments since then. A family member had once sent repeated checks to him after Kevorkian assisted in his wife's suicide, and he kept sending the money back, he told me.
