Because the way things stand today, electricity demand must be in constant balance with electricity supply. What if we could use solar energy when the sun has set, or wind energy when the air is calm? Sadoway: Ambri is aiming to deliver electricity storage without subsidies. If in the time that it took me to walk out here on this stage, some tens of megawatts of wind power stopped pouring into the grid, the difference would have to be made up from other generators immediately. For example, one variant will be the size of a 40-foot shipping container and hold 2 MWh, enough electricity to meet the daily needs of 200 American households.
