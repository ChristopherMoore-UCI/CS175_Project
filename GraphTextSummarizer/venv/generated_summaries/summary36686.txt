Lawyer Giulia Bongiorno  said on Tuesday that Knox is not the character the media has painted her as and urged a jury to acquit Knox and his client,  Rafaelle Sollecito, of murdering Meredith Kercher. As she began her closing arguments Tuesday, Bongiorno said there was no physical trace of Knox or Sollecito in the room where Kercher was found murdered. Bongiorno compared Knox to the voluptuous cartoon character Jessica Rabbit, who protests, "I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way," in the movie "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" Bongiorno, who represents Sollecito -- Knox and Sollecito are fighting their conviction for killing Kercher -- Knox's roommate -- in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. He urged the Italian jury not to overturn Knox and Sollecito's convictions.
