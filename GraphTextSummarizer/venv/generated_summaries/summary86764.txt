U.S. trade deficit with China has steadily grown over the past decade. So there's a temptation to seize on China's currency policy as a "silver bullet" that will solve this concern, by making U.S. goods cheaper and Chinese ones more expensive, even though the real problem is more complex than that. U.S. President Barack Obama said China is manipulating its currency but expressed concerns about backing the Senate bill. China opposes the bill, warning that it "seriously violates rules of the World Trade Organization and obstructs China-U.S. trade ties. But a Chinese consumer with greater buying power -- if accompanied by greater openness and fairer treatment for American companies in the Chinese market -- will translate into more opportunities and more jobs in sectors where the U.S. has a real advantage.
