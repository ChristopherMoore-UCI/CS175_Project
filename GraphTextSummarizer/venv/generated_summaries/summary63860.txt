"But there is a lot of research going on, and I would say in the next five to 10 years, we will have identified between five and 10 genes that we know raise the risk for autism." Once the autism gene or genes have been identified, it would theoretically be possible to screen for those genes, according to Dawson. The standard CCB procedure for screening donors involves extensive physical, genetic and health screening ..." Since the discovery of autism in some of the families that used Donor X, Cryobank had this to say about his samples: "... per CCB policy, the donor's samples were removed from the general catalog. " In six families Jackaway contacted that had used Donor X, three of the children are autistic, and one is showing signs of autism. Researchers have found some genetic areas associated with autism, but it could take years before the gene or genes that cause autism or contribute to it will be determined. There seemed to be eye contact issues," recalled Jackaway, who immediately suggested screening Joseph for autism.
