Watch Blauser demonstrate the specialized wheelchair Â» For Blauser, who provides part-time safety consulting in exchange for room and board, an initial plan to stay for one year has become a dream to get wheelchairs to every Iraqi child who wants one. For the past four years, the Dallas, Texas, native has been providing hope to hundreds of disabled Iraqi children and their families through the distribution of pediatric wheelchairs. The organization provides wheelchairs designed for rough terrains in developing nations, making the devices "perfect for this environment," said Blauser. The boy is among hundreds of disabled Iraqi children to benefit from Blauser's generosity. "By providing what they need, I'm hoping to start a movement to change the way people think about disabled children," said Blauser.
