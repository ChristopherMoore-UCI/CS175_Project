Volunteers help Sandy victims start over "With more than 85% of gas stations now operating -- a substantial increase from just 25% two weeks ago -- and Thanksgiving and Black Friday behind us, the odd-even license plate system will be rescinded starting tomorrow morning," New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced on Friday. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that signal problems that prevented some of the traffic lanes to be open at the Queens-Midtown Tunnel are fixed in time for the post-holiday rush hour commute on Monday morning. -- Superstorm Sandy caused $29.4 billion in damages in New Jersey, one of the hardest hit states, said Gov. Chris Christie. More than 30,000 people remain without power in New York and New Jersey. Meanwhile, odd-even gas rationing ended early Saturday in New York City, a milestone as the city continues to recover from Sandy, which hit more than three weeks ago.
