Chelsea do have another Champions League winner to call upon on Wednesday or, better put, a double Champions League winner -- in Mourinho himself. -- Wednesday in Paris will see two worlds collide, when Nouveau Riche take on Nouveau Riche-r. Paris Saint-Germain welcome Chelsea to the Parc des Princes for a Champions League quarterfinal first leg, with both teams vying for a spot in the final four of Europe's crÃ¨me de la crÃ¨me. He also has Champions League pedigree coming into Wednesday's game, with the Swede pouncing 10 times in his last seven appearances in the competition. Chelsea's problems up front this season, however, have been well-documented, with coach Jose Mourinho recently admitting that there will be great changes in that department come the summer. And unfortunately, if Torres' nine goals from 32 appearances this term are insufficient, the Chelsea boss will be unable to call on a Champions League winning-striker in his ranks.
