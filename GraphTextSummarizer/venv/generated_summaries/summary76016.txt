" At last year's Principal Voices roundtable, Rory Stear asked: "How can we enable access to self-sufficient energy by those who need it the most yet can afford it the least?"

"In my mind this is the business of the future, especially for India," Devin Narang says. Last year, former Principal Voice Rory Stear and his wife Kristine Pearson were named TIME 'Heroes of the Environment.'
