This review was done on the PS3 using the Sixaxis controller for single player and the Move controller for multiplayer. The environments play a big role in gameplay, as buildings and roads crumble under the weight of armored vehicles in the city or darkened areas hide players from enemy eyes as they sneak through the jungle. Single player action took about 7 hours for me, but Shubel said 8 to 10 hours was normal for completion. The Helghast, sort of a futuristic pseudo-Nazi/Cold War Russian looking group, are on the trail of our intrepid heroes through a nuked-out city, leafy jungle, polar mountains and outer space. Set across many different terrains, it challenges players to show off their mental capabilities as well as their shooting prowess.
