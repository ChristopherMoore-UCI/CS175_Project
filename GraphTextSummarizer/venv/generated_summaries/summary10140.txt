-- Officials investigating last week's crash of two Metro subway trains said a system used to detect trains in the area of the accident had failed intermittently in the days immediately before the fatal crash. The NTSB says the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported the problem during a post-accident review of track circuit data, but it was not immediately clear if operators were aware of the problem before the accident. In an update Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board added that after the repair, the circuit "periodically lost its ability to detect trains." In a prepared statement, Metro General Manager John Catoe said the track circuit data problem "... is not an issue that would have been easily detectable to controllers in our operations center." The NTSB, meanwhile, has been conducting nightly tests at the accident scene between the Fort Totten and Takoma stations.
