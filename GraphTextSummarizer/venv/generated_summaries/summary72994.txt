-- Second seed Roger Federer stayed on course for a first French Open title after coming from two sets to one down to defeat Argentine Juan Martin del Potro in another five-set epic, securing a place in Sunday's final at Roland Garros. It was Federer's second five-set win this tournament -- he was also taken the distance by Tommy Haas in the fourth round -- and he has squeezed through to his fourth straight Paris final without hitting top form. Fifth seed Del Potro played a poor second-set tie-break, sending four shots into the net to gift the Swiss the leveller, but he still held the whip hand and sped through a 36-minute third set during which he broke Federer's serve twice more. Del Potro grabbed one himself as the light started to fade on Philippe Chatrier court, but he double-faulted in game seven to put Federer back in front. But he was broken in the fifth and ninth games to lose the first set as Del Potro dictated the rallies, feasting off Federer's weak and short backhands.
