EW: Community' season 5 - A visual analysis Harmon has now taken to Tumblr to clarify his position, in a surprisingly serene post directed at Community fans. It's worth reading Harmon's whole post, which features, among other things, Harmon expressing a bit of skepticism about how the new system of TV can actually wind up exploiting fanbases, "like a corporation is doing you a favor by feeding you low grade opiate through a regulated tube." And there were probably other rumors, like the rumor about how "Community" star Danny Pudi's appearance in "Captain America 2" was intended to set up a future Marvel spin-off directed by Justin Lin where it turns out the characters on "Community" were the New Warriors the whole time. Those rumors led in turn to counter-rumors that Community showrunner/messiah/demonic inspiration Dan Harmon didn't actually want "Community" to continue. EW: 'Community' canceled Harmon cautions that "there are lots of reasons a Community resurrection could be difficult."
