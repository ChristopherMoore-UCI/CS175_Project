Art looted by Nazis found in German apartment Editors' Note: This article has been edited to remove plagiarized content after CNN discovered multiple instances of plagiarism by Marie-Louise Gumuchian, a former CNN news editor. Italy's Culture Ministry unveiled the two paintings Wednesday after they were recovered by police specialized in finding stolen art, following an "incredible" series of events. The man, whom police did not name, hung the works in his Turin home before taking them to Sicily when he retired. Italian heritage police were alerted last summer when a friend of the worker grew suspicious of their value. The man was an art lover, but he had no idea of the real value of the paintings, police said.
