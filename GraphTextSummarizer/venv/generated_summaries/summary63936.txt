Travis, 54, was initially hospitalized July 7 at Baylor Medical Center at McKinney, Texas, with a presumptive cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, according to publicist Kirt Webster. His song "Three Wooden Crosses" won song of the year in 2003 from both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Country singer Randy Travis left a Texas hospital and entered a physical therapy facility, his publicist said Wednesday. The release and transfer came three weeks after Travis was admitted to The Heart Hospital at Baylor Plano for treatment of congestive heart failure. "Thanks to all the fans and friends for your continued prayers and support as Randy continues on the road to recovery," his fiance Mary Davis said in a written statement Wednesday.
