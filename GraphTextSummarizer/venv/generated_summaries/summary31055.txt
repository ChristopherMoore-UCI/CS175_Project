"If we can go out on the road with this boat, it's a huge boat, only on solar energy, and we live on this boat, everything is working the computer, the telephone, everything is on solar energy. And if Planet Solar completes its mission, the crew says that will be proof that the sun, and solar power, is the answer. Measuring 31 meters (102 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide, the catamaran is powered by 537-square meters of photovoltaic solar panels. It means everyone can use solar and renewable energy at home everyday," Domjan said. French captain, Erwann Le Rouzic (one of six crew members on board), says that while the technology has been faultless, Mother Nature has proven to be a challenge.
