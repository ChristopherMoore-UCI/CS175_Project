The fourth typhoon to hit the Philippines in a month came ashore east of the capital, Manila, on Saturday morning, bringing heavy rain, flooding, and washing away shanty houses near the coast. There were power flashes across Manila, as the storm hit Saturday and cut the electricity supply, videographer James Reynolds said. The storm dropped at least 85 millimeters (3.3 inches) of rain on Manila. Last week a third typhoon, Lupit, narrowly missed making landfall but still brought lots of rain to the Philippines. The storm was weaker than expected, he said, but it still brought fierce winds and lots of rain.
