"Old Boy's Club" "A guy grabbing a woman's ass is very much indicative of a level of sexual assault," said Kathryn Bertine, former professional cyclist and director of "Half the Road," a documentary about female racers. " Former World Road Race champion Cooke points to the discrepancy in prize money as another big obstacle for women within the sport. She sees the problem not with the majority of "supportive" male cyclists, but with the lack of female representation among race directors and promoters.
