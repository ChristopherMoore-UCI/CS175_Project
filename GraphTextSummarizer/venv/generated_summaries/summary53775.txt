"I fly out of the New York airports and I want to be safe just as much as the next person," said Stephen Zawistowski, a spokesman for The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. In an effort to control the city's goose population and improve aviation safety, authorities slaughtered 1,676 Canada geese across New York last summer, according to a recent U.S. Department of Agriculture report. The birds are generally rounded up when their feathers molt, rendering them unable to fly, said USDA Wildlife Services spokeswoman Carol Bannerman. "But there are a combination of nonlethal alternatives such as habitat management and reproduction control that can be implemented to prevent the need for a mass euthanasia of Canada geese. Officials from the agency's Wildlife Service eliminated 89% of the geese that reside within 7 miles of New York's two major airports after a 2009 incident in which birds flew into the engines of US Airways Flight 1549, the report said.
