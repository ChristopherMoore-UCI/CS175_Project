They will remain on course to make sure that they secure a murder conviction." If convicted of premeditated murder, Pistorius could face life in prison -- which in practice typically amounts to 25 years, unless someone can prove extraordinary circumstances. It was only upon returning to his bedroom, Pistorius said, that he realized Steenkamp was not in bed and that she was actually the one in the bathroom. But prosecutors said the act was a premeditated murder -- that Pistorius had an argument with Steenkamp, put on his prosthetic legs, walked to the bathroom, and shot through the door, intentionally killing his girlfriend. The Paralympian's lawyers also got Botha to acknowledge that investigators had failed to collect any evidence that counters Pistorius' argument that he mistakenly shot Steenkamp. Hilton Botha, the original lead investigator, admitted during Pistorius' bail hearing that police had failed to wear protective shoe covers at the crime scene because they had run out of them, and that it was possible evidence had been damaged as a result.
