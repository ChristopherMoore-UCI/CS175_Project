Bobby Jack Fowler, who died in an Oregon prison in 2006, is responsible for the murder of 16-year-old Colleen MacMillen, Inspector Gary Shinkaruk of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said at a news conference. New DNA work may offer break in 36-year-old Michigan slayings On August 9, 1974, MacMillen disappeared near Highway 97 in Lac La Hache, British Columbia, according to Shinkaruk. "Today's announcement and public plea for assistance is a significant milestone in our commitment to solving a series of missing and murdered women investigations in British Columbia," said Deputy Commissioner Craig Callens, commanding officer of the RCMP in British Columbia. The development brings to a close one of 18 open cases in British Columbia involving women who went missing, with some later found murdered, stretching back to 1969. The RCMP has also created a timeline for Fowler's movements over the last 40 years, and Shinkaruk called on citizens of Canada and the United States to think back to the 1970s, '80s and '90s and contact the RCMP with any new information in the still-open cases.
