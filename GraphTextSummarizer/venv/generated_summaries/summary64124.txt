Greece is on the way to economic recovery as investor faith returns to the recession-ridden eurozone nation, an executive at Greece's largest bank has told CNN. Greece fell into recession after the collapse of U.S. bank Lehman Brothers in 2008, which sparked a euro-wide debt crisis the following year. Petros Christodoulou, deputy chief executive of the National Bank of Greece, said that a drastic drop in government borrowing costs since the outbreak of the crisis in 2009 marks a "great improvement and a great perception of the country" by foreign investors. "It's hardly surprising we've had the odd protest," he added, "you have to look at things in a cumulative way and Greeks have come to accept, in a way, they are resigned to accepting all these measures." Greece's economic renaissance This week, the European Commission released its autumn economic forecast, estimating that Greece will emerge from recession in 2014 and projected solid growth of 2.9% for 2015 if the country maintains its current path. Spiro said that Greece will be "very lucky" to grow next year.
