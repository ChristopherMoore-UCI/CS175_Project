Of the 42 states that have reported infections in people, birds or mosquitoes, 80% of them have been in Texas, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the CDC said in a statement. In the United States, most infections occur between June and September, and peak in August, according to the CDC. "It is not clear why we are seeing more activity than in recent years," said Marc Fischer, a medical epidemiologist at the CDC. Health experts say prevention measures include avoiding mosquito bites, using insect repellent and getting rid of insect breeding sites. There are no medications to treat West Nile virus or vaccines to prevent infection.
