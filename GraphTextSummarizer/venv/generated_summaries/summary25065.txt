"We will meet and we will do what's right for everyone," Khan said, noting the project has the backing of the community board as well as New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other politicians. -- A major figure in the project to build an Islamic center and mosque near ground zero in New York City said Sunday that moving the project to another site is not under consideration for now. Moving from the planned site two blocks from where al Qaeda attackers destroyed the World Trade Center, killing more than 2,700 people, raises constitutional issues and would be noted by Islamic extremists, Khan said. A protest against the project was scheduled to take place Sunday in New York. Khan appeared on the program with Rabbi Joy Levitt, the executive director of the Jewish Community Center in New York.
