When -- after many visits to doctors and hospitals --- Tian Huiping's son was finally diagnosed with autism, the only advice she was given was to make use of a loophole in China's "one-child" policy that allows parents with disabled children to have one more. And more parents with autistic children came to Tian  looking for help, all of them with the same fears. They first help parents to accept their child's disability and teach basic information about autism awareness. There are no government programs to help parents with autistic children -- and there is no government help for Tian and her school. The Chinese government says there are only about 100,000 people with autism in the entire country, but unofficial estimates put the number between 1-2 million people, perhaps even more.
