But the style with which Bayern secured a trio of titles, including a 7-0 aggregate thrashing of Barca in the Champions League semifinals, led to the 68-year-old being mooted as a possible to successor to Jose Mourinho at Real Madrid. The veteran coach's team beat Stuttgart in the final of the German Cup last weekend to win a third major honor of the season, adding to the European Champions League and German Bundesliga trophies secured last month. Jupp Heynckes has poured cold water on suggestions he could take over at Real Madrid by announcing he will take a break from football after leading Bayern Munich to a historic treble. Bayern announced in January that former Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola would take over the team for the 2013-14 season, with many presuming Heynckes would call time on his managerial career. Heynckes began his third spell as Bayern coach in 2011, replacing the sacked Louis van Gaal after the club had limped to a third-place finish in the Bundesliga.
