She said a local NATO team is already in Kunduz province conducting an investigation with Afghan forces and another team from the central office is on its way. " Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, is following the investigation, his public affairs officer, Lt. Col. Tadd Sholtis, said in an e-mail. Militants had commandeered the trucks, which were carrying fuel for NATO forces, he said. The fuel trucks were hijacked late Thursday in Kunduz province and were spotted several hours later on the banks of the Kunduz River, ISAF said.
