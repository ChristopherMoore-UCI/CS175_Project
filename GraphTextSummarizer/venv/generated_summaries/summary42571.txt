"All of those who could speak any English were very supportive and helpful" in both the prison and the jail, Black recalled, but Kousai made the most concerted effort. He was driven back to "Reception," which Black believes was a police station, where his passport, camera and cell phone were seized. "The Foreman" didn't speak much English, Black said, but seemed to be in charge of the cell block. As the weeks dragged on, Black became immersed in prison life. When Black first walked in, Kousai and his roommate, a massive man everyone called "The Foreman," offered him an orange drink and crackers.
