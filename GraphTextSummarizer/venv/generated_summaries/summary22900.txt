Al Libi trial, Libya and al Qaeda: What you won't hear in court In less than 30 seconds, the United States had taken suspected al Qaeda member Anas al-Libi into custody. He was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York on charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, murder, destruction of American buildings and government property and destruction of national defense utilities of the United States. Dramatic security camera video published Monday in the Washington Post shows U.S. commandos capturing al-Libi last October. On October 5, the day of the capture, a team of U.S. Navy SEALs in southern Somalia targeted the top leader of Al-Shabaab, which was behind the mall attack in Kenya in September.
