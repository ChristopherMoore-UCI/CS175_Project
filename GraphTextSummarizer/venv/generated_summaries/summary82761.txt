Drug cartel leaders often align themselves with street gangs, employing gang members to carry out some of the cartel's most vicious work. "He has an entourage, he has bodyguards, he has armored vehicles to protect him from rival gangs and rival cartels," Mikeska says. He heads the Barrio Aztecas gang, but Ravelo isn't flashy, FBI agents say. "Eduardo Ravelo rose to power within the Barrio Aztecas criminal enterprise because of his connections with the Juarez cartel and also [because] he's a ruthless killer and will basically carry out what the Juarez cartel wants him to do," Mikeska said. Federal authorities say the profits from drug sales are often transferred to the commissary accounts of gang members in prison.
