"With investment in 2014/15 growing 20% over last season, the investment in shirt sponsorship has increased faster than at any time in the last 15 years" said a Repucom spokesman. Driven by a contract with car manufacturer Chevrolet, Manchester United's $70m a year deal is a big part of the EPL's 36% rise in shirt sponsorship income on the 2013/2014 season, reports Repucom. Looking further afield, American newcomer MLS is also attracting big business with shirt sponsorships totaling $55.8m -- about $3m more than the Netherlands' Eredivisie, which perhaps is another signal of the strengthening of interest in football in the U.S. It's just secured a whopping $8 billion dollar TV deal and now the English Premier League is cleaning up in shirt sponsorship revenue. Only the Netherlands' Eredivisie bucked the trend as its shirt sponsorship income value dropped five percent to $47 million as European clubs reaped the benefits of sponsors forking out $777m to get their brand on the front of some of the world's biggest clubs' kits.
