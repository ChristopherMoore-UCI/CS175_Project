HISTORY: -- Bahrain's current monarch, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, is the latest ruler in an Arab dynasty that wrested control of the archipelago from Persia in the 1780s. The monarchy views Iran, its neighbor across the Persian Gulf and onetime ruler, with "deep suspicion" and suspects it of supporting Shiite opposition movements, according to a U.S. diplomatic cable disclosed by the WikiLeaks website. Bahrain was the first Middle Eastern country to land a Formula One Grand Prix race, in 2004.
