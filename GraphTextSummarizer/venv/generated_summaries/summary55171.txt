-- Television stations in Baghdad are calling it "Iraq Day," the Saturday deadline for American troops to completely withdraw from the country under a U.S.-Iraqi security pact. Udey al-Zaidi, the brother of Iraqi journalist Muntadhar al-Zaidi who threw his shoes at then-President George W. Bush during a 2008 news conference in Baghdad, said Saturday he was detained a day earlier at an anti-American protest. Human Rights Watch, in recent months, has reported that Iraqi security forces have beaten and detained anti-government demonstrators protesting corruption and demanding more political freedoms. The celebrations in Iraq come nearly two weeks after the last convoy of U.S. troops crossed into Kuwait, ending an almost nine year war that saw more than 4,400 American military personnel and an estimated 115,000 Iraqis killed. Outside a Sunni mosque in northern Baghdad's Adhamiya district, a place where Sunnis and Shiites once battled one another and American troops, hundreds of men and boys gathered to listen to religious leaders who asked them to vow to preserve Iraq's independence.
