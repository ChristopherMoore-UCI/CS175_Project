He lied to the authorities in Greece about his sailing route and changed it from Egypt to Gaza," said IDF spokesman Brig. After the Israeli Navy intercepted the vessel, it engaged in a "dialogue" with the activists "in an attempt to dissuade them from continuing on their route" toward a maritime security blockade off the Gaza coast, the IDF said. The ship was part of a group of vessels that had planned to sail to Gaza in an effort to promote public awareness about Israel's blockade of the area. -- Israeli naval forces Tuesday successfully took over a boat of activists intent on breaking what they call the "siege of Gaza" without violent resistance. Israel insists on controlling access to Gaza because it says it has to keep weapons out of the hands of Palestinian militants who would use them to attack Israelis.
