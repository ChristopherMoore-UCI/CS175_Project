-- North Korea said Sunday it would no longer move forward with nuclear disarmament in response to a planned U.S.-South Korean joint military exercise. North Korea also announced it would no longer abide by the armistice that brought a truce to the Korean War, saying that South Korea violated the agreement by participating in the military cooperation with the United States. All talks between North Korea, the United States and South Korea will be suspended if the joint exercises go through as planned, North Korea said. Disarmament talks were already at an impasse between North Korea, the United States and other nations. "The process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will naturally come to a standstill and (North Korea) will bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defense," the statement said.
