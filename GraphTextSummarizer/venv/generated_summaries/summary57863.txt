Tunisian star says artists finally free after uprising Passionate about his country and his people, Naga says Egyptians are very proud of their African roots and adds that there are many lessons that African countries can learn from the Egypt revolution. He might be one of Egypt's most recognizable faces but in Cairo's Tahrir Square last January, when it became the focal point for anti-regime sentiment, actor Khaled Abol Naga was proud to be just one of the crowd. "It's an untapped treasure, the youth of Africa, not only the Arab world, because there is a lot of young people there. And that's why I always wanted to, I found myself doing these projects, awareness projects, with young people." The award-winning film star and activist, described by many fans as the "Egyptian Brad Pitt," was among the disgruntled Egyptians who filled the square last year when the daily gatherings of thousands of protesters ultimately led to the removal of longtime President Hosni Mubarak.
