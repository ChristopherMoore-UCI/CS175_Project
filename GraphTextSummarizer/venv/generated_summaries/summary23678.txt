In late 2009, Collum mine workers "threw missiles" at Chinese managers after receiving "slave wages," according to Zambian state media. The shooting at Collum is the latest in a string of attacks between Zambian workers and Chinese managers at the coal mine. Three Chinese employees were also injured and mine equipment damaged, according to Chinese state media. Politicians find themselves locked in a delicate dance: fostering a business climate that boosts Chinese investment while ensuring their constituencies don't feel shunned. Former presidential candidate Michael Sata is a major critic of Chinese employers in the nation.
