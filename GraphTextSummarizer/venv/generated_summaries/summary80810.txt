Flemmi testified he was by Bulger's side for most of it, saying both were FBI informants. He described hundreds of occasions when he and Bulger met with FBI agents. He had called Buccheri to a meeting to discuss the positioning of a fence on a property Bulger associate Kevin Weeks wanted to buy, Buccheri said. Bulger would give information about the Italian mob -- the FBI's prime target -- while Bulger, authorities said, got names of rival gang members and other informants who had dirt on him. " Flemmi was spared the death penalty on the 10 murder charge after agreeing to testify against Bulger and his disgraced FBI informant handler, John Connolly.
