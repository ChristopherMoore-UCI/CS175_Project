The result leaves PSG in third place behind Marseille, which drew with Stade Reims on Friday, and table-topping Lyon which heads to FC Lorient Sunday. Saturday's result moves Los Blancos four points clear atop the La Liga table although this will be cut back to one point if second placed Barcelona beats Levante at the Nou Camp Sunday. After a 4-0 derby thrashing at the hands of city rivals Atletico Madrid last weekend, Real manager Carlo Ancelotti will be content to return to winning ways. In Saturday's other cup fixtures, Premier League Stoke City was thrashed 4-1 by second-tier Blackburn. A nervy Real Madrid returned to winning ways Saturday with a 2-0 victory over mid-table Deportivo la Coruna at the Santiago Bernabeu.
