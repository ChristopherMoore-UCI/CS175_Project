The deadly 2007 incident heightened tensions between U.S. and Iraqi government officials and contributed to a protracted, ongoing debate over the extent of immunity that U.S. military personnel and civilian contractors will have from Iraqi laws.

Iraqi authorities have accused Blackwater guards of killing 17 civilians and wounding nearly 30 in the shootings.
