My mother, Halina Wind Preston, a Jewish educator who had survived 14 months hiding from the Nazis in the sewers of Lvov, Poland, conceived and planned the garden, and she unveiled markers bearing the names of two Polish Catholic sewer workers who had saved her: Leopold Socha and Stefan Wroblewski. An American audience first heard a survivor speak of the Lvov sewer episode on October 25, 1949, when Halina Wind, now a 27-year-old senior in the seminary's teachers institute, addressed the annual conference of the National Women's League of the United Synagogue of America, meeting in New York City. During three decades in Delaware, my mother inspired students and audiences of all faiths with the story of the Lvov sewer workers who saved her, establishing herself as the state's eloquent representative of the victims and survivors of the Nazis. The story of the Wilmington garden, and the Lvov sewer-survival story -- dramatized in Agnieszka Holland's movie "In Darkness" -- are particularly timely because the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has designated "Choosing to Act: Stories of Rescue" as this year's theme for Yom Hashoah, the day of remembrance, Thursday, April 19. My cover story about my mother in the Philadelphia Inquirer Sunday Magazine on Mother's Day 1983 -- five months after her death -- was the first full English-language presentation of the Lvov sewer rescue.
