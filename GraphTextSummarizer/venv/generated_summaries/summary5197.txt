-- A three-judge federal appeals panel has ruled that Tucson shooting suspect Jared Lee Loughner can refuse anti-psychotic medication. The hospital's medical staff began forcing him to take psychotropic medication after it deemed him to be a danger to himself and others. "Since Loughner has not been convicted of a crime, he is presumptively innocent and is therefore entitled to greater constitutional protections than a convicted inmate," court documents said. On May 25, a judge found Loughner incompetent to stand trial and committed him to federal custody for hospitalization at the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, where the staff will determine whether Loughner will become competent in the foreseeable future and, if so, oversee his mental restoration. "While both interests are significant, we conclude that preserving the dignity and bodily integrity of an individual who has not been convicted of a crime is the stronger interest, especially when the government has demonstrated that it is able to prevent that individual from harming himself or others.
