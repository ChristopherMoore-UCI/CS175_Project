Tenenbaum stressed that parents should always supervise young people around fireworks and that consumers should only buy legal products. "We know that 70 percent of all [fireworks-related] accidents occur between June 20 and July 20," commission head Inez Tenenbaum said during a demonstration of fireworks safety on the National Mall. That was the message from the Consumer Product Safety Commission Tuesday, which put out an early July Fourth holiday warning urging families to put safety first when celebrating with fireworks. Tenenbaum noted that the largest number of young people injured by fireworks are between the ages of 14 to 17. After Tenenbaum spoke, government lab technicians demonstrated some of the potentially deadly consequences that can result from a failure to observe basic firework safety.
