-- A poultry facility in southwest Missouri was quarantined after the discovery of a suspected case of bird flu, officials said. Additional tests will authenticate the viral disease at the Polk County facility, the state said Wednesday, adding that it is extremely rare for humans to be affected by this type of bird flu. Cargill Corp. will euthanize up to 15,000 younger birds exposed to older turkeys that tested positive for bird flu antibodies, said Mike Martin, director of communications for the company. Martin said Thursday the older birds are being harvested at another Missouri location. "The flu could have been present in the water, ground, air or transmitted by other migrating birds."
