His friend and fellow Cambridge mosque worshiper, pharmaceutical student Tarek Mehanna, is serving 17 years in federal prison after being found guilty of translating material for al Qaeda in Iraq, the precursor to ISIS. Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was kicked out of the Cambridge mosque, according to a mosque member who spoke to CNN at the time of the attack. " Law enforcement officials say the mosque has attracted a number of known terrorists and accused extremists, among them the accused Boston Marathon bombers, "Lady al Qaeda," and now an American fugitive wanted for questioning for possible ties to ISIS' social-media wing -- too many for law enforcement to ignore. Nor is there any evidence suggesting Cambridge mosque officials knew or were involved with the suspects, nor do they preach any form of radical Islam. The mosque on Prospect Street is not only Cambridge, Massachusetts,' largest mosque, but it is also the city's only mosque.
