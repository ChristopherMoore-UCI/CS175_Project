"Nobody reasonably thinks Chris Christie is opposed to vaccinating kids other than a bunch of reporters who want to write headlines." Cruz added in a statement that vaccines "have tremendous public health benefits." "But on the question of whether kids should be vaccinated, the answer is obvious, and there's widespread agreement: of course they should. "I've heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines," Paul said. At least three would-be Republican presidential contenders have said that vaccinating children should sometimes be done on a voluntary basis, but their careful comments on the issue underscore how problematic it could be for some of them in a primary fight. "The Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated. He went on to say that the debate over whether to vaccinate children should measure "whatever the perceived danger by the vaccine is — and we've had plenty of that over a period of time — versus what the risk to public health is."
