Playing in only 335 theaters, the Glee-ful singing competition flick grossed a tremendous $5.2 million, giving "Pitch Perfect" a robust $15,560 per theater average — the strongest of all movies that reported box-office numbers today. Check back next week for full box office coverage of Frankenweenie, Taken 2, and Pitch Perfect, and follow me on Twitter for up-to-the-minute box office updates. For the still-young Sony Pictures Animation (the animation division entered the marketplace in 2006 with Open Season), "Hotel Transylvania's" strong debut is the studio's best opening weekend yet. The monster hit, which earned an "A-" CinemaScore grade and a sizzling $12,840 per theater average, will continue to play to family audiences in the weeks leading up to the great pumpkin holiday, and will easily break the $100 million mark — a milestone that has evaded main voice actor Adam Sandler's last two films, "That's My Boy" ($36.9 million) and "Jack and Jill" ($74.2 million). The film, which cost a reported $19 million to make, bombed with only $2.7 million from 2,515 theaters, yielding a wretched $1,074 per theater average.
