Venezuela's alliance with Cuba in areas such as medicine has resulted in a system in which Cuba purchases medical equipment that it in turn sells to Venezuela at a markup, he said. The government of Hugo Chavez blames a long drought that has reduced energy production at the country's main hydroelectric dam, while others say the real problem is a lack of investment in energy infrastructure. Venezuela is facing critical electricity shortages that have created rolling blackouts in some areas. So critics are eying the subsequent hiring of Cuba's top Internet censor to help Chavez in Venezuela. "For us engineers in Venezuela, it makes no sense," Enzo Betancourt, president of Venezuela's Association of Engineers, told CNN.
