-- A Tel Aviv district court Tuesday sentenced former Israeli President Moshe Katsav to seven years in prison on multiple charges of rape and sexual harassment. In late December, the three-judge panel found Katsav guilty of two charges of rape, two charges of forceful sexual harassment and one charge of sexual harassment. The plea bargain caused a public storm in Israel, mainly because it did not include charges of rape, contrary to what had been suggested in a draft indictment. Katsav had agreed in 2007 to plead guilty to lesser charges and pay a fine to avoid jail time, but he pulled out of the deal when it came time to enter his plea. "This is a day of sadness and shame, but also one of deep appreciation and pride in the Israeli justice system," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
