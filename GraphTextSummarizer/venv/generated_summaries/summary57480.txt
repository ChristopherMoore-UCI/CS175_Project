In testimony before a tribunal, the girl told authorities she asked to speak to her relatives, but the police never responded, O Liberal reported, citing court documents. The girl -- who said she was forced to have sex for food and suffered burns and other abuse -- has denounced police in the small town of Abaetetuba for keeping her in the cell. The case has sparked outrage among human rights groups as well as government officials. One of them, Maria Imaculada, told O Liberal the young woman was courageous and talked to them in front of several policemen. Since the case made national headlines, other cases of women being sent to male prison cells have surfaced.
