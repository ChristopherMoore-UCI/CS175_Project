-- Officials are still trying to secure the release of dozens of U.N. peacekeepers from Fiji who were taken captive by al Qaeda-linked rebels from Syria. The Golan Heights border crossing made headlines earlier last week, when the al-Nusra Front handed over American journalist Peter Theo Curtis to U.N. peacekeepers on the Syrian side of the checkpoint. An Israeli military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN last week that the peacekeepers were being held by members of the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, one of the groups fighting the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. "These men are peacekeepers, not combatants in the Syrian conflict, and there is no need for them to be detained," Fijian Prime Minister J. V. Bainimarama said Friday. Fighting from Syria's civil war spilled over into the buffer zone last week.
