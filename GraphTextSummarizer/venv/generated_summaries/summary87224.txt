"To have brought the Arabian Oryx back from the brink of extinction is a major feat, one which we hope will be repeated many times over for other threatened species," said Razan Khalifa Al Mubarak, Director General of the Environment Agency -- Abu Dhabi. Captive bred oryx were successfully released back into the desert habitats of the country and then in regions of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel and Jordan. The main threats come from habitat loss, pollution, diseases and invasive species. The turn-around has been the result of conservation efforts that began in 1982 in Oman. The IUCN says that amphibians are one of the most threatened species groups with an estimated 41% at risk of extinction.
