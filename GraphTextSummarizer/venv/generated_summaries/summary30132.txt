The fragile U.S.-Russia relationship -- already frayed by disagreements over Syria, Iran and nuclear arms -- showed another sign of strain Sunday, as American lawmakers blasted the country's President Vladimir Putin for allowing NSA leaker Edward Snowden to land in Moscow while evading U.S. espionage charges. While Russia is not believed to be his final destination -- Ecuador's prime minister said Snowden applied for asylum in his country -- lawmakers on Sunday were quick to fault Putin for harboring a man the U.S. government desperately wants back. Asked Sunday whether he believed Putin had advance knowledge of Snowden's travel plans, Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said, "That wouldn't surprise me. Snowden, who has admitted leaking top-secret information about government surveillance programs, left Hong Kong on Sunday and later touched down in Moscow, according to Wikileaks, which helped him travel. "Persons wanted on felony charges, such as Mr. Snowden, should not be allowed to proceed in any further international travel, other than is necessary to return him to the United States," State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.
