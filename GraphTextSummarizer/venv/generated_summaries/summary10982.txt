Sheriff Newell Normand said earlier that investigators hadn't been able to talk to White, who officials said suffered from some type of mental illness. "What I saw originally was one of the officers getting sprayed with the wasp spray," said TSA agent Carol Richel, whose arm was hit by one of the bullets fired at White. The officer being sprayed with wasp spray picked up a bag and threw it at White to slow him down, but the suspect still barged through, Richel told reporters. " When White approached the checkpoint, he was carrying a bag that he dropped as soon as the first agent confronted him, Normand said. "And not unlike dealing with the mentally ill, sometimes you will never know what actually triggers some of this type of behavior." People who had recently interacted with White described him as very cordial, calm, cool and collected, Normand said.
