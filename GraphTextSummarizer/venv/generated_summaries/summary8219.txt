The commission of inquiry was appointed in October to investigate the causes of the accident, assess safety practices of passenger vessels, and make recommendations to avoid similar incidents. -- Crew members of the boats that collided in Hong Kong's deadliest maritime disaster in decades may face manslaughter charges, according to the director of public prosecutions, who spoke Wednesday at the preliminary hearing of the commission of inquiry. Thirty nine people, including eight children, were killed after a company-owned boat carrying Hong Kong Electric employees and their families was upended by a regular passenger ferry off Lamma, an outlying island. They had requested more time to review 30 boxes of government documents, compiled by rescue services, marine officials, and other departments. The chairman also rejected applications from lawyers representing the boat operators and crews to adjourn the hearing until next month.
