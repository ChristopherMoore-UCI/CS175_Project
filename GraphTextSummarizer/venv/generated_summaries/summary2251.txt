It was one of Bayern's regulars who opened the scoring, however, with Thomas Muller lashing the ball into the net from close range after a header from debutant Dante. Xerdan Shaqiri was handed his debut for Bayern, and tasked with replacing the ill Franck Ribery, with Brazilian defender Dante also making his first start in defence. Bayern dominated throughout and doubled their lead in the 59th minute when Croatian striker Mario Mandzukic -- signed in the summer from Wolfsburg -- headed his first goal of the season past goalkeeper Max Grun. In the 33rd minute, Juan Arango delivered a dangerous free kick into the box that tall striker Mike Hanke was able to head into the net to open the scoring. Bayer Leverkusen struggled in their first game of the season, going down 2-1 to Eintracht Frankfurt despite taking the lead in the first half.
