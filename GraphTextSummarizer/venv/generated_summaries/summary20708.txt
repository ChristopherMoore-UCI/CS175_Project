"We have determine that Ariel is a suspect in the sex video case, we charged him with the pornography law and with the 2008 electronic information and transaction law," said Marwoto Sutowijoyo, from national police public information. The first video, allegedly featuring Ariel and his current girlfriend Luna Maya, surfaced on several websites and went viral through social networking sites Facebook and Twitter. On Tuesday, after the release of the second video allegedly featuring Ariel and Tari, the term "Ariel Peterporn," a spin on the singer's name and his band, became a top trending topic on Twitter. Meanwhile, raids on internet cafes and the search of student cellphones at schools -- both confirmed by police -- have raised fears among defenders of free speech.
