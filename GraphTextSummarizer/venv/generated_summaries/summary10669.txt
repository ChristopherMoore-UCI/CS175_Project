Chavez's brother, Adan Chavez, who is governor of Chavez's home state of Barinas, recently returned from Cuba, where the president is undergoing cancer treatment. Chavez allies, including a majority of lawmakers in the country's congress, have said he should remain in power while taking the time he needs to recuperate. -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is not in a coma and is continuing to make strides in his recovery, his brother said. Last week, a government spokesman said Chavez was battling a severe lung infection that has caused respiratory failure. "The head of state continues to assimilate treatment well and, each day, advances in his recovery," said Adan Chavez, according to a statement posted Saturday by his office.
