Many members of that pledge class, as well others who he knew from SAE, have reached out to James in recent days by text, phone, email and Facebook. The episode has left James disgusted, horrified that members of a fraternity that once welcomed him could espouse such hatred. A video shot this Saturday of party-bound shows SAE members clapping, pumping their fists and chanting in unison: "There will never be a ni**** SAE," they sing. That's what James thinks that his own fraternity brothers would've done, whether he was around or not. While the Oklahoma frat has never had a lot of black members, that didn't matter to James when he joined in 2001.
