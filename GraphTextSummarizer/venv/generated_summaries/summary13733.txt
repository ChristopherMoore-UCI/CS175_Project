Chris Christie -- a self-styled truth teller with a penchant for political combat -- was notably cautious Wednesday when pressed on President Barack Obama's plan to issue immigration executive orders. Later, asked if he would repeal Obama's executive actions on immigration if he were elected president, he punted again, saying that questions about a hypothetical candidacy were irrelevant. "I want to thank Gov. Christie for believing in us, and the RGA for coming to the rescue," Hogan told reporters. "I speak on behalf of all the Republican governors, when I say thank you to Gov. Christie for his extraordinary leadership," Pence said.â€‹ But even as other Republican governors with White House ambitions sharply attacked the President's decision, Christie hedged on the hot-button issue when reporters broached the subject.
