Presidential elections will be held by June, according to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's acting ruling body. -- Egyptians reveled in their chance to vote in a post-Hosni Mubarak era during a second day of parliamentary elections, but nightfall brought new clashes in Cairo's Tahrir Square that stretched into Wednesday. But many voters expressed jubilation at their chance to help build a new Egypt after the popular revolt that toppled Mubarak. Voters decried the late opening of polling stations Monday and a delay in the arrival of ballots, leading the head of Egypt's election committee to promise a smoother voting process Tuesday. "I'm very happy, and I feel that even when I see old ladies hardly walking, it makes me feel that really Egypt is reviving."
