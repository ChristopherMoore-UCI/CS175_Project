But above all, what Nintendo has learned from its research over the past few decades -- and what television makers and rival game companies like Sony Computer Entertainment are learning -- is that 3-D plus glasses is a losing formula, Nintendo executives said. Nintendo sold 47 million units of the DS line of systems, which all have two screens, with one being a touchscreen. Playing games in 3-D "is something that we've been continually testing and working on at Nintendo," said Hideki Konno, who has directed or produced some of Nintendo's most prized franchises and was a key person in the 3DS's development, through an interpreter. "In order to make 3-D technology viable with video games, we thought we needed to have glasses-free 3-D." Nintendo's aversion to glasses could also rule out 3-D coming to its home console systems. "I think at Nintendo, we realize that any sort of goggle-type 3-D technology was not going to work," Konno said.
