RELATED: Ben Carson leaves Fox News, mulls run Fox said nothing further about Huckabee's status until Saturday, when a network spokesperson confirmed that it had "amicably parted ways with Huckabee." Huckabee, in his on-air sign-off, positioned it the same way. So what will Fox do with Huckabee's time slot? In a recent CNN/ORC poll about potential Republican presidential candidates, Huckabee received the support of 6 percent of respondents, putting him tied for fourth place. "I won't make a decision about running until late in the spring of 2015, but the continued chatter has put Fox News into a position that is not fair to them," Huckabee wrote in a letter to supporters Saturday evening released before his show started airing. Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, is ending his weekend program on Fox News -- effective immediately -- as he contemplates another run for president.
