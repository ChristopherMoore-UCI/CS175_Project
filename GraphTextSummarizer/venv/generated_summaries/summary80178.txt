"Noah goes to such dark places over the course of the movie that it's impossible to keep relating to him as a protagonist (sometimes to the point of comedy, intentional or otherwise), and it becomes necessary for the narrative to switch its viewpoint from character to character." For the most part, it appears the critics appreciate the efforts of both Crowe and Aronofsky -- who is best known for controversial films such as "Requiem for a Dream" and "Black Swan" -- even if they don't think the pair quite pull it off. Duralde says that "Unlike the thousands of CGI beasts of the land and air who hitch a ride on 'Noah,' Darren Aronofsky's highly-anticipated epic is neither fish nor fowl; in no way is it a straightforward Bible tale (and given the brevity of Genesis' account of the flood, such a thing would be next to impossible) nor is it the sort of unfettered freak-out that fans of 'Black Swan,' 'Pi' or 'The Fountain' would expect from its director and co-writer (with Ari Handel). The Brooklyn-born Aronofsky and his Harvard roomie and writing partner, Ari Handel -- 'two not very religious Jewish guys,' says the director -- are hellbent on making their Noah relevant for believers and skeptics alike." Post film critic Ann Hornaday calls it a slightly different take on the biblical story and writes, "The result is a movie that is clearly deeply respectful of its source material but also at times startlingly revisionist, a go-for-broke throwback to Hollywood biblical epics of yore that combines grandeur and grace, as well as a generous dollop of goofy overstatement.
