After insisting for months that any U.S. hospital could handle an Ebola case by following CDC guidelines, Frieden now wishes he had provided Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with the robust CDC clinical support team it desperately needed to care for Thomas Eric Duncan -- the first of three people to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil. Frieden should have known the closest equivalent to the level of personal protective equipment required by Ebola in American hospitals is found in operating rooms, and even that doesn't compare. The fact that more than 70 health care workers were involved in Duncan's care points to Presbyterian's lack of preparedness; hospitals that have a plan know it's essential to limit staff coming into contact with Ebola patients, who become progressively more contagious the sicker they become. Frieden's out-of-the-loop status on core clinical details seemed to have pointed him in the wrong direction entirely for a cause of contamination, as further details about the Dallas hospital's difficulties with Ebola protective garb have come to light. This weekend Frieden told reporters: "I'm not familiar with any prior patient with Ebola who has undergone either intubation or dialysis," and speculated that such measures could have increased the risk of contamination surrounding Duncan's care in Dallas.
