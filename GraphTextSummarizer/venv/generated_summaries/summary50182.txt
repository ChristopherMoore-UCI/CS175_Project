The eight unknown Gacy victims make up the department's largest cold case, so Dart approved their exhumations in order to obtain new DNA evidence and, if possible, identify them. The Cook County Sheriff's Office says new technology has allowed it to obtain DNA profiles for the eight victims, whose remains were recovered from Gacy's house in late 1978 and early 1979 but were never identified. "The public coming forward will allow us to do DNA matches that were not available 30 years ago," Dart said Wednesday. "These were eight young men who had futures, and one of the most evil people to ever be on this planet destroyed their lives," Sheriff Thomas Dart said Wednesday. Gacy was known to have targeted bus stations, the sheriff's office said, seeking victims who were traveling.
