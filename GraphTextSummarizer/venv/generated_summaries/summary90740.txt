"We think the sharp increase could partially be due to people having more interest in China this year because of the Olympics in Beijing." With just three months to go before the Olympics in Beijing begins, some runners said they feel they have already taking part in this year's Games. "Though I will not be here when the Olympics conclude with the marathon event," an unidentified runner joked as he finished the final section of the wall, "I can say that I was already there, and my marathon in China was on the Great Wall." "This is more than just a running event, it is also an exchange of culture," said Thomas Orr, a South African who has been working in Beijing the past three years and ran the marathon last year. Theobald had a tattoo of the Great Wall Marathon designed on her back as a reminder of her desire to complete this year's marathon. The Great Wall marathon typically takes runners 50 percent longer to complete than their average marathon. "The number of participants in this year's race increased by 50 percent," announced Lars Fyhr, the International Sales and Event Manager for Albatros Travel, the tour agency that organized the race.
