It's also not known how exercise may impact weight loss over the long term. As with so many other things in life, exercise may work best if you follow the Goldilocks rule: exercise neither too little nor too much, if your goal is to shed extra weight, a new study finds. For more weight loss, exercise less? Previous research has shown that exercise alone doesn't reliably lead to weight loss -- without accompanying restrictions in diet -- a dismaying fact that many hopeful weight-losers know firsthand. The men in the high-intensity exercise group lost an average of 5 pounds, but while weight loss was expected, the researchers said these men lost about 20% less than they would have anticipated, given how many extra calories they were burning.
