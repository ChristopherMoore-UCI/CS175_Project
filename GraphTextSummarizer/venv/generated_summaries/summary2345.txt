-- Riot police descended on scores of anti-government protesters in the streets of Thailand's capital as violence intensified early Monday. "That was, until a few hours ago where .. they have started to crack down on this movement." Earlier, Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva announced a state of emergency Sunday in the capital and surrounding areas in an attempt to tamp down days of heightening protests. Immediately after Abhisit's state-of-emergency declaration, dozens of protesters stormed the country's Interior Ministry and pelted Abhisit's car with rocks, chairs, flags and sticks as he escaped. Protesters elsewhere lit fires in the streets, blocked intersections and surrounded the prime minister's office, where there was no sign of security. Thai soldiers secure an area early Monday in Bangkok after dispersing protesters.
