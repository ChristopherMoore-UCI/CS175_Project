Garner's case is not the first to suffer from these deadly intersections -- the language we've heard echoes numerous other cases in which police and their defenders blame disability for the results of police violence. What we are seeing in the death of Eric Garner and the reaction to the initial exoneration of his killer, is the intersection of racism, fat-hatred (as discussed by Melissa McEwan), and the failure of law enforcement to accommodate disability. It seems that every time a person with schizophrenia or other psychiatric disabilities gets hurt by law enforcement, the officers justify their actions by explaining that the individual acted in unpredictable ways, was potentially threatening, and so force had to be applied. How the high court rules on the case will shape law enforcement reactions to disability for the foreseeable future. Sheehan, a woman with psychiatric disabilities, was shot by police in 2008.
