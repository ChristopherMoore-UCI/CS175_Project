In the last two years, many a respectable economist has argued the end was nigh for Europe's single currency, as well as the EU at large. The Nobel communique does not begin to describe what the EU has done for Europe, but history can. It's not just European institutions like the central bank and the Commission that speak of "more Europe" as the solution. With all its imperfections, Europe today is the largest single market in the world, featuring effective anti-trust regulations, curtailing economic nationalism, and promoting free trade agreements with counties as far away as Asia and Latin America. In its aftermath, as Churchill warned, "an iron curtain descended across the Continent," and whole nations lived in the misery and rubble left behind by aerial bombing.
