The film follows retired university professor Craig Ewert during the last four days of his life in 2006, when he visited a Swiss clinic with his wife, Mary, in order to die. The 59-year-old suffered from motor neurone disease (MND), which deprived him of the use of his arms and legs and caused him to be on a ventilator, Mary Ewert told The Independent. In a clip on the Web site of British satellite channel Sky Real Lives, which planned to air the documentary, he dictates an e-mail to his son and daughter in America. "I truly expect that death is the end, that there is no everlasting soul, no afterlife," Ewert says. -- A British TV channel was scheduled to air a controversial documentary Wednesday night showing a terminally ill man committing assisted suicide.
