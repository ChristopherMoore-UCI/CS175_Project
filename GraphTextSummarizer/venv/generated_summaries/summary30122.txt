-- AC Milan went top of Serie A for the first time this season with a 3-1 victory over Palermo in the San Siro as previous leaders Lazio lost 1-0 at newly-promoted Cesena Wednesday. Diego Milito scored ony his third goal of the season on 76 minutes as he returns from injury, but Uruguayan Ruben Oliver leveled for Lecce just three minutes later. Marco Parolo scored the only goal of the game five minutes from time to sink Lazio. Esteban Granero's early goal put Real ahead before Gonzalo Higuain's controversial second, which saw Sergio Ramos clearly obstruct visiting goalkeeper Dani Hernandez from an offside position. In Spain's Copa Del Rey, Real Madrid thumped Real Murcia 5-1 at home to avoid the domestic cup upsets of recent seasons.
