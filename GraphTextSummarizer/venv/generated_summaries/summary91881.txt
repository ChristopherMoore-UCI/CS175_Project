With ratings that abysmal, one might think that House Republicans might use a turnover in leadership as an opportunity to steer their sinking ship in a new direction. Just 19% of tea party Republicans believe immigration helps the United States, compared to 47% of the country at large. House Republicans just went through the pageantry of the changing of the guard with their leadership elections. With House Republicans beholden to this tiny minority of the country at large, they will continue to drag their party to the right â€” and their so-called leadership will have no choice but to follow, if they want to keep their jobs. If we learned one thing from Republicans' elections, it's that their leadership simply follows their tea party base in an unceasing march to the right.
