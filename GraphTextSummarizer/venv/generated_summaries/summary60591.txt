The cross began to be retrieved as a symbol of power, so that instead of being a symbol of shameful death it became an emblem of victory over death. There are a lot of really interesting studies of the emergence of the cross in early Christian art; I'd recommend Robin Jensen's "Understanding Early Christian Art" as a great place to start. So, early on, Christians used images of Daniel in the lion's den, Jonah and the whale and the three young men in the fiery furnace in the funeral art as symbols of resurrection and conquest of death. The Department of Botany at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem concluded that the wood underneath the nail was olive wood. The Jewish historian Josephus tells us that wood was scarce around Jerusalem in the first century A.D. and that the Romans had to travel 10 miles to secure timber for the siege of Jerusalem (Jewish War 5.522-23).
