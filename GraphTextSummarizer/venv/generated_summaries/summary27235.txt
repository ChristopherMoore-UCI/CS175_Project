The first President's dislike for political parties still fits with the reality in which most Americans live today. Both parties today would likely level such charges against one another, while most Americans recognize that both parties share responsibility for the current situation. Fiorina points out that most Americans are not hard-core ideologues. He warned: "The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism." The effect of the polarized nation narrative is disillusionment for many Americans and undue influence for the more ideological in our midst.
