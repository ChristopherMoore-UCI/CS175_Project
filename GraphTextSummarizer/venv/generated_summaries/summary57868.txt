News of the publishing shutdown rattled consumers enough to cause a spike in sales to 1,050 a week, company spokesman Peter Duckler told CNN. Just three weeks after the publisher of the iconic encyclopedia announced it would be ceasing print production after 244 years, more than 3,000 printed copies of the final edition, the 2010 version, have sold at the standard price of $1,395 Cauz said.
