Minus star players Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres, Liverpool saw their 1-0 first leg advantage wiped out in just four minutes in Turkey when Colombian international Teofilo Gutierrez put Trabzonspor ahead. But there was more disappointment for a third English Premier League side as Aston Villa, thrashed 6-0 at the weekend by Newcastle, lost 3-2 at home to Austrian side Rapid Vienna. -- Liverpool shrugged off conceding an early goal to beat Turkish side Trabzonspor 2-1 and qualify for the group stages of the Europa League with a 3-1 aggregate victory. It was a welcome boost for Liverpool after their 3-0 thrashing by Manchester City, who also reached the group stages with a 2-0 home win over Romanian side FC Timisoara at Eastlands, going through 3-0 on aggregate. But Roy Hodgson's side drew level seven minutes from time as Trabzonspor's Giray Kacar turned a Glen Johnson cross into his own net.
