Dengue is most common in Asia and India, but more cases have been popping up in the Caribbean and Latin America in recent years. In mild cases, dengue fever causes a high fever, rash and joint and muscle pain. The Honduran government has declared a state of emergency after an increase in dengue cases. Tuesday's state of emergency declaration is scheduled to last until the end of the year. There are 13,828 cases in the Central American nation, according to data released by emergency officials on Tuesday.
