Max Rutherston, Chairman of Asian Art in London, says the week of Asian art sales and exhibitions in London has been running for 13 years, and has seen a "Chinese art boom," with collectors from mainland China and Hong Kong flocking to London to check out the array of antique wares laid out in the salesrooms and galleries. So why do Chinese buyers come to London to buy art? Now dealers and auction houses in London are feverishly anticipating a slew of sales as part of Asian Art in London, a week-long event that has been attracting newly-wealthy Chinese buyers and collectors to the capital for over a decade. And with the new class of Chinese buyers entering the market right now, high prices have become normalized. "It's a true tide-change," said Asian art dealer Daniel Eskenazi, whose London dealership has been running for 50 years.
