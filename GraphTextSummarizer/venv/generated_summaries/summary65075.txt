Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton called in National Guard helicopters to assist firefighters as the Pagami Creek fire, located in the remote Superior National Forest. About 25 National Guard troops and four Black Hawk helicopters activated by Tuesday evening, the state Guard reported. It spread from about 11,000 acres on Monday to more than 100,000 by Tuesday afternoon, said Doug Anderson, a spokesman for the firefighting effort. -- A wildfire in a northeast Minnesota woodland grew by nearly tenfold Tuesday, giving off a pall of smoke that stretched from the Canadian border to southern Wisconsin. Air National Guard members were also activated to assist the effort.
