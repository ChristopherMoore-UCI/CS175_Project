Owen Wilson making porn drama for Starz "Tina and Robert, who cemented their partnership on '30 Rock,' have created a new signature comedy for us that is audacious, emotional, and clever," said Robert Greenblatt, Chairman, NBC Entertainment. Added Jennifer Salke, President, NBC Entertainment: "Original voices like Tina and Robert don't come along very often and we wanted them back on the air as soon as possible. "The Office" actress will star in a new sitcom written and produced by "30 Rock's" Tina Fey and Robert Carlock. NBC has been their home for many years and we're so happy that they've found another way to push the comedy envelope for us. The series will center on a woman (Kemper) who "escapes from a doomsday cult and starts life over in New York City."
