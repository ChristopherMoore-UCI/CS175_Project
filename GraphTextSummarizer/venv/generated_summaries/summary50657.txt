Q: In your new film, Machine Gun Preacher, you play the wife of an ex-drug-addict-turned-evangelist who crusades to protect Sudanese children from the horrors of war. Sipping mint tea, she talks workouts, health scares, and her secret weapon for PMS. Sitting in an L.A. cafÃ©, I see no sign of Michelle Monaghan, 35, whose career has soared since playing Tom Cruise's love interest in "Mission: Impossible III." Could it be that the famously down-to-earth star -- who grew up in Winthrop, Iowa, Population: 850 -- has turned diva? When I was growing up, my parents took in foster children. From a young age, I learned that there are a lot of children in need.
