According to a CNN count based on available figures, just a little more than 200,000 people have signed up for new private health insurance under Obamacare -- either through the national system or networks set up in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Officials fear another huge surge in volume that the site can't handle, which is what occurred around the October 1 launch of new insurance exchanges under Obama's signature health care reforms. While Sebelius is technically the top administration official overseeing implementation of Obamacare, former White House aide Jeff Zients was brought in last month to oversee efforts to fix the troubled website. "If the President won't repeal it, he should at least delay the entire law before it wreaks any more havoc on American families and small businesses, as well as our economy." Wednesday's development came as the Obama administration prepared for a potential surge in online enrollment in response to its pledge to have the HealthCare.gov website functioning smoothly for most users by the end of November. Separately,  an HHS official confirmed the government will go with a new web-hosting contractor, Hewlett-Packard, for HealthCare.gov early next year.
