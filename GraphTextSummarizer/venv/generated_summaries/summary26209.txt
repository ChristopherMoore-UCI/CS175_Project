The victory maintains City's 100% record in home league matches this season and draws them within a point of Premier League leaders and bitter rivals Manchester United. But when Pablo Zabaleta's shot hit the arm of Chelsea substitute Michael Essien, City were handed a lifeline and Argentina striker Aguero slotted home the spot kick. But Rangers hit back with three goals in the last 14 minutes, from Shaun Derry, former Liverpool striker Djibril Cisse and Jamie Mackie. A late strike from Samir Nasri, set up by the returning Carlos Tevez, helped Manchester City maintain their quest for a first English league title in 44 years with a 2-1 win over Chelsea on Wednesday. The London side had to rely on an injury-time goal from Netherlands international Rafael Van der Vaart to salvage a draw after striker Cameron Jerome had put City in front.
