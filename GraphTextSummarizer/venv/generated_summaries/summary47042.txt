"There were some stops and starts to it since it started yesterday (Wednesday) morning at 7 a.m., but I do know it originally started through a customer," said Starbucks spokesperson Linda Mills. -- A pay it forward chain that began in a St. Petersburg, Florida, Starbucks linked more than 750 strangers in a two-day act of coffee kindness. So it was nice," one customer told CNN affiliate Bay News 9. St. Petersburg blogger Peter Schorsch asked that readers don't call him a "grinch" for allegedly ending the pay it forward chain. "We are greatly humbled by the generosity of our customers and store partners in the organic Pay if Forward movement happening in St. Petersburg, Florida," said Mills.
