In the end, "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword" is an underwhelming game that mostly sticks to the successful path that Link has been on for the past 25 years. On one hand, the "Zelda" franchise has provided many hours of enjoyment for fans for 25 years, while chronicling the adventures of everyone's favorite green-hat-wearing elf, Link. Contrast that with previous games where Link looks like a kid. Epona, Link's trusted horse, has been replaced by a giant bird that carries him to distant locations. "Skyward Sword" is full of what we've come to know and love about Link.
