Argentina 2-0 Greece Argentina coach Diego Maradona rested strikers Gonzalo Higuain and Carlos Tevez as Diego Milito and Sergio Aguero came into the starting line-up. But despite needing more than a point to go through due to the score in the Nigeria versus South Korea game, Greece continued to sit back. -- Argentina booked their place in the second round of the World Cup after a 2-0 win over Greece and were joined by South Korea, who secured their berth with a thrilling 2-2 draw against Nigeria. Late goals from Martin Demichelis and Martin Palermo maintained Argentina's 100% record as they booked a last 16 knockout match with fellow Latin American side Mexico. Nigeria and South Korea battled it out for second spot in the group in a game that swung one way and then the other in Durban.
