-- Ash clouds from a Chilean volcano continued to cause numerous flight cancellations in Australia and New Zealand Tuesday for at least one airliner. The airliner has also canceled flights to and from New Zealand Tuesday because of the ash cloud. The company said it would resume flights to and from Adelaide on Wednesday and that all mainland Australian flights would run as scheduled on Wednesday, as well. Virgin Australia announced on its website that flights to those same areas were expected to run on schedule Tuesday. The U.S. Geological Survey says more than 80 commercial aircraft have unexpectedly encountered volcanic ash in flight and at airports in the past 15 years.
