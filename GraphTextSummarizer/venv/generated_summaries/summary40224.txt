India's federal cabinet approved "irretrievable breakdown of marriage" as a ground for couples to part ways, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni told reporters. Under original Hindu marriage laws, both estranged partners have to appear at court proceedings for settlement of their lawsuit for divorce by consent. He was referring to a growing number of Indian women joining the workforce who he says refuse to remain trapped in unwanted marriages. In India, marriages are solemnized as a well-guarded union. There was no official data on divorces immediately available, but matchmakers say four in 100 marriages fail in India.
