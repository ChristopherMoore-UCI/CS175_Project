The double-decker ferry was overcrowded when it tipped over Sunday afternoon between the popular resort of Pattaya and Koh Lan, an island off the coast, said Lt. Wuttipon Trakulviratikul, a Pattaya police official. He said police were yet to confirm the total number of people on board the ferry, although it was estimated to be around 100. Six people died after the tourist ferry they were traveling on capsized near a Thai beach resort, authorities said. In February: 2 dead, 15  missing after ferry capsizes in Philippines
