Both Michael and his half-sister, 8-month-old Liliana Ruth, receive a 50% stake in property Gandolfini owns in Italy. -- Late actor James Gandolfini's will left large amounts of money to family and friends, with much of it going to his teenage son, Michael, according to a copy of his will made public Wednesday. The remainder of his estate is divided among his direct family: Lin, Liliana, and Gandolfini's sisters Johanna Antonacci and Leta Gandolfini. Gandolfini's widow, Deborah Lin, receives all of Gandolfini's tangible property, aside from the clothing and jewelry. The trust also has the option to purchase Gandolfini's Greenwich Village condominium in New York.
