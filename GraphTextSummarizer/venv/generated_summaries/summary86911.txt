Government officials approved a name change to "Heroic Ciudad Juarez" to emphasize the city's participation in the Mexican Revolution, but only as a symbolical slogan and not for official purposes, said Enrique Serrano Escobar, coordinator with the office of Chihuahua state representatives. A statistic must be considered as a long process and not in a comparison of one month to another," Ciudad Juarez criminologist Oscar Maynes said. Ciudad Juarez is the city with the highest number of homicides in Mexico, with a record 8,000 victims since 2008, according to the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. The homicide rate in Mexico's most violent city -- Ciudad Juarez -- is down, according to Mexican President Felipe Calderon, but some residents of the city are not convinced. Over the weekend, Calderon said homicides had fallen by 60% in Juarez since last October, comparing statistics from that month with April's numbers.
