CNN's Anderson Cooper will reveal this year's top 10 CNN Heroes during the 8 a.m. hour of "New Day." This is the seventh year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. This year's tribute show will be held in New York and hosted by Cooper at the American Museum of Natural History. Each will receive $50,000 and be honored at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," a globally broadcast event that airs December 1. One of the top 10 will receive an additional $250,000 for their cause if the public chooses them as the CNN Hero of the Year.
