"We haven't seen any definite nucleus yet," said Padma Yanamandra-Fisher with the Space Science Institute and NASA's Comet ISON Observing Campaign. Members of the group's Facebook page spotted what may be the remnants of ISON in satellite images soon after experts at NASA's Google Hangout on ISON said it looked like the comet had broken up and melted into the sun. NASA scientists, professional and amateur astronomers are analyzing images from NASA satellites to learn more about comet's fate. Its amazing journey through the solar system had been chronicled by amateur astronomers and by space telescopes. Comet watchers will have to wait until ISON, or what's left of it, are a bit further from the sun to get more information.
