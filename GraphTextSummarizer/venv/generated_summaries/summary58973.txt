Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola opted to start with Thierry Henry up front alongside Messi, leaving expensive pre-season signing Zlatan Ibrahimovic -- who scored the equalizer in Stuttgart last month -- on the bench. -- Lionel Messi underlined his status as the best player in the world with two inspirational goals and an assist as holders Barcelona cruised into the quarterfinals of the Champions League with a 4-0 victory at home to Stuttgart on Wednesday night. Messi went close again in the 86th minute as he skipped through the Barcelona defense and dinked a chip past Lehmann, but wide of the goal. While Cristiano Ronaldo, the world's most expensive player, was unable to stop Spanish rivals Real Madrid crashing out of Europe's premier club competition last week, Messi made sure that Barcelona suffered no such embarrassment ahead of Friday's last-eight draw. Messi, who netted a hat-trick against Valencia on Sunday, then set Yaya Toure free in the penalty box with a delightful angled ball behind the Stuttgart defense, and the Ivory Coast midfielder's low cross gave young winger Pedro a simple chance to sidefoot into the net.
