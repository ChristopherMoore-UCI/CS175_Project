At least 33 people -- mostly women -- were killed in the explosion, Pemex chief Emilio Lozoya said at a news conference Friday. Watch: Blast rocks Mexico City Lozoya was asked if he believed Pemex, the powerful but often criticized state oil monopoly, was the target of a bombing, but he declined to speculate. -- A day after an explosion rocked its offices in Mexico City, Mexico's state-run oil giant Pemex says it's too early to speculate on the cause of the deadly blast. The oil company's production capabilities have not been harmed, and operations and oil production will continue Friday as normal, Lozoya said. Employees at the Pemex annex said that the basement of the building, where he explosion is believed to have originated, housed a water treatment facility, storage areas and archives.
