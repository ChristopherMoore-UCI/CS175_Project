Our resistance to marriage, then, had nothing to do with an absence of love. The problem was that the two of us were both survivors of bad divorces, and we'd been so badly gutted by our experiences that the very idea of legal marriage -- with anyone, even with such nice people as each other -- filled us with a heavy sense of dread. Like anyone who has ever walked through the valley of the shadow of divorce, Felipe and I had each learned firsthand this distressing truth: that every intimacy carries, secreted somewhere below its initial lovely surfaces, the ever-coiled makings of complete catastrophe. Thus, you can feasibly find yourself trapped for months or even years in a loveless legal bond that has come to feel rather like a burning building. What had followed was attraction, then a slow courtship, and then, much to our mutual wonderment, love.
