Daughter Emily Castro in prison for slashing baby's throat Domestic violence Gregg recalled fond memories of growing up in the house and fun times with her father. Gregg's mother died in 2012 after a bout with brain cancer. Gregg, her husband and Castro "ate, looked at photos and listened to music," she said. The music was usually turned up loud, but Gregg thought this to be fitting since Castro was a musician. Castro clung to home, never wanting to leave for more than a day, even to visit Gregg out of state when she lived with her family in Indiana.
