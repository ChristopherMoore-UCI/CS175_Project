By not adding a camera to its iPod Touch, Apple may boost sales of its iPod Nano. That Apple included a video camera inside the iPod Nano makes this more inexplicable still -- the Apple of today is clearly happy to put cameras into its media players (unlike the first iPhone, whose camera was so poor we thought it was just a petulant capitulation to cellphone norms). Apple's decision to not include a camera in the new iPod Touch is somewhat surprising. The Nano is the fitness iPod, too, and in this guise it makes another piece of hardware obsolete: Take a look at the sample videos at the Apple store and you'll see that the Nano's quality is easily "good enough."
