Elsewhere in Southern California, a harbor officer was killed in the waters of Catalina Island, and the death appears to be weather-related, Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Wednesday. Crews began using snowcats late Tuesday and rescued 136 trapped motorists on Highway 138 at Old Mill Road by 3 a.m. Wednesday, authorities told CNN affiliate KABC. The motorists became tuck near the town of Crestline, when a wreck blocked the road, and snow piled in on top of them, San Bernardino County Fire Chief Mark Hartwig said. The strength of the Californian winds was captured Wednesday on a YouTube video as the gust blasted through the Rose Bowl grounds, a day before the college playoff game between No. 2 Florida State and No. 3 Oregon. In all, at least two people in California were killed in storm-related incidents since Tuesday, authorities said Wednesday.
