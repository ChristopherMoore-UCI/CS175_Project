Romney's 2010 tax return, when combined with his FEC disclosure, reveals red flags that raise serious tax compliance questions with respect to his possible tax minimization strategies in earlier years. Since George Romney inaugurated the practice more than 40 years ago by releasing 12 years of tax returns in his bid for the Republican Party nomination, presidential nominees have been transparent with voters about their personal finances. Third, the vast amounts in Romney's family trusts raise a parallel question: Did Romney report and pay gift tax on the funding of these trusts or did he claim similarly unreasonable valuations, which likewise would have exposed him to serious penalties if all the facts were known? The account seems to have been closed early in 2010, but was the income in fact reported on earlier tax returns? News: Romney campaign expected to launch multipronged effort to rebut attacks Given Romney's financial sophistication, it has been assumed by some that there cannot be any tax skeletons in his closet.
