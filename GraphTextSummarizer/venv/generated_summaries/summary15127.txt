The father of first mate Shane Murphy on Saturday offered thanks for the "tremendous outpouring" of support his family has received from the public and government officials, including U.S. Sens.

Maersk president and CEO John Reinhart told reporters Saturday that the crew will stay on board in Mombasa while the FBI conducts an investigation.
