The killing, which was still under investigation Sunday afternoon, follows a long series of "insider" attacks by Afghan troops or infiltrators on U.S. and allied troops, including one in September that killed three Americans in eastern Afghanistan. Sunday's attack came a day after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Afghan President Hamid Karzai worked out what Kerry called "the major issues" in talks aimed at keeping some American military forces in Aghanistan after 2014. Without an agreement on immunity, U.S. troops would leave Afghanistan with other NATO contingents at the end of 2014. So-called "green on blue" attacks killed dozens of coalition troops in 2012, prompting the U.S. command in Kabul to stop some joint operations with Afghan security forces. But a potential deal-breaker, legal immunity for U.S. troops, was referred to a council of Afghan elders.
