The second shooting victim suffered non-life threatening injuries, according to Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. Quebec voters have twice rejected referendums supporting sovereignty for the province, the last time in a closely contested 1995 vote, said Antonia Maioni, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. Pauline Marois was speaking to excited supporters near midnight Tuesday when the man, dressed in what appeared to be a bathrobe and face mask and armed with two guns, slipped into the Montreal concert hall and opened fire. Quebec voters first elected a separatist government in 1976, and since that time the province has quarreled with the English-speaking majority in the rest of Canada over its position in the country. While Marois talked up the issue with the party faithful, she pitched to the broader electorate with a message of change and a platform calling for expanded economic programs and government financial reforms, Maioni said.
