Tomiichi Murayama, who served as the nation's premier from 1994 to 1996, visited South Korea this week for a three-day visit, during which he met with former comfort women in Seoul. While recent nationalist gestures from Japan's political rulers continue to rile neighbors South Korea and China, a former prime minister is aiming to make some amends in his own way. Murayama said Japan's wartime policy of providing comfort women to its troops meant that it had committed "indescribable wrongdoings," the Japan Times reported. The issue of comfort women, and the Japanese acknowledgement of them, is controversial and consistently topical in South Korea. Murayama also spoke at Korea's National Assembly this week, as part of a trip organized by Korea's minor opposition Justice Party, as well as meeting members of both the ruling party and the opposition.
