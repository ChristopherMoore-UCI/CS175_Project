CNN: How do video games compare to books and TV as a storytelling medium? Harris: Video games are visual like TV, but involve a certain amount of comprehension that TV often doesn't. What key differences are involved in writing for passive and interactive formats, e.g. novels vs. games? Harris: For me, writing books is about the progression of the characters as they change to meet circumstances on their way to the climax of the book. Knowing this, are games becoming a better medium both artistically and commercially than typical channels such as books, essays and short stories for writers to make their mark? -- The author of the Sookie Stackhouse series of supernatural thrillers and inspiration for HBO's popular drama "True Blood," Charlaine Harris, is putting her eye for suspense toward an equally arresting subject: Video games. A hidden-object game designed for casual play by both women and men, it aims to bridge the gap between paperback readers and gaming fans, leveraging Harris' gift for crafting clever characters and scenarios.
