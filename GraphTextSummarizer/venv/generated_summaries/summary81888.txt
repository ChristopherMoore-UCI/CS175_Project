Hong Kong protests: What you need to know Both sides have demonstrated restraint, with the protesters remaining largely peaceful and the government pulling back riot police after a day of aggressive crowd control tactics. With their actions, the Hong Kong citizens are assembling the pieces for greater civil and political participation in not only Hong Kong but also mainland China. Hong Kong was returned to mainland China from the British Commonwealth in 1997, its institutions grounded in Western and democratic thought. As the removal of riot police reveals, the international presence in Hong Kong means that Beijing does not have the same freedom of action as it does on the mainland. The Chinese government is aggressively censoring posts on Weibo, a popular social media site -- censored posts reportedly increased five-fold over the weekend, and "Hong Kong" is now the most widely deleted search term on the social media site -- and Instagram was blocked for the first time in Hong Kong.
