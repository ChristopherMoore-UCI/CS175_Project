What the show lacked in suspense was made up with entertainment as two-time Tony host Neil Patrick Harris guided the three-hour broadcast from Broadway's Beacon Theatre. "It it weren't for you, we wouldn't be here," Trey Parker told fans of his Comedy Central animated series "South Park" as he and Casey Nicholaw accepted the Tony for best direction of a musical. If an award was given for the most emotional and breathless acceptance speech, it might have gone to Nikki M. James, the 30-year-old actress who claimed her first Tony after a decade of work on Broadway. " "Anything Goes" also won for best musical revival and best choreography. The former "Night Court" actor won the best featured actor in a musical for his Broadway debut in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." Ellen Barkin, a veteran film and television actress, won the best featured actress in a play Tony for her Broadway debut in "The Normal Heart."
