Wheeler worked in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. He said police are also working with Amtrak officials in an effort to determine whether Wheeler had been on a train from Washington to Wilmington that he had been scheduled to take near the time of the death. A man whom police identified as Wheeler was recorded by security cameras in an office building in downtown Wilmington as late as 8:30 p.m. December 30, the day before his body was discovered, according to a police statement Wednesday. An area newspaper, The News Journal, reported in its online edition that Wheeler walked into a pharmacy in New Castle, asking for a ride to Wilmington at 6 p.m. December 29. Farrall said Wheeler's body was seen jutting out of a garbage truck Friday at the landfill by a spotter whose job it is to ensure that hazardous material is not dumped there.
