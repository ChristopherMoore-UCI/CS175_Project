The ruling coalition this week sacked the heads of both chambers of Parliament, who were Basescu allies, and replaced them with politicians close to the prime minister. Romania's coalition of Social Democrats and Liberals argued their action by saying that President Traian Basescu has breached the Constitution and overstepped his authority. In addition, the prime minister accused some Constitutional Court judges of political bias and incompatibility and suggested that they should be replaced. -- Romania's president Traian Basescu was suspended on Friday, after the impeachment motion filed by the ruling coalition passed the Parliament's vote. Earlier this week Romania's Parliament passed a law making it easier to impeach Basescu, a decision that sparked some controversy.
