The European Commission warned Hungary Tuesday it faces legal action over controversial reforms introduced by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The string of constitutional changes introduced by Orban's center-right government have generated much controversy within Hungary, where his party, Fidesz, has a dominant position in Parliament. " Infringement proceedings are a step preceding legal action, intended to enable a state to make changes to conform with EU law rather than be taken to court. The EU then raised the prospect of taking Hungary to the European Court of Justice, Europe's highest court, over Orban's constitutional overhaul. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said the move reflects its determination to see that EU law is fully respected.
