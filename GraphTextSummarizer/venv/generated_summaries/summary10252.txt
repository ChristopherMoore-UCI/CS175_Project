Scientists are hoping the probe will help us learn a lot more about the composition of comets and how they react when they get close to the Sun. According to details on ESA's Rosetta website, sensors on the lander will measure the density and thermal properties of the surface, gas analyzers will help to detect and identify any complex organic chemicals that might be present, while other tests will measure the magnetic field and interaction between the comet and solar wind -- high-energy particles given off by the Sun. Before Tuesday's announcement, ESA lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that the orbiter Rosetta has to be in the right position to allow the craft to "free fall" on the correct trajectory to the chosen landing site. What can we learn from comet landing? O'Rourke explained that hours before separation, Philae's on-board batteries are prepared and a fly wheel is started to give the probe stability on its journey to the comet surface.
