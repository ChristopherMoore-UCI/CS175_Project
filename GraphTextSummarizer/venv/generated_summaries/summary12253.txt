The married couple first stirred anticipation that they'd tour together in early April, but the buzz was initially dampened by Jay Z revealing that his 2014 "Made in America" music festival will play in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia. On Monday, Jay Z and Beyonce announced a joint summer trek that will take them to 16 cities throughout North America, starting in June. The tour will launch in Miami on June 25 and wind down in San Francisco on August 5. The tour is also being presented in partnership with Beyonce's #BeyGOOD campaign, which seeks to inspire charitable work, kindness and community involvement. Tickets go on sale for the general public May 2, while anxious fans can visit Beyonce's or Jay Z's Facebook page for information on advance purchases.
