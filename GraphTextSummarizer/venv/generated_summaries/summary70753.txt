Officers arrived to find LaDue in the locker surrounded by an assortment of gunpowder, pyrotechnic chemicals, ball bearings and a pressure cooker, police said. Then he'd shoot at students until police officers arrived. Behind that door lay finished bombs, "numerous guns" and ammunition, police say. LaDue built bombs, starting off with small charges. He had wanted to carry it out on April 19, a day before the 15th anniversary of the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado.
