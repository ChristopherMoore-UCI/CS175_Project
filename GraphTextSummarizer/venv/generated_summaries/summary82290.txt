New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Sunday the launch of a statewide program to fund college courses in prisons, giving inmates the opportunity to earn a college degree. But in 1994, Congress passed legislation that eliminated Pell grant eligibility for inmates, and the following year, New York  banned inmates from receiving state aid for in-prison education programs. Martin, 42, grew up impoverished in Brooklyn and spent six years in state prison. Pell grants, which provide financial aid to students in need, were made available to prison inmates in the 1970s. Martin said a statewide initiative to fund correctional education is a "win-win" for everyone in New York and hopes other states will catch on.
