-- Authorities in China's south-central Hunan province are associating disgruntled parents of children stricken by lead poisoning with the outlawed spiritual group Falun Gong. Similar incidents were reported in northern Shaanxi province, where 851 children were affected, and in southwestern Yunnan province, where 200 children were sickened. An August 26 public notice warned villagers to beware of Falun Gong members and instructed people to watch for "reactionary propaganda" sent online and by phone. "Citizens of the Wugang area have received phone calls from members of the Falun Gong over the past several days," said Wugang Deputy Spokesman Zhen Zhaoxin. Wugang government officials say children who live as far as 20 kms (12.5 miles) from the polluting factories in Wenping and Simachong have been affected.
