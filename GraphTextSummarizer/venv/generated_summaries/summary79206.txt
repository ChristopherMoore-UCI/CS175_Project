Aberdeen is about 75 miles from the Philadelphia street where the 22-year-old woman was forced into a car on Sunday night, Philadelphia police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told reporters earlier. The kidnapping is believed to be a "stranger abduction," Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said on CNN's "AC360" on Wednesday night. But he said surveillance video showed a man "similar" to one who police say dragged and abducted Freeland-Gaither. , three days after her abduction was captured on a surveillance video in Philadelphia and sparked an all-out manhunt, FBI special agent in charge Ed Hanko told reporters. Barnes is currently being held on a Virginia warrant for attempted capital murder in another case and "then he will be charged federally with the crimes here in Philadelphia," Hanko said.
