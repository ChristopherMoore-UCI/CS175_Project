Since the film's release, media outlets have dwelled on "New Year's Eve's" unrealistic plot points, from Ashton Kutcher's character sneaking into a secured space in Times Square to Katherine Heigl as a big-time caterer with poor knife skills.

"Marquee names represent somewhat of an insurance policy for the film's investors," said Rubin, who has cast ensemble films like "Hairspray" and "Romeo + Juliet."

"It's hard to get people excited about a movie about New Year's," Setoodeh said.
