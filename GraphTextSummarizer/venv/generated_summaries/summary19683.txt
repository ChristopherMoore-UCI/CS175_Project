But should Crabster succeed in its maiden voyage, Huan Jun predicts a widespread impact. As the Crabster creeps along the ocean floor, it can adapt its posture to different current or pressure conditions, to a depth of around 200 meters. While propeller-driven craft do not work well in fierce tides, and divers are limited to calm, relatively shallow seas, the new machine mimics the design of crabs and lobsters that live in stormy waters but are still able to control their movements. "I don't know if the animals treat the Crabster as a real crab or not," says Huan Jun.
