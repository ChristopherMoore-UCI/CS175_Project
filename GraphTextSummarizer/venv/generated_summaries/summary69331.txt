" State troopers, park rangers and wildlife biologists, using the photos to identify the "large male bear," shot and killed the animal as it was still "defending the kill site along the Toklat River as the recovery team attempted to reach White's remains," the park service said. -- A southern California man killed by a grizzly bear in Alaska's backcountry was shooting photos of the animal that killed him just moments before the attack, a National Park Service official said Sunday. The bear that killed Richard White, 49, was still with his body when rangers found him in Denali National Park on Saturday, the official said. Earlier that year, grizzly bears killed two men in Yellowstone National Park, according to the park's superintendent. About 12 grizzly bears have been living this summer around where Friday's attack occurred, the park said, citing wildlife biologists.
