I've attended the Oscars, been inside the crimson cocoon, felt the collective shock when "Shakespeare In Love" beat "Saving Private Ryan" for Best Picture. But did anyone ever imagine that betting against Mr. Oscars himself, Tom Hanks, could pay off? -- If you set your alarm this morning for quarter-past ungodly (California time) to catch the predawn announcement of the Oscars nominations, then we're in the same twisted little club. Years before Oscars handicapping became an official Olympics sport -- My favorite year was 1978, the night Jane Fonda and Jon Voight took the best leads categories for "Coming Home."
