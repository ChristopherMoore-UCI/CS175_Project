The media stopped showing such incidents, he pointed out, and now that the TV cameras no longer show these runners, he asked, "When was the last time you saw somebody jump on the field?" The problem, unfortunately, is that people still jump on ball fields. We learned that in high school, "for no reason whatever," as his father put it, Alex always wore white T-shirts and blue jeans, and that one day some 400 to 500 kids from the school wore the same outfit, declaring an unofficial "Alex Teves Day." Looking into the minds of killers Like Teves, many people suspect that some sort of media glory is part of the payoff for these mass killers. We got to meet Alex's best friend, Ryan Cooper, who spoke about how people were "drawn to him." As an analogy, one he freely admitted is on a wholly different level, Teves used the example of people running on fields during professional ball games.
