Many were surprised when Dunn took the stand in his defense -- conventional wisdom among defense attorneys is that defendants should not. As with many things, we cannot look into Dunn's mind, so we have to evaluate circumstantial evidence, and now his own testimony. Strangely, Dunn's flight -- something he did after the killing -- may be the most damaging piece of evidence against him. This is why Dunn's testimony needed to put the jury in the heat of the moment, to show them how fast shots are fired; how close the aggressor was; that an aggressor can keep approaching after one shot; and how long it takes in a deadly situation to realize that the threat is over. The number of shots is tied directly to the time it took to squeeze them off, which in turn is tied directly to the urgency of Dunn's actions.
