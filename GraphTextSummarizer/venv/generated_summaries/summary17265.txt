Carrie Underwood in a Michael Kors wool crÃªpe dress and Kenneth Jay Lane link bracelet. Don't break the bank I don't buy expensive jewelry and fur coats and Escalades. If it's a nice day, outdoor activity is nice. I also do the treadmill, free weights, exercise ball. Go with the flow I tend to go after bigger, flowy tops or dresses.
