A group of six players were tied for third place on 206, including world No. 7 Luke Donald (67), veteran Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez (66) and first-round leader Robert-Jan Derksen (72). French veteran Jean Van De Velde was unable to reproduce the form of his opening 66 as he followed up his second-round 76 with a 74 to be in a group tied for 62nd along with Italian teen prodigy Matteo Manassero (76).

Webster played at the 1995 British Open, when he was top amateur ahead of Tiger Woods. World No. 10 Rory McIlroy was tied for 12th on 208 after a four-birdie 69, while third-ranked Lee Westwood was in a group two shots back along with No. 8
