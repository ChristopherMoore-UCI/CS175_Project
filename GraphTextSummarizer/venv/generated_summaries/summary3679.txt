-- Democrat Alex Sink will debate Republican Rick Scott on Monday, setting up a nationally televised showdown between the two Florida governor hopefuls on CNN. Sink was quick to point out Scott's evasion and state her position on gay adoption, saying that judges and social workers should decide what is in the best interest of the child. Continuing a theme he has used throughout the campaign, Scott tied Sink's views on policy to those of President Barack Obama. On social issues, Scott did not give a direct answer when asked if he believed homosexuality was immoral; instead, he pledged his opposition to gay marriage and gay adoption. It pits Sink, the state's chief financial officer, against Scott, a billionaire health executive who shocked the GOP establishment to win his party's nomination.
