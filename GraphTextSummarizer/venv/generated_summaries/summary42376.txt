Christie said his father forced him to help cover the body with tires, douse it in gasoline and set it on fire, Humboldt County Sheriff Gary Philp said in a statement Thursday. Using a description provided by Christie, sheriff's personnel located the stump and found a carpet, plastic jugs, a hypodermic syringe and clothing there, Philp said Thursday. Christie related other instances of his father -- who he said frequently used methamphetamine -- terrorizing women, Philp said. A forensic odontologist positively identified the remains as Lysandra Turpin on Wednesday, according to Philp. She had been reported missing to Humboldt County law enforcement on April 8, 1988.
