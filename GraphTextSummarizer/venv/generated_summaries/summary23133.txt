Instead of picking up a few pumpkins from the grocery store, however, we decided to work on six giant pumpkins, specially delivered from nearby Half Moon Bay (some weighing well over 1,000 pounds). Here's how the Googlers describe the making of this kooky video on the official Google blog: "To celebrate Halloween this year, the doodle team wanted to capture that fascinating transformation that takes place when carving a pumpkin. What you see is a timelapse video of the approximately eight hours we spent carving in the middle of our Mountain View, California, campus." Mashable: Where do Google doodles come from?
