Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased since fighting broke out recently to the west of Baghdad in Anbar province, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraq's security forces have been battling for control of Falluja and Ramadi. On Saturday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden talked with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki about U.S. support for Iraq's fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, a group trying to overthrow the Iraqi government. The violence adds to the particularly bloody fighting and political instability that Iraq and its capital, Baghdad, has seen in recent months. Biden's office said the two leaders agreed on the importance of the Iraqi government's continued outreach to local and tribal leaders in Anbar province. -- Car bombs rocked a number of predominantly Shiite Muslim neighborhoods of Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 13 people and wounding 53 others, police officials told CNN.
