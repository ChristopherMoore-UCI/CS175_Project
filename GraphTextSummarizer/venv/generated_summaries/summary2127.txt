That game is also remembered for Chelsea player Didier Drogba's foul-mouthed tirade at referee Tom Henning Ovrebo after the Norwegian turned down four penalty appeals from his team in the second leg. The match will be particularly loaded for Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola and his Chelsea counterpart Roberto di Matteo, who faced each other as players for the teams in the Champions League quarterfinals 12 years ago. Almost three years ago, Andreas Iniesta fired an incredible shot in the nail-biting final moments of a European Champions League semifinal at Stamford Bridge. On Wednesday, the Spanish champions will return to London to face Chelsea for the first time since that fateful day on May 6, 2009 in the first leg of this season's semifinal. Iniesta's ecstatic team then took the title in Rome, beating Chelsea's English rivals Manchester United.
