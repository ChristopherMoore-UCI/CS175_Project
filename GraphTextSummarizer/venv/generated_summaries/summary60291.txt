Savio's body was exhumed on November 13, 2007, and state pathologist Dr. Larry Blum performed a second autopsy. "It is my opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the drowning of Ms. Savio ... should be properly classified as a homicide," the pathologist concluded. But investigators took another look at the case after Peterson was named as a suspect in the October 28, 2007, disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson. He conducted a third autopsy on the body of Kathleen Savio at the request of Savio's family in November 2007. Peterson, a former Bolingbrook, Illinois, police sergeant, pleaded not guilty May 22 to a charge of first-degree murder in Savio's 2004 death.
