Mourinho signed a contract extension until 2016 with Real Madrid last May after ending Barcelona's three-year stranglehold on La Liga, but his relationship with the Spanish press soured and he has clashed with Madrid and Spain's much-loved keeper, Iker Casillas. Three days after the Real Madrid manager hinted he was on his way back to England and Chelsea, the self-proclaimed "Special One" insisted his future was still undecided. On Tuesday following Real Madrid's exit in the Champions League semifinals for a third straight season under Mourinho, this time to Borussia Dortmund, the 50-year-old, not for the first time, spoke of his deep fondness for England. With Mourinho at the helm, Chelsea ended a 50-year title drought and won back-to-back Premier League titles. Once he ended Barcelona's reign in La Liga in 2012, the goal with Real Madrid was to win the Champions League, which hasn't materialized.
