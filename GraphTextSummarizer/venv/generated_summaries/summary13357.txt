Police believe Lovett was the man seen in a surveillance-camera photo possibly using Carson's card at an ATM, Chapel Hill Police Chief Brian Curran said. -- One suspect has been charged and police are hunting for another in connection with the killing of University of North Carolina student Eve Carson, police said Wednesday. Carson's killing "feels like a random crime," Curran said Saturday. A second suspect, Lawrence Alvin Lovett Jr., 17, is being sought in Carson's death, police said. The medical examiner told police that her body showed no signs of sexual assault or other injury, Curran said.
