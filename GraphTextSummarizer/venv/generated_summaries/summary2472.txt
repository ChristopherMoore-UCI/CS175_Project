First responders could still have problems communicating with one another, and there is confusion in some communities about who would be in charge, Hamilton told the House Homeland Security Committee. Hamilton told the panel much progress has been made in the past 10 years, but more needs to be done: "We are safer today, but not as safe as we could be." Tom Ridge, the first secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said competing measures to deal with the problem are being considered by the House and Senate, while police and fire departments are waiting for some kind of action. "We're sending mixed signals as far as what Congress wants in the area of homeland security, and this fragmentation, to me, is inviting, if not disaster, certainly it's preventing law enforcement and the intelligence agencies from doing the job to the maximum," King said. The 9/11 Commission recommended concerted action to fix the problem of responder communications, but the problem persists.
