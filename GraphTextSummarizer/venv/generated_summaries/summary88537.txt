" Michael Jackson's family issued a statement in reaction: "The Jackson family again wishes to commend the actions of the Coroner, the LAPD and other law enforcement agencies, and looks forward to the day that justice can be served. Klein, who treated Jackson for decades, denied in a CNN interview last month that he had given Jackson dangerous drugs. " Federal and state agencies also have launched independent investigations into "matters uncovered" by Los Angeles police while looking into Jackson's death, authorities said. Worried that Jackson might become addicted to the drug, Murray said he tried to wean Jackson from it, putting together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping him sleep during the two nights before his death. "Dr. Murray simply never told investigators that he found Michael Jackson at 11 a.m. not breathing," Chernoff said.
