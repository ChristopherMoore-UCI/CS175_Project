As a mainstay of the team that won 13 Premier League titles and two European Cups under retired manager Alex Ferguson, Ryan Giggs provides a vital link to United's illustrious recent past. Current Dutch national team coach Louis van Gaal is the man expected to take control of United on a full-time basis, but whether the former Ajax boss will retain the services of Giggs as a player or a coach is unclear. If what Giggs achieved as a player manifests itself during his coaching career, United fans could have a lot to look forward to. From a pacey winger in the early 1990s to a yoga-practicing 21st century professional, Giggs' status as a revered veteran of United's golden age made him the only logical choice to step into the managerial hotseat vacated prematurely by Ferguson's replacement David Moyes last month. But for one former member of Ferguson's coaching staff, retaining the services of Giggs is essential if United are to bounce back from failing to qualify for the European Champions League for the first time since 1995.
