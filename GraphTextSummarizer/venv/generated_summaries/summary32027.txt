With less free time to attend classes at set times, Stern has kept up through Lipsey's mobile app, Gym Tuck, which launched last November. "He took my fitness to a completely different level, and he really challenged me." Lipsey and Stern both emphasize that to see results, you have to change your whole lifestyle. Lipsey's workouts consist of body weight exercises, including beggar's planks, split and bicycle crunches, back extensions and wide-stance plie squats. After about eight months of eating clean -- increasing fruit and vegetable intake while decreasing meat consumption -- and attending core and plyometric classes for an hour a day, six days a week, Stern lost 106 pounds, which was even more than she had gained while pregnant. As such, attacking the core can lead to quick weight loss results, Lipsey says.
