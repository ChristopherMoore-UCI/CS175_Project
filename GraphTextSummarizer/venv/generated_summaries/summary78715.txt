"An assertion that the United States was somehow involved in causing President Chavez's illness is absurd, and we definitively reject it,"  State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said last week. "Would it be strange if (the United States) had developed a technology to induce cancer," he asked, "and for no one to know it?" Maduro announced on March 5 that Chavez had died. Critics dismissed the accusation -- first floated by then-Vice President Nicolas Maduro on March 5 -- as an eleventh-hour attempt to distract Venezuelans and drum up popular support as leaders prepared to announce Chavez's death. While government announcements of Chavez's trips to Cuba for treatment were common, officials never revealed details about his prognosis or specified what kind of cancer he had. But Maduro revived the issue this week, announcing that planning was in the works for a commission of "the world's best scientists" to investigate whether Chavez had been poisoned.
