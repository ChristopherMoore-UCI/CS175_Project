Eritrea is under the rule of President Isaias Afwerki, whose government has imprisoned critics and exerted increasingly authoritarian controls over the economy, media and religion, according to U.N. reports and human rights organizations. None of the 12 missing has a visa to remain in Kenya, national police spokesman Eric Kiraithe said. Musonye said it was not the first time Eritrean players have tried to avoid returning home: The Refugee Consortium of Kenya, a nonprofit organization that gives free legal aid and representation to asylum seekers and refugees, would not comment to CNN. Eritrea denies the allegation, but Uganda, which leads an African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia that has taken heavy casualties during the insurgency, has sought U.N. sanctions against the Eritreans as a result.
