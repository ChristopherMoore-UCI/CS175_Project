Speaking Thursday on ABC's "Good Morning America," Arlene Castro said she had "no idea" her father allegedly was holding DeJesus and two other young women, Michelle Knight and Amanda Berry, as well as Berry's 6-year-old daughter, who was born in captivity. And she walked," the then-teenage Castro said, with the "America's Most Wanted" reporter explaining that DeJesus would have taken the bus but had loaned out the change she'd normally use for bus fare. Castro told "America's Most Wanted" -- as seen in archived video posted online, including on Slate's website -- that her friend loaned her 50 cents, so she could use the phone and ask her mother if the two could spend the afternoon together at DeJesus' house. According to the FBI, the then 14-year-old DeJesus disappeared on April 2, 2004, as she was walking home from middle school. At that time, DeJesus was alive but captive in an older man's house about three miles away, authorities said.
