No one can predict the future so hence you get some surprises." Once those horses are sold, though, Tattersalls work is not done and they continue to follow their progress for future potential worth and future potential sales. Another horse set to test the spending power of horse racing's power brokers is Immortal Verse, winner of the Group 1 Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville, in foal for the first time to Dansili, whose wins included Priex Messidor, Prix Edmond Blanc and Prix du Muguet, and with an already impressive breeding record. "We never expect to break records; records by their nature are unexpected," says George. The horses come to Tattersalls pre-sale in one of the 850 stables on a 47-acre site and are there to be viewed by prospective buyers before being led into the sales ring. Tattersalls remains the name when it comes to bloodstock auctions but, as George points out, they still have to work at it.
