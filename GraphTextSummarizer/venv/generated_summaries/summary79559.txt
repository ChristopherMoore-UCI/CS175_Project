-- Government airstrikes killed 20 Taliban militants in the past 24 hours in northwest Pakistan, a military source said Monday. The operation is going on in north and south Waziristan, the source added, particularly to clear supply routes and prepare for a major operation against Pakistan's Taliban chief, Baitullah Mehsud, who has ties to al Qaeda. Also Monday, a police officer and two civilians were killed when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into a police checkpoint near Peshawar. And on early Sunday morning, a bomb blast destroyed a girl's school east of Peshawar city, authorities said. Residents sift through the rubble of a bombed out school near Peshawar city.
