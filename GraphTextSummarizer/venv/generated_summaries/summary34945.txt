It's possible to spend a lot of money, and time, at Tokyo Station. In the station you can wander through Kitchen Street, or for slurpier, cheaper meals, Tokyo Ramen Street. Fans of Hello Kitty, Moomins and Pokemon should swing by Tokyo Character Street (again, also not a real street) for take-home trinkets from some 15 shops. A subterranean network is rumored to exist in downtown Tokyo, linking important government buildings. There's also Tokyo Michi Terrace, an illumination projected on station buildings that takes a "Memorial Light-up/Taisho Period (1912-1926) Romance" theme, in honor of the station's birthday.
