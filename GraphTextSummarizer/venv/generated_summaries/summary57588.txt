-- U.S. Sens. John McCain and John Kerry focused on the U.S. and Egyptian economies during a trip to Egypt Saturday and Sunday. This is McCain's third trip to Egypt since the January 25 revolution that drove former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak from power. In an effort to spur U.S. investment in Egypt, Kerry and McCain led a delegation of American businessmen representing companies including General Electric, Coca-Cola, Boeing, Dow, Marriott International and Exxon Mobil. Their visit also included meetings with high-ranking Egyptian officials, including the head of Egypt's interim government, Field Marshal Mohamed Tantawi, who leads the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. Billions of dollars are needed to revive Egypt's economy, Kerry said, but the United States is willing, along with other countries, to provide assistance.
