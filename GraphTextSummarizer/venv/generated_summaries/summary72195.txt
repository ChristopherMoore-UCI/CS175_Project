-- Lawyers for State Sen. Chris McDaniel filed an appeal Friday with the Mississippi Supreme Court to overturn last week's judicial decision rejecting McDaniel's challenge to the state's June 24 GOP primary runoff, which was won by incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran. McDaniel, who received strong support from tea party and anti-establishment groups, narrowly defeated Cochran in Mississippi's June 3 Republican primary. Cochran's victory was apparently aided by crossover votes from African-Americans, a largely Democratic bloc actively courted by Cochran's campaign and allied groups. McDaniel filed the challenge 41 days after the election; McGehee said that under state law the challenge had to be filed within 20 days. Judge Hollis McGehee ruled on August 29 that McDaniel waited too long to file his challenge with the state Republican Party.
