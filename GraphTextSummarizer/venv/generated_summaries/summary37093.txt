Bashir has been in police detention since August and Monday police sent charges to state prosecutors accusing him of multiple terror charges including inciting others to commit crimes of terror. -- Five suspects were arrested on terror-related charges, including one of Indonesia's most wanted men, Abu Tholut, Indonesian police said Tuesday. Tholut helped create a militant training camp in Aceh that was raided by authorities in February, said Inspector General Iskandar Hasan, a National Police spokesman. The group was allegedly training and planning attacks in Indonesia that were similar to the 2008 Mumbai, India terror attacks, in which 164 people were killed. Tholut is a weapons expert and is a former senior leader of the terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, police said.
