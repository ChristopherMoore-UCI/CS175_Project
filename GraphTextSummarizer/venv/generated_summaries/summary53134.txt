While the existence of frozen natural gas deposits -- especially in the Arctic region -- has been known for years, the USGS study is the first estimate of recoverable natural gas hydrates with current technology. While natural gas is a fossil fuel that emits carbon dioxide, tapping into the gas hydrates assessed in the study is not expected to affect global warming, said Brenda Pierce, coordinator for the USGS Energy Resources Program. The North Slope natural gas hydrates make up 11.5 percent of the volume of gas within all other undiscovered, technically recoverable gas resources in the United States -- frozen or not, the USGS estimated. In the study released Wednesday, researchers suggest extracting the natural gas hydrates with "depressurization" -- a method that involves changing the ice into gas and water at the surface. "The assessment points to a truly significant potential for natural gas hydrates to contribute to the energy mix of the United States and the world," said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne.
