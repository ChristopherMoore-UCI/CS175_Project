While clubs such as United and Liverpool incurred vast debts when they were taken over by new owners, player wages have long been a major item on the expenses side of the balance sheet. And it's not just in England where clubs, also including the American-owned Liverpool, are battling to stay afloat in a sea of debt -- said to be around $4.3 billion for the whole of the Premier League, according to the Wall Street Journal. With European ruling body UEFA planning to bring in new rules governing debt and ownership from 2012 which mean clubs cannot spend more than they earn, the pressure is on to find a safe financial footing. The English outfit is riddled with debt following two takeovers in the past six months, with former owner Alexandre Gaydamak claiming that he is still owed some $45 million in loans and the British tax department issuing a winding-up notice over unpaid debts. " Belgian club Mouscron has been put into liquidation after being expelled from the Jupiler League on December 28 for failing to meet financial obligations, with debts of $1.15 million, ending 87 years of existence.
