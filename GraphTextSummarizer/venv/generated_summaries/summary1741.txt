Baron Cohen's next film, "The Dictator," is inspired by Hussein's "Zabibah and the King," a romance novel originally published anonymously in 2000, reportedly as an allegory for the U.S. invasion of Iraq in the First Gulf War. Baron Cohen is producing, along with Scott Rudin -- who produced Joel and Ethan Coen's "True Grit" -- Alec Berg, Jeff Schaffer and David Mandel. Hussein, executed in Iraq in 2006, fancied himself something of a novelist, penning four of them while ruling Iraq. Berg, Schaffer and Mandel will pitch in with the writing chores. The film is slated for release on May 11, 2012, Paramount said.
