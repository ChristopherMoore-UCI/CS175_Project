-- A Colorado woman was arrested at the Denver airport in April and charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, according to court documents that were unsealed Wednesday. Shannon Maureen Conley, 19, allegedly told FBI agents before her arrest that she was going to be with a member of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, that she had met through the Internet. Conley, a certified nurse aide, had told FBI agents she was going to be the man's wife and a nurse in a ISIS camp near the Turkish border, documents showed. "It's a difficult time for us," her mother, Ana Conley, told CNN on Wednesday. Texas man pleads guilty to attempting to join ISIS' jihad in Syria
