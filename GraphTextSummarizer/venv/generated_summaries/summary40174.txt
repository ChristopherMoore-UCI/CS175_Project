Djokovic won the tournament in 2008 its final staging in Shanghai, but last year failed to qualify out of a group including Berdych. The U.S. Open and Olympic champion needed only to win the first set to go through, following Berdych's defeat, and did so with few problems before Tsonga made a match of it. I was fortunate to come back and win in straight sets," said Djokovic, who ended Berdych's hopes of repeating last year's progress to the semifinals with his 11th win in their last 12 encounters. It took him to 73 match victories this year, equaling the leading mark set by David Ferrer. Berdych will now look forward to next week's 100th Davis Cup final, where he will lead his country against Spain.
