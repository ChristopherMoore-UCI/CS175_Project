A Pinpoint employee, Colin Small of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, who was brought on to conduct voter registration drives, faces local criminal charges in Rockingham County, Virginia. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican, said he was expanding the investigation to see whether there was an effort to destroy voter registration applications statewide. The Justice Department on Thursday was reviewing a request from Virginia Democratic lawmakers to launch an inquiry into a firm that hired a worker who allegedly destroyed voter registration applications. Congressmen Jim Moran, Bobby Scott and Gerry Connolly on Wednesday asked Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate a Republican-hired firm, Pinpoint, amid allegations of voter fraud. Pinpoint and another company, Strategic Allied Consulting, were hired by Republicans to conduct voter registration drives.
