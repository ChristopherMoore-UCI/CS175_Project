Now that mobile phones have rendered hotel room phones largely obsolete, Wi-Fi is the new bugbear for today's traveler. For many hotel guests, paying for Wi-Fi is an outdated charge that you only get wind of when you're up in your room. She adds that if hotels charge for Wi-Fi, the service must be excellent. "Getting charged each night for 24 hours Wi-Fi seems like pure profiteering on their part, but I think hotels are starting to realize that they will lose valuable customers and valuable business by charging crazy amounts for Wi-Fi," says Juliana Shallcross, managing editor at HotelChatter. Hotels not only need to adapt to guest activity, they also need to be aware that for many guests Wi-Fi is not an extra luxury, like the mini bar or dry cleaning, it's part and parcel of the guest experience -- like hot water and clean towels.
