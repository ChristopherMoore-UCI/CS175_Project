California health officials said Wednesday there are 79 confirmed measles cases in the state, as federal health authorities reported that the number of U.S. cases in 2014 more than tripled any total in recent years. Minnesota is one of 27 states that reported measles cases last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disease outbreak became apparent when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from December 15 to December 20. Of the 79 California cases, 15 are in Los Angeles County, and all victims were unvaccinated for measles, said Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, the county's interim health officer. There are four confirmed cases in Riverside County, where the Desert Sands Unified School District told 66 students -- who have either not been vaccinated for measles or can't show proof --  that they need to stay home.
