Elliott also won the Internet if the tweet love is any indication; even fellow celebrities had fan moments. Some viewers hailed the "new artist," a move reminiscent of recent tweets celebrating Paul McCartney as "one to watch" after he released a song with rapper Kanye West. Elliott joined main performer Katy Perry on stage at halftime and performed a medley of some of her hits, much to the delight of fans. But not everyone remembered the glory days of the trash bag outfit being "Supa Dupa Fly." According to Mashable, the singer/rapper/producer has returned to the charts after her performance during Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday.
