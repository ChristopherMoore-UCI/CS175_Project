Breaking down the key points of bin Laden raid Pakistan is also a key supply route for the U.S. and NATO troops battling the Taliban in Afghanistan, with truck convoys often coming under attack near the border. Mark Grossman, the U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, had some "very blunt" conversations with Pakistani officials in the wake of the bin Laden raid, according to two senior U.S. officials briefed on the talks. He said there has been an "excellent exchange of views" between the two sides in recent days, a positive rapport he expects to continue even as Pakistan opens a "review" of how bin Laden was able to stay in Abbottabad, deals with the ramifications of accusations it could have done more and addresses issues of its terroritorial sovereignty after U.S. forces got into Pakistan undetected. And Pakistan has ordered U.S. military personnel on its territory drawn down to the "minimum essential" level in the wake of the assault that killed bin Laden deep within Pakistan early Monday, the statement announced. American critics have questioned how Pakistani officials could have missed the compound, and U.S. officials have said Washington did not give Pakistan any notice of the assault because they feared the word would leak.
