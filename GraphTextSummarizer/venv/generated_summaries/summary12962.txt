The timing of Kobayashi's success was perfect, not only because the driver's future with Sauber is uncertain but also because of Japan's reduced investment in F1 in recent years. It's very important for the race in Japan, for F1 in the country, because now they have a driver who has given such a great performance," says Sauber team principal Monisha Kaltenborn. Yet Kobayashi's place on the podium did not come easily, with a man who was appointed an international ambassador for sports and tourism by the Japanese government in September having long battled the odds to calmber to the top of F1. Chants of "Kamui" broke out from the grandstands as he was introduced at the post-race awards ceremony, before F1's only Japanese driver was eventually chased to his garage by delirious fans who had managed to infiltrate the paddock. After signing for Toyota's Driver Academy in 2004, Kobayashi graduated to being a Toyota F1 test driver before finally contesting his first F1 drive in 2009.
