Vicky Chandhok, president of the Federation of Motor Sports Clubs of India, is the father of Karun Chandhok, one of only two Indian drivers to have competed in F1. According to Chandhok, it could take a figure such as legendary cricketer Sachin Tendulkar to spark genuine interest in F1 among India's 1.2 billion inhabitants. Chandhok told CNN that the increasing need for drivers to attract big-money sponsors has made it harder for talented youngsters to break through, especially with F1 battling to gain a foothold in India's sporting spectrum. However, Chandhok hopes F1 can develop in India despite the challenges faced by its race organizers. They might not have as many spectators as last year, but they have still got a hell of a lot more than many other race tracks."
