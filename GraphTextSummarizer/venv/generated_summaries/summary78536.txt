I've come across a couple of black mambas down there (in South Africa.) I've got the Irish Open at Country Down, the Open Championship at St. Andrews. " Can you do better than Tiger Woods? Rory, can you do better than Tiger Woods? I'll keep chipping away at it tournament by tournament and see how I go, but I think if you asked anyone if anyone had half of the career that Tiger Woods has -- has had so far -- they'd be very, very happy."
