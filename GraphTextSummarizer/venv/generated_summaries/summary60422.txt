"The sheriff's office believes Sylar did not wander from the campground and he is presumably dead," Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh told a news conference last week. " Sylar was camping with his custodial mother, Christina Priem, and her children, when he disappeared. Sylar Newton was reported missing July 25 from the Beaver Creek Campgrounds in Rimrock. Authorities said last week that the boy was presumed dead as they announced the launch of a criminal investigation into his disappearance. The office said the remains "likely came to rest in this area due to recent flash flooding."
