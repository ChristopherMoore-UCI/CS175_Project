Although seeing pulses of light may not sound like much, for Pontz it's so much more than he had before the procedure. The Argus II has been used in Europe since 2011 in countries including Italy and Germany, but Pontz lives in Michigan, and the device wasn't approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration until last year. Pontz had been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary eye disease that damages the retina -- a layer of tissue at the back of the eye that converts light to nerve signals and sends them to the brain. After years of not processing visual information, it wasn't just Pontz's eyes that had to learn how to see again. "I told my wife for years, 'I don't know when, what, or how, but I will see again," says Pontz.
