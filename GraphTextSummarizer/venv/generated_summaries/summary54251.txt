Ankara also was calm Wednesday, a day after riot police in armored vehicles topped with water cannons made a show of force in the city's central Kizilay Square, the site of earlier violent clashes between protesters and security forces. The demonstrations began more than a week ago over plans to replace an Istanbul park with a new development but quickly morphed into broader protests against Erdogan's rule and exploded after protesters complained that police had used unnecessarily harsh tactics in an effort to break up the rallies. After riot police moved in to break up the demonstration with tear gas and pepper spray, protesters set up barricades and hurled bottles at police. Protests have spread across Turkey in recent days amid dissatisfaction with Erdogan and anger about what protesters and international critics have described as a heavy-handed crackdown on protesters by security forces. On Tuesday, the group complained of "unprecedented and abusive use of force by police officers against protestors" and demanded immediate steps to stop it.
