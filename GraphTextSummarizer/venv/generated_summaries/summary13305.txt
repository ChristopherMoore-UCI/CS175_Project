During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a "serial rapist" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus. The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz "transform her personal vendetta" into a "Columbia-sponsored calumny" by supporting "Carry That Weight" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through "this outrageous display of harassment and defamation." Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia. "As we have said consistently, we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law, but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff, the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them," spokesman Robert Hornsby said in statement. "If artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences, then how are we to heal?" The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus.
