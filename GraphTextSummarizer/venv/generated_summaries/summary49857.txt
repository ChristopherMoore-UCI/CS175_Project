It's a different way of fighting a war on cancer: Instead of focusing on treatments, drugs and experimental surgeries, it looks at what is going on in our environment and what we are eating, and considers what role those factors might play in the cancer epidemic. Three months after the accident, I was with my longtime friend and colleague Kate Tobin camping on a Denali glacier in Alaska for a story we are doing on climate change. Over the past two years, I lost my sister, my mother and nearly lost my girlfriend to breast cancer and its complications. -- I'm tired of being surrounded by cancer. My lifelong friend Bill Couzens has been similarly affected by cancer.
