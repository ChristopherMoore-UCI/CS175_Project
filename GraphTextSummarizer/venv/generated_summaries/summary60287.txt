Facing lethal injection in a matter of days, Ohio murderer Billy Slagle apparently hanged himself in his prison cell early Sunday, state corrections officials said. Ohio's parole board voted 6-4 against his petition for clemency in June, and Gov. John Kasich denied his request on July 24. Slagle was 18 and already had a long history of drug and alcohol abuse when arrested in the killing of Mari Anne Pope, who was stabbed 17 times with scissors while her children were in the home, according to court records. McGinty said in July that there was "no doubt of Slagle's guilt," but jurors at the time didn't have the option to consider a sentence of life in prison without parole. Prison officials have launched an investigation into how he died, she said, and no further details had been released Sunday afternoon.
