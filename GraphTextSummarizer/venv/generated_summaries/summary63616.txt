Syncope may be associated with a sudden fall in blood pressure, a decrease in heart rate or changes in blood volume or distribution. According to some experts, syncope is often the result of an underlying medical condition that could be related to the heart, nervous system or blood flow to the brain. The most common one is vasovagal syncope, which occurs when the blood pressure drops suddenly, reducing blood flow to the brain. Syncope (pronounced "sin-ko-pea") is the brief loss of consciousness or fainting caused by a temporary decrease in blood flow to the brain. In most people, the heart and nervous system will react and give out the correct signals to maintain blood flowing everywhere else in the body.
