More than eight in 10 say that economic conditions are in poor shape, with 43 percent calling them very poor. The number of Americans who said the economy is in good shape -- a number that grew steadily through the spring and summer -- has now stalled, with fewer than one in five expressing a positive view of current conditions. "At that rate, only a handful of voters will blame the economy on the Republicans by the time next year's midterm elections roll around.." Thirty-six percent of people questioned said that President Obama's policies have improved economic conditions, with 28 percent feeling that the president's programs have made things worse, and 35 percent saying what he's done has had no effect on the economy. Eighty-two percent said economic conditions are poor. "The bad news for the Democrats is that the number of Americans who hold the GOP exclusively responsible for the recession has been steadily falling by about two to three points per month," said Keating Holland, CNN polling director.
