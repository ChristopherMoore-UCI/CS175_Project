Hong Kong Executive Council member Regina Ip said authorities can arrest Snowden if his actions qualify as a crime under Hong Kong law, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported early Sunday. The United States has contacted authorities in Hong Kong to seek the extradition of Edward Snowden, the man who admitted leaking top-secret details about U.S. surveillance programs, a senior U.S. administration official said Saturday. Washington already asked Hong Kong, where Snowden is believed to be in hiding, to detain the former National Security Agency contract analyst on a provisional arrest warrant, The Washington Post reported, citing unnamed U.S. officials. The U.S. agreement with Hong Kong makes an exception for political offenses, in which case the treaty would not apply to Snowden. "We will work under the framework of Hong Kong law, and won't allow any illegal or unfair judgment," Hong Kong Secretary of Justice Rimsky Yuen told Xinhua.
