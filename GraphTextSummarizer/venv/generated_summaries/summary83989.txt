Quinten passed away less than a month after Wood-Harber says she called DHS to report their father, who took care of Quinten and the boy's younger brother in Oklahoma City. Wood, 47, said Quinten had so many ear infections that antibiotics rarely worked. Without help at home, the responsibilities of feeding and changing Quinten fell to his other son when Wood was at work. Powell, with DHS, declined to comment on whether Wood had ever approached the department and if so, what happened. " 'The system, it doesn't work' Wood-Harber says she 100% believes that her brother would be alive if her father had taken better care of Quinten.
