Police said Qadri shot Taseer because of the liberal politician's campaign to amend Pakistan's controversial blasphemy laws. Pakistani police have said Mumtaz Hussain Qadri confessed to gunning down Salman Taseer, the governor of Punjab Province, outside an outdoor market in Islamabad last month. Since the shooting, Pakistan's hard-line religious groups have congratulated Qadri and held demonstrations calling him a hero, while condemning anyone who tries to change Pakistan's blasphemy laws. When the judge asked Qadri to enter a plea, he denied committing a crime, said Raja Shuja Ur Rehman, his lawyer. " Pakistani authorities held Monday's hearing inside the jail where Qadri is being kept for security reasons.
