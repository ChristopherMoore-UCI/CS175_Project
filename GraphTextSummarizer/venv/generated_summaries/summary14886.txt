Three senior security officials in Abyan accuse Mahdi Makwalah, the military commander of the southern regions, of handing over heavy artillery to al Qaeda fighters Sunday. The attacks come less than a week after President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi took office and days after he changed top civilian, law enforcement and military officials in southern Yemen. "The only reason why al Qaeda is expanding in Abyan is because they are receiving aid from corrupt officials within the Yemeni government. Officials blame the attacks on Ansar al-Sharia, a group with links to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the global terrorist network's branch in Yemen. -- Fierce clashes followed suicide bombings and checkpoint attacks Sunday in Yemen, leaving dozens dead as the government fought back in a province largely controlled by terrorist groups, officials said.
