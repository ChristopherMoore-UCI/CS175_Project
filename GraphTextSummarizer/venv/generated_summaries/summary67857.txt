Tycoon Thomas Kwok received a five year sentence Tuesday, and former chief secretary Rafael Hui got seven and a half years, after having been found guilty by a Hong Kong high court jury last week. Kwok was also ordered to pay a $64,453 fine and $1.6 million in costs to the prosecution, while Hui was ordered to pay the Hong Kong government $1.4 million, equivalent to the amount of bribes taken. The jury also found Thomas Chan, who was responsible for land acquisition at the company and Francis Kwan, a former Hong Kong Stock Exchange official, guilty of making a series of payments to Hui. Ex-city official convicted Hui, 66, is the highest-ranking former official to be tried in Hong Kong. During the sentencing hearing yesterday, Hui's defence lawyer Edwin Choy read out a mitigation letter from the former chief executive of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang.
