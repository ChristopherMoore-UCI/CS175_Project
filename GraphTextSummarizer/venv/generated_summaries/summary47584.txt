I wasn't senior enough to cover the big political stories of the day so news editors only assigned me the light hearted Mandela news stories. So they whizzed away, slightly peeved, and I landed up with a "Me and Mandela" photograph that showed the president grinning into camera, holding me around the waist and me half bent over, lowering my handbag, with my head half cocked and eyes half closed. Mandela holds baby Freya as Robyn Curnow and her husband Kim look on. Years after that, I was taking a sabbatical from journalism and spent a year studying for my Masters degree at Cambridge University. For someone who makes a living out of communications, I have consistently been tongue-tied around Nelson Mandela.
