The IPA has been greeted by many developers as an important step away from the "patent trolling" that many tech companies have been accused of recently -- most notably Intellectual Ventures, founded by Microsoft veteran Nathan Myhrvold, as well as Yahoo. If someone else sues Twitter over a patent, however, the company can use patents awarded to employees or former employees to defend itself. In an opinion piece for Wired, Upcoming.org founder and former Yahoo employee Andy Baio called the suit "an attack on invention and the hacker ethic," explaining why support for Twitter's IPA has been strong. The move to more formally adopted agreements like Twitter's appears to have already gained some traction among tech companies, as well as developers: Foursquare's engineering lead Harry Heymann said he's a "big fan" of the move; Facebook has expressed support for the idea; and the British startup Multizone committed to following suit with this tweet: @nuxnix: @adam_messinger the IPA is a great innovation. Publicly revealed in a blog post and dubbed the Innovator's Patent Agreement (IPA), the policy pledges that Twitter will not pursue offensive litigation over patents without the consent of the employees who created them.
