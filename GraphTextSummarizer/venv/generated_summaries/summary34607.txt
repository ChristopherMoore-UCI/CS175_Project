The state's death toll from flooding has climbed to 741, according to government figures released Wednesday. In Nova Friburgo -- the hardest-hit city, according to government figures -- 355 deaths due to flooding have been counted. Much of the damage occurred in that state, where heavy rains have liquefied hills into tombs of mud and debris. Last week, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said 24 people had been killed by flooding. Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall.
