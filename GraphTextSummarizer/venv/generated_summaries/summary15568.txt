Manti Te'o: A linebacker, a made-up girlfriend and a national hoax Last week, Te'o said, however, that he had lied to his dad because he was embarrassed to admit he was in love with a woman he'd never laid eyes on. Questions have also been raised about Te'o telling Sports Illustrated in October that Kekua had attended one of his games, when he issued a statement last week saying he'd never met her. It was true that his grandmother had died, but Te'o conceded that he mentioned Kekua again even after -- as Couric put it -- he "knew that something was amiss," according to the interview clips. Who knows Couric said she believes Te'o sincerely thought he was having a relationship with Kekua. -- Notre Dame star linebacker Manti Te'o acknowledged to ABC's Katie Couric that he maintained the illusion of his dead girlfriend in the weeks after he received a call claiming that Lennay Kekua and her death were hoaxes.
