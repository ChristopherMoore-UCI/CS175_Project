However, aviation experts warn airport infrastructure still lags behind demand, and that real estate realities in the New York area, perceived to be the epicenter of aviation delays, mean that new runways are least likely to be built where they are most needed. Jenkins jokingly said new runways inevitably come on line precisely when they are not needed, but he said airline delays are here to stay. Jenkins said new runways in New York are pipe dreams because of land constraints and local opposition. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters said travelers will benefit from coast to coast. Aviation experts argue the experience at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Georgia demonstrate that new runways are invaluable to airlines and travelers.
