Bad Eggs Easter Egg Hunt, London Dungeon, Westminster Bridge Road; April 5 -21, from £17.50 ($30) per adult over 16 years, £15.95 ($27) per child The Easter Egg Hunt (Provins, France) This French Easter egg hunt takes place in the historic town of Provins, in the shadow of its spectacular castle. The zoo has been holding the annual Easter egg hunt -- or safari in this case -- for several years. The Easter bunny will join forces with the park's Beasley Bear to offer guidance to egg hunters, and there'll also be face painting sessions and Easter basket workshops. The highlight is an Easter egg hunt, but there are also workshops in marzipan sculpting and flower arranging. This city-wide Easter egg hunt is organized by the Capella Washington, D.C. hotel.
