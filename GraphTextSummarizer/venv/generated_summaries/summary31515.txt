But in the Galaxy S III, the fragmented field of phones running on Google's Android operating system found a champion: a single gadget to put forward for an apples to apples (if you will) comparison to the iconic iPhone. Samsung unveiled a new tablet there but, taking a page from Apple's playbook, opted not to roll out its flagship phone during the crowded event where many rival products are clamoring for attention. The Korean company was a sponsor of Sunday night's Academy Awards telecast, and it and Apple went head-to-head with big advertising buys during the broadcast. All but the most ardent of tech pundits have abandoned the idea that a mythical "iPhone killer" will emerge from Apple's bevy of competitors. The Samsung Galaxy S IV will be unveiled March 14 at a New York event, the company announced Monday.
