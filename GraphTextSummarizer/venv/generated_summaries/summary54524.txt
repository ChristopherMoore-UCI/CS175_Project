A Minneapolis police officer was shot Saturday morning, and Police Chief Janee Harteau said "there is little doubt that an officer was the intended target. Assistant Police Chief Matt Clark told reporters Saturday afternoon that the officer, who was standing outside his car, was "doing well and is in fair condition." Police believe the wounded officer wasn't targeted personally, but was shot simply because he is a police officer, police spokesman Scott Seroka added. " The wounded officer was one of two who had just finished responding to a reported burglary when he was shot just before 5 a.m. (6 a.m. ET), Minneapolis police said in a statement. A man was arrested in connection with the burglary and a reported domestic assault, Clark said.
