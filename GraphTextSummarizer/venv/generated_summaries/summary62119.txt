"There are lots of other works in the visitor room which people will see and encounter and also will give them a sense of what it was like to be in Buckingham Palace on that day," de Guitaut said. The robe that the queen wore when she left Westminster Abbey to go to Buckingham Palace is made of English purple silk-velvet and is more than 6.5 meters long from the shoulder to the tip of the train. After the official coronation, more than 8,000 guests were invited to Buckingham Palace to celebrate the occasion at banquets. The exhibition shows recreations of the table settings and flowers of the series of banquets that foreign heads of state and the royal family attended. The Halo tiara that the queen's sister Princess Margaret wore and which was later loaned by the queen to Kate Middleton when she married Prince William at Westminster Abbey is part of the exhibition.
