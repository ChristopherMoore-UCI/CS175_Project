-- Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates thinks one of the answers to improving health is in the bathroom. "Many of these innovations will not only revolutionize sanitation in the developing world, but also help transform our dependence on traditional flush toilets in wealthy nations." The United Kingdom's Loughborough University won second place and was awarded $60,000 for a toilet that produces biological charcoal, minerals, and clean water. "Imagine what's possible if we continue to collaborate, stimulate new investment in this sector, and apply our ingenuity in the years ahead," said Gates. The fair in Seattle will also bring together researchers, designers and investors from 29 countries, the Gates foundation says.
