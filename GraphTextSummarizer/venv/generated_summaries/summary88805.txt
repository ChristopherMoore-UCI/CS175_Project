The Taixing Intermediate People's Court found Xu Yuyuan, 47, guilty of intentional homicide after a half-day trial, Xinhua news agency said. At least four other such attacks on school children in China have been reported since March. Xu's sentence was the second death penalty conviction after a recent spate of school attacks that have prompted public outrage across China. Chinese penal code says a person can be convicted of intentional homicide for acting on an intent to kill, the news agency reported. Xu told the court that his rage against society motivated him in the April 29 attacks, according to Xinhua.
