The new provisions will end lifetime limits on coverage; ensure coverage of children with pre-existing medical conditions; allow parents to keep children on their policies until the age of 26; halt the practice of rescission, in which insurance companies drop coverage for arbitrary reasons; and cover preventive health practices, Obama said. Because of the health reform law, she put off treatment until July, when insurance companies were banned from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions, she said. Responding to a Republican argument that the health care bill represents a government takeover of health care, Obama said the bill's provisions are instead "designed to make sure you're getting what you paid for. " Obama mentioned the call by House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, to repeal the health care bill and said Boehner should have to look O'Brien in the eye and tell her, "Sorry, Gail, you can't afford health insurance." He emphasized how the health care bill helps small businesses by providing tax breaks to those that provide coverage to their workers.
