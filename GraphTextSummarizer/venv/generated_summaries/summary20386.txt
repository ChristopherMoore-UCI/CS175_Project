Luz y Fuerza del Centro had sales of 730 megawatt-hours per worker, Gomez Mont said, compared to 2,500 megawatt-hours per worker for CFE. The Mexican government on Sunday dissolved the company that supplies power to the capital and four central states because of the utility's unsustainable financial position, Interior Minister Fernando Gomez Mont said. Inefficiencies at Luz y Fuerza del Centro were costing the government billions of dollars in subsidies to keep the company afloat, Gomez Mont said. "Practically all of the decisions of Luz y Fuerza del Centro had to be taken to serve the demands of the union and not in the interests of the consumers," Gomez Mont said. CFE operates with one electricity distribution employee per 627 consumers; LFC had one distribution employee per 291 users, Gomez Mont said.
