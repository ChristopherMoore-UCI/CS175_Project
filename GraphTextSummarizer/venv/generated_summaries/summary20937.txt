Privacy is contingent on who we're trying to keep something private from -- family, friends, acquaintances, employers, strangers. Privacy today is just more nuanced and exists in different ways than 10, 50, 100 years ago. These services help me stay connected with my friends and interact with strangers, and in turn I grant them permission to analyze my tweets and profile my Facebook interests for profit. There may be new spotlights illuminating our lives, but these lights also cast shadows, and these shadows become new places where we can hide ourselves from the world. Besides, privacy is dead, right?
