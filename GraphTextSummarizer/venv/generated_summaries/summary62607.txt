Hosts Brazil enjoyed a triumphant finale to the troubled Confederations Cup with a 3-0 defeat of world champions Spain in the Maracana Sunday. With Brazil threatening to add further goals, Gerard Pique hacked down his soon to be teammate Neymar and was promptly shown red. For as well as Brazil played, Spain's performance was below standard, with Fred's early goal after a Neymar assist all too easy. Spain could offer little in return and the home side went further ahead just before the break as Barcelona-bound Neymar received a pass from Oscar and beat Iker Casillas with a thunderous shot. Protesters outside the iconic ground, with reports of clashes with riot police amid tight security, have been complaining about the cost of staging the global showpiece against a backdrop of poor public services and alleged corruption.
