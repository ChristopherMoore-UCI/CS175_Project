Second seed Andrea Petkovic of Germany defeated Israeli Shahar Peer 7-6 1-6 6-3, while former world number one Ana Ivanovic saw off Austrian Tamira Paszek 6-3 6-3 and now faces Kim Clijsters. Playing in her first match since losing the U.S. Open final to Samantha Stosur in September, Williams brushed aside South African Chanelle Scheepers 6-2 6-3 with consummate ease. Clijsters returns with convincing victory I've actually never liked sports and I never understood how I became an athlete," Williams continued. In other matches, top seed and local favorite Stosur beat Anastasiya Yakimova of Belarus 6-2 6-3 and is on course to face Williams again in the semifinals.
