"For more than 45 years, Vicente Fernandez has maintained his position as the biggest living singer in Mexico, combining a operatic vocal range with a deep comprehension of the folk roots of ranchera music," his official biography says. -- Mexican crooner Vicente Fernandez, an icon of folk music known for his ranchera ballads, will undergo a liver biopsy in Houston on Tuesday, he announced. Considered Mexico's most famous living singer, Fernandez told CNN affiliate Foro TV that doctors had found a 2-centimeter "ball" in his liver that requires examination. The 72-year-old has won a bevy of awards, including, this month, three Mexican Music Billboard awards. Fernandez's career has spanned four decades, and he is known as the king of ranchera music.
