The Dreamliner uses electricity to run more systems than any other Boeing airliner, said University of Dayton professor Raul Ordonez, an aircraft electrical and computer engineer who spent time observing Dreamliner development at Boeing's Seattle headquarters. On Wednesday, the FAA announced plans to ground U.S.-registered Dreamliners until they pass an emergency airworthiness inspection addressing the potential risk of battery fire. "These kinds of batteries," Ordonez says, "are slightly more likely to cause problems." " Cracked engines and windshields, oil and fuel leaks Other problems linked to the Dreamliner -- such as oil and fuel leaks or damaged cockpit windows -- are operational issues that occur aboard "every airliner out there flying today," says Hiatt. As for random window cracks and fuel and oil leaks, Boeing can solve these kinds of problems without much difficulty, he says.
