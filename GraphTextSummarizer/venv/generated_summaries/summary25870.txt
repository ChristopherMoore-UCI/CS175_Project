North Korea fired two projectiles Sunday that "appear to be short-range missiles" into the sea off the eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula, a South Korean Defense Ministry official told CNN. North Korea has launched missiles several times in the past, often while South Korea is interacting with foreign powers. In late March, the same thing happened while the South Korean leadership met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Barack Obama. On Thursday, U.S. and South Korean government officials reported North Korea had launched three projectiles from its southeastern coast. North and South Korea have existed in a state of permanent tension since the Korean War ended in 1953.
