U.S. News & World Report also published several other lists, including best weight-loss diets, best diabetes diets, best commercial diet plans and easiest diets to follow. The meal plan includes three whole-grain products each day, four to six servings of vegetables, four to six servings of fruit, two to four servings of dairy products and several servings each of lean meats and nuts/seeds/legumes. Unlike many diet plans, DASH doesn't cut out or extremely restrict certain foods. The publication has ranked the controversial diet last on its "Best Diets Overall" list for 2014. Also high on several lists were the Jenny Craig plan and "The Biggest Loser" plan.
