Korean media artist Jin-Yo Mok created the 3D matrix in collaboration with Seoul-based media artist group Jonpasang, and requested animation images from fellow media artists Jussi Angesleva and Alvaro Cassinelli. Mok was also the creative mind behind the beautiful three-layer LED facade of another Seoul icon -- the Shinsegae Department Store -- as well as the dramatic kinetic landscape "Hyper Matrix" exhibited at the Yeosu Expo last year. Mok's artwork -- infusing art with technology -- fit the image that Hyundai has been increasingly aiming to project, leading to the Korean conglomerate's commissions of both "Brilliant Cube" and "Hyper Matrix." "It will probably be moved to the national museum of contemporary art in Seoul after March," said Mok. Comprised of 576 clear LED poles that move up and down, the 36-square-meter matrix, named "Brilliant Cube," continuously flashes hypnotic, colorful patterns and images in one of the most crowded -- and now famous -- areas of Seoul.
