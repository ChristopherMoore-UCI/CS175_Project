Blood Isn't an Easy Medium The issue with blood, or any other liquid for that matter, is that it tends to pool on paper. Any logicality involving drawing with your own blood is debatable, but Lawson persisted and adapted his process to replace traditional ink with body ink. "When you focus on something other than yourself, like making a drawing, it becomes ink and stops being blood." The machine dispensed lines of blood, creating a pixelated version of Lawson's original photo. Lawson hooked himself up to a needle and funneled his blood into the machine like one might do with ink.
