"I am greatly saddened to hear of this tragic incident and of the death of a Royal Navy serviceman," Defense Secretary Liam Fox said in a statement Friday. The Astute made headlines last year when it ran aground off the Isle of Skye, in northern Scotland, while doing sea trials. -- A shooting on board the HMS Astute, a British nuclear submarine making a visit to Southampton, left one person dead and another critically wounded, authorities said Friday. One man was arrested after the shooting, said police, who were contacted by the Ministry of Defense about the incident. The submarine can carry a mix of as many as 38 Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes and Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, according to the ministry.
