" CNN Photos: Rape adds to Haitian camp woes Concannon said Haiti's justice system has a history "of not taking rape that seriously." Reports of rape and sexual violence have been all too common after the January 2010 earthquake that killed more than 220,000 people and displaced almost 25% of the entire population. But this year there have already been more than 60 convictions for sex crimes in Haiti, according to the National Human Rights Defense Network. While it still can be difficult for many victims to file a police report and obtain the necessary medical documents needed to pursue justice, there are more resources for women who want to speak out. This summer, 22 rape cases were prosecuted and there were 13 convictions, said Meena Jagannath, a lawyer who has worked with Haitian rape victims.
