-- Space shuttle Discovery docked with the international space station early Wednesday despite a broken antenna that knocked out radar tracking aboard the shuttle. NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson is already at the space station. Commander Alan Poindexter and his crew completed the rendezvous without the use of the shuttle's Ku-band radar, relying instead on other navigation tools to precisely track the space station, NASA said. The shuttle docked with the space station at 3:44 a.m. ET. It will mark the first time four women have been in space at one time.
