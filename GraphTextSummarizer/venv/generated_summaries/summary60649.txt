Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith said positive identification of the man killed in Sunnyvale, a Bay Area city that borders Cupertino, must come through the coroner. Allman also was believed to be involved in an attempted carjacking that occurred around 7 a.m. Wednesday on the Hewlett-Packard campus in Cupertino, about five miles away from the quarry, Smith said. The workplace shooting occurred Wednesday about 4:15 a.m. at the Permanente Quarry, which produces cement products, Smith said. The suspect died within the perimeter of Wednesday's manhunt, but it was not clear if he spent any time in a home before he was spotted, Smith told reporters. -- A man matching the description of the suspect in a fatal workplace shooting in Cupertino, California, was killed Thursday morning when he brandished a weapon, authorities said.
