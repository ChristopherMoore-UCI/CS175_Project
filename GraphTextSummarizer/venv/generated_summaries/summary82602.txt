Under the plan, the Transportation Security Administration would give airlines and other nations information gleaned from intelligence sources about potential terrorists -- information such as partial names, partial passport numbers and travel patterns of suspects. Based on intelligence, including a partial name and travel information, Customs and Border Protection did additional screening of travelers entering the United States and was able to identify Headley. "This is yet another instance of homeland security adviser John Brennan and other White House staff withholding important security information from Congress," he said. The U.S. intelligence community will determine, based on threat information, which characteristics should be used to select passengers for secondary screening. It's a stronger way to determine whether passengers should go through secondary examination and not just primary examination."
