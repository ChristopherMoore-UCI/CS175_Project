-- South Sudan accused Sudan of launching ground and aerial attacks inside South Sudan's territory Sunday. Sudan has accused South Sudan of destroying oil infrastructure and said it would attempt to force South Sudan to pay for damages. Sudan's oil industry suffered further when fighting in Heglig forced a halt to oil production in those fields, which account for about half of the country's entire production of 115,000 barrels a day. While both countries claim Heglig, Sudan continued administering the region after South Sudan declared independence last July following a two-decade civil war. Benjamin said the bases near the border have been repeatedly attacked in the past by Sudanese troops based in Heglig, and those previous attacks prompted South Sudan to occupy the area.
