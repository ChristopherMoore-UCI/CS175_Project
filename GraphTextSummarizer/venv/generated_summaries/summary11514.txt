"Our task at Fraunhofer is to bring as much of our research as possible straight into industrial production," says Matthia Putz, director at Fraunhofer Institute. "We don't focus on reports, we develop new products and new technologies together with industrial partners," he adds. Developed by scientists at Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools and Forming Technology in Saxony, the factory is particularly committed to rethinking the role of humans in manufacturing lines. Cue the "Factory of the Future", a 17,000 square foot innovation hub in the city of Chemnitz where researchers experiment with new technologies and machinery in a bid to improve the production process. "The processes we are developing today are so much more complex," says Professor Dirk Landgrebe, director of the institute.
