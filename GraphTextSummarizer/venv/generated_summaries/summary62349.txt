UK authorities estimate that 500 Britons have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with Islamist groups. Even without specific threats in the West, ISIS' track record in Syria and Iraq -- where it was known to massacre minorities, forcefully institute Sharia law and stage executions and stonings -- suggest it may be capable of anything. In response to events in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS militants have seized a large swath of territory, the UK government increased the country's threat level from "substantial" to "severe," the fourth highest of five levels. "I think it's just trying to make people scared really, that's all it is, said Dill Shawki, a Ph.D student in London. "Make people scared and they'll be more likely to support something if the government then eventually did try to go into Iraq."
