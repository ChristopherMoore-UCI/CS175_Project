Pelosi brushed off the negative attack ads featuring her image in several House races, but said she was "offended" by what the GOP was saying about President Barack Obama on the campaign trail. The California Democrat seemed more than happy that Republicans are again using a strategy from previous election cycles to try and tie vulnerable House Democrats to her, remarking, "oh my goodness, they've helped me raise money every time." About a month from the 2014 midterm elections House Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was already predicting a sweep for her party in the 2016 election. Asked about her personal political plans given her confidence of a Democratic takeover on Capitol Hill, Pelosi pointed out she was already running for re-election in 2014. Pelosi has publicly urged former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to run for president and said if Clinton does decide to run she would win.
