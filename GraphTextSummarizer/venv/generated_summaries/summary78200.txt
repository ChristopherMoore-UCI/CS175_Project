"It was a mistake to open schools and mayor de Blasio and Carmen Farina should be ashamed of themselves for allowing it," wrote Steve Caruso. On January 3, with only three days in office, de Blasio closed schools when snow combined with frigid temperatures in the first "polar vortex" of the year. But his administration was criticized for not canceling school on other days, including the January 22 storm that brought about a foot of snow to New York. -- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who took office 44 days ago promising to bring together residents of a divided city, was widely vilified Thursday for keeping the nation's largest school system open during a brutal storm expected to leave up to 14 inches of snow in some areas. Since 1978, he said, New York City schools have closed due to snow just 11 times.
