" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, praised the Navy's decision, noting that Chavez "worked tirelessly to promote fair working conditions and equal rights for all Americans." Other ships in the Navy's T-AKE class of dry cargo and ammunition ships are named for innovators like aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart and Antarctic explorer Richard Byrd. "Naming a ship after Cesar Chavez goes right along with other recent decisions by the Navy that appear to be more about making a political statement than upholding the Navy's history and tradition." Hunter sent a letter to Mabus on Wednesday, requesting the Navy name its next available vessel after Marine Corps Sgt. "This decision shows the direction the Navy is heading," said Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who sits on the House Armed Services Committee. As several family members of Chavez and Navy officials honored the ship at a ceremony in San Diego Wednesday afternoon, several Latinos in California said they were happy to hear the news.
