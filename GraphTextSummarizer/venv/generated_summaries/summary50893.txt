As their clothes light up, a message that says "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year" appears above them. Remember last month's viral video that showed action star Jean-Claude Van Damme doing the splits between two moving Volvo trucks? Representatives for Norris and Delov Digital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spoof video by Hungarian company Delov Digital shows a CGI likeness of the actor doing the splits between two airplanes soaring through the sky. It's unclear whether Norris, 73, was involved at all in producing the video, which has garnered more than 13.5 million hits on YouTube since it was posted last week.
