Amid massive global interest in the trial, appeal and retrial of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, it has been easy to overlook their alleged victim, Meredith Kercher, who was found brutally murdered in the flat she shared with Knox in Italy in 2007. "I also hope this book might help to keep Meredith's case in the spotlight, and, in some small way, to keep alive the hope that we might yet know the truth about her death." John Kercher wrote about the moment he learned the British student killed in Perugia was his daughter. "I want people to remember Meredith for the good times she had in Perugia, not just the horrible ending," said Natalie Hayward, who got to know Kercher before her death. Despite the focus on Knox's endless travails, Kercher's family and friends remain determined to keep her memory alive. The Kercher family, who were not in court Wednesday, have said that if Knox's conviction is confirmed, they want authorities in the U.S. to extradite her to Italy, according to Britain's Press Association.
