Kristin Palmer and Trent Wood were asleep in their home last week when a motorist allegedly drove into their bedroom around 4 a.m., mistakenly believing it was his ex-girlfriend's home. " Authorities say the motorist was drunk when he drove into the couple's home in Sparks, mistakenly believing it was the home of his ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend. "When you experience something like that there's no limits anymore, you can try to do whatever you want to do," Wood told HLN's Mike Galanos. The couple calmed down somewhat after emergency workers arrived at the scene, using chainsaws to rip through the wall, Wood said. Somehow, the two left the scene with relatively minor scrapes and burns -- and a new lease on life, Wood said.
