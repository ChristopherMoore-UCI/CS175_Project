Described as the "Oprah of Africa," Nigerian talk show host Mosunmola Abudu has interviewed such high profile guests as IMF chief Christine Lagarde and former U.S. secretary of State Hillary Clinton. However, one interviewee Abudu still dreams of having on her program, "Moments with Mo," is American talk show queen Oprah Winfrey. When other women ask Christine Lagarde about coping with failure -- and they often do -- the head of the International Monetary Fund doesn't mince her words. She's the self-made Chinese billionaire who's richer than Donald Trump and Oprah Winfrey. So far, Abudu has been unable to make contact with Winfrey.
