" Prosecutors said Jasper also had detailed maps of three university campuses -- University of Washington, South Seattle Community College, and Seattle University -- in his possession, according to CNN affiliate KIRO. University officers arrested Justin Miles Jasper, a 21-year-old Nevada man, on Wednesday night after finding him near the Seattle school in a truck that had been reported stolen recently from a Butte, Montana, residence, campus police Chief John Vinson said Thursday. But on Wednesday, "the vehicle was entered as stolen from Montana," so officers looked for the vehicle and stopped it not far from campus at about 10:30 p.m., Vinson said. Police initially found him sleeping in the truck on campus on Tuesday, a day before the arrest, Vinson said. -- Why would someone allegedly steal a pickup truck and guns in Montana and then go to the University of Washington area with Molotov cocktails and a bullet-resistant vest?
