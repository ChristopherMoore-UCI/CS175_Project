A grand jury in Dallas County, Texas, has decided not to indict two officers in the fatal shooting of Jason Harrison, a schizophrenic man whose mother had called police for help getting him to the hospital. The Harrison family's lawsuit against Rogers and Hutchins says they should have used nonlethal means of defusing the situation instead of choosing to engage "in unlawful vicious attacks" when they and the department were aware of Harrison's condition. In it, Harrison's mother answers the door for police and nonchalantly walks outside. Video from one officer's body camera fades to black as Harrison's mother wails, "Oh, they killed my son! The suit also claims the officers violated Harrison's civil rights.
