Fernando Caignet Aguilera, 64, was cited by officials December 10 after he trapped the 4-foot alligator at a nearby park and brought it to the Santa Ana Market, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino. -- A Miami man is in a swampy situation after he was caught trying to trade a live alligator for beer at a Florida convenience store. The alligator was unharmed and returned to the wild by wildlife officials, Pino said. Pino told CNN that never in his 25-year career in law enforcement has he heard of a person capturing an alligator for the purpose of exchanging it for alcohol -- or anything, for that matter. Pino was unsure if Aguilera requested a specific brand of beer.
