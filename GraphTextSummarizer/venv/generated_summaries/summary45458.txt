When first questioned, the family members told police that Deal had climbed into the box and suffocated while playing hide-and-seek, police said. Cynthia Stoltzmann, 44, and Judith Deal, 62, were charged with child abuse and kidnapping after both admitted they had locked the girl in the box on previous occasions, it added. Stoltzmann was the victim's aunt and legal guardian, according to police spokesman Sgt. That was the account Stoltzmann gave to CNN affiliate KNXV-TV on July 13, the day after family members reported finding the body. The charges were filed Thursday, a day after Phoenix police arrested the four.
