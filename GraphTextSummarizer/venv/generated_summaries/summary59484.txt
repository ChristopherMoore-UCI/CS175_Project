By the end of last year, Gambia had 44 people on death row, including two women, according to human rights activists. Amnesty International, the French government and other rights groups condemned the execution order. -- Gambia plans to execute all death row prisoners by September, the president said this week, sparking condemnation from human rights groups worldwide. "President Jammeh's comments are deeply troubling and will undoubtedly cause severe anguish to those on death row and their families," said Audrey Gaughran, the Africa director for Amnesty. In 2010, British human rights group Reprieve said Gambia had introduced the death penalty for those found with more than 250 grams of cocaine or heroin.
