Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in an interview published in the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet Wednesday, lambasted Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for interfering in Syrian internal politics. Meanwhile, at least 70 people -- including 10 children and three women -- were killed Wednesday in Syria, opposition activists said. Crews have found the bodies of the Turkish pilots killed in last month's downing of their jet by Syria, an incident that prompted an outbreak of hostile rhetoric between the two nations that continued Wednesday. Erdogan, whose government is hosting anti-Assad opposition groups and thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing Syria's violence, wants "terrorists to be free in Syria," al-Assad said, asserting that the prime minister is "very excited about the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Syria" -- a Sunni movement. Syria shot down the F-4 Turkish Phantom jet on June 22, intensifying the animosity between the countries, whose once-close relationship has eroded since the al-Assad regime begain cracking down on opposition forces 16 months ago.
