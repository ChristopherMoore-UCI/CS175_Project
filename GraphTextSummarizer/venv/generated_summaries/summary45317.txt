The Guardian said actress Gwyneth Paltrow, model Elle MacPherson, actor Jude Law, singer George Michael, celebrity chef Nigella Lawson, celebrity PR agent Max Clifford, and actors union Equity were also victims of the hacking. " In a statement News International, the UK subsidiary of News Corporation, said it was prevented by "confidentiality obligations from discussing certain allegations made in the Guardian newspaper today. Prosecutors said they would look again at claims of alleged phone hacking by the News of the World. The Guardian reported that Equity was targeted as a way to get actors' addresses. "We have no evidence to support the claims in today's Guardian story that Equity was conned into giving out information and we have received no complaints from any of our members that the details we hold on their behalf have been improperly accessed," Equity's letter states.
