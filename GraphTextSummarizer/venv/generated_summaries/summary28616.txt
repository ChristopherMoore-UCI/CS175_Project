The only man charged in the 2010 disappearance and death of honor student Phylicia Barnes has been freed by a judge in Baltimore. The judge's order said there was plenty of circumstantial evidence against Johnson, including that he was the last person known to see Barnes and that a witness watched him sweating as he carried an object in a tote down the apartment stairs on the day she disappeared. Johnson was convicted of second degree murder in January 2013. However, Mr. Johnson has maintained his innocence from Day One of this entire case, and we are very thankful that justice was done. On Monday, Judge Addison Howard granted a motion of acquittal for Michael Johnson because of insufficient evidence.
