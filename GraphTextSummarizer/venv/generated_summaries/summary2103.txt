Called "harrowing," "a testament to a misconceived war," and as Ben so aptly puts it in quoting the New York Times, "a mix between 'In Cold Blood,' 'Black Hawk Down,' with a bit of 'Apocalypse Now'," the book attempts to explain how the United States' overthrow of Saddam Hussein, an event which the U.S. government promised would bring so much hope for the future of Iraq, eventually led to the unprovoked murder of four of the nation's innocent citizens at the hands of three U.S. soldiers. It was a quite a change for us, then, when Ben took the subway to Brooklyn and pulled up a comfy chair with Time Executive Editor and Time.com Managing Editor Jim Frederick, himself an intrepid reporter and the author of "Black Hearts: One Platoon's Descent Into Madness in Iraq's Triangle of Death." Whether he's touring former slave forts in Senegal with legendary boxer David Haye, dodging insurgent bullets in Afghanistan or exposing the network of oppressed immigrants that helped build Dubai, Ben's willingness to venture into the unexplored pockets of the globe always make for fascinating reporting. See the rest of VBS Meets Jim Frederick at VBS.TV Black Hearts tells the story of a unit of the Army's 101st Airborne division deployed to Iraq's "triangle of death" in 2005. In his appearances on VBS.TV, correspondent Ben Anderson has taken us to some dangerous and far-flung places -- conflict-ridden sites imbued with human suffering and the scars of injustice.
