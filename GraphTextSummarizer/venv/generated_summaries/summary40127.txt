As head of Berkeley National Lab, he led projects to the tune of $650 million channeling much of it towards green technology to develop advanced biofuels and solar power. Indeed Friedman's book was written before the financial meltdown but recent events have furthered his argument that environmental technology is the solution of all solutions. Unlike Gore, Friedman is a distinctly different shade of green, a deeply pragmatic green that believes economic forces can usher in a revolution in environmental policy. As a journalist, Friedman makes no claims to having scientific expertise in climate change. For Friedman, America is slipping down the ranks of hegemonic power and climate change is its big chance to reposition itself as a global leader.
