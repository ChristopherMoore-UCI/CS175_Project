-- With less than two weeks before federal money runs out for transportation projects across the country, a partisan showdown is developing between Senate Democrats and House Republicans over passing a new bill. Instead, Reid said House Republicans should accept a two-year, $109 billion bill that recently passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support. On Wednesday, House Transportation Committee Chairman John Mica, R-Florida, said the House would soon pass a three-month extension of existing funding to provide time for negotiations over a longer-term bill. House Democrats, meanwhile, say the bill is a non-starter because it calls for drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Asked about Reid's refusal to consider a short-term bill, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said Reid is taking a risk.
