I think that rap music and hip-hop has a good future in Tunisia. Balti: I'm so happy to see other Arab countries looking to get back their freedom, and not just because I'm a Tunisian, but because Tunisia played a leading role in this matter. But more than simply upsetting the status quo, according to one of the country's leading rappers their music was the "fuel" for Tunisia's revolution. Inside the Middle East traveled to a recording studio in the suburbs of Tunis where Balti makes his music to get his take on the role of rap in Tunisia's revolution. In recent years Tunisian rappers have taken advantage of social networks to post music videos on the internet.
