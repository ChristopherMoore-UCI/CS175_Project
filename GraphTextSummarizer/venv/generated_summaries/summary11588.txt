A series of photos recently circulated on Sina Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, shows Chinese doctors and nurses decked in scrubs, posing with reportedly unconscious patients on the operating table in the operating theater. Senior executives and a team of medical staff from a Chinese hospital in the northwestern province of Shaanxi have been punished for taking group photos next to apparently unconscious patients after surgery, state media reported on Monday. The Xi'an Bureau of Public Health has taken action for the photos taken in August this year, removing three top executives from administrative duties at the privately-run Fengcheng Hospital, reported Xinhua News Agency. A man makes a V-sign in one of the happy snaps, while other doctors are seen leaning over the patient mid-procedure. Bloggers have taken to social media to express their opinions using the hashtag "surgery selfie", with many condemning the doctors' lack of professional ethics.
