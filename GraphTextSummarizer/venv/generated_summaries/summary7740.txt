Giggs, however -- and not for the first time in his stellar career -- split open the Olympiacos defense with a diagonal ball that reached van Persie. The Red Devils advanced to the quarterfinals of this season's Champions League by thumping Olympiacos 3-0 thanks to a Robin van Persie hat-trick, thus overturning a 2-0 first-leg deficit. Bookings, a collision that left United winger Antonio Valencia with a swollen eye and a glaring miss by Olympiacos' Hernan Perez highlighted an action-packed opening 15 minutes. Before the game, Moyes -- one bookmaker lists Dortmund boss Jurgen Klopp as the favorite to succeed the Scot -- denied reports that he had clashed with Ryan Giggs and van Persie. "I said to (my team) on Monday morning we have to win 3-0, give the crowd something back because the crowd here has been incredible," Moyes, the successor to managerial giant Alex Ferguson at United, told Sky Sports.
