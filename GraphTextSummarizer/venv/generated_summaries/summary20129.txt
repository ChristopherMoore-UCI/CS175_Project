A Swiss woman and her husband who were on a cycling tour across the India were attacked by a group of men in March after they set up camp near a forest in the central part of the country. The man said he and the young woman watched a movie before boarding a private bus to return to her home in a New Delhi suburb. An American woman was raped in June after visiting a popular Hindu temple in northern India. The woman was on assignment with a male colleague when some men approached them, took them to a nearby mill under false pretenses, then tied them both up and raped her, Mumbai police commissioner Satypal Singh said. The teenager is the first of five suspects to be tried for their role in the attack, which happened December 16 on a moving bus in New Delhi.
