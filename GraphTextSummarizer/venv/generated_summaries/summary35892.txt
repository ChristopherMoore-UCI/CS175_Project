According to the report, the process costs 163.55 New Zealand dollars (US$129) and does not have a minimum capital requirement. In New Zealand, it takes only one step and one day, the ideal number, to incorporate a company. The report also factors in the cost and the minimum capital required, with 0% of income per capita being best.
