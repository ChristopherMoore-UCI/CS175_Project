Samuel L. Jackson took a Los Angeles entertainment reporter to task Monday after the reporter appeared to confuse the actor for Laurence Fishburne. "I indicated to Samuel that I'd seen him during the Super Bowl, and he thought that I had confused him with the commercial Laurence Fishburne had done for a car company. " The outburst momentarily stunned CNN affiliate KTLA's Sam Rubin, who had asked Jackson what the reaction was to his Super Bowl commercial. I'm not Laurence Fishburne!" You only hear his voice, though, so you probably won't confuse him with Laurence Fishburne."
