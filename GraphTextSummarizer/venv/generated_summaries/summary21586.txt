The plane was on autopilot during its approach to the Buffalo airport, Chealander said. However, severe icing is "not what we saw here," Chealander said, adding that the FAA has no such disengagement rule in effect. Offering more details, Chealander said Sunday that the plane's nose pitched up 31 degrees, then down 45 degrees. "To say that they should not have been flying on autopilot is not correct," Chealander said. Chealander said the plane's de-icing system was turned on 11 minutes after the flight left Newark, New Jersey, for Buffalo, and remained on for the entire flight.
