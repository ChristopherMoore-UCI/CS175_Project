As bassist Chris Baio tells Rolling Stone, they've been hard at work on the follow-up to their 2010 LP, "Contra. Given the band's extremely light tour schedule last year, Baio had time to reacquaint himself with his love of DJ'ing. The band has amassed plenty of material, but as frontman Ezra Koenig echoed in a recent chat with Rolling Stone, they aren't working with any deadline in mind. His first completed track was "Sunburn Modern" -- a cut whose title, Baio says, was inspired by a nasty, "modern art"-looking sunburn he received last year while on a trip to Mexico with his girlfriend. A three-track set of undulating dance grooves that capture a vibe the bassist describes as "hopeful melancholy," it's the culmination of a hobby Baio took up half a decade ago as a student at Columbia University in New York.
