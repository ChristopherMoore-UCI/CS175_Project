The former vice president told Charlie Rose that President Barack Obama had been cautious, and when the CBS anchor asked whether there was "a very hostile environment for progressive ideas," Gore had his culprit ready: "Fox News and right-wing talk radio. Limbaugh later offered this response: "If Fox News and I are the only thing keeping the Republicans from caving to Barack Obama on every issue, I'm not paid enough." There are times when many Fox programs, including in the nonopinion hours, appear to be on a jihad against the administration. " The resulting furor gave Fox months of fodder and was widely judged a tactical misstep that if anything elevated the network's role. If a Republican member of Congress is not punished on Fox News or by Rush Limbaugh for working with a Democrat on a bill of common interest, then you'll see more of them doing it."
