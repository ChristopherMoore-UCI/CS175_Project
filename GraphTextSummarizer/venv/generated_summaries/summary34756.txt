While Eliassen is embracing this new chapter in the short history of her sport, she is also keen to pay tribute to slopestyle's X Games roots. With Russia's first Winter Games drawing ever closer, the two-time X Games gold medal winner could get one last chance to fulfill her childhood dream. "I've been watching the Olympics since I was a little girl," said Eliassen, who is based in Salt Lake City -- which hosted the 2002 Winter Games. You never know what you're going to see in our sport." Come February, slopestyle fans could see Eliassen with a gold medal around her neck. "The X Games has always been our Olympics because in the past we never had the Olympics," explained Eliassen.
