The United States is doing its part, too, by installing more radiation detection equipment at ports and other transit sites to thwart would-be smugglers of nuclear materials; by developing guidelines to strengthen cybersecurity at nuclear power plants; and by pursuing production of an isotope used in medicine that does not require weapons-usable materials, he said. Hours after Obama landed Monday in The Netherlands for the summit, the White House announced a deal to dispose of huge quantities of nuclear material from Japan. And dozens of other nations have agreed to take steps to improve nuclear security in their own countries and to support global efforts, the U.S. President said. "We've seen such steps as Belgium and Italy completing the removal of their excess supplies of highly enriched uranium and plutonium so that those supplied can be eliminated," he said at a joint news conference with Mark Rutte, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. "Had that not happened, those dangerous nuclear materials would still be there now, and the difficult situation we are dealing with in Ukraine today would involve yet another level of concern."
