The band will also perform two shows in Pero's honor: one at Las Vegas' Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, the other at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. Next year marks the band's 40th anniversary, and to celebrate, the tour is being titled "Forty and F*ck It." "It's official: Farewell," Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider posted on Facebook. Snider also noted that the band will play with a new drummer, Mike Portnoy of Adrenaline Mob. Twisted Sister says that its 2016 tour will be its last, according to a press release. Portnoy replaces A.J. Pero, who died March 20.
