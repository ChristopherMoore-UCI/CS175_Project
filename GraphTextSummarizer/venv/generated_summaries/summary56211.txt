Although the training is different from medical school, nurse practitioners do invest a great deal of time in education: usually a bachelor's degree in nursing and then two to four more years getting a graduate-level degree, sometimes in a specialty area such as family practice. " Ford always thought nurse practitioners would be able to practice independently; it's only recently that autonomy has been legalized in several states, but there has always been a clear need, she said. The four components of Ford's vision for nurse practitioners -- the ability to assess, diagnose, treat and evaluate -- have not changed since the early days, but the extent to which they do those things has evolved, and so has their independence, Rideout said. As she gained experience, Ford realized that more nurses should be able to have specialized training so they could make basic decisions on their own about the health status of patients. Ford had wanted to be a teacher, but because of cost concerns she went to nursing school instead.
