The U.S. has its shale bonanza, while China has led the way with an aggressive array of international deals, covering everything from shale gas in North America, pipelines across Myanmar, stakes in Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects and Caspian Sea oil and gas. That makes a Russian pipeline running through its Altai region into northwest China and then to northern India a possibility, albeit a costly one. In energy infrastructure such as international pipelines, China is way ahead of India, with a network of lines from Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Myanmar that delivers a steady supply of oil and gas. India is partnering with Vietnam to explore for oil in the same South China Sea waters where China's recent oil rig movements have brought China-Vietnam relations to an unhappy low. Modi says India-Russia relations have stood the test of time, and he wants to further strengthen them, which suggests that India may be keen to buy more Russian oil and gas in future.
