Conservative publications have raised questions about his ties to Islamist groups that have been investigated for allegedly supporting terrorism, and his comments during a 2012 speech that U.S. public schools should look to Islamic schools as a model. He also weighed in on the elevated terror threat in France and the 10,000 troops the French government deployed across the country this week as a precautionary measure, following a week of violent attacks from individuals who've claimed ties to ISIS and other terrorist groups. "I know they certainly don't want to become a totalitarian state, but in protecting the rights of citizens there's a delicate balance between keeping people safe and surveilling the citizens to the point where we are targeting people specifically — not because of race, not because of religion, but making sure we are targeting the right people and eliminating the threat to make people safer," he said. But a top Democrat came to his defense this week, with New York Rep. Joseph Crowley, vice-chairman of the Democratic caucus, saying the comments "offended" him in a letter to members. "It's not any different than those who claim to be Christians or Jews or Hindus and commit atrocious acts," Democratic Rep. Andre Carson said on CNN's New Day of the attacks.
