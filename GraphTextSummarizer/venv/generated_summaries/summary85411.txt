" CNN reached out to Bracamonte for reaction to Stretton's radio interview but had not heard back Monday evening. CNN discovered that Stretton is on the California's Vexatious Litigant List, a list of people who continually bring legal action, regardless of merit, against others with the sole intention of harassment. Marcella Bracamonte told CNN's Sara Sidner that Stretton -- who is currently sleeping in her car, while all of her belongings remain inside Bracamontes' home -- offered to move out over the July Fourth weekend. The saga began back in March when Marcella Bracamonte hired Stretton as a nanny to take care of her three children and to help out with household chores. Stretton refused to leave the Bracamonte home in Upland, about 35 miles east of Los Angeles, and police told the family they couldn't force her out without an eviction notice.
