Steve Riach, the founder of Heart of a Champion Foundation -- a nonprofit organization that says it offers educators an "innovative and effective approach to developing character in the lives of their students" -- said his organization has learned that students recognize that school safety cannot be accomplished only with security guards and metal detectors. That question haunts me to this day, and I will probably never know the answer," Sirdeaner Walker said in a House Education and Labor Committee hearing on school bullying. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, said the emotional and physical effects of bullying are becoming more severe and that the acts of bullying can continue outside school. And students "have told us that emotional safety is every bit a concern as physical safety," he said. Walker called school bullying a national crisis.
