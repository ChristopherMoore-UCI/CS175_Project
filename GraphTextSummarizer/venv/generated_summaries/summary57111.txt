-- Two tank barges loaded with light crude oil struck a bridge in the Mississippi River early Sunday morning. In February 2012 a tanker barge spilled 10,000 gallons of oil into the Mississippi after a collision near New Orleans. The Mississippi River at Vicksburg moves about 890,000 cubic feet of water per second, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Coast Guard said it was trying to determine how many gallons may have been spilled into the river near Vicksburg, Mississippi. The tank that was leaking contained 80,000 gallons of oil.
