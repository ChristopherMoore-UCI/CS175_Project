Peñaflorida kept his stride, ready to laugh off the incident, said CNN producer Alex Zolbert. He was returning to Manila from Hong Kong, where he gave a speech, when a man dressed as a woman tried to grab something out of his bag at Manila's Ninoy Aquino International Airport, police said. CNN honored Peñaflorida in November for starting a "pushcart classroom" in the Philippines to bring education to poor children as an alternative to gang membership. The suspect, who police say was part of a larger pickpocketing operation, later confessed, authorities said. Police spotted the pickpocket and made an arrest, as a CNN crew witnessed the incident.
