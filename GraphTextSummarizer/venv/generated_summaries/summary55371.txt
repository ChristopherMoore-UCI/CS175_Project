In an e-mail dated September 19, Sanford police volunteer coordinator Wendy Dorival thanked Zimmerman for his "kind words" sent to the chief. HLN: Zimmerman wife talks publicly for the first time Zimmerman was once sharply critical of police in Sanford, according to an audio recording of a January 8, 2011, public meeting at Sanford's City Hall obtained by CNN. The two exchanges, eight months apart, show a significant shift in Zimmerman's relationship with police months before officers responded to the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Zimmerman's e-mails with Sanford police show a cordial, even friendly, relationship. At the neighborhood watch meeting on September 22, according to court documents, Sanford police distributed contact cards and hosted a presentation on crime-prevention and security measures.
