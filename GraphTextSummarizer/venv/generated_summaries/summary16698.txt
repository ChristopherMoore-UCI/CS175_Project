Beyond this, innovators in this field are seeking another level of information that combines the research of drones on the surface with drones on the sea bed, aerial drones and satellites in space. Looking ahead, Liquid Robotics is opening up its platforms to research institutions to develop new and improved sensors to create new fields of investigation. "In the last 20 years these platforms gone from experimental one-offs to workhorses," says Chris Roman, professor of oceanography at University of Rhode Island, who uses drones in research on oil spills. A more ambitious vision is to build on communication -- between drone and command center, but also between swarms of drones working together. They are searching for new sources of fuel, chemicals and medicines, and providing security against mines and other hazards.
