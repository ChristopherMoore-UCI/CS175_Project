The incident dates back to July 14 when Amarildo de Souza was taken to police headquarters in Rio de Janeiro by officers, state broadcaster Agencia Brazil reported. But a prosecutor said there was no evidence from security camera footage that Souza ever left police headquarters, Agencia Brazil reported. The incident was allegedly committed by members of Brazil's Pacifying Police Unit, a team assembled to address crime before the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympic Games comes to Brazil. The unit has grown in importance in recent years as the upcoming World Cup and Olympics puts Brazil in the spotlight. Prosecutor Homero de Freitas plans to file a complaint against all 10 officers, Agencia Brazil reported.
