His father said the new asphalt between fields makes it easier for people using wheelchairs, walkers or strollers to watch the games up close and support their teams. Martin was diagnosed with stage IV brain cancer last fall, his parents told CNN affiliate KRQE. When his condition worsened in January, Martin decided he wanted to upgrade the Albuquerque, New Mexico, fields where he had played baseball since he was 6 years old. That's why Martin Romero asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation to donate his wish to improve the local baseball fields that were his second home. "Because of his tumor, they wouldn't allow that," mom Cindy Romero said.
