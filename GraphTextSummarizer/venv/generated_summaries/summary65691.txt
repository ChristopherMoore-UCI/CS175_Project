We've been making records for a long time together, but there's always an element of surprise when it comes to the way a Depeche Mode record is really going to sound -- even for ourselves. But, as mutual fans, with front man Dave Gahan enjoying Soulsavers' work with singer Mark Lanegan and Machin's love of the seminal albums "Violator" and "Songs of Faith and Devotion," it was only a matter of time. CNN: You are currently recording your 13th Depeche Mode album. -- When Depeche Mode chose Soulsavers, the English electronica production team of Rich Machin and Ian Glover, to open for them on their 2009 European tour, they didn't know it would be just the beginning of their musical collaboration. CNN recently spoke to Gahan about what inspired the soaring new songs, what fans can expect from the new Depeche Mode LP being recorded now and how "Ziggy Stardust" changed his life.
