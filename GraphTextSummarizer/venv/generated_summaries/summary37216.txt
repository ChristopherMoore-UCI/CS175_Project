The quake struck Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula Wednesday morning, on the Pacific coast about 87 miles west of the capital, San Jose. Schools in the hardest hit areas will be closed Thursday and Friday while engineers inspect buildings for damage, Chinchilla said. Other photos showed floors littered with merchandise inside stores and homes with minor damages. It was pretty scary," said David Boddinger, editor of the English-language Tico Times in San Jose. The president praised residents' response, saying there were no reports of major physical damage from the quake.
