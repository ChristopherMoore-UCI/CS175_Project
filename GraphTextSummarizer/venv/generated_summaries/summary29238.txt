" Where sex-same marriage is legal New Jersey has recognized civil unions between same-sex couples since 2007, after the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the state must allow same-sex couples all the rights and benefits of marriage. Same-sex marriage is now legal in 14 U.S states -- California, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington -- as well as the District of Columbia. As far as state rights and benefits went, civil unions and marriages differed only in label. "Marriage is equal in New Jersey." New Jersey now becomes the 14th state to recognize gay marriages.
