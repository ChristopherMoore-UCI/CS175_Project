Even though Marshall was congratulating the staff for an earlier event that went off successfully, staff members have a long week ahead assuring there are no diplomatic glitches when President Barack Obama and Secretary Clinton meet with many of their counterparts. Matt Lee, a veteran State Department reporter, says UNGA week is always a big hassle because of the famous New York City traffic, but it's a good opportunity to see lots of sources and get a better sense of the full diplomatic picture. Special Agent T.J. Lunardi of the Diplomatic Security Service has an office set up to oversee the security for Clinton as she travels around New York for her meetings, as well as the security for all other non-head of state dignitaries. She may be out of Washington and on the road for the week, but the heavy machinery of office has followed Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to New York as she attends the annual United Nations General Assembly meetings. Benjamin Sand with International Organization Affairs -- the bureau responsible for managing the U.S. relationship with United Nations and all other international organizations -- said the pressure of managing the week's itinerary was more like "finals week" in college, except that it would be the entire world grading his office's performance as opposed to a lone professor.
