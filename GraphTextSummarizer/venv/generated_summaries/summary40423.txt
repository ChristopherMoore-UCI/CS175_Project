Farmers will see less risk; federal government takes on more: The bill dramatically changes 82 years of agricultural subsidies, ending guaranteed payments that farmers receive regardless of their harvest quality or crop prices. To try and mitigate the hit, the farm bill beefs up a different kind of subsidy -- a subsidy for crop insurance. But, because those "direct payments" have been in place for generations, many farm values became based on the expectation of government dollars. And it aims to protect more prairie land by cutting subsidies in half for people who farm on some virgin sod. The most subsidized crops in this (and in most farm bills of the past) are the so-called "row crops," things like wheat, soy, and the king of American agriculture, corn.
