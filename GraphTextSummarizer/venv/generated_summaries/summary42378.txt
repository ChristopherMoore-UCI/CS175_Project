The bombing occurred near a Sunni mosque and an office belonging to one of Iraq's top Sunni Arab parties. The umbrella group includes a number of Sunni extremist organizations and has ties to al Qaeda in Iraq. -- Three bombs left outside three Christian homes in western Baghdad detonated Tuesday evening, wounding at least three people, an Interior Ministry official said. The parked car bomb targeted buses carrying Iranian pilgrims at the road leading to Najaf's old city. The bomb went off at one of the main entrances to the city where buses carrying Iranian pilgrims stop.
