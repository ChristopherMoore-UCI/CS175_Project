-- Egypt's general prosecutor on Monday extended the detention of two of former President Hosni Mubarak's sons, saying further investigation is needed. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak will be held for another 15 days, the prosecutor's office said in a statement, adding that members of the office went to Tora prison to conduct questioning. Mubarak and his two sons were detained in connection with the protesters' deaths, an official with Egypt's Justice Ministry said at the time. The two were being questioned "regarding the prices of their real estate, lands and their role in intervening in the program of settling Egypt's debts," as well as commissions on a gas deal with Israel and their roles in "mandatory partnerships with foreign companies in Egypt," the statement said. Last month, Egyptians exulted over the detention of their ailing former president and his two sons in a probe exploring the killing of protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, the center of the country's dramatic uprising earlier this year that led to Mubarak's ouster.
