Here is a sampling of comments from distraught Twitter users: Sarah Traczyk ‚Äè@cadetkellyy Swear to god if @Caribou_Coffee disappears for good I will never be okay. Customers who have Caribou gift cards will still be able to use them at CaribouCoffee.com, the company said on Twitter. After that, 88 other Caribou locations will become Peet's as Caribou becomes extinct or critically endangered in Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia, Illinois, eastern Wisconsin and Washington. When the purge is complete, Caribou plans to continue to operate 468 locations in Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, western Wisconsin, North Carolina, Denver, Colorado, and 10 international markets. Why would I try it when you are closing my store in LaGrange IL and forcing good, hardworking people out of a job?" A community called "Caribou Coffee, putting 1,000's of people out of work" popped up on Facebook and had 120 likes by 7 p.m. ET.
