-- Editor's note: On April 21, Denis Asselin, 63, stepped out his front door to embark on a 525-mile walk from Philadelphia to Boston in memory of his son Nathaniel, who took his life last year after a 13-year battle with body dysmorphic disorder, a condition related to obsessive compulsive disorder. My primary goals are to tell Nathaniel's story -- so that awareness about brain disorders, especially OCD and BDD, can spread far and wide -- and to raise much needed funds for the International OCD Foundation so research and programs can help other sufferers, their families and their friends. To engage in a "pilgrimage" in the 21st century is by its very definition an invitation to step outside of chronos time (ordinary clock time) and to enter into kyros time (timelessness). There he will share his story as a parent of a child with body dysmorphic disorder. For more information on body dysmorphic disorder, click here
