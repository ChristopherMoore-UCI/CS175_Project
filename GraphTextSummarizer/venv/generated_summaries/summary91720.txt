"It's not for surveillance," said NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek. Any response to missile attacks would still come from ground missiles, ships and airplanes, according to NORAD. The JLENS manufacturer, Raytheon Corp., says the system can provide radar coverage to an area the size of Texas. The agency is working with the FAA so the balloons won't impede air traffic, Kucharek said. The U.S. Army plans to launch two stationary "blimps" at 10,000-feet in the air next week to better protect the Washington, D.C. area from cruise missiles and other possible air attacks.
