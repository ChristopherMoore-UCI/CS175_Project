Brescia were ahead on 14 minutes as Caracciolo slipped the ball under home keeper Luca Castellazzi. -- Samuel Eto'o scored his 17th goal in 16 games but his controversial penalty could only salvage a 1-1 home draw for Italian champions Inter Milan against Brescia in the San Siro on Saturday. Inter came into the match off the back of a 3-1 reverse to Tottenham Hotspur and with coach Rafael Benitez having to shuffle his pack after injuries to key players. In other Serie A action on Saturday, Bologna moved out of the relegation zone with a 2-0 win over Lecce with Marco Di Vaio and Henry Gimenez scoring in the final six minutes. Milito shot over in injury time from a great position, but defeat would have been harsh on Brescia.
