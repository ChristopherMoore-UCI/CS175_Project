Intent on improving his record in golf's oldest major, McIlroy spent the weeks leading up to the tournament shaping his game on the links courses of his native Northern Ireland. Rickie Fowler tied McIlroy for the lead as the two-time major champion toiled amid the thick and unforgiving rough of Hoylake's 12th hole. This meant after a twilight finish on Friday, McIlroy barely had time to hit the gym and watch a movie, as he has done after both rounds so far, before he was due back at the course. First things first, play a good solid round tomorrow and if that means I'm going to Augusta with a bit of hype then so be it." A six-shot lead going into a final round that should see a return to the benign weather of the first two days means a third major of McIlroy's fledgling career is within touching distance.
