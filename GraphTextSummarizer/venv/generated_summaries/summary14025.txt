"A.J. Jacobs is my cousin, and I'm his cousin, and we are probably cousins," said Daniel Radcliffe of "Harry Potter" fame in a video for Jacobs' project. He and his wife did DNA testing using the site 23andMe.com and learned they are cousins -- not second or third cousins but distant cousins nonetheless. Tell your first and second and third cousins and beyond, because Jacobs is trying to break the Guinness Book of World Records when it comes to family reunions. The credit for learning about my new-found family connections goes to best-selling author A.J. Jacobs, the guy who lived life according to the Bible for a year for his book "The Year of Living Biblically" and tried every imaginable diet and workout for another book, "Drop Dead Healthy." His inspiration, he says, came from an email from a man who said he was Jacobs' 12th cousin.
