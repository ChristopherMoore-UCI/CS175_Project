Industrial growth saw the city's population grow by 5.3% per year in the 1970's and this rapid influx of new people living and working in the city called for new urban design and led to this innovative use of buses in their own infrastructure by the mayor and architect Jaime Lerner. Exclusive bus lanes dominate the center of roads, prepaid tickets prevent delays when boarding and raised platforms at bus stops make you level with the bus floor to get on. The lure is still faster travel but also convenience, with bus stops every 400 meters. Colour-coding of buses also makes it easier to know if you;re on the right track. This bus-based infrastructure is significantly cheaper to build than going underground like the metro systems seen in other cities such as London and New York.
