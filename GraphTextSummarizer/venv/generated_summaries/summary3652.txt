In the first film, thanks to the intercession of Rufus (George Carlin), the two travel through history and gather notables such as Napoleon, Genghis Khan and Abraham Lincoln, allowing them to breeze through. " Winter didn't say who would take the place of Carlin, who died in 2008, but told Yahoo there will be "many versions of ourselves in this movie." "(Bill and Ted) will be 40-something, and it's all about Bill and Ted grown up, or not grown up," Winter told Yahoo. in 1989's "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" and 1991's "Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey," said plans for the pair's third movie are coming along -- and Keanu Reeves, who played Ted "Theodore" Logan, is also on board. In the second film, the two face off against Death -- though, instead of playing him in a "Seventh Seal"-type chess match, the two choose to challenge Death to games of Battleship and Twister.
