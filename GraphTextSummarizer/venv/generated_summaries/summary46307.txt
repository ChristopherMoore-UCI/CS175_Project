Gettysburg anniversary provides a bigger story With soldiers' graves on the battlefield and near a former hospital site, Gettysburg residents pleaded with state officials to create what is now called the Soldiers' National Cemetery. "After watching it, I couldn't get enough of it and bought books and watched specials," said Kostic, 24, who lived in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, about 120 miles northeast of Gettysburg.
