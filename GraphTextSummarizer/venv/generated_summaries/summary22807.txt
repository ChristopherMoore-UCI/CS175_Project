-- The trial of Egypt's former President Hosni Mubarak will take place behind closed doors, Judge Ahmed Refaat announced Monday, citing "the public interest" as he barred television cameras from the court. Small crowds of Mubarak supporters clashed with opponents of the former Egyptian president Monday as he and his sons appeared at the court hearing. As during a court appearance earlier this month, the ailing leader was wheeled into court on a hospital gurney Monday. Crowds were smaller than during Mubarak's first court appearance last week. In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges.
