The city is constructing a new airport next to the existing one, and Mayor Carl Brewer told CNN it's projected to be completed in March 2015. Last year, Little Rock, Arkansas, officially renamed its airport after former President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, the former senator and secretary of state. " CNN learned about Wichita's new airport name from a tweet via CNN affiliate KWCH. -- Presidents John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton all have one. Federal Aviation Administration and other approvals are still required before the name change takes effect, said Brewer.
