" "They have defamed Martin, concocted false allegations and amplified racial stereotypes of young black men -- in effect, putting the victim on trial in the court of public opinion," the group said. Potok said the Martin case reminds him of what happened with Shirley Sherrod, the black Agriculture Department employee who was engulfed in controversy two years ago. The incident has created a "mob mentality," according to a commentary from William Bennett, a CNN contributor who served as secretary of education under President Reagan. He compared the slams at Sherrod to the doubt cast on Martin's character. Late blogger Andrew Breitbart posted an edited and incomplete video of a speech by Sherrod, making her appear to say she discriminated against a white farmer looking for assistance.
