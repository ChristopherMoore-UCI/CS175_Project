Authorities on Wednesday questioned a Haitian police officer who works at the Dominican Embassy about whether he provided illegal paperwork to Silsby and the other Americans to facilitate their efforts as alleged by interpreters who had translated for the Americans. The number of Haitian orphans taken to the United States -- those whose approval and paperwork had been in the bureaucratic pipeline at the time of the disaster -- stands at 578, with 44 others processed and awaiting transportation, said U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. Four hours later, Silsby and nine other Americans were turned back from the border. Isaac Adrien, Steve's brother and another of the interpreters, said the group came away from the meeting with a document from the embassy that the Americans took with them to the border Friday in their unsuccessful attempt to cross. iReport: How you can help A Haitian lawyer representing the Americans told reporters that the arrests themselves were illegal and that their clients had only been trying to help. Told earlier that many of the children had living parents, Silsby said, "I did not know that."
