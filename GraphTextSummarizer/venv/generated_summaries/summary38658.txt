When CNN spoke to former Danish international Michael Laudrup, who is now in charge of La Liga side Majorca, he pointed to the discrepancies between the riches of Barcelona, Real Madrid and the rest of Spanish football. -- Football officials and players will hold last minute talks Friday to avert a strike that could see the start of the Spanish football season postponed for the first time in 27 years. There has been almost universal support from players and coaches within the Spanish game. "We have made clear that all the players support the players' association," Barcelona striker David Villa told the Associated Press. Barcelona and Real Madrid will be the highest profile casualties of the postponement.
