They are now getting a new trial -- set to start in mid August, according to court authorities -- after developments stemming from conversations on a Facebook page for people who had lived in a Detroit neighborhood in past decades. The Wayne County prosecutors office declined to comment, though it can appeal the court's decision to overturn the past conviction, according to office spokeswoman Maria Miller. "I always believed that they were innocent," said the Highers brothers' aunt, Janet Hirth. Raymond and Thomas Highers, both 46, were sentenced to life in prison for the 1987 murder of a suspected Detroit drug dealer. In the affidavit, Hielscher said he hadn't come forward out of fear the real killers would come after him.
