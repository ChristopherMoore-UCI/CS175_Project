Yet even though a Texas court may have handed Boehner a face-saving lifeline by ruling Obama's actions unlawful and essentially stopping the presidential actions pending appeal, House Republicans appear undeterred, although Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday indicated Senate Republicans might be willing to offer some concessions. But one of DHS's fundamental roles has always been to work with states and localities in crises management, disaster relief funding, and emergency response training. February 28 marks the date when money for the Department of Homeland Security runs out as House Republicans hold the DHS's funding hostage to make an ideological point. As a result of this deadlock, you can increasingly expect to hear governors and mayors -- who actually run something -- to begin to push House Republicans to sign a clean funding bill that will keep DHS funded. And it is in these specific roles -- supporting state emergency management agencies, writing checks to localities and individuals who have suffered harm, and training hundreds of thousands of first-responders on how to protect their communities -- that the DHS standoff will surely be felt.
