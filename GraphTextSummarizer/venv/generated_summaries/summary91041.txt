Some 26% of UK's carbon emissions come from homes, making it a significant area for reducing emissions overall, according to UK Green Building Council and WWF. Of course, most people will not be living in new houses, so existing homes will also need to be made more energy efficient, according to Zoe Leader, sustainable homes policy adviser for WWF. Zero carbon homes will have no net carbon emissions over the course of a year. He added: "In the UK, we are doing small-scale privately funded developments, whereas in China we are being asked to design whole city extensions with thousands of homes." This will be a minimum requirement for homes to gain planning permission.
