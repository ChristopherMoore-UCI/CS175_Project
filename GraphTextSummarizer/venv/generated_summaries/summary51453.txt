" State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Wednesday that investigators know Frein "has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder." Frein is a survivalist with an extensive shooting background and a grudge against law enforcement, officials said. On Friday night, police had surrounded an area where suspect Eric Matthew Frein was believed to be hiding, Megliola said. Mohawk-style haircut Frein apparently cut his hair into a mohawk style before the attack on police and was active in a military simulation unit that reenacted Cold War-era European conflicts, officials said. Hundreds of law enforcement officers searched Saturday for the suspect in the slaying of a Pennsylvania state trooper -- hours after authorities appeared to be closing in on the self-taught survivalist and bursts of gunfire were heard near the man's home in the Poconos Mountains.
