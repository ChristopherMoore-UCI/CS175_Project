Paid family leave has been shown to dramatically increase breastfeeding, such as in California, where the introduction of paid family leave doubled the median duration of breastfeeding for new mothers who used it. One study of 19 developed countries found that paid parental leave had a significantly greater positive effect on productivity than unpaid leave. It increases productivity, reduces turnover costs, and results in health care savings. Paid family leave is associated with better health and lower health care costs. Paid leave helps retain employees and avoid turnover costs.
