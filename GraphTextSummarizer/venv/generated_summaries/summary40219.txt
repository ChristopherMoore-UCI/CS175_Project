"We're talking about (home) prices being 3 to 4% higher than last year, which most people don't believe because they're used to bad news," said Mike Orr, director of Arizona State University's Center of Real Estate Theory and Practice. "It's getting very, very tough to find a real bargain nowadays," said Mark Stapp, a Phoenix real estate developer who also teaches at the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at ASU's Carey School of Business. According to Orr's new report, the number of homes reverting to lenders in the Phoenix area is down 62% since January 2011. Look to a place where the housing collapse began: Phoenix, Arizona. Orr's new report on the Phoenix market shows a direct reverse of the situation that sparked a massive housing bubble.
