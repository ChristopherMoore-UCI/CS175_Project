" Indonesia's economy is one of Asia's fastest growing -- GDP grew there by 6.5% last years -- and Lion Air also announced another deal this week for a fleet of short-haul planes from ATR for its subsidiary, Wings Air. However, two thirds of that was down to Indonesian low-cost airline Lion Air formally sealing its deal for 230 next-generation Boeing 737s, first reported last year. "(These deals) shows a greater trend that developing countries are leading the world in demand (for new planes)," says Govindasamy. But on the same day that Air Australia went into administration stranding 4,000 passengers, there is some apprehension that the region could be blighted by airlines with too many planes and not enough passengers to fill them. Budget Indian airline Go Air joined the billion-dollar deal club by signing an agreement with engine maker Pratt Whitney, worth around $1 billion.
