Organized by the General Confederation of Labor union, the strike began on Tuesday morning, with Eiffel Tower employees pressing demands for better working conditions and more pay. As reported by the Wall Street Journal, the company that operates the 324-meter (1,063 feet) structure earlier stated that an agreement to end the strike had been reached with workers on Wednesday night. To the relief of thousands, normal Tower operations are set to resume on Thursday. After Wednesday negotiations, the Tower's management announced the reopening with a terse message on its official website. The union claims that one of the Tower's lifts still hasn't been renovated, as promised in 2008, leading to longer lines and impatient visitors.
