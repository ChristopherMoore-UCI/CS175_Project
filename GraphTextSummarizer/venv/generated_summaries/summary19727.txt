The 911 call was one of more than 400 before daybreak Monday that sent rescue crews through the floodwaters of Gwinnett County, a large suburban county northeast of Atlanta. She made her way through the pouring rain in her minivan and turned onto her cul-de-sac in suburban Atlanta. "There's really no words to describe it," said Gwinnett County police spokesman David Shiralli. Burciaga's death was one of at least nine in severe flooding that has shut down roads across north Georgia and caused gridlock on Atlanta's already congested highways. "We've lost a valued member of our family, and we will always remember her smile," said store manager Annette Gillespie.
