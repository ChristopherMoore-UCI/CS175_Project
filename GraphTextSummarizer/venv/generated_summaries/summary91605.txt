The match at the Yankee Stadium saw the home team run out 22-9 winners against the Oakland Athletics, with the Yankees hitting home runs with the bases loaded on three occasions. Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams were the last two players to record grand slams in the same game, during a trip to the Toronto Blue Jays on September 14 1999. The New York Yankees made Major League Baseball (MLB) history on Thursday when they became the first team to hit three grand slams in a single game. Robinson Cano, Curtis Granderson and Russell Martin were the three men on the plate to hit the grand slams for the Yankees -- who sit second in the Eastern Conference behind the Boston Red Sox. " Center-fielder Granderson connected with the hit which sealed the historic achievement, and the 30-year-old had to look at the stadium's scoreboard to be sure of what the Yankees had accomplished.
