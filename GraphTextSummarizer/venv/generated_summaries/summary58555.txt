"People tend to continue exercise if they feel it's approved by other people who are meaningful to them," said sports psychologist Jen Gapin. "One way that people gain self-confidence is when they see other people of similar ability doing things," said Gapin. Fogg said social features on fitness devices play three roles: They motivate people; the various interactions act as triggers for action; and sharing information and tips can increase ability. They collect all manner of data, tracking workouts so people can set goals and self-monitor their progress along the way. But publicly sharing workouts has real benefits, especially for people who are just getting into shape and are trying to stick to new behaviors.
