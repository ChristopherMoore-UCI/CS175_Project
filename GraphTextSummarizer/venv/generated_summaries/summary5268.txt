The 36-year-old artist is set to appear in an Atlanta court on January 29 on felony charges of battery, terroristic threats and false imprisonment, Flanagan said. Jeezy -- whose real name is Jay Wayne Jenkins -- was released on a $45,000 bond on Friday, hours after turning himself into the jail on a grand jury warrant, Fulton County, Georgia, sheriff's spokesman Tracy Flanagan said. His son told police the alleged incident at this Atlanta apartment in September 2012 "stemmed from a text message he sent to his father. " His father "walked into the bathroom where he was and slammed his head against the sliding shower door," then "picked him up and threw him into the wall in the bedroom," the police report said. Jeezy then "pulled him back into the room, threw him on the bed, choked him and stated 'I'll kill you," the son told police.
