The Hutaree militia members cleared of all charges are Tina Stone, 46; David Stone, Jr., 22, another son of the elder Stone; Thomas Piatek, 48; Michael Meeks, 40; and Kristopher Sickles, 29. "We are gratified that these felony convictions mean that these defendants will never be permitted to possess firearms again," said U.S. Attorney Barbara McQuade. David Stone, Sr., 47, and his son Joshua Stone, 23, members of the Hutaree Militia, face up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 after admitting to possessing illegal automatic firearms. "The court's order dismissing the more serious charges in this case was disappointing, but it does not shake our commitment to dismantling groups who would harm our citizens and law enforcement officers, and these efforts will continue," McQuade said. "We always said it was a First Amendment and Second Amendment case, and that's what it ended up being," added attorney Michael Rataj, whose client, Tina Stone, is the wife of the elder Stone.
