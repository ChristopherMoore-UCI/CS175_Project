House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday confirmed House Republicans are filing a lawsuit against Obama's executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrants here illegally. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration believes Obama was acting well within his power when he issued the order on deportations. " Boehner had told House Republicans of the planned lawsuit during their closed-door meeting on Tuesday. The move comes as House leadership struggles to round up support for a border security bill they planned to vote on this week, in part due to conservative opposition. "We believe that we acted within the full bounds of authority enshrined to the executive branch, and we'll be defending that." Boehner also defended his decision to invite Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the House in March, without letting the White House know in advance, a move that's drawn widespread criticism from even pro-Israel groups.
