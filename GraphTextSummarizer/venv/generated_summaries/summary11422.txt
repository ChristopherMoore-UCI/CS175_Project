Gbagbo had been expected to appear on state-run television, but the embattled president has not been seen in public for days and the TV network -- accused of having incited post-election violence -- went dark Friday after pro-Ouattara forces attacked the building and took control. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights reported Friday that the agency had received "unconfirmed but worrying reports" that Republican Forces have been committing human rights violations in their advance to Abidjan, especially in the Guiglo and Daloa areas in western Ivory Coast. Gbagbo's siege of the hotel ended Thursday after pro-Ouattara forces carried a nationwide offensive to Abidjan. The chances for that victory appeared slim Friday after pro-Ouattara forces launched a massive offensive in a final push to oust Gbagbo. Artillery and mortars joined the cacophony of gunfire Friday in Abidjan, the nation's commercial center and largest city, witnesses said.
