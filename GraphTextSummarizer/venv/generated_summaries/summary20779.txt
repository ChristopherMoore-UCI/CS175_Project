Teams before drivers Team orders have always existed in F1 because, in simple terms, teams also want to be happy -- and that often means making money. Who wants to watch races that have been massaged and manipulated by team orders? Taking the low road "I don't think there's the same respect now for other drivers," British racing legend Stirling Moss told CNN. Sebastian Vettel has been vilified for ignoring team orders and passing his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber in Malaysia to whisk the win from under the Australian's nose. Directly behind the dueling Red Bulls, the opposite scenario was playing out as Nico Rosberg reluctantly obeyed team orders not to overtake his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton for third place, even though the German appeared to have a quicker car.
