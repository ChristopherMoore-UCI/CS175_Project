Watch Josh Myers tell his story: "I need help" Â» "He was present when it happened," Myers said. " Sheriff's Deputy Josh Myers' wife and toddler daughter were killed; his son and baby daughter survived. Ella Kay, who was shot in the leg, will have surgery on Wednesday at a hospital in Pensacola, Florida, to remove the bullet or shrapnel that is near her femoral artery, Myers said. This is going to take a long time to work through it." Andrea Myers, 31, was holding Ella Kay and talking with her neighbors on their porch across the street when the gunman -- identified by police as Michael McLendon -- opened fire. Then, another urgent message: "We got notified on the radio that a trooper was chasing a suspect that had fired shots," Myers told reporters on Wednesday.
