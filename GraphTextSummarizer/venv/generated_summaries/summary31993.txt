Part of the problem with the international response to traveling foreign fighters is the lack of coordinated counterterrorism measures among countries, senior administration officials said. The Obama administration is confident a new binding resolution aimed at preventing and tracking the travel of foreign fighters will be adopted at this week's U.N. Security Council meeting. "It sends a very powerful signal that this is an item of the highest urgency," said a senior administration official, who described the danger posed by foreign fighters as "extremely worrying." The White House is planning an upcoming summit to confront the threat posed by foreign fighters inspired by ISIS, a senior administration official said Monday. The Countering Violent Extremism Summit would take place at the White House, senior administration officials said at a background briefing with reporters.
