The Airbus A380 is currently in service with Air France, China Southern Airlines, Emirates, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Qantas and Singapore Airlines. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders told CNN's Richard Quest last month that the cracks in the wing rib feet were "minor" and that safety was an "absolute priority." The European Aviation Safety Agency has ordered checks for cracks in the wings of the Airbus A380, though it has stopped short of grounding the fleet. He also said the fault was confined to the A380 and confirmed that it was not a wider problem on the Airbus range. It made its maiden flight in 2005 and first entered service with Singapore Airlines in 2007.
