Human Rights Watch says ISIS and other extremist groups "have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions." CNN's Abeer Salman contributed to this report. The ISIS video shows Musallam's Israeli passport and claims he's an agent sent to infiltrate the group. An Israeli Arab man who is shown being shot by a child in a recent ISIS video has no connections to Israeli intelligence, the country's defense minister said Wednesday. Musallam's family members said they believe he was coerced in the video, forced to lie about ties to Israeli intelligence. In the video released Tuesday, ISIS claims the man, 19-year-old Mohamed Said Ismail Musallam, is an Israeli spy.
