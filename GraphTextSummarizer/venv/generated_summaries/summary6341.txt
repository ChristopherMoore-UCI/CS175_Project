Other members of the Rohingya have allegedly been abandoned at sea after being rounded up by Thai authorities. CNN also interviewed a refugee who said he was one of the few that survived after his group of six rickety boats were towed back to sea and abandoned by Thai authorities in January. The government "categorically denied" media reports blaming Thai authorities for mistreating the illegal migrants, and intentionally damaging their boats. A recent CNN investigation found evidence that the Thai military towed hundreds of refugees into open waters only to abandon them. The Thai government maintains that "there are no reasonable grounds to believe" that the Rohingya are fleeing Myanmar out of fear of persecution.
