"We're meeting here today to chart the future of China-U.S. relations," Chinese President Xi Jinping said. "They both won't want to and won't be able to use this as leverage in a discussion," said Chris Johnson, China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. " Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pointed to China when he addressed cybersecurity threats, telling an audience of defense professionals in Singapore that the United States was concerned about "the growing threat of cyber intrusions, some of which appear to be tied to the Chinese government and military." In an annual support on Chinese military capabilities, the Pentagon echoed Hagel's claim, stating that recent cyber attacks in the United States appeared "to be attributable directly to Chinese government and military." "It is in the United States' interest that China continues on the path of success, because we believe that a peaceful and stable and prosperous china is not only good for Chinese but also good for the world and for the United States," he said.
