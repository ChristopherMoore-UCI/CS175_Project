-- A crew member aboard a U.S. Navy ship accidentally fired a machine gun into the Polish port city of Gdynia on Wednesday while cleaning the weapon, Navy officials said Friday. Polish military police boarded the ship to investigate, and Navy officials said the crew of the Ramage fully cooperated. No U.S. sailors were taken into custody by Polish authorities, Navy officials said. The gun, aboard the USS Ramage, a Navy destroyer, is used to defend the ship in close combat. There was no immediate word of a U.S. Navy investigation into the incident.
