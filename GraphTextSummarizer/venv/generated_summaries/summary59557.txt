-- Democratic Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy of New York -- who ran for office after a gunman killed her husband and injured her son -- is drafting legislation that would ban the sale of high-capacity gun ammunition magazines to civilians in the aftermath of the tragic shooting in Tucson, Arizona. Loughner is accused of opening fire outside a Tucson supermarket where Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, was meeting with constituents Saturday. Six states and the District of Columbia currently ban the sale of high-capacity gun magazines, according to the Brady Center: California, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. "What we're looking at is high-capacity magazines and nothing else," McCarthy Press Secretary Shams Tarek told CNN, explaining the legislation would be streamlined to maximize odds of passage. A prohibition on the sale of ammunition magazines containing more than 10 bullets was part of the federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004.
