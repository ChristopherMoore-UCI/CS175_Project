But she told CNN on Friday night that she learned that Duncan had Ebola "on the news." The Dallas County District Attorney's office said Friday that it is "looking into whether or not Thomas Eric Duncan knowingly and intentionally exposed the public to a deadly virus -- making this a criminal matter." Discussing this case, Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf told Canadian public broadcaster CBC, "The fact that he knew (he was exposed to the virus) and he left the country is unpardonable, quite frankly." "With the U.S. doing so much to help us fight Ebola, and again one of our compatriots didn't take due care, and so, he's gone there and ... put some Americans in a state of fear, and put them at some risk, and so I feel very saddened by that and very angry with him, to tell you the truth. But Tugbeh Chief Tugbeh, a community leader in Liberia, has said that Duncan was "a caretaker" for a woman who died from Ebola at a residence outside the capital of Monrovia. Because of these and other claims, Liberia Airport Authority officials say they may prosecute Duncan if he lied before leaving that West African nation. " Duncan's nephew on Friday strongly rejected such allegations, much like other relatives have in recent days.
