-- An Indonesian volcano has killed 240 people since it started erupting in October, officials said Saturday, a day after it spewed more hot ash and sent residents fleeing. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has called the volcanic eruptions a crisis situation. The president has announced that residents will receive compensation for livelihoods and animals lost to the eruptions. Over the weekend, he and several ministers visited the area to oversee relief efforts. On Friday, it spewed volcanic material for more than an hour.
