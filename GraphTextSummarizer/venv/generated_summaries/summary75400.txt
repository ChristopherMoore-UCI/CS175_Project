After attending Howard University and then the University of California Hastings College of the Law, Harris worked as a deputy district attorney in Alameda County, California, and then as an attorney in the San Francisco district attorney's and San Francisco city attorney's offices. On Friday, Harris joined the president at a Los Angeles rally at the University of Southern California, a day after he appeared at one of her fundraisers in Atherton, California. For her part, Harris said she would still enforce death penalty verdicts as attorney general. And two, I do believe that California voters still have a perception of a guy being stronger on the issues of law enforcement. Kamala Harris is the daughter of a father from Jamaica and a mother from India, and she's seeking to be the first black woman attorney general of California.
