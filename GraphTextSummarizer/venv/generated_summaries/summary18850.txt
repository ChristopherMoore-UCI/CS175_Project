I heard that piece of advice more than any other during the Fit Nation kickoff weekend. Some of that group has changed because I needed it to, but those who matter have weathered the changes with me and will always have my back no matter where life takes us. I've made new friends since the beginning of my journey. To maintain my active lifestyle I make sure I get a minimum of seven hours of sleep every night. The changes I've made and continue to make are permanent lifestyle investments in me and my ultimate goal of living the rest of my life as a healthy, happy, active adult.
