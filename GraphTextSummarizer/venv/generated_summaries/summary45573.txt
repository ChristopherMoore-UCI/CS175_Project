-- Two feet of snow has fallen in western New York and more is coming along the southern shore of Lake Erie from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, the National Weather Service said Monday. The latest lake-effect storm dropped 23 inches on Ellicottville, New York, 40 miles south of Buffalo, as of 10:15 a.m. Monday and 20 inches on nearby South Dayton. Rock salt to clear roads of ice was in short supply, CNN affiliate WKYC-TV reported, and authorities were looking for ways to stretch supplies to counteract escalating prices. An additional 6 inches of snow could come by evening, according to CNN affiliate WGRZ-TV in Buffalo. The area could expect as much as a foot of snow before Tuesday, WJET reported.
