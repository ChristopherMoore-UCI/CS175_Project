-- The leader of the Hezbollah movement in Lebanon says that Arab regimes have been confronted by popular protest because of their alliances with the United States and Israel. Hezbollah has turned on the U.N. Special Tribunal on Lebanon that is investigating the assassination, describing it as a tool of Israel and the United States. Besides its political strength, Hezbollah's militia numbers thousands of well-trained fighters and tens of thousands of rockets prepared for war with Israel. At the same time, tension is growing over the unveiling of indictments said to connect members of Hezbollah with the assassination of Rafik Hariri, Saad's father, in 2005. He has said he wants to form a national unity government -- and is seeking to accommodate Sunnis, Shi'ites and Christians in government as he negotiates the bewildering alliances between Lebanon's many parties.
