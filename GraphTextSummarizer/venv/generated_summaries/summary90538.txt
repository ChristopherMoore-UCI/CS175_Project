Online streaming, by which users listen to music either for free or for a monthly fee, is the fastest growing form of music listening, according to industry reports. The Recording Industry Association of America, in its annual report, said that while overall music sales were down in 2012, digital-music sales were up 14%, topping $4 billion. In its announcement of Daisy, Beats said the service would be released in late 2013 and "bring an emotional connection back to the act of music discovery. Spotify has made no bones about its desire to make even the Apple iTunes model for digital music obsolete. "Digital growth was driven by large increases in revenues through what can broadly be referred to as 'access models,' where users can choose to listen from large libraries of music rather than purchasing individual songs or albums," the report read.
