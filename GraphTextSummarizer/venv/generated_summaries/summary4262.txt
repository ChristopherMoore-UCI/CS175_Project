Perched on the western shores of the Bosphorus, the Kabatas Seagull Transportation Hub will enable new and improved connections for ferries, trains, buses and some small ships, says Ali Ulvi Altan, director of major projects for Hakan Kiran Architecture. Wheeling around the skies above the ferry boats and cargo ships, seagulls are as a familiar sight above the Bosphorus as the commuters and containers on it. The seagull was a natural choice for the design, says Altan, because the bird is the symbol of the Bosphorus. when [the hub is completed it will carry] around 90,000 persons per day by our estimates," Altan said. Work on the building is due to start next year, Altan says, and should be completed by 2015/16.
