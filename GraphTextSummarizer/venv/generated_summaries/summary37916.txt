In last year's season finale, the Man in Black convinced Ben to kill Jacob. Jacob has been tasked with guarding the white light for forever, and in this week's episode, Jack volunteered to take over the job -- which makes sense, as Jacob tells him that the light is near the bamboo field where he awoke in the show's first seconds. When Jack took over for Jacob, Jacob said Jack must "do what he couldn't -- kill him." So, uh, how is Jacob sitting around a campfire explaining to the candidates how he picked each of them because they had no ties, led miserable existences, and were alone in the world? Why was Claire able to give birth to Aaron and Jacob and the Man in Black's mother able to give birth to them -- but all other women on the island are unable to have babies?
