They include communications devices, such as hands-free phones, navigation equipment, such as GPS units, entertainment devices, such as DVD movie players, and information gathering devices, such as internet-enabled devices.

The technology advances are crucial selling points, especially for passenger cars, sport utilities, pickups and vans made by U.S. automakers. LaHood had met previously with car executives to express his overall concerns about distracted driving and to discuss ways to reduce it.
