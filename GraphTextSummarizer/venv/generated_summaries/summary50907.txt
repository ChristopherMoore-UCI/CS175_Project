Two letters to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson this week from Justice Department chastised Ferguson police over what officers were wearing -- and in some cases, not wearing. Jackson's interview with CNN came Thursday afternoon, shortly after the release of his video apology to Brown's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to Ferguson's streets to protest Brown's death. Ferguson has been marred by discord and distrust of authorities -- especially among those in its large African-American community -- since the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black teenager killed by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, who is white. Police chief tries to apologize Emotions spiked following an appearance by Chief Jackson late Thursday night to address the crowd and take questions from protesters. In that video, the chief expressed regret that it took investigating officers four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead.
