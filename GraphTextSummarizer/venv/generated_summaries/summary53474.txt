Also, Lebanese state-run news agency NNA reported that Syrian warplanes attacked sites in northern Lebanon. Syrian armed forces and border guards have thwarted "armed terrorist" infiltrators attempting to get into the Homs countryside from Lebanon, SANA said, citing a development first reported last week. The news outlet also reported gunshots fired at Syrian border checkpoints from Lebanon. "The aerial bombing carried out today by the armed forces of the Syrian regime on Lebanese territory, in the region of Ersal, is a new and serious violation of Lebanon's sovereignty," the statement said. Secretary of State John Kerry said Monday that the United States would not hamper the arming of Syrian rebels by allies.
