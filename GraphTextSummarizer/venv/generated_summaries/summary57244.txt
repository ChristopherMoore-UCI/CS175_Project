Without those healthy people, Obamacare could be in trouble, since an insurance pool only works well when healthy people, who pay premiums but use few services, are in it to help offset the costs of people like Lane and her daughter. "It's incredibly important to have young people in the (insurance) exchanges in the long term," said Caroline Pearson, a vice president at Avalere Health, a healthcare strategy group. Official: Obamacare website 'fixable' by end of November "Is that perception of this flawed website going to stick with the public, or is it something that can be gotten over?" asked Michael Perry, a partner at PerryUndem, which does surveying and marketing to young people about health care. But Lane kept with it because she needs insurance -- badly. But some worry that even then, the website will have been branded as problematic and time-consuming, and some healthy people will prefer to pay the fine for being uninsured, which in many cases is significantly lower than the cost of buying insurance.
