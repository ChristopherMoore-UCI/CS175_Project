The world number one duly beat Ivan Dodig of Croatia 6-3 6-3 to earn a last eight clash against fellow Nicolas Almagro. In other third round matches, 12th seed Marin Cilic of Croatia beat Spanish fifth seed Tommy Robredo 7-5 6-7 7-6, while Colombia's Santiago Giraldo saw off Dominic Thiem of Austria in another three-setter. Fellow Spaniard Almagro lost to Nadal in last year's final but earned his passage with a 6-3 6-3 success over Fernando Verdasco in another domestic clash. It was second seed Ferrer who scored a rare win over his compatriot in Monte Carlo but he was unable to repeat this form against Gabashvili, who then secured his place in the last eight with a straight sets win over Inigo Cervantes. Sharapova, who needs to reach the last four in the WTA Premier Level event to retain her top 10 status, must next play top seed Agnieszka Radwanska, a tough task as she acknowledged.
