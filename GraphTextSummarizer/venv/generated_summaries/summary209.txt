In the arena which bears his name, Rod Laver -- a former world No. 1 and winner of 11 grand slam singles titles -- returned to the court. "Hitting with Rod Laver for me clearly is an absolute dream come true," Federer, who will be bidding for a fifth Australian Open over the next fortnight, told reporters. While Federer will be competing for a winner's check $2.3 million winner's check at Melbourne Park, Laver earned a comparatively modest $1.5 million during his glittering 13-year career. But ahead of a charity match against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Melbourne, the 17-time grand slam winner played second fiddle to a bona fide Australian sporting great. For Federer it was an opportunity to hit with his hero, even if Laver isn't the athlete he once was.
