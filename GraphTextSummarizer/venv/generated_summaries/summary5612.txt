Tsvangirai, Zimbabwe's main opposition leader, took office last month under a power-sharing deal with Mugabe following a contentious election. "President Mugabe has a history of strange car accidents when someone lo and behold dies -- it's sort of his M.O., of how they get rid of people they don't like." Members of his political party, the Movement for Democratic Change, and former U.S. diplomat also say the crash raises suspicions of foul play. McDonald cited the car crash deaths of Defense Minister Moven Mahachi in 2001, Employment Minister Border Gezi in 1999 and Elliot Manyika, a government minister and former regional governor, last year. It comes only weeks after the start of a power-sharing agreement between Tsvangirai and his political rival, President Robert Mugabe.
