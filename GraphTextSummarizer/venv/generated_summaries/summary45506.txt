In an address to the Delhi Sustainable Development Summit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, "We cannot continue with a global development model in which some countries continue to maintain high carbon emissions, while the development options available for developing countries get constrained."

At the time, she stressed the need for individuals to make changes, however small, to contribute to the global effort to reverse climate change. " Mehra's not only on a tight timetable today -- the way she sees it she has just two years to change the Indian government's position on climate change.
