However, children can be missing for a wide variety of reasons (e.g., runaway, lost or injured, benign episode, family abduction) other than nonfamily abduction. The danger of sexual victimization of children comes predominantly from family members and acquaintances, not strangers. In addition, sexually motivated nonfamily abduction is probably the only aspect of sexual victimization of children that people think occurs more often than it actually does. I am aware of no research that indicates that children today are any more likely to be abducted by sexual predators than they were 50 years ago. When I joined the FBI in 1970 and someone talked about child abduction, you immediately assumed it was a ransom-motivated case.
