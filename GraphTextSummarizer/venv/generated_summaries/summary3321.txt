"We anticipate that within the next five years, patients suffering from degenerative diseases will be treated -- if not cured -- using technology introduced by Dr. Campbell," the university quoted him as saying. "All these scientific breakthroughs Professor Campbell gave us did not happen by chance; they are the product of years of study, hands-on experimentation and above all, a deep love for science. While Campbell is not listed in research papers as the principal investigator in papers related to Dolly's cloning, the man who is -- Ian Wilmut -- told The Telegraph newspaper in 2009 that Campbell deserved much of the credit for the feat. Campbell, 58, died on October 5, according to a university statement released Thursday. Jose Cibelli, a Michigan State University researcher, said Campbell's work has led directly to treatments that will soon be saving lives around the world.
