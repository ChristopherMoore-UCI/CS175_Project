Well, we started the festival in a place called Congo Square, which is very ironically historical because that was the birth of African music in the North American continent and really the birth of the beat that became everything else we know in American music. Now 40 years later, New Orleans music is at the forefront. Davis: An interesting thing about the evolution of this festival, being that it's 88 percent New Orleans music. We have three generations of festival-goers and now three generations of musicians and cooks whose grandkids are coming out here and playing music. And that was a great time in music, 40 years ago.
