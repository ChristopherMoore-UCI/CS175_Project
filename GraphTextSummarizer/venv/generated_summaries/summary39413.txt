One of those people is Phil Libin, CEO of Evernote, a service that allows users to archive images, documents and other data. "They're planning for thousands of years," he said. But as we increasingly rely on digital services as a repository for our life stories, is there any guarantee that we will be able to access them in years to come? Libin says his company is taking cues from the Long Now Foundation, a private organization that is examining ways to preserve data for centuries as part of its broader efforts to promote debate over humankind's distant legacy. Kevin Systrom, co-founder of photo sharing site Instagram, said this week he wants to give his users better access to their older images.
