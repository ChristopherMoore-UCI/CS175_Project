"In the last two years, the software used to create the Mariposa botnet was sold to hundreds of other criminals, making it one of the most notorious in the world," said FBI Director Robert Mueller. Botnets are a network of computers infected with a malicious kind of robot software which allow remote access, often without the owner's knowledge. The FBI said in a news statement a 23-year-old Slovene known as "Iserdo" was arrested last week for his role in a cyber scam that stole passwords from websites and financial institutions. It was designed to steal computer users' credit card and bank information, launch a denial of service attacks and spread viruses. The significant arrest comes about five months after Spanish authorities arrested three suspected Mariposa botnet operators.
