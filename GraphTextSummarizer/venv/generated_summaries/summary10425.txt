The editors of Rupert Murdoch's News of the World tabloid knew that their reporters were hacking phones in search of stories, former News of the World journalist Paul McMullan testified Tuesday. Police investigating phone hacking by journalists say that about 5,800 people, including celebrities, crime victims, politicians and members of the royal family, were targets of the practice by journalists in search of stories. Mulcaire went to prison for hacking royal staff voice mails along with News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman. Coulson has always denied knowing about phone hacking, saying he quit the paper because he was ultimately responsible for the actions of his staff. McMullan said phone hacking was widespread at the tabloid and described being caught out himself while trying to hack David Beckham's phone.
