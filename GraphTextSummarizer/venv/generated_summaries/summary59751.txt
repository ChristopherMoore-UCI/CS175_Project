Both carded final rounds of 66 to achieve their wins, McIlroy by a shot from Ireland's Shane Lowry at the European PGA Championships, while Aussie Scott had to go to extra holes to beat Jason Dufner. -- Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott showed they were rolling into top form ahead of next month's U.S. Open with impressive victories on either side of the Atlantic Sunday. McIlroy put his personal difficulties behind him -- he broke off his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki earlier in the week -- to win the European Tour's flagship event at Wentworth, while Scott lived up to his billing as the new world number one with a playoff success in the Colonial event in Texas. Scott and 2013 PGA Championship winner Dufner will also be hoping to carry their fine weekend form into the second major of the season in search of their own second triumph at golf's highest level. The 25-year-old McIlroy also trailed for much of the four rounds on the famous West Course, being seven shots behind tournament leader Thomas Bjorn going into the final round.
