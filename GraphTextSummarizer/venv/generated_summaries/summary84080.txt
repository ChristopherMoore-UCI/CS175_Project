Lunden, who co-hosted "GMA" from 1980 to 1997 and promotes health and wellness for women, said she "jumped into action," immediately consulted specialists and sought other opinions before starting with chemotherapy. Lunden told CNN that she decided to shave her hair before losing it to chemotherapy, enabling her to "stay in an empowered position instead of  woe-is-me patient position." " Lunden said her tumor was picked up after an ultrasound, which is used for women who have dense fibrous breast tissue where cancers are not always detectible on mammograms. "Most women do not have any symptoms before they're diagnosed with breast cancer," Dr. Valerie Montgomery-Rice, dean of the Morehouse School of Medicine, told CNN. "GMA" co-host Amy Robach is currently being treated for breast cancer.
