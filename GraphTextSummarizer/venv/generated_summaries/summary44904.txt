Abdul-Jabbar, in a column for the website of Time magazine last week, said he was looking forward to the day when "these terrorists praising the Prophet (Mohammed) or Allah's name as they debase their actual teachings are instantly recognized as thugs disguising themselves as Muslims." "Most Muslims do not become Muslims to indulge in murder and mayhem," Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the leading point scorer in NBA history, told CNN's World Sport on Wednesday. " Abdul-Jabbar -- also a best-selling author who was in London promoting a pair of new books including a fictional work about Sherlock Holmes' brother -- was speaking a week after brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi killed 12 people at the French satirical magazine. "When you spend all of your time trying to develop the talent for a sport and you see people doing the same thing from a different culture and you have the same interests, there's common ground there. But nothing justifies that." As someone who was in the public eye through sports, Abdul-Jabbar feels sports can play a role in bringing people from different backgrounds together.
