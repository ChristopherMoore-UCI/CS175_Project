Fewer than 1 percent of babies are born at less than 28 weeks, according to the March of Dimes, a nonprofit organization aimed at reducing premature births, birth defects and infant mortality. It claims that clinic records were falsified to say only that Williams underwent an abortion. Williams' lawsuit seeks damages from Renelique, the clinic and its staff. The baby's mother, Sycloria Williams, sued Renelique, the clinic and its staff in January, seeking damages. "Dr. Renelique's failure to practice medicine with that level of care, skill and treatment that is recognized as being acceptable, as well as his willingness to falsify medical records, poses a serious and immediate danger to the public," the health department said.
