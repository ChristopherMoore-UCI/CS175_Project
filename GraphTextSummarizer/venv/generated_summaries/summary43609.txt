Victoria's Secret is synonymous with sultry femininity, and if Carmen Carrera had her way, that would include transgendered women as well. " "It's difficult for people (who) don't know trans men and women to wrap their head around the whole thing," Campbell said. "If trans people are going to make any strides in society it shouldn't be forced, but if anyone can make it as a Victoria's Secret model it's Carmen. The Change.org petition, which calls Carrera "a force to be reckoned with," says such a move by Victoria's Secret would "show the entire community that they embrace trans patrons." "That's why it's so important that more trans people have a chance to tell their stories and, as is the case with Carmen, to give a face ... to the trans movement."
