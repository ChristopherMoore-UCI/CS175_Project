The group is working in coordination with the Philippines' government -- which requested the assistance -- as well as international and non-governmental organizations plus other U.S. agencies, such as the Department of Defense. Much of this support will be directed to the same place -- including hard-hit places like Palo and Tacloban -- where, just under 70 years ago, U.S. Gen. Douglas MacArthur led allied troops back to then battle-scarred Philippines. The island nation had been under U.S. sovereignty -- with the exception of the three years it was occupied by the Japanese during World War II -- since the Spanish-American War's end in 1898. The U.S. government had pledged an array of support from monetary aid to search-and-rescue missions in the Philippines, helping its longtime ally recover from a massive, devastating typhoon. This initial grant follows a disaster declaration by Acting U.S. Ambassador Brian Goldbeck, as the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines notes on its website.
