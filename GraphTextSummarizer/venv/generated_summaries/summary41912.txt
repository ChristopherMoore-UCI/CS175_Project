"When cases emerge involving famous persons," Freire told the official Agencia Brasil, "that's when society becomes aware of what is not being printed... that women are violated, subjugated daily through inequality. Freire said that a law allowing gender-based crimes against women to be judged in special courts should have been respected in the Samudio case. " Freire said studies show that most women are victimized by men they knew well. Several other high-profile murders committed against women have gained national attention. Last week, Brazilians were shocked by the details emerging from the case of Flamengo goalkeeper Bruno Fernandes Das Dores de Souza, who is accused of overseeing the kidnapping and dismembering of former lover Eliza Samudio, with whom he fathered a child.
