Since then, LRA attacks have killed 2,400 people and displaced 465,000, according to Resolve Uganda, a nonprofit group that monitors LRA activity. -- The Lord's Resistance Army slammed "Kony 2012" as a "clear act of malevolent deception and manipulation of world mass consciousness" in an 18-page statement believed to be its first response to the viral video spotlighting the renegade group and its leader, warlord Joseph Kony. "Behind 'Kony 2012' lurks the U.S.A., which is not a 'banana republic' state, but a world hegemonic power that runs a vast global network of war, intelligence and security institutions, and a myriad of their humanitarian front and service organizations," said the statement signed by Justine Labeja, a spokesman for Kony's organization known commonly by its acronym, LRA. He said it was sent to him from LRA representatives in Nairobi, Kenya, who have been quoted in international news media. "In effect, 'Kony 2012,' whose falsehoods have now boomeranged on one of its authors and purveyors, a Mr. Jason Russell, constitute(s) the biggest ruse and the most sordid 'open air' 'sleight of the hand' act that has ever been used to deceive the gullible and the uninformed in the world," the LRA statement said. " It accused Invisible Children co-founder Jason Russell, who directed video, of sanitizing the acts of the Ugandan military.
