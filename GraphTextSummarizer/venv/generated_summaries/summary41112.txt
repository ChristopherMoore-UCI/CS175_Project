-- As record oil prices dominate the headlines, natural gas is an energy sector gaining more recognition. (JD): There is a lot of political pressure now, or calls from Washington and the European Union for OPEC to provide more oil, more energy to the global market. MME's John Defterios (JD) talks with the CEO of Dolphin Energy, Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh (AS) about the importance of the natural gas sector, the impact of high oil prices, and increasing global energy demand. (AS): The reserves in the Middle East are there and the commitment from the governments in the Middle East to produce those reserves, existing production and extract production is there. Al Sayegh is head of the largest single energy initiative in the Middle East, linking the three Gulf states of Qatar, U.A.E. and Oman, and producing two billion cubic feet of gas a day, equivalent to 350,000 barrels of oil.
