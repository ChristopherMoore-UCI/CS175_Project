Michael Woodford, the whistleblowing ex-chief executive of Olympus, will seek up to $60m of compensation from his former company at an employment tribunal hearing scheduled to start on Monday in east London. Mr Woodford initially campaigned to be reinstated as chief executive, before announcing plans to take legal action against Olympus in January. If unsuccessful, Mr Woodford could sue for defamation in the High Court of England and Wales, or launch proceedings against Olympus for breach of contract in Japan. Mr Woodford's removal from his job came after he raised concerns that eventually led to the exposure of a Â¥130bn ($1.6bn) accounting scandal at the Japanese maker of optical equipment. The British executive is claiming unfair dismissal and discrimination after he was sacked just two weeks after becoming chief executive in October.
