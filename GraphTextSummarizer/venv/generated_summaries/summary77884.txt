"Al-Bashir is an international fugitive wanted on charges of genocide and other heinous crimes committed in Darfur," said Elise Keppler, international justice senior counsel at Human Rights Watch. "The Court is a valuable instrument of the international community to ensure that there is no impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern; genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes must not go unpunished and their prosecution must be ensured by measures at both domestic and international level." The court issued a warrant for al-Bashir for alleged crimes in the troubled region of Darfur in March, 2009. Malawi welcomed Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for a regional trade meeting Thursday over the objections of the International Criminal Court and human rights activists. Al-Bashir is wanted by the court in The Hague, Netherlands, for alleged war crimes.
