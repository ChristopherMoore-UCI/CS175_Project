The two journalists' deaths come less than a week after New York Times reporter Anthony Shadid, a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, died in Syria apparently of an asthma attack. "So, we posted the story on a private Facebook page for journalists, and another journalist commented that he was relieved that she had already left Homs. CNN's Hala Gorani, who reported from Syria last summer on a government-sanctioned trip, later wrote about the dangers journalists faced. " With daily reports of civilian fatalities in Syria, some critics may question the amount of attention focused on the deaths of a couple of Western journalists. We know the cost of unreliable government information." Currently, CNN and other media outlets often cannot independently verify opposition or government reports because the Syrian regime has severely limited access to the country by foreign journalists.
