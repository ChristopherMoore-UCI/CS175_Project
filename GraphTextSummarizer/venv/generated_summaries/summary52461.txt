There have been countless attempts by daredevils to ride down both parts of Niagara Falls -- the American Falls on the U.S. side and Horseshoe Falls on the Canadian side. "I was so close to the water, I could reach out and stick my ice tool in the Niagara Falls," Gadd told redbull.com. The Canadian ice climber used only ice hooks to scale the frozen cliffs at Terrapin Point, a 147-foot section directly next to Horseshoe Falls. But on a cold, freezing day in late January, the wall of water is a wall of ice -- the icing is so heavy that the area is closed to tourists during the winter months -- a perfect scenario for Gadd. Most visitors to Niagara Falls consider it a place for romance.
