And our family has formed a foundation as an avenue to pay forward the love and the care that we continue to receive." Because of the work of the JAYC Foundation, which aims to help families recovering from abduction and the aftermath of other traumatic events, Dugard and her mother received "Hope Awards" from the center at Tuesday night's dinner. Three girls are alive," Terry Probyn said, speaking at a National Center for Missing & Exploited Children awards gala in Washington. The event was scheduled long before Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were found alive in Cleveland. Nearly four years ago, Probyn lived through a similar struggle when she reunited with her daughter, Dugard, who was freed in 2009 after 18 years of captivity behind the home of a California couple. But the timing made Tuesday's award ceremony even more special, Dugard told the crowd.
