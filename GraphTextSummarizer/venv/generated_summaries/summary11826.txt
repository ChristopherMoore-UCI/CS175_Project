-- After being lampooned on social media for delaying the start of a debate because his opponent used a fan, Florida Gov. Rick Scott tried to bring the race back to the real issue at stake: Why did former Gov. Charlie Crist need a fan in the first place? Update: An earlier version of this story misstated how many jobs Gov. Rick Scott said were lost in Florida while Crist was governor. That could have actually been a solution to the standoff, because Scott's protest flamed over Crist's apparent disregard for debate rules that banned electronic devices from the stage. Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, stood on stage alone Wednesday night for the first seven minutes. Scott held up the Florida gubernatorial debate on Wednesday for seven minutes after his Democratic rival showed up with an electric fan under his podium.
