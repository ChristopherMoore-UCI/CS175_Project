-- Republican leaders will propose cutting more spending to balance the amount of additional disaster relief money in a short-term government spending measure defeated earlier by the House, two Republican sources told CNN on Thursday. In addition, House Republican leaders insist that the $1 billion in immediate disaster funding be offset with $1.5 billion in cuts to a loan program that helps automakers retool their operations to make more fuel-efficient cars. Speaking before news of the additional offset provision added by House Republicans, Reid proclaimed himself "cautiously optimistic" an agreement would be reached. " If House Republicans "expect our votes, they have to work with us," he said. The House measure included a total of $3.6 billion in disaster relief money -- $1 billion in emergency funds available when the bill is enacted and another $2.6 billion to be budgeted for those federal response agencies for the 2012 fiscal year that begins October 1.
