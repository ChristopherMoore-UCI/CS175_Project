Instead, food allergies were considered vague and very mysterious, and hardly anyone was prepared for allergic reactions to foods. Currently, there is no cure for food allergies, so early recognition and management of allergic reactions are important measures to prevent serious health consequences. Understanding the types of reactions your child has to certain foods, the timing of eating the food in relationship to these reactions, your child's personal history and the family history: all of these components are critical to helping develop a successful food allergy survival lifestyle. I also have personal experience with food allergies. Three decades ago, when I was a young person, the outlook on food allergy within the community at large was vastly different than it is now.
