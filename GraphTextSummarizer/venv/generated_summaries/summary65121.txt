The Real Madrid striker dipped a trademark free-kick narrowly over the bar as Portugal inched closer and seven minutes from time his effort from similar range was handled in the wall by Arbeloa, only for Ronaldo to fire over again from 10 yards closer in. In a game of few chances, Portugal worked hard to edge much of it but their pressing tactics started to backfire in extra-time as tiredness increasingly became a factor. It was a heroic piece of goalkeeping and Patricio also brilliantly kept out Navas in extra time, then Alonso from the spot before Portugal's resistance finally cracked -- with Ronaldo a frustrated spectator. Bizarrely, Portugal's key man Cristiano Ronaldo never even got to take a spot kick as he was saved for Portugal's final penalty, a tactic that backfired horribly. Instead, as extra-time progressed, Portugal's earlier pressing caught up with them as Spain's patience started to pay dividends.
