A recent study published in the journal Current Biology finds that Korean eunuchs â€” castrated men â€” lived 14 to 19 years longer than other men, suggesting that male sex hormones play a role in life span. But while animal studies have suggested that castration (which removes the testes, the source of male hormones) results in longer lives, studies in humans have been spotty. Don't try caloric restriction "Our study supports the idea that male sex hormones decrease the lifespan of men," the authors write.

The current incidence of centenarians is 1 per 3,500 people in Japan, and 1 per 4,400 people in the United States, for instance; thus, the incidence of centenarians among Korean eunuchs was at least 130 times higher than that of present-day developed countries, according to the paper.
