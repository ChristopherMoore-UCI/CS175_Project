The new Undercover Tourist app made for savvy Walt Disney World-goers delivers accurate wait times for every ride in the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom. From skipping long lines at Walt Disney World to blending in with the locals on any adventure, smartphone travel apps can keep just about any obstacle from hindering your trip. More than 99,000 restrooms are represented (concentrated in larger cities in the U.S. and Europe), with details like hours, changing-table availability, and, of course, a "sit" or "squat" recommendation. Then use the brand's dedicated guides (for over 75 cities) to hunt for specifics, like how to get a bus pass for the MUNI in San Francisco or when to catch the ferry for a visit to Alcatraz. Goby has you covered: The app searches events and activities near you -- live-music shows, family-friendly outings and outdoorsy pursuits -- and plots them on a map with details and photos.
