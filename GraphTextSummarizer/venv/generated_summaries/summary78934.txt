"In response to these attacks on their people, the leaders of Israel have launched military operations on Hamas positions in Gaza," Bush says. -- U.S. President Bush laid the blame for recent fighting in Gaza squarely at the feet of Hamas, accusing militants of waging a campaign of violence against Israel with little regard for its people. But Bush does not directly mention the toll that the airstrikes have taken in the address, again blaming conditions in Gaza on Hamas, which has repeatedly called for the destruction of Israel. President Bush, pictured in December, says Hamas "has no intention of serving the Palestinian people." "Since Hamas' violent takeover in the summer of 2007, living conditions have worsened for Palestinians in Gaza," Bush says in prepared remarks released Friday by the White House. Rice said Friday that a "durable and sustainable" cease-fire was needed to end the violence in Gaza and in southern Israel.
