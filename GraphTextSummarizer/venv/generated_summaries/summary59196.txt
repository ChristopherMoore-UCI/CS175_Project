That was a decade ago, when Peter Hughes was one of many Australian vacationers in the Indonesian island resort of Kuta. Thursday, Hughes awaited news of the fate of Umar Patek, an Indonesian man accused of assembling the bombs used in the 2002 Bali attacks. When it was announced that Patek will serve 20 years in jail, Hughes was disappointed. Hughes wished the same sentence for Patek. At least the court found Patek guilty, Hughes said.
