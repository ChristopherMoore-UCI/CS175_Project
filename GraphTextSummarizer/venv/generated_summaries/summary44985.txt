So, as a role model, to take little kids wearing your jerseys and playing video games of you, do you take that seriously? The NBA's Dwyane Wade started a foundation to help inspire kids in at-risk situations. And my main thing is like, when I go out and talk to kids or I do different events through my foundation, I just want to change one person's thought in that room. With the steroids controversy in baseball and drug allegations against the world's greatest swimmer, many adoring fans may wonder, "Where are the good guys in sports?" Dwyane Wade of the Miami Heat is one of those good guys. And it's something that a lot of kids dream of.
