This is when you need to hit the Toei Kyoto Studio Park -- or Toei Uzumasa Eigamura -- and spend an afternoon geeking out on some of the most familiar icons of Japanese pop culture, from samurais and geisha to "Dragon Ball" and "Sailor Moon." In addition to Toei's dozens of film-related displays, the park has live ninja and samurai shows, a Haunted House, Ninja Mystery House, Trick Art Museum, 3D theater, maze of illusions, science museum, indoor kids play areas and a lovely Japanese "ukiyo-e" woodcut print gallery. Toei Kyoto Studio Park has multiple restaurants throughout, which serve Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisine. Next, bearing in mind the words of author Jarius Raphel -- "Ninjas don't wish upon a star, they throw them" -- I eagerly hit the Ninja Mystery House, where staff conducted a quick primer on the history of the cloaked assassins' residences before setting me free to get out of a fun maze of false walls and doors.
