On his website, Flynn had said that becoming a novelist was an unusual choice because he had been diagnosed with dyslexia as a child, and struggled with reading and writing. He listed his influences as Ernest Hemingway, Robert Ludlum, Tom Clancy, J.R.R. Tolkien, Gore Vidal and John Irving. "Flynn's novels have been praised for their extensive research and prescient warnings about the rise of Islamic Radical Fundamentalism and terrorism," Simon & Schuster said in a statement. Flynn had planned on becoming Marine Corps aviator in the early 1990s, but he was medically disqualified before entering the program, his publisher, Simon & Schuster, said. All but one of his novels feature counterterrorism operative Mitch Rapp.
