It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law, she says, "will strengthen informed consent and bring abortion closer to standards that are set for other surgical procedures. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.
