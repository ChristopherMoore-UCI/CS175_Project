The ruling late Friday by U.S. District Court Judge Clark Waddoups threw out  the law's section prohibiting "cohabitation," saying it violates constitutional guarantees of due process and religious freedom. "This is what happens when marriage becomes about the emotional and sexual wants of adults, divorced from the needs of children for a mother and a father committed to each other for life," said Russell Moore, of the Southern Baptist Convention. Sadly, when marriage is elastic enough to mean anything, in due time it comes to mean nothing." A federal judge in Utah has struck down part of that state's law banning polygamy, after a lawsuit was brought by the stars of the television reality series "Sister Wives." The 91-page decision comes months after the Supreme Court struck down a separate federal law that defined marriage as between only one man and one woman, a major legal, political, and social victory for homosexual couples seeking recognition of their same-sex unions.
