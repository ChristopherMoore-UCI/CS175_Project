In the statement Friday, the medical examiner's office declared the manner of death in the Singleton case as homicide caused by the "physical restraint by police during excited delirium due to acute phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication," said Julie Bolcer, spokeswoman for the medical examiner. Singleton, who was African-American, was taken into police custody after a yellow cab driver flagged down a police officer near St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, police said in a statement. Ronald Singleton, 45, died in police custody on July 13, four days before a man in Staten Island died after police put him in a choke hold, a case that sparked national outrage. The cause of Garner's death was "compression of neck (choke hold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police," according to Bolcer. Garner's death occurred just weeks before Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot to death by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9.
