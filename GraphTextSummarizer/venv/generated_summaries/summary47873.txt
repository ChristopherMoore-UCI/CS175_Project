" North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil' Kirby, a retired Australian judge, said he has read through North Korea's report on human rights and said some statements could be viewed as "fair comment," such as criticism of the United States and other countries for their own human rights records. The United Nations chairman investigating human rights in North Korea said the leaders in the country, including Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un, must be held accountable for crimes against humanity and urged the Security Council to bring perpetrators to the International Criminal Court. Before introducing two witnesses from North Korea, Kirby told the audience to judge for themselves if they are "human scum" or witnesses trying to share their story. " North Korea: We have the 'most advantageous human rights system' Kim Song, adviser for political affairs at the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's mission to the United Nations, denounced the U.N. report as "groundless," saying investigators only talked with defectors of a "negative disposition." He then cited his report on human rights in the country, originally issued in March 2014 to the United Nations, that chronicled crimes against humanity in prison camps and ordinary prisons, crimes that targeted religious believers and starvation of citizens, among other crimes.
