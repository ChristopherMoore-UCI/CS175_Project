This time the guards enter, making awful honking noises, like wild animals. I'm in a sort of cinema room, where I have to watch videos of other prisoners being abused. They make me stand and salute the American flag. The dirty and sadistic methods I endured -- which were then taken directly to Abu Ghraib -- achieved nothing, except to shame that American flag hanging in the prison corridor, which I was made to salute. Or the fear that comes when you realize that no one is coming to help; that the life, family and friends you knew are all far, far away.
