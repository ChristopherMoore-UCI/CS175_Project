-- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts "full responsibility" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday. But the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at "an astounding rate" during his tenure as governor. "Between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10Â½ years I was governor," Huckabee said Tuesday. On Sunday, Huckabee's office issued a statement saying that if Clemmons was "found responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state. " One survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas.
