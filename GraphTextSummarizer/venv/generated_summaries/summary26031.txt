There's been growing support for NCAA reform, mostly because of former UCLA basketball player Ed O'Bannon suing the NCAA for rights to his own likeness. It would put the athletes in a position to bargain, to demand things that college athletes have never had before -- like stipends, continuing medical coverage after graduation, more concussion testing and even a portion of the profits of the multibillion dollar windfall created by college football and basketball. Huma said most people don't know that the NCAA doesn't even mandate that colleges cover the cost of medical expenses for current players, and there's no help at all for former ones. "These guys at Northwestern are really an inspiration, not just to other football and basketball players and athletes, but these are young men standing together, 70 to 80 guys and they're taking on a multibillion industry because they know it's the right thing to do," said Ramogi Huma, president of the NCPA, which last season organized the All Players United wristband protest in support of NCAA reform at Georgia Tech, Northwestern and the University of Georgia. The 21-year-old quarterback, soon to graduate with a degree in psychology, is taking the day off from training for the NFL draft to take the stand at a National Labor Relations Board hearing today and testify against his own university and on behalf of fellow football players.
