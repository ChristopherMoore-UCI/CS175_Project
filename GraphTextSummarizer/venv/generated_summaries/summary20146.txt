Facing persecution and hardship in the old country, Vietnamese refugees braved the perilous seas aboard small fishing boats to seek freedom. Along with other Vietnamese immigrants and refugees of the time, stories of successes and heartbreaks quickly spread around the community. It has been 35 years since the first wave of Vietnamese refugees landed on American soil. The lucky ones who were able to land somewhere would face cold rejections by a world grown tired of having to deal with refugee problems. Many lost their lives to piracy, storm and starvation.
