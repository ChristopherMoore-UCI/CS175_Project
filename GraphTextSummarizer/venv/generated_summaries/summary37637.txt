"(T)he Spotify Play Button is a simple yet extremely powerful music widget that makes it easier than ever to deliver all the world's music to fans of your website or blog," Spotify spokesman Diego Planas Rego wrote on the streaming service's blog. Spotify also partnered with websites, including Virgin Media, New Music Express, Mashable, The Guardian and Rolling Stone, which will display buttons letting visitors listen to music while on those sites. While the tool can be used across all types of blogs and sites, Tumblr announced that it has partnered with Spotify, incorporating the tool directly into its blogging platform. Introduced Wednesday, the Spotify Play Button is a widget that will let Web users listen to songs, playlists or entire albums without having to leave the page they're viewing. The feature will let Spotify users who install the button simply to click on songs on the site, then copy them onto their own site.
