And by this I mean that white South Africa packed out every cricket ground to watch black West Indies, went home and made sure that "The Cosby Show" was the most watched program on television -- and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything. It gave me greater insight into the players, the tour, West Indies cricket and indeed my home country. That's what they were to us white South Africans, and I think deep down the Windies players felt that too. In the interview with Clive Lloyd, longtime captain of the official West Indies team that dominated world cricket for two decades, he said no amount of money would have made him support a racist regime. Great players like Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Clive Rice also effectively served life bans for being, well, South African, and the program understood that.
