Chinese President Hu Jintao, U.S. President Barack Obama, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Rwandan President Paul Kagame are among the world leaders expected to speak Tuesday. "Climate change has the potential to really fundamentally reshape dynamics between these big and significant countries in a way we've never seen before," said Julian Wong, a senior energy analyst at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank based in Washington, D.C. Leaders are expected to discuss how climate change affects energy, food security, trade, finance and international security, according to the United Nations. -- World leaders converge Tuesday in New York to focus on climate change, with the clock ticking down toward a summit this year in Denmark, where a global climate change pact is to be signed. In Melbourne, a man dressed as Australia's prime minister highlights that leaders must "wake up" to climate change. "We have an unprecedented opportunity to prevent climate change from slipping out of control and to jump-start the transformation to a safer, cleaner, more prosperous green economy that benefits all," said U.N. Secretary-General Ban-Ki-moon.
