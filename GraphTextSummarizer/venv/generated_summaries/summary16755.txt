Analysts told Yonhap that Jang may serve as caretaker for Kim's successor, who will possibly be one of his three sons. "Kim wants to keep the military in check and secure loyalty to both the military and the party," Cha Doo-hyeogn, a North Korea expert, told Yonhap. -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-il has added his brother-in-law to a military board in a move analysts say paves the way for an heir, according to South Korea's state-sponsored Yonhap news agency. Jang, who has been married to Kim's sister since 1972, currently serves as a director of the Workers' Party, Yonhap said. There were no other major changes in the new parliament, which signifies that Kim, 67, is prepared to maintain the status quo as he readies someone to take over from him, analysts told Yonhap.
