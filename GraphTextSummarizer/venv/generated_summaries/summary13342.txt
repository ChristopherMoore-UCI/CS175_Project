According to the park service, Gatlinburg Trail is frequently used by joggers, walkers and bicyclists. Rangers and National Park Service special agents were working more than 50 leads received on a tip line, said Molly Schroer, spokeswoman for the park, the most visited in the nation. The 44-year-old victim, who officials said did not know her attacker, managed to make her way afterward to Gatlinburg Bypass, where she flagged down a motorist, officials said. Schroer said the woman's permanent residency is in Kentucky, but she had been "temporarily" residing in the Gatlinburg area. The National Park Service released a sketch and offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator in Friday afternoon's assault on Gatlinburg Trail near the city of the same name.
