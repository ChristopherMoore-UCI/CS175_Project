The White House called on Congress to pass legislation to combat patent trolls, known less pejoratively as "patent assertion entities." Time will tell whether they successfully enhance patent quality, yet the promise is there. Reform must address patent quality and exorbitant litigation costs. They buy patents and threaten to sue people to extract licensing fees, like the mythical troll charging a fee to cross a bridge. Patents don't grow on trees.
