-- The trial of American hikers charged with espionage in Iran will resume May 11, the state run Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday, citing the head of the Justice Ministry. The trial began behind closed-doors last month, and allowed Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal "the opportunity to explain their innocence to the court," according to February 7 statement from the men's families. Fattal and Bauer continue to be held in Iran's notorious Evin prison. Iran accuses Bauer, 28, Fattal, 28, and Sarah Shourd, 32, of spying and trespassing. Iranian authorities say she will be tried in absentia if she doesn't appear in court.
