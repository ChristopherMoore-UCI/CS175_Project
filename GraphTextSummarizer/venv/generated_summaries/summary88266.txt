Kim Hix had already considered making Good Boy Roy a business, but when she saw how proud the T-shirt made Zack, she wondered if it might be a way for Zack to support himself after high school if his mental health issues prove to be barriers to employment. In 2009, Zack took a stack of Good Boy Roy drawings to his mother and asked what she thought. Enter Good Boy Roy Zack has drawn pictures since he was old enough to hold a pen. The family had no history of mental disorders, so Kim Hix started taking Zack to doctors. "Good Boy Roy, the business and brand, was launched to share with the world this story of hope, determination and overcoming challenges; [to] reach parents of children like Zack, to let them know they are not alone in their heartache and uncertainty; [to] let the kids know that anything is possible, and being different is OK."
