-- A rare tropical disease called Guinea worm is closer to being eradicated, according to former President Jimmy Carter and other experts. How fight against Guinea worm was won Prevention strategies include filtering drinking water and discouraging people with Guinea worm from wading in water. A main obstacle to eradication is that one case of Guinea worm disease, if not addressed quickly, can spread to hundreds more people, Carter said. Carter recalled Thursday that he first saw people living with Guinea worm in Ghana. In 1986, when the Carter Center began leading its international campaign against Guinea worm disease, there were 3.5 million cases in 21 countries.
