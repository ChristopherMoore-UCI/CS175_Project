What's needed, Okina said, is a way for women to remain in the work force after having children instead of being forced out because of lack of child care. About 40,000 children are on waiting lists for day care, according to government figures. Critics also have said the plan would not fix a significant problem for working families -- the lack of day care centers. About a quarter of the country's population is older than 65, according to government figures. The proposal would pay families the money every year until the child reached high school.
