By tacking on a call in the final minute of the film for Muslims in the West to attack shopping malls -- and then naming specific targets -- the producers guaranteed that their otherwise forgettable video would get global headlines. Likewise, in a 2013 video, Al-Shabaab called on Muslims in the West "to grab whatever you've got" to attack non-Muslims. For years, violent extremist groups such as ISIS, al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula and Al-Shabaab have been calling on Muslims living in the West to wage jihad against the unbelievers on their home soil. The Somali jihadi group Al-Shabaab grabbed headlines at the weekend when it released a video urging Muslims living in the United States, Britain and Canada to launch terrorist attacks against high-profile shopping malls -- including the Mall of America in Minnesota. Despite such calls to action, though, the good news is that very few Muslim citizens in the West have paid any attention to these calls to war.
