On day 46 of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, BP began to siphon oil from the ruptured undersea well to the surface, where it was flowing onto the awaiting drill ship Discover Enterprise. In the past, BP has denied that such large amounts of oil, which can choke fish and harm their eggs, have formed into underwater plumes. The university, which recently discovered a second oil plume in the Gulf, concluded that microscopic oil droplets are forming deepwater oil plumes. As the recovery process started Friday, BP said it would shut four vents on top of a containment cap from which oil was still escaping into the ocean. After mixed success with cutting off a damaged pipe, BP positioned a cap over the ruptured well head, though the company was uncertain whether the cap's seal would be snug enough to prevent oil from leaking out.
