-- Derek Jeter, who led the Yankees to five World Series titles during his first 19 seasons, announced Wednesday that he will retire at the end of the 2014 major league baseball season. " With his boyish good looks and ability to get base hits in clutch situations, Jeter charmed New York and led the Yankees resurgence from a franchise that had struggled in the early 1990s. USA Today baseball columnist Bob Nightengale said on Twitter that Jeter was "one of the finest class acts in any sport. "He is one of the most accomplished and memorable players of his -- or any -- era." Jeter, through his goodbye letter, said he wants to focus on new challenges like business, charitable work and starting a family. The 2014 season will be my last year playing professional baseball," the Yankees captain and shortstop said in a note posted on his Facebook page.
