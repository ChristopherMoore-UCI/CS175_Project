The following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. -- Former Manson family member Susan Atkins has requested a "compassionate release" from prison because she has less than six months to live Last month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there. Atkins' husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, was quoted as saying she has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, according to a blog called Manson Family Today. If the department approves, the Board of Parole Hearings and the sentencing court in Los Angeles also must sign off on the request.
