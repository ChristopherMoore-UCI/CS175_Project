End of Thai surrogacy? Already, people who may have sought surrogacy in Thailand are looking elsewhere, Everingham said. Hundreds of confused couples Families Through Surrogacy (FTS), a non-profit organization that helps intending parents through the process, says there are currently around 400 couples with pregnant surrogates or frozen embryos in Thailand. The options will be discussed at a conference in Washington DC, next month, when Families Through Surrogacy will also be calling for mandatory criminal checks worldwide on intending parents, to avoid a repeat of the outrage that followed the case of baby Gammy. It's likely the Thai crackdown will lead to a sharp drop in foreign parents seeking surrogacy in the country. Around half are from Australia, with many others from the U.S., Canada and Israel, said FTS founder Sam Everingham, who has been inundated with calls from around the world from worried parents.
