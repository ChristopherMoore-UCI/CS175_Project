The Pena Nieto government is currently shepherding through reforms that could change that picture, but lower prices could be a complication, given that 30-40% of government revenues come from oil. This is the cruel full circle of the global oil market: unrest provoked by low oil prices in these countries can run prices back up. A number of oil-producing countries may have trouble paying their bills if oil prices stay below a certain level. Ultimately, there's only one way out, and that's to depend less on oil, for both producers and consumers. So, while it's nice to get the break at the gas pump and the economic benefits of an energy boom at home, the national security price of oil remains high.
