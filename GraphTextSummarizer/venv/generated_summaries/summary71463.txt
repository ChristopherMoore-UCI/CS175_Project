The Qatari has this year been involved in new allegations by Britain's Sunday Times newspaper, which claimed he had been offering bribes to FIFA delegates for support of his country's 2022 bid. The former France international has indicated he is unlikely to run against the Swiss in next year's elections, but compatriot and former FIFA official Jerome Champagne will stand against his old boss Blatter. Bin Hammam, who had hoped to be Sepp Blatter's sole challenger at that year's FIFA presidential elections, was banned for life. Beckenbauer led West Germany to World Cup success as a player in 1974 and as coach in 1990. The 65-year-old -- a former FIFA ExCO member -- has denied all accusations, while the Qatar 2022 Organizing Committee insisted that Bin Hammam had not been working for them.
