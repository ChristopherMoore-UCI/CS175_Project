Kvitova expects French Open winner Sharapova and Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka, who she beat in the Wimbledon semifinals last year, to be her main challengers over the Wimbledon fortnight. " Sharapova, Wimbledon champion in 2004, has been drawn against Russia-born Australian Anastasia Rodionova, while second seed Azarenka, who could be set for another semifinal showdown with Kvitova, will play American Irina Falconi. French Open champion Rafael Nadal could face fourth seed Andy Murray in the last four for the third year in a row. Unlike the men's game, which has been dominated by Serbia's Novak Djokovic, women's tennis has seen a number of players clinch grand slam titles -- the last six major tournaments have had six different winners. -- Petra Kvitova will use the expectation of being defending champion to help her when she begins her Wimbledon campaign.
