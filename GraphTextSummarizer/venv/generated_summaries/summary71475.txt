Watson is listed in critical condition, and his daughter is in stable condition at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Burden said. The country trio's representatives contacted the Watson family and offered to take care of all the expenses, Watson family friend Pam Burden said. "I'm a volunteer firefighter here in Muhlenberg County and I want to thank you for your generosity and support you have given to the Watson family," wrote Willam Michael Vick. The band is set to perform Sunday as part of the Super Bowl XLVIII pregame show in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The group also offered to pay hotel expenses for family members staying near the medical center where the two are being treated, she said.
