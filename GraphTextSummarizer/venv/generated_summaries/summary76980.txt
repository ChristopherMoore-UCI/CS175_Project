Dozens of Boko Haram insurgents stormed the Doron Baga fishing and farming village on the shores of Lake Chad late Sunday through Monday and took away 97 young men and boys plus several women, residents said. The hostages were loaded onto motorboats and ferried into neighboring Chad, with residents saying they feared the hostages  would be forcefully conscripted as foot soldiers. Chadian security officials reported intercepting a convoy of buses carrying 85 Nigerians" believed to have been kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists from Baga," a Nigerian security source said. "The convoy being led by six Boko Haram gunmen was stopped on the Chadian part of the border along Lake Chad for routine checks and the huge number in the convoy raised suspicion," said the source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the issue. Boko Haram has been waging a five-year armed insurgency to create an Islamic state in northern Nigeria.
