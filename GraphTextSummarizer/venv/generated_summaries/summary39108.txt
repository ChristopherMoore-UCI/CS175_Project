Despite a long list of other distinguished film roles -- including opposite Frank Sinatra in Otto Preminger's "The Man with the Golden Arm" (1955) and Clark Gable in "The King and Four Queens"(1956) -- it was a smaller role that audiences today are most likely to recognize. Parker died at a medical facility near her Palm Springs, California, home from complications related to pneumonia, according to director Richard Gale, who is a family friend. Her acting career began on stage as a teenager, but it was a performance at the Pasadena Playhouse that led Warner Bros. to sign her to a studio contract on her 18th birthday. Her early notable movies included "Pride of the Marines" in 1945 and "Voice of the Turtle" -- opposite Ronald Reagan -- in 1947. The first Academy Award nomination came in 1950 for her portrayal of a terrorized prison inmate in "Caged."
