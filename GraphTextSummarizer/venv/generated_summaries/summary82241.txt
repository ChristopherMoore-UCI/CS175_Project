-- Afghanistan's president is speeding up the transfer of the U.S.-run prison at Bagram to Afghan control within a month after hearing a report citing problems at the facility, including human rights issues. Last year, Human Rights First said the detainees "are, in fact, afforded far fewer rights than are those at Guantanamo, who have the right to challenge their detention in a U.S. court and to representation by a lawyer." "Some detainees at Bagram have been imprisoned for eight years or more without charge or trial, based largely on evidence they have never seen and with no meaningful opportunity to defend themselves," a report from the group said in May. A U.S. Forces in Afghanistan fact sheet issued in October said the Detention Facility in Parwan "enables security, transparency and rule of law in Afghanistan both now and when the facility is transferred to the Afghan government. "The United States has repeatedly made clear we are committed to working with the Afghan government to complete a joint plan for transition of detention operations in Afghanistan," said Gavin Sundwall, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. " "We're going to continue to work with the Afghan government to implement the transition -- that we have both agreed needs to happen -- of detention operations in Afghanistan. Human rights activists have criticized detention practices at the Bagram facilities over the years.
