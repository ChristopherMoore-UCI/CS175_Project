Becker, the chief of staff for former President George H.W. Bush, said her hospitalization is "not serious at all." Last year, Bush underwent open-heart surgery during which doctors replaced her aortic valve with a biologic valve. "Mrs Bush is in for some routine tests, not an emergency of any kind," said Jim Appleby, spokesman for former President George H.W. Bush. -- Former first lady Barbara Bush was admitted Saturday to a hospital in Texas for routine tests, a spokeswoman said. She had not been feeling well for about a week, said Jean Becker, the chief of staff for Bush's husband. Bush, 84, is expected to stay at the hospital for a day or two, Becker said.
