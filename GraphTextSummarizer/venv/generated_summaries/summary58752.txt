Such is the aim of Syri-Arts, part of Lebanese non-profit organization Kayany, which is working to raise much needed money for Syrian refugee children by auctioning off 150 works of art. According to Syri-Arts, all the funds raised "will go to the benefit of Syrian refugee children to secure food, clothing, medication and schooling through reputable NGOs working on the ground. This really shows how civil society is keen to help Syrian children." " Children are facing "catastrophic consequences" because of the escalating violence in Syria, according to UNICEF, which adds that "more than 4 million children are now affected by the brutal conflict." Just recently the World Health Organization confirmed ten cases of polio among children in Syria, the first outbreak of the disease in the country since 1999.
