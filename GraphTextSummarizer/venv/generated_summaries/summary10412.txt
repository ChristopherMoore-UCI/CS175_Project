When police arrived at the Premiere Theatre, they found 21-year-old Christopher Sides with his face painted like the Joker from the Batman movies and his hair dyed pink. -- Police arrested a man wearing "Joker" makeup at a Florida movie theater Wednesday after someone reported the man acting suspiciously, the Melbourne Police Department said.
