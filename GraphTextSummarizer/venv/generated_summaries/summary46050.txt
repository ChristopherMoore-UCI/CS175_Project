In the survey, 46% said they believe that most rich people "are wealthy mainly because they know the right people or were born into wealthy families." However, the poll did find that younger adults, Democrats and African-Americans are somewhat more likely than older people, Republicans, whites or Hispanics to note strong conflict between rich and poor. "I am not angry at rich people," said Smith, 51. Conflict between rich and poor is at an all-time high, at least in the way of public perception, a new Pew Research Center poll shows. "For example, there has been no change in views about whether the rich became wealthy through personal effort or because they were fortunate enough to be from wealthy families or have the right connections."
