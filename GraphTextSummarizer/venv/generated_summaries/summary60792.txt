-- Threats of another perilous outbreak of tornadoes appeared to fizzle Sunday, a day after powerful storms tied to the same weather system tore through the Midwest and Plains states. Yet while people in many of those areas experienced inclement weather and a handful of tornadoes were reported in several states, the impact paled compared to what others had experienced Saturday and into the early morning hours of Sunday. The National Weather Service had issued widespread tornado watches for several states including Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Iowa and Illinois. By early Sunday morning, many Thurman residents who took up temporary shelter at a high school in nearby Tabor were again in the path of a storm that spawned suspected tornadoes in neighboring Kansas. As of 10 p.m. CT, the service's Storm Prediction Center had received 10 reports of tornadoes on Sunday.
