One person swam ashore, a Maui Fire Department helicopter picked up four, and a Coast Guard helicopter rescued three. -- Loretta Fuddy, the Hawaii official who confirmed the authenticity of President Obama's birth record in Hawaii, died Wednesday night in a small-plane crash. Her hobbies included singing in a church choir, "enjoying her cat Flint, and spending time with her grand nieces and nephews." The other eight people survived, Petty Officer Stephen Woodbury said. The aircraft, with nine passengers on board, crashed into the ocean about a mile off Kalaupapa, Molokai, on Wednesday, the U.S. Coast Guard said.
