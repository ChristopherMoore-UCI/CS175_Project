But Ferrari's team principal Stefano Domenicali has backed the 30-year-old to answer his critics. He also revealed that, instead of spending time with his family ahead of the next race in China on April 15, Massa is heading to Italy to work with the team at Ferrari's home base. " Despite a positive result in Malaysia, Domenicali warned there is still work to do to ensure the F2012 car is competitive ahead of the next race in Shanghai. "I well remember that, four years ago, in fact right after a Malaysian Grand Prix, which was won for us by Kimi Raikkonen, Felipe was more or less in the same situation as today," Domenicali told the team's official website. Last weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix was an encouraging race for Ferrari, with Fernando Alonso's victory lifting some of the gloom which had descended over the legendary Italian team after a disappointing preseason.
