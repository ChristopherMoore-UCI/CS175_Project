Support crew A support boat -- a Lagoon 500 catamaran -- was a constant companion, with five crew members including the Dutch professional sailor Erik van Vuuren as team captain. It remains to be seen whether other relay teams attempt to beat their new record but for now Van Hellenberg Hubar is content to live with the memories. With his sailing expertise, Van Vuuren was one of the first people recruited to the challenge, which was the brainchild of Filippo van Hellenberg Hubar, who set up the Enable Passion Foundation with the express aim of completing inspiring and original challenges. The team, consisting of Little, four Dutchman and one woman -- 30-year-old Camilla Ringvold -- were assigned two shifts of two hours each per day -- one in the daylight and one at night -- so constant progress was made on the 4,000 mile (6,000km) plus crossing to their destination in the Turks and Caicos Islands. Frans was grateful to Van Vuuren and his skill when he went down during a night stint and was picked up within minutes.
