About 100 investigators -- including FBI agents, New Hampshire and Vermont state police, local authorities and employees of the state's fish and game department -- went door-to-door Thursday in the small, tight-knit town of West Stewartstown, said FBI Supervisory Special Agent Kieran Ramsey. -- Authorities in New Hampshire bolstered their search operations Thursday in their search for a 11-year-old who a school nurse described as a "young girl who is afraid and needs to be home." New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jane Young noted authorities had received about 150 tips as of early Thursday evening, and were checking each one. "Celina is a young girl who is afraid and needs to be home," Lyons told reporters on Thursday. "It is our greatest hope that we find her and we bring her home safely," Young said Thursday, declining to field questions from reporters.
