He said recent Israeli accusations that al Qaeda had secured a foothold in the Palestinian territory were "an illusion" and were being used a pretext for future Israeli military action in Gaza and to incite American and international public opinion against Palestinians. "We are the ones being strangled in the siege, and now Gaza is being marketed as the ones who have the bombs, missiles and anti-aircraft missiles" The prime minister of the Hamas government in Gaza denied Wednesday Israeli claims of an al Qaeda presence in the coastal strip, claiming there is no such thing. The Israeli military claimed the victims were senior operatives of an al Qaeda inspired radical group known as the Army of Islam and were planning attacks against Israeli and American targets in the Sinai Peninsula. Speaking to reporters, Ismail Haniya said there was an active Palestinian resistance in Gaza but that it "does not work outside of the borders of Palestine."
