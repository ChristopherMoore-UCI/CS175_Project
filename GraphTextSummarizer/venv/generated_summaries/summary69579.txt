Sylviane Finck Lozada, a French and Spanish teacher at Brusly High School in Brusly, Louisiana, for the past 13 years, last spoke to her family in Belgium about July 5, said spokeswoman Casey Hicks of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office. Walter Lemoine, principal at Brusly High, said Sylviane Finck Lozada had been a West Baton Rouge Parish Teacher of the Year. He and the couple's daughter boarded a plane from Dallas to Venezuela on July 9, Hicks said. But, Hicks added: "The buckets and concrete mix are unaccounted for." Lemoine called Sylviane Finck Lozada a "tough" teacher and said her disappearance is "a major impact" to the community.
