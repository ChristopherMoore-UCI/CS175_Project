A National Weather Service message, that was meant as a test, instead appeared on the service's website and was pushed to mobile apps that rely on it for information. "AccuWeather sent out an automatic alert to our App users, -- a programmed message to get this warning out as quickly as possible," said Evan Myers, chief operating officer of AccuWeather. AccuWeather's app was among those that sent a tsunami warning to users in parts of California and Washington. We've got a few folks calling in and freaking out about this message," Seth Wayne, a weather forecaster for Seattle's KOMO, wrote on Twitter. " "We have retweeted NWS' clarification via social media," Myers said via email.
