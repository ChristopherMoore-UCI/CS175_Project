Renee (Vanessa Williams) went to see her fiancÃ© Ben (Charles Mesure) when he got thrown in jail for contempt before their wedding because he refused to answer questions on the stand about an incriminating phone conversation with Bree. She went to court that next morning and told Trip he should call her as a witness so she could discredit Renee's testimony because she'd seen her drinking the night she claimed to have seen Bree with a shovel. Bree (Marcia Cross): She was on trial for allegedly killing Gaby's (Eva Longoria) abusive stepfather Alejandro, which Carlos (Antonio Chavira) had actually done. Just as she was about to move into hospice care, Susan, Bree, Lynette, and Gaby offered to take shifts helping Roy so she could stay. Bree thanked Roy for finding the record at Renee's wedding reception, which was the start of the conversation that ended with them getting their own happily ever after.
