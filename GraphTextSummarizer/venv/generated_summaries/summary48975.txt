-- Three suspects appeared in a Mauritius court Wednesday in connection with the death of Michaela Harte-McAreavey, daughter of a leading Irish sports figure and wife of Gaelic football star John McAreavey. "We believe we have substantial evidence to connect them to the case," said police Superintendent Yoosoof Soopun, who is leading the investigation. Harte was the daughter of one of the best-known figures in Irish sports, Mickey Harte, the Tyrone Gaelic football manager. A post-mortem examination showed that she had died from asphyxiation, said Dr. Sudesh Kumar Gungadin. Harte asked the media to refrain from contacting his son-in-law, who's "isolated out there" in Mauritius, he said.
