" "This president is not going to agree to defund health care," Clinton said at a health panel just before President Barack Obama was to make an appearance. "If they want to vote to shut the government down, that's on their head and their responsibility and if they go even further, which is deeply distressing, and for the first time lead our country into default on our obligations that is not just partisan politics," Clinton said at the Clinton Global Initiative established by her husband, who was also in attendance. Later in the panel, Obama and former President Bill Clinton -- both Democrats -- defended the health care reform. "So what you have had is an unprecedented effort, that you have seen ramp up over the last month or so, in which those who have opposed the idea of universal health care in the first place, and have fought this thing tooth and nail through Congress and through the courts and so forth, are -- have been trying to scare and discourage people from getting a good deal," Obama said. Bill Clinton praised the health initiative, saying it will make Americans "healthier" in the next decade.
