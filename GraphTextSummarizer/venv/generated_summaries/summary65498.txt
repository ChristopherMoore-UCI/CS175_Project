"Sugarland had supervisory authority and discretion for stage size, lighting, instruments, trusses, sound equipment and location of sound equipment, and the stage system," the suit said. The estate of each of those who died would get at least $300,000, while the injured would get 65% of their medical expenses paid out of the state's tort claims fund, Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a news release Tuesday. The suit also names other defendants, including Mid-America Sound, the company that rented the stage, roof and lighting system, and event promoter Live Nation. A lawsuit filed last month by 48 plaintiffs contends that the band "failed or refused to cancel the Sugarland concert despite inclement weather" and that it had "ultimate control over the lighting" that fell on many of the victims. "Sugarland was not required to perform if Sugarland determined their performance would be impaired or prevented due to inclement weather," the suit said.
