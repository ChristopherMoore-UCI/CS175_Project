Libya's new authorities found chemical weapons about a month ago and asked for international aid in securing them, a top military spokesman for the National Transitional Council told CNN Monday. Libya's chemical weapons stockpiles consisted of about 9 metric tons of sulfur mustard agent and more than 800 metric tons of precursor chemicals, as of February. In 2003, Libya agreed to destroy its entire chemical weapons arsenal, which included some 25 tons of mustard gas and 3,300 empty aerial bombs. But U.S. officials told CNN in August that they and NATO had been discussing Libya's chemical weapons store with the transitional council in case the Gadhafi regime fell. The official also confirmed that intelligence personnel from the United States and other countries had been in Libya over the summer to help maintain security at various sites.
