With old-fashioned American character and ingenuity, the U.S. national team is poised to do great things in Brazil. But it really confirmed to the rest of the world that U.S. football (OK, we also call it soccer) will not go gently into that good night. Dempsey played the creative genius for a workmanlike U.S. team, and Brooks stood tall as a powerful 6-foot-4 defender. The opening match of the World Cup against Ghana was a must-win for the U.S. team -- anything short of a victory, and the red, white and blue would have faced a seemingly insurmountable hill to climb. The refrain is consistently chanted by the American Outlaws, the supporters group for the U.S. national soccer team, and it now rings truer than ever.
