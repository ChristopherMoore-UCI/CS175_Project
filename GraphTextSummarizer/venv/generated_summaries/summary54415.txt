Others do not have this opportunity because of a disruptive childhood, abusive relationships or limited resources. This world is a busy place with billions of people and billions of things to achieve and experience. Growing up, I wasn't as connected to helping other people because too much was catching my attention, typical teenage things like football and girls. I had the unbelievable honor to meet great people over the years, and most recently, at the CNN Hero Awards show in Los Angeles. It's easy to live a lifetime without knowing the feeling of helping others.
