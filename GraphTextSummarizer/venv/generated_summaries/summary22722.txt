Kirsten Nematandani and four other SAFA officials were suspended as an act of "good governence" following a report by football's global governing body FIFA, which adjudged four friendly matches ahead of Africa's first World Cup had been fixed. Hosts South Africa were eliminated in the group stages, but, to the delight of African football fans, Ghana enjoyed a run to the quarterfinal. The timing of FIFA's report into match-fixing involving the team known as Bafana Bafana comes at a bad time for South Africa, as it is just one month away from hosting the continent's showpiece football event -- the Africa Cup of Nations. A month later the 2010 World Cup was the first to be staged on the continent of Africa. "The offer included providing FIFA-accredited referees at their cost for the friendly matches prior to the FIFA 2010 World Cup."
