WPS took the decision on October 27 2011 to "terminate" the franchise, which had U.S. national team stars such as goalkeeper Hope Solo and striker Abby Wambach on its roster. Borislow challenged the termination, with the league forced to suspend the 2012 season "in order to address the legal issues head-on before moving forward with competition." "Those that take part in our league -- players, partners and fans -- deserve the best," said WPS CEO Jennifer O'Sullivan. He repeatedly clashed with WPS over a number of issues, including the size of the magicJack's stadium and reportedly failing to pay player wages. The 2011 WPS playoffs were won by the Western New York Flash, who were led by Brazil's five-time FIFA World Player of the Year Marta. "We are proud of what the league has accomplished in the first three seasons," Thomas Hofstetter, owner of the New Jersey-based Sky Blues FC, who won the 2009 WPS playoffs, said in a statement.
