Hundreds of Yemeni anti-government protesters clashed with pro-government demonstrators Saturday at Sanaa University, eyewitnesses and a local human rights group said. -- As the ninth day of protests left six wounded Saturday, Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh blamed the roiling unrest on foreign agendas and a plot against Yemen's stability, according to the state-run Saba news agency. Saba reported Saturday that an official source at the Interior Ministry has denounced some reports that security personnel in civilian clothes participated in marches. The source also said security personnel are present in uniform near all rallies of pro- and anti-government marchers to maintain security and public order. It rejected any efforts promoting "hatred and regionalism culture" and called on security forces to enhance stability and protect citizens, according to Saba.
