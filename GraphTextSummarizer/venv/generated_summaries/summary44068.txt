"It looks like a nice layout in terms of the track, we are all optimistic to go there and have a good run and I am looking forward to it," Webber told the Red Bull website. "The track's got a good mix of corners and I think we'll see a lot of overtaking in the first sector -- there are long straights into slow hairpins," he told the Red Bull website. The duo will be taking tips from Karun Chandhok, a driver for Hispania Racing who carried out a test run in a Red Bull show event there in September. -- This weekend's inaugural Korean Grand Prix is a step into the unknown for Formula One, but Red Bull's title hopefuls Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel are looking forward to the challenge as the 2010 season heads into its final three races. From turn seven onwards, there's a fast section of flowing corners all the way back to the start-finish line, so I think the Red Bull Racing guys will be happy in sectors two and three.
