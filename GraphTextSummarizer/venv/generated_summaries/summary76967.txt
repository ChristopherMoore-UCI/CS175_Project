A search of Wallin's apartment found meth, drug paraphernalia and drug packaging materials, said Thomas Carson, Fein's spokesman. CNN made several attempts to contact Fein, federal public defender Kelly Barrett and Diocese of Bridgeport spokesman Brian Wallace for comments, but calls were not returned. With the plea, he admitted that he received and distributed 1.7 kilograms of the drug, U.S. Attorney David B. Fein said in a statement. Wallin sold meth to the undercover officer six times between September and January, Fein said. Authorities said they believe Wallin also distributed the drug to alleged dealer Michael Nelson of Manchester.
