At Friday's meeting, in addition to the Vahidi case, representatives from the DAIA and Morales also discussed international security, terrorism, Holocaust deniers, diplomacy and development. The Iranian minister, Ahmad Vahidi, is wanted in Argentina for his alleged role in planning the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994 that killed 85 people. Vahidi's boss, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has in the past denied the existence of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of some 6 million Jews during World War II. The published apology came a day after Jewish leaders met with the president to discuss the case and other matters. Interpol has issued a "red notice" for Vahidi, which seeks other governments' help in detaining him for possible extradition, and the DAIA demanded that Bolivia arrest him when they learned of his visit.
