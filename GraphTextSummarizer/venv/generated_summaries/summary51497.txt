Sunnis demand that the Shiite-led government stop what they call second-class treatment of Iraq's Sunni community. Yet such attacks continue as the 10-year anniversary of the U.S-led invasion of Iraq nears next month. Last month, at least 177 Iraqi civilians, soldiers and police officers were killed in attacks, according to figures compiled by Iraq's interior, defense and health ministries. Overall violence has dropped significantly in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence, between 2005 and 2007. Recent attacks in Shiite areas have spread fear among Iraqis that sectarian warfare may ravage the country again.
