A French hostage held in Mali has been executed by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Mauritania's ANI news agency reported late Tuesday. Before the ANI report on Tuesday, the French foreign ministry released a statement quoting Hollande as saying there are no "financial discussions" ongoing to gain the release of French hostages in various countries. The spokesman reportedly told the agency that the March 10 execution was in response to France's military intervention in Mali, and that French President Francois Hollande "is responsible for the lives of the rest of the hostages." French involvement in the Malian conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital. Six other French hostages are still being held in Mali, ANI said.
