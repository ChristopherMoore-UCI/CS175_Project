The news of Wolff's role comes 10 days after Swiss driver Simona De Silvestro joined Sauber with a view to competing in F1 next year. Wolff joined Williams in April 2012 and has been credited with helping to develop various cars. Having impressed in a test at Silverstone last year, Wolff can boast good knowledge of both the track for the British grand prix and Hockenheim -- following her experiences there in DTM. 'I'm grateful for the support and belief Williams continue to show in me and 2014 promises to be a very important milestone in my career," Wolff told the manufacturer's website. Already a development driver with British team Williams, the 31-year-old is scheduled to take part in the first practice sessions ahead of the British and Germans grands prix in July.
