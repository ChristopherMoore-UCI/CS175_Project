"We look at any kind of suspicious death on the high seas," said Special Agent Richard Wolf, spokesman for the FBI's Baltimore field office. Wolf said the woman's autopsy has been completed, but authorities are waiting for results from toxicology tests before a cause of death is determined. The FBI is investigating the mysterious death of a 64-year-old woman aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise ship. "As is our standard procedure, both the FBI and local law enforcement were notified," Royal Caribbean said. The couple was traveling on the Enchantment of the Seas ship, which was on a seven-day voyage from Baltimore to Florida and the Bahamas.
