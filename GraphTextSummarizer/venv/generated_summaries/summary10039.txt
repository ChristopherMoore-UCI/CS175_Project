Henning, a big-hearted taxi driver from Bolton, northern England, was part of a team of volunteers traveling from Britain to Syria to deliver aid to people in need. While part of the aid convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning was part of a much smaller group that volunteered to press ahead into Syria. He sacrificed Christmas, weekends and family time to do his part for those worst hit by Syria's civil war, and was admired by his fellow volunteers. A short video released by ISIS showed the apparent beheading of Henning. Before he was killed, Henning spoke to the camera, referencing the British Parliament's decision to join the bombing campaign against ISIS.
