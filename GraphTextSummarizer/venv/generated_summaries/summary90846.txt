"The availability of automatic external defibrillators can be the difference between life and death when an individual goes into sudden cardiac arrest," she said. Now, these two families have joined cardiologist Dr. Terry Gordon and lawmakers to push for a bill in the U.S. House of Representatives to mandate federal funding for defibrillators in primary and secondary schools across the nation. The couples successfully lobbied in their home states of Ohio and New York to pass laws mandating defibrillators in schools. U.S. Rep.

Because the biggest problem in stocking schools with defibrillators is funding, the bill before the House would require the federal government to match funds for the devices.
