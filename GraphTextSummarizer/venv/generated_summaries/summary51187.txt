The 21-year-old singer fell ill on April 15 and was kept in a Kansas City hospital for several days. The illness that derailed Miley Cyrus' U.S. tour in April has returned like a wrecking ball at the start of her European tour. "After a period of improvement, Cyrus' symptoms have returned and doctors will not permit her to travel," her representative told CNN Wednesday. "This type of extreme reaction can last up to 27 days and Cyrus must remain under doctors' care at this time. " Cyrus is still hoping to perform her "Bangerz" show at London's O2 Arena on May 6, the rep said.
