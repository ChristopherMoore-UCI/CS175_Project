Spokesman Ma Yue confirmed that talks are ongoing with the 32-year-old, who is out of favor at English Premier League side Chelsea. -- Chinese football club Shanghai Shenhua hope to pull off a major transfer coup by signing former France international Nicolas Anelka. Anelka's international career came to a controversial halt during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, when he was sent home in disgrace after clashing with coach Raymond Domenech. Shenhua owner Zhu Jun said former France international Jean Tigana will become the club's new coach, according to the Shanghai Daily website. In 2008, Anelka moved to Chelsea in a Â£15 million deal from Bolton, where he resurrected his career after a short spell in Turkey with Fenerbahce.
