He had been ordered to wear the electronic tracking device on his ankle while awaiting trial on child pornography charges, Matt Brown, chief probation officer of the Northern District of New York, told CNN Friday. Renz -- who police said was arrested after trying to flee the scene through the woods -- has been charged with rape, kidnapping and murder. -- A man accused of killing a school district librarian and raping her 10-year-old daughter in upstate New York had removed an electronic tracking anklet before carrying out the attack, police said. This meant Renz was able to reconnect the device and leave it in his home before his alleged attack, Brown said. David J. Renz, 29, of Cicero, is accused of abducting the 47-year-old mother and her daughter shortly before 9 p.m. on Thursday as they left a gymnastics class, state police said.
