The team that killed Osama bin Laden had gone through thousands of scenarios for assaulting a compound, just like this group of Navy SEALs on U.S. soil. The visit comes days after Osama bin Laden -- the man responsible for the 9/11 attacks -- was killed by U.S. forces. And it was a group of these elite troops who carried out the operation that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. The government confirmed it was bin Laden through DNA testing, but some people say that's not enough evidence; they want to see proof. But the team that went after bin Laden was special, part of the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DEVGRU.
