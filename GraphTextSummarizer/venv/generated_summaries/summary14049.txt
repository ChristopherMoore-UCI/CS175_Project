The early morning fire was ruled accidental, the result of "child involvement with fire play," and the fire department was still investigating which occupants were involved in playing with the fire, according to department spokesman Khalid Baylor. -- A house fire in Queens that killed two 4-year-old siblings Sunday was a result of a child or children playing with fire, a Fire Department of New York spokesman said. Barbara Smith, a friend of the family, spoke with WABC on Sunday morning and said the family is from Jamaica and that the children were visiting. Another 4-year-old girl was taken to the same hospital and is in stable condition, said Baylor. Five people were rescued from the blaze, Baylor said.
