-- Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, who died Wednesday at 56, made the world "immeasurably better," the company's board of directors said in a statement. The company also released an e-mail sent to Apple employees in which CEO Tim Cook announced Jobs' death, saying, "Apple has lost a visionary and creative genius, and the world has lost an amazing human being. Cook said the company is planning a "celebration of Steve's extraordinary life for Apple employees that will take place soon. "Our hearts go out to them and all who were touched by his extraordinary gifts." "No words can adequately express our sadness at Steve's death or our gratitude for the opportunity to work with him," Cook told Apple employees. "We know many of you will mourn with us and we ask that you respect our privacy during our time of grief." Printed copies of a picture of Jobs -- posted on Apple's website announcing his passing -- appeared Wednesday night on a marble wall outside the Apple store on New York's Fifth Avenue, with notes written on them.
