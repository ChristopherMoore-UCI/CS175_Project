American Tommy Gainey led by three shots at the halfway stage of the Wyndham Championship at Greater Greensboro with South African star Ernie Els in the four-strong chasing group. Els is battling for a tournament win but also to clinch his place in the lucrative FedEx Cup playoffs which start next week. Defending Wyndham champion Arjun Atwal of India will not be playing the weekend after missing the cut, while joint first round leader Jeff Quinney carded a level-par 70 to fall five behind Gainey. Gainey carded a five-under par 65 Friday for a 12-under total of 128, with Els sharing second on nine-under with Australian Stewart Appleby, Daniel Summerhays and Webb Simpson. Four players shared sixth on 132, Jim Furyk (67), Brazil's Alexandre Rocha (66), England's Paul Casey (67) and South African Retief Goosen (65).
