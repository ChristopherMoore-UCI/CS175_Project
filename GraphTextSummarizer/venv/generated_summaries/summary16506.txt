A statement from the U.S. assistant secretary of state for the Bureau of African Affairs Wednesday welcomed the news of Yar'Adua's return, but said he hoped that it was not "an effort by his senior advisors to upset Nigeria's stability and create renewed uncertainty in the democratic process. Abdullah Aminchi, Nigeria's ambassador to Saudi Arabia -- where Yar'Adua has been receiving medical treatment since November -- said the president's health had improved considerably and that he went back to Nigeria on Tuesday. Ailing President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua has returned home to Nigeria, though it was not immediately clear whether he was well enough to resume duties. " "Nigeria is an extraordinarily important country to its friends and partners, and all those in positions of responsibility should put the health of the president and the best interests of the country and people of Nigeria above personal ambition or gain," said the statement from Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson. "As a nation of 150 million people, Nigeria's democracy and its continued adherence to constitutional rule should be the highest priority," the statement added.
