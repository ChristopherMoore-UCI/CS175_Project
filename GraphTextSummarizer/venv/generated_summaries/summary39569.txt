"Keeping immunization levels high is critical to preventing outbreaks or sustained transmission in Georgia," said Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health. Georgia has its first confirmed case of measles since 2012, the state's Health Department said Monday. The Georgia case is unrelated to the recent California outbreak, the Georgia Health Department said Monday. Health officials are working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention "to identify anyone who may have been exposed to the patient and to prevent further spread of measles," the statement said. Young children are also particularly vulnerable in cases in which they have received only one dose of measles vaccine.
