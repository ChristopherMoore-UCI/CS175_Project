But some protesters wearing masks threw objects at police officers in another march Tuesday night, said police spokesman Daniel Fortier. CLASSE, considered the most militant of the province's three main student associations, has said it will continue to protest without giving police an approved itinerary, according to CNN Canada affiliate CTV. After a weekend of clashes, tension at first subsided because organizers of the downtown rally provided an itinerary in advance, as required by an emergency law passed late last week, police said. At least 300 people were arrested and 20 were injured in Montreal during weekend clashes between police and protesters, according to CTV. Tuesday's protest was intended to denounce tuition increases and Bill 78, which requires organizers of a demonstration with more than 50 participants to provide written details and the route of the event eight hours in advance.
