Allen said Sunday that he and EPA administrator Lisa Jackson talk daily about dispersant use, saying "we haven't ignored EPA's guidelines." "Furthermore, we've complied with EPA requests regarding dispersants which are an EPA-approved and recognized tool in fighting oil spills," the statement said. "The use of dispersant is always a difficult decision, with environmental trade-offs that must be taken seriously into consideration," EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan said Sunday. "While EPA may not have concurred with every individual waiver granted by the federal on-scene coordinator, the agency believes dispersant use has been an essential tool in mitigating this spill's impact, preventing millions of gallons of oil from doing even more damage to sensitive marshes, wetlands and beaches and the economy of the Gulf coast," Gilfillan said. In one instance, Coast Guard officials allowed the oil giant to use a larger volume of dispersants than it had applied for, he said.
