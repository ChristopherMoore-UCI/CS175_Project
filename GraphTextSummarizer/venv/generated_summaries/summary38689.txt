Strong schools have supportive parents and an involved community. What we have in communities with failing schools is parents who are for a variety of reasons -- mostly economic -- failing to parent effectively. The U.S. Department of Education needs to change its focus and stop its policy of supporting the closing of failing schools; it does not bring long-lasting change. Let's look at how ineffective school closures have been in Washington, where Chancellor Michelle Rhee has closed many schools. Or take a look at the Chicago Public Schools, where former CEO Arne Duncan, now U.S. secretary of education, closed many schools.
