Meanwhile, a weakened Serbian men's team crashed out the Davis Cup in the first round on Saturday, losing 3-0 to a Switzerland side bolstered by the presence of 17-time grand slam champion Roger Federer and Australian Open winner Stanislas Wawrinka. "I started the match really well, but as the match continued I wasn't doing the things that really helped me in the first set," said 2012 French Open champion Sharapova, who returned to the tour in January after missing the final third of last season with a shoulder injury. Top seed Sharapova would have moved back to fourth in the world rankings by winning her 30th career crown this weekend, but was beaten 4-6 6-3 6-4 by fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. "They obviously came at the wrong time," said Sharapova, who heads to her former home of Sochi on Sunday to start her role as a TV commentator at Russia's first Winter Olympics. "When I was down in games in the first couple of sets I felt my serve really helped me, but in the third set I didn't keep that level up.
