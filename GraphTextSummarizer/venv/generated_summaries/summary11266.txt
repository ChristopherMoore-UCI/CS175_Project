" Earlier Saturday, riot police detained at least 35 people after peaceful protesters thronged the main square in the capital, Kiev, to voice displeasure with the decision of Yanukovych's government to suspend the EU talks last week. Ukrinform quoted Kiev police as saying that riot police were called in after protesters began throwing objects at law enforcement officers who were moving equipment into independence Square ahead of New Year holidays. The emboldened demonstrators waved Ukrainian and EU flags and sang the national anthem outside the St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery, where groups of protesters retreated earlier after a sweep by riot police left seven people hospitalized and dozens under arrest at Independence Square. But riot police stepped in early Saturday and "brutally dispersed" several hundred people who were demonstrating peacefully in support of Ukraine's European integration, according to a statement from Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Georgia, Moldova and Azerbaijan all took steps toward closer EU integration at a summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, on Friday, but Ukraine did not sign an association agreement as expected.
