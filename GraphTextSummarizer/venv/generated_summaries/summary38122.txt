Officers fired tear gas into a crowd of hundreds of protester, including children, who were marching toward a police command post despite an impending midnight curfew. " Michael Brown's parents -- Lesley McSpadden and Michael Brown Sr.  -- appeared on stage at the rally at Greater Grace Church with attorney Benjamin Crump but didn't address the audience. St. Louis County police said several protesters had thrown Molotov cocktails toward the officers before authorities shot tear gas toward them. Michael Brown was shot at least six times, according to the preliminary results of a private autopsy that his family requested. The scene was a far cry from a packed church earlier Sunday, where hundreds of people gathered for a two-hour rally demanding justice for Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager shot dead eight days ago by a white police officer.
