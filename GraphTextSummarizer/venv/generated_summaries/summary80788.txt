-- Rapper Gucci Mane made his first court appearance Wednesday on charges of aggravated assault and aggravated battery in connection with an alleged attack at an Atlanta night club, the Fulton County Sheriff's Office said. Mane, whose real name is Radric Davis, was denied bond, authorities said, and he will remain in the Fulton County Jail until April 10. Mane, 33, is accused of hitting a man over the head with a champagne bottle at Atlanta's Harlem Nights Ultra Lounge club. I wanted to get a picture with Gucci Mane," he told CNN affiliate WSB-TV in Atlanta. "I was speaking to the security guard, and Gucci Mane hit me in the head with a bottle."
