While the number of young drivers involved in fatal crashes has dropped significantly over the past decade, 15- to 20-year-old drivers were at the wheel in 10% of deadly accidents in 2010, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration's latest numbers. Mourners left notes for the teens, several of whom were students at Warren schools. Grief counselors visited local schools Monday to help students and staff with the emotional aftermath. Brian Holt said Monday that weather was not a factor in what he called the deadliest traffic accident in Trumbull County history -- and the worst in Ohio in at least three years. "We actually had some of the students who were siblings of some of the deceased, and they came to school today, and I think they needed that support," Warren schools Superintendent Michael Notar said at a news conference Monday, fighting back tears at times.
