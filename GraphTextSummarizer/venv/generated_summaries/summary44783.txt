A monument to the dead now stands where Paddy's Bar used to be, but Britten and other survivors want to see the Bali Peace Park, a place of reflection for those killed, built on the Sari site. Phil Britten was there with his team mates from the Kingsley Cats, Australian rules football players on an end of season trip from Perth, on the country's west coast. New Zealand, Brazil, Canada and Japan also lost citizens, as did South Africa, South Korea and Ecuador. "I can pay my respects to Sando here, I don't need to go to Bali and see what hasn't been done," Nicholson said from his home in Forbes, a town of just 8,500 people in rural New South Wales. While some may see the 10 year mark as a time to let go, Britten says, for him, the significance of the date won't fade over time.
