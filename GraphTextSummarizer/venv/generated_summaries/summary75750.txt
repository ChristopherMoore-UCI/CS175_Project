But Urschel acknowledges that he has faced questions from NFL officials, journalists, fans and fellow mathematicians about why he runs the risk of potential brain injury from playing football when he has "a bright career ahead of me in mathematics." But besides his endeavors on the field, Urschel also keeps up another demanding pursuit that is rarely associated with NFL players: mathematical research. He shared his thoughts after San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland announced last week that he was retiring from professional football at age 24 because he was worried about the long-term effects of head trauma. "I have a Bachelor's and Master's in mathematics, all with a 4.0, and numerous published papers in major mathematical journals," Urschel wrote in a recent article for The Players' Tribune. As word of his double life spread on social media in recent days, users responded with fascination and admiration.
