Sen. Barack Obama has a broad spectrum of candidates as potential running mates. Ticker: Obama beats back criticism over head of VP search Obama said last week that he would not respond to pressure from others about his choice of a running mate. Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, said that some of those considered are "top officials now," others are "former lawmakers" and others are "former top military leaders." He said many of the names already have been "bandied about" in the media, but others were "outside the box." Other possible front-runners include former presidential hopefuls Joe Biden, Chris Dodd, Bill Richardson and John Edwards. And ever since New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg ruled out his own independent bid for the presidency, he's been seen as a potential running mate for both Obama and John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee.
