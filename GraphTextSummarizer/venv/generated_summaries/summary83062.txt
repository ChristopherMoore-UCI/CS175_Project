"There's a problem that's very prevalent in some countries where boy babies are greatly preferred for cultural reasons and aborting girl babies is very common," said Anthony Lauinger, vice president of National Right to Life. "When a parent can visualize the sex of their baby and confirm they have that little person inside of them, it suddenly becomes real to them," said Jennifer Parks, co-director of Loyola University Chicago's Programs in Health Care Ethics. "Most parents have a great degree of curiosity to find out if they're having a boy or a girl, and it can be so excruciating to wait until the 20-week sonogram to find out," IntelliGender co-founder Rebecca Griffin said. With IntelliGender's home gender prediction test, a urine specimen turns orange if it's a girl. Green is for boys.
