The tragic news that Kayla Mueller, an American woman being held hostage by ISIS, has been confirmed dead has once again raised the question of how the United States and others should respond to hostage taking. There's no question that negotiating with terror groups, paying ransoms, incentivizes these activities, undermines America's credibility, sets terrible precedents and encourages copycats and more terror. The most obvious exception to the U.S. government's rule on negotiating was the Reagan administration's efforts during the 1980s to seek the return of hostages held by Lebanese Shia groups, famously revealed in the Iran Contra affair. But it should -- in the event there are real opportunities to redeem hostages -- look the other way, if not facilitate the efforts of private individuals or family members who can raise funds to secure the release of family members? Sure nobody wants to give in to terror and enable more hostage taking.
