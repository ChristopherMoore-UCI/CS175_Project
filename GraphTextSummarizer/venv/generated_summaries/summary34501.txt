In a posting on one of its Web pages, the group claimed it would target live streams of the speech, to be broadcast on the official White House site as well as many major news websites, including CNN. None of the major news feeds or the official White House site showed any signs of disruption or delay during the speech. The group's call to action also mentioned the recent death of Internet activist Aaron Swartz, the National Defense Authorization Act, the use of military drones, Bradley Manning and warrantless wiretapping. Anonymous objects to such sharing, saying it would turn "private companies into government informants." The bill attempts to address cyberattacks by increasing the sharing of information between private companies and the Department of Homeland Security.
