Brazilian football players protested Wednesday and said they could take more action -- possibly "drastic measures" -- if their confederation doesn't make changes to the country's overcrowded calendar. According to Brazilian media, the future measures could include players crossing their arms for a longer period of time, wearing red clown noses or even halting a game. In a statement, Common Sense F.C. -- not a club but a movement symbolizing the changes the players want -- said on its Facebook page: "If there are attempts to prevent players from expressing themselves in a peaceful way, drastic measures will be taken. And in some instances, they passed the ball from one end of the field to the other after the referees threatened to give players yellow cards. They want, among other things, more vacation time, longer preseasons, fewer games and a bigger voice in decision making.
