Tech Check will be hosted most weeks by producer and writer Doug Gross, with a rotating cast of characters that include writer John D. Sutter, associate producer and tech-section contributor Stephanie Goldberg, tech section producer Brandon Griggs and writer Mark Milian, checking in from CNN's San Francisco bureau. Topics regularly covered by the Tech Check team include social networking, technology innovation, mobile phones and other gadgets, video gaming and the internet at large. The podcast will be streamed every Friday morning on CNN.com/TECH,  in an RSS feed and on CNN.com's podcast page, and be available on iTunes for free download. The weekly podcast offers a roundup of the week's technology news, with members of CNN.com's tech team working to make sense of, and sometimes make light of, the top stories from the digital world. The breezy, quick-hitting podcast uses a roundtable format to break down the latest from Apple, Google, Facebook and other technology-related newsmakers, with a focus on consumer news.
