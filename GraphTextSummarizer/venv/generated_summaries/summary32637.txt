-- North Korea threatened to conduct a nuclear test and more ballistic missile tests if the U.N. Security Council doesn't withdraw its condemnation of Pyongyang's rocket launch earlier this month, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. North Korea has begun reprocessing fuel rods, its Foreign Ministry said Saturday, according to state-run media. North Korea, angered by the Security Council's unanimous vote, has threatened to walk away from the six-party talks aimed at disarming the country of nuclear weapons. The six-party talks -- involving China, Japan, North Korea, Russia, South Korea and the United States -- have been aimed at persuading North Korea to scrap its nuclear program.
