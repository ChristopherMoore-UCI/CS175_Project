Though he's often thought of in the West as an experimenter and collaborator -- with guitarist George Harrison, violinist Yehudi Menuhin, saxophonist John Coltrane, composer Phillip Glass and conductor Andre Previn -- Shankar was a traditionalist. If there was a musician who transcended the difficult boundaries between East and West, it was sitar maestro Ravi Shankar. "Harrison dubbed Shankar the "godfather of world music." Shankar's music moved from introspective to playful. The lights dimmed and Shankar's music filled the air, mellifluous and luscious like the rich silk of a Benarasi sari.
