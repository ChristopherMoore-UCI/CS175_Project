The Times story went on to say that during the six years between Bennett's trial and his execution, eight other black soldiers were executed -- but the six white prisoners on death row lived. A 2012 study that analyzed racial disparity in military death penalty cases between 1984 and 2005 found minorities were twice as likely as whites to be given the death penalty, a finding considerably higher than in civilian courts, said Catherine Grosso of Michigan State University's College of Law, a co-author of the study. "The biggest concern with the military death penalty was that it fell disproportionately on African-American soldiers," says Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military justice at Yale Law School. Bennett was black, the Austrian girl was white, and Bennett's defense was "brief and ineffective," the Times reported. Apart from the Times story, few news outlets appear to have written about Bennett, an indigent son of a Virginia sharecropper.
