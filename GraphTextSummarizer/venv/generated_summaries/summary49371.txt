CNN spoke to TNT NBA analyst Steve Kerr about the excitement around this week's league openers and the economic clouds looming next season. LeBron James' decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to join the Miami Heat and fellow stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, fueled passionate off-season conversation about him and the league. It takes some time for the team to find its identity and find their roles especially with Dwyane Wade injured for most of the pre-season. While the focus this season is what will take place on the court, there are financial issues looming for the NBA that many expect will result in a work stoppage next season. Will this result in people seeing a different side of LeBron James, perhaps not the carefree kid they saw for many years in Cleveland?
