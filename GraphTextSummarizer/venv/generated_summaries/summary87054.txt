While Armstrong didn't invent the culture of doping in cycling, he said, he admitted not acting to prevent it either. "We will shortly be asking Mr. Armstrong to return his medal to us, so that we can return it to the IOC." But in April, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency notified Armstrong of an investigation into new doping charges. She later testified about the incident and began cooperating with a reporter working on a book about doping allegations against Armstrong. In 2011, Armstrong retired once more from cycling.
