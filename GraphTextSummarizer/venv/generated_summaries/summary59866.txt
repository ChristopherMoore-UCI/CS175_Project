Only 5% of Weibo users generate original posts, while the rest of the Chinese micro-blogging world just re-posts from them, according to research by Fu King-wa from the University of Hong Kong. Yeo pointed to one of the earliest and most often cited studies on the so-called "free-riding" of Internet users, where the Gnutella network -- a popular peer-to-peer file-sharing service -- was scrutinized to reveal that 70% of users share no files, and nearly 50% of all responses are returned by the top 1% of sharing hosts. For Weibo, users specifically join the community to share other users' interesting posts with their friends," he added. "The value of Weibo comes from having many users re-posting a particular item," he said. In contrast, Weibo claims it has 130 million active users but does not say whether these users post original content.
