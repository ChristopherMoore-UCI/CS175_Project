When Barcelona clinched their 22nd La Liga title last season, club captain Carles Puyol stepped aside to allow Vilanova and Abidal to initially lift the trophy in recognition of their brave battles against illness. Tito Vilanova stepped down as Barcelona coach Friday after the Spanish champions revealed he needed fresh treatment in his battle against cancer. The 44-year-old Vilanova led the Catalan giants to the La Liga title last season after succeeding Pep Guardiola in June 2012. Vilanova, a long-time assistant to Guardiola, had first been diagnosed with a cancerous tumor of the throat in November 2011, but after having initial treatment returned to work in less than three weeks. He was appointed to the top job when his old boss quit and under his charge Barcelona made a storming start to last season.
