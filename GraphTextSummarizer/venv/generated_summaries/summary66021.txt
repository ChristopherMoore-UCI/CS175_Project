So football fanatics from that African nation will certainly have a vested interest in their team's Saturday World Cup game against Bosnia and Herzegovina. -- More than a week into the tournament, diehard World Cup fans are losing sleep and falling down on their jobs as they yell at their TV and computer screens. Those figures dwarf other nations, including World Cup host Brazil -- where 67% are fans and 28% play. That mindset remains year-round for Dan Gaspar, the Portuguese-American goalkeeping coach for team Iran -- which goes up against Argentina. Conditions for Germany and Ghana, on the other hand, look like they'll be 67 degrees with 76% humidity; Nigeria and Bosnia and Herzegovina will face 86 degrees and about 61% humidity.
