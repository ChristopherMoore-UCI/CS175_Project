As of Monday, charities had raised more than $210 million in donations for Haiti earthquake relief, according to the Chronicle of Philanthropy, a newspaper covering nonprofit organizations. A magnitude 5.8 earthquake struck off the coast of the Cayman Islands, 600 miles west of Haiti, on Tuesday morning, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. Although aid organization Doctors Without Borders is "facing huge problems" in receiving supplies, it is doing what it can to get work done, said Renzo Fricke, the group's chief of Haiti operations. 3:03 p.m. -- Twenty-eight Americans have been confirmed dead in Haiti since last week's earthquake, according to U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley. Ena Zizi, the woman in her 70s who was rescued from rubble in Port-au-Prince today, has been airlifted by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter to the USS Bataan, CNN's Ivan Watson reports.
