"I wanted to get the essence of adventure, the wilderness, the challenge, the escape from urban life, all these things that are really important to me, and condense them down into something small and achievable for normal people with real lives. "Microadventures are my attempt to try to help normal people in the real world get the enjoyment out of adventures that I've had over many years," Humphreys explains. While early 20th century explorers such as Ernest Shackleton and Robert Scott were discovering uncharted territories, Humphreys concedes that modern adventures mostly provide more personal achievements. "Now it's just more the curiosity of going to new places and the simplicity of life when you're out on an expedition, and the contrast of the life out in the wild to the real world back home -- the urban, busy, hectic life which I also enjoy. While he loves the solitude of being alone in the great outdoors, Humphreys also appreciates being able to share the experience -- as he did with two friends when they went to Greenland in 2012.
