Lawmakers are slated to vote on the privatization plan and further tax increases, pension cuts and layoffs on June 30, and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso warned Greece risks being abandoned by both Europe and the International Monetary Fund if it fails to act. On Sunday, international lenders demanded that Greece stick with tough austerity measures and raise billions of euros by selling off state assets in exchange for further support. Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said Tuesday he was encouraged by bipartisan support he received from main opposition leader Antonis Samaras on the austerity plan, which Venizelos said he would take to Eurogroup ministers July 3. -- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's reshuffled Cabinet survived a vote of confidence early Wednesday despite widespread opposition to budget cuts he says are needed to prevent a government default. International lenders have demanded Greece cut spending, lay off public workers, raise taxes and raise 50 billion euros ($71 billion) through selling off state-owned enterprises in exchange for another bailout deal for the cash-strapped nation.
