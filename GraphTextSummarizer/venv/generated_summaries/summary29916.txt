A nationwide network of "social leadership" committees set up by Gadhafi in 1993 and composed primarily of traditional leaders and tribal leaders could seek to take charge, according to Ronald Bruce St John, who has written seven books on Libya. Gadhafi tried without success to eliminate the more than 100 tribes in Libya between 1969 and 1980, St John said. They say they're united by one mission -- to topple the regime of Col. Moammar Gadhafi. Libya has long been a patchwork of tribes and rival sects, kept largely intact in the grip of Gadhafi's autocratic regime. Traditionally, opposition to Gadhafi has been hampered by the fact that Libya's sense of national identity is "very weak," according to Robert Danin, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.
