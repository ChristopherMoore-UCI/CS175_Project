Max Page: Meet the face behind the Force "Max is out of surgery and he's doing well," said his surgeon, Dr. Vaughn Starnes at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles. -- Max Page, the 7-year-old who played a mini Darth Vader in a Volkswagen commercial, is recovering from open heart surgery, his doctor and mother said Thursday. Max is known for playing the role of a mini Darth Vader character who goes around his parents' house trying to use "the Force" on various household items without much success. Max underwent the surgery to replace a pulmonary heart valve. Max's family waited in the lounge next door during surgery, his mother said, adding that his younger brother Els made him a special recovery pillow and offered a silent prayer by Max's side once the operation was complete.
