-- For days, the wounded just kept coming to the 60-bed central hospital in Misrata, a city under siege from forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The coalition began airstrikes last Saturday and has been able to establish a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya's coastline. Six were killed Thursday by Gadhafi's rooftop snipers -- unseen but too often precise. People flooded the hospital, wounded in war that has raged between the opposition and Gadhafi's forces. But Gadhafi's forces are far from defeated.
