The vote unfolded amid political intrigue, with some analysts suggesting that opponents of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad are trying to trigger a vote of confidence in the government by impeaching the interior minister. If Kordan resigns, he will be the 10th minister in Ahmadinejad's cabinet to leave the government for various reasons. -- Iran's parliament voted Tuesday to impeach Interior Minister Ali Kordan for listing a fake doctorate degree on his resume. Although it is difficult to confirm details of political machinations in Tehran, some have suggested that Ahmadinejad's opponents were using the impeachment in a strategy to destabilize Ahmadinejad's administration ahead of June's presidential election. Ahmadinejad's term is up next year, but he is expected to seek another four years in office in the June election.
