Writing skills, general management experience, technical and computer skills, people smarts, and international experience or language skills are examples of skills with what we call high option value -- that is, they are transferable to a wide range of possible options. Make a plan to develop skills and experiences that are broadly useful to potential other jobs. They aggressively seek and create breakout opportunities that involve focused risk, and actively manage that risk. In the early days of LinkedIn, the plan was to have members invite their trusted connections by email -- an invitation mechanism that would fuel membership growth. Lunging at the first well-paid and/or high-status job you come upon may offer immediate gratification, but it won't get you any closer to building a meaningful career.
