Moving forward, it's important to note that television is a collaborative medium, and there may be an element that changes from season to season, but the core group, the core people that make "The Walking Dead" what it is, changes a little bit from season to season. AMC's popular zombie series resumes on Sunday, and CNN spoke with Robert Kirkman, executive producer and creator of the original comic book series, about what fans can expect for the last half of season 3, life after outgoing showrunner Glen Mazzara and how long even the undead can survive the apocalypse on TV. When you look at season 3, sure, Glenn's there, Rick's there, Daryl Dixon's there -- but they're vastly different than they were in season 1. As a television fan, when I see things like "American Horror Story," these kind of crazy shows that you wouldn't expect to see on television, things like "The Following" -- it's really exciting to see all this new stuff coming in. I work hand-in-hand with all the other executive producers and Glen Mazzara in season 3 and craft the show into what it is.
