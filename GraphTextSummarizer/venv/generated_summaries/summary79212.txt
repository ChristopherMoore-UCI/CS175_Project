The FCCC said it was "appalled" by the decision to block Chan's visa application, which it called "the most extreme example of a recent pattern of using journalist visas in an attempt to censor and intimidate foreign correspondents in China." He added: "We have been dealing with relevant media and foreign journalists in accordance with relevant laws and regulations as well as the actual performance of the journalist." Chan, a U.S. citizen, is thought to be the first accredited foreign correspondent to lose the right to report in China since the expulsion of Yukihisa Nakatsu, a reporter for Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, in October 1998. The U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) urged China to "immediately grant" a visa to Al Jazeera English correspondents, adding that the refusal to approve Chan's application "marks a real deterioration in China's media environment. "At the same time," he said, "foreign journalists should abide by Chinese laws and regulations while reporting in China and follow the professional ethics." "To our knowledge, she operated and reported in accordance with Chinese law, including regulations that permit foreign journalists to operate freely in China."
