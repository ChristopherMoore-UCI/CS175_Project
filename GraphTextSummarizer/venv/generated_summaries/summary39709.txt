So, too, does another underlying issue: the Kurdish/Arab dispute along a lengthy confrontation line in northern Iraq, where the Kurdistan Regional Government and its Peshmerga military forces claim territory that lies beyond the territory Iraqi Kurdistan controlled during the Saddam Hussein period. Another option is the Strategic Framework Agreement, a bilateral commitment to continued U.S. cooperation with Iraq that the Iraqis sought and continue to think important. Fully implemented, it would be little short of an alliance relationship with Iraq, one that would encourage foreign investment and open up economic, educational and cultural opportunities for Iraqis. The most obvious vehicle for this is a new U.N. Security Council resolution, but getting one is complicated by the fact that Iraq wants an existing Security Council resolution lifted. The American troops have de facto guaranteed for the past seven years that some sort of broad, representative democracy would continue in Iraq.
