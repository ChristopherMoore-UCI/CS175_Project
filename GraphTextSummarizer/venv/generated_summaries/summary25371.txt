"This is why these type of projects are much more than feel-good gimmicks, they are absolutely vital as part of a diverse array of sustainable agriculture systems that we must pursue further," says Olivier de Schutter, the U.N.'s special rapporteur on the right to food. "If you're growing food directly where it's eaten, there's less refrigeration ... less energy use through transport and distribution," claims Smyth. He says FARM:shop could be scaled up and replicated in cities around the world to help reduce the enormous carbon emissions linked to food production.

"I think places like FARM:shop can reconnect people with their food," says engineer and co-founder Paul Smyth.
