Almeria scored four first-half goals in a 4-3 win at Mallorca to advance win 8-6 on aggregate while Villarreal made it to the last eight after after beating Valencia 4-2 following their goalless draw in the first leg. Levante's two second-half goals by Xisco Nadal and Sergio Gonzalez were not enough to overturn Real's massive first leg advantage, but it was a boost for the Valencia-based side after an 8-0 first leg rout in the Bernabeu. Barcelona, held 0-0 at home in the first leg, went through on away goals. But Real Betis put out top-flight Getafe with a 3-1 win that wiped the Madrid's club's 2-1 advantage from last month's first leg. League leaders Barcelona secured their place in the quarterfinals on Wednesday with French international defender Eric Abidal scoring in the 1-1 second leg draw at Athletic Bilboa.
