" Owen is not alone when it comes to a love of football and horses -- trainer Mick Channon played for Southampton and Manchester City as well as England. " Owen remains connected to football, working as a media pundit for broadcasters such as BT Sport -- which is threatening to break Sky Sports' dominance of UK coverage after landing big-money deals for the Premier League and UEFA Champions League. Then there is Owen's former manager at Manchester United, Alex Ferguson, who has an interest in a number of horses, which means he is often seen on racecourses around the country. " Owen retired from football in March 2013 following an illustrious career in which he played for several of Europe's top clubs and scored 40 goals in 89 international appearances for England. " Owen's own horse, Brown Panther, has enjoyed success in England and finished eighth at Australia's Melbourne Cup in November 2013.
