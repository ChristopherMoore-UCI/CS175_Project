The decision followed more than 10 hours of talks between government ministers and indigenous Aymara leaders as the two sides tried to put an end to an indefinite strike that has gripped Puno for a month. "If the communities don't want mining, it can't be forced," said Fernando Gala, vice minister of mines. According to the mine ministry, Puno receives 700 million soles ($250 million) annually from the government, of which about 40% is from mining royalties. The move comes after five people were killed and 25 injured in clashes with police as protesters tried to take over Manco Capac International Airport in the Puno city of Juliaca. She called for residents of Puno and two other areas where violent protests have taken hold -- Huancavelica and Huancayo -- to restore calm and assume an attitude of "democracy and dialogue."
