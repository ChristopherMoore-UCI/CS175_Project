-- Legislation providing for government-funded contraception and sex education classes in the Philippines will take effect in mid-January, according to a spokeswoman for President Benigno Aquino. Aquino signed the bill on December 21, deputy presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte said in a statement released Saturday. Passage of the bill closed a divisive chapter in the country's history, said Valte, according to the official Philippines News Agency. More than 80% of the Philippines' 96 million residents are Catholic. Despite widespread popular support, the Catholic Church opposed the measure, saying it will destroy marriage and morality in the Philippines.
