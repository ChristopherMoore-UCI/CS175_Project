But Agassi and Graf did pair up last year to play in a special mixed doubles match against Tim Henman and Kim Clijsters to christen the new roof at Wimbledon. He retired in 2006 but made the headlines again last year with the publication of his explosive autobiography "Open" in which he admitted failing a drugs test in 1997, but said it came at a period when his personal life was in turmoil. On Wednesday May 19, CNN's World Sport Anchor Candy Reid will interview husband and wife tennis legends Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf in Las Vegas and it will be your chance to pose questions like these, and others of your own. He won his first grand slam title at Wimbledon in 1992 and claimed eight in total, completing a grand slam of the four majors with victory at the 1999 French Open. Like his wife, Agassi also reached world number one and secured Olympic singles gold in Atlanta in 1996.
