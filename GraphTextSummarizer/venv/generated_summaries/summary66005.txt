In a letter to Tomislav Karadzic, President of the FSS, Valcke said: "We would like to stress that the FIFA Executive Committee made clear that such authorization does not constitute a step towards FIFA membership, which depends on other considerations. "In particular, and according to both the current and draft statutes of FIFA, as long as (Football Federation of Kosovo) is not a member of UEFA it cannot be a member of FIFA. "Hence we will ask for an urgent meeting with FIFA President Sepp Blatter and his UEFA counterpart Michel Platini to demand a reverse of this unjustified decision which could have far-reaching consequences across the region. "We strongly protest the decision by FIFA's executive committee to allow the world soccer governing body's members to play friendly matches with the so-called national team of the so-called Republic of Kosovo," the FSS said. Kosovo may not be recognized by the United Nations but the region has taken a giant leap towards acceptance in the soccer world thanks to FIFA's decision to allow its national team to play in international matches.
