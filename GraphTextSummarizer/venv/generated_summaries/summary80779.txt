The little information that has surfaced has been through 911 tapes, what Zimmerman told police and the accounts of witnesses who helped paint a picture of the night Martin died. Martin asked Zimmerman if he had a problem; Zimmerman said no and reached for his cell phone, he told police. George Zimmerman Zimmerman was wearing a red jacket and blue jeans when he came across Martin on that night. " Martin's girlfriend Benjamin Crump, the Martin family lawyer, says Martin's girlfriend's account of what happened connects the dots and destroys Zimmerman's claims of self-defense. By the time police arrived on the scene, Martin was dead from a gunshot wound in the chest, according to Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee.
