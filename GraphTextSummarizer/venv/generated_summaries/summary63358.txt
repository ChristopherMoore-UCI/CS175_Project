-- A Harvard-educated legal expert was elected head of Tibet's government-in-exile on Wednesday, filling the shoes of the Dalai Lama who said last month he was going to give up his political role. Lobsang Sangay got 55% of the vote, beating two other candidates for the post of Kalon Tripa, or prime minister. In March, the Dalai Lama announced his plan to retire as political head of the Tibetan exile movement, saying Tibetans needed an elected leader "to whom I can devolve power." In May, Tibetan representatives will meet to discuss the Dalai Lama's proposal of political retirement. The exile group is headquartered in Dharamsala in northern India.
