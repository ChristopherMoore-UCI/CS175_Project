Authorities seized computer equipment and questioned the teen, said New Zealand Police Detective Inspector Peter Devoy, but the person has not been identified, arrested or charged. -- A New Zealand teenager has been questioned in connection with a scheme by hackers to remotely take over more than 1 million computers worldwide and use them for criminal activity, New Zealand police and the FBI said Thursday. Personal computers can be compromised when users open an attachment, click on an advertisement or give personal information to a "phishing" site, or a fake site that looks legitimate. Since June, eight people have been charged or convicted of crimes related to botnet activity. FBI Director Robert Mueller says botnets are "the weapon of choice for cyber criminals."
