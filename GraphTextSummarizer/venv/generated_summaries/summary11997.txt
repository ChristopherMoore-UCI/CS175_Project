The North Korean proposal did not, however, mention anything about the North's controversial nuclear and missile programs, which lie at the heart of the tensions surrounding North Korea. South Korea reacted quickly and positively to the offer, noting that it had been "continuously" seeking talks on Kaesong since the North shut it down. South Korean officials didn't immediately respond to the North's latest statement Friday. In early April, Kim Jong Un's regime began blocking South Koreans from entering the manufacturing complex, which sits on the North's side of the heavily fortified border and houses the operations of more than 120 South Korean companies. "South Korea and its allies in the international community demonstrated their resolve and unwillingness to back down in the face of North Korean rhetoric."
