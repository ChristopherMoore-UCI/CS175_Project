Spain's Champions League woes continued as Sevilla were beaten 2-1 at home by CSKA Moscow to go out at the first knockout stage 3-2 on aggregate. Tomas Necid put CSKA ahead in the 39th minute lead only for Argentine Diego Perotti to equalize two minutes later and level the tie 2-2 on aggregate. " Sevilla, who drew 1-1 in Moscow and looked favorites to go through, fielded a defensive line-up as coach Manolo Jimenez opted to leave the likes of Negredo and Mali star Frederic Kanoute on the bench. "Of course it is a real shame to go out but we have to bounce back from this," home striker Alvaro Negredo told AFP. A disastrous goalkeeping error from their captain Andres Palop sealed Moscow's passage to the quarterfinals, the first time a Russian team has reached that stage in over a decade.
