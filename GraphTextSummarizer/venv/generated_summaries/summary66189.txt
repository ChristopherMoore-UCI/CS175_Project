"The additional attention that social media has given the sport offers women additional outlets to access the tournament that they may not have traditionally had", says Stacy Torres, a doctoral student in Sociology at New York University. "Now women can follow the games more independently with social media and unprecedented streaming options," added Torres, an avid Chile fan who has written about the experience of being a Chile fan at the World Cup for New Republic. Of the people talking about Costa Rica's 1-0 surprise win over Italy in the group stages, 44% of them were women, while Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina has over 27,487 mentions on social media, with 61% of them women. Facebook statistics show female interest in teams considered World Cup underdogs -- such as Iran, Colombia, the U.S and Costa Rica -- is well over 40% in the number of posts mentioning those countries. Iran received over 472,927 social mentions, with 43% of those coming from women, while of the 3.25 million mentions relating to Costa Rica, 46% were from female contributors.
