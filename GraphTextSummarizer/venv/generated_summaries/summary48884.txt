The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. Anyone born in Britain on the same day as William and Catherine's baby will receive a special coin from the Royal Mint: a silver penny, dated 2013, that will come in a blue pouch for a boy or a pink one for a girl. The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William, regardless of gender. â€¢ William and Catherine did not want to know the sex of their baby beforehand, royal sources say.
