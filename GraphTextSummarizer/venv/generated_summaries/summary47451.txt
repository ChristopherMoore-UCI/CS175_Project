"Over the last nine months, Penn State has made a commitment to becoming a leader in the research, prevention and treatment of child sexual abuse, and we have taken a number of steps to ensure that our communities are safer," Penn State President Rodney Erickson said in a message promoting the conference. The conference will be held on October 29-30 and comes after the well-publicized scandal that culminated with the conviction of Sandusky, a former assistant Penn State football coach on multiple charges of sexual abuse of young boys. Penn State has had its share of bad headlines since Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of child sex abuse against 10 male victims. Former senator to be integrity monitor for Penn State athletics Jordana Ossad contributed to this report. In the aftermath of the Jerry Sandusky scandal, embattled Penn State University is hosting a sexual abuse conference and says boxer Sugar Ray Leonard and Elizabeth Smart will give speeches.
