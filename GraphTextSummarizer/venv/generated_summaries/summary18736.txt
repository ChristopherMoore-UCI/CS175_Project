"President Obama welcomes President Santos' deep commitment to working for peace and recognizes the courage and sacrifice of successive Colombian governments -- and most especially of the Colombian people -- in achieving this milestone," the White House said. Critics, including former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe, say it is impossible to hold peace talks without a unilateral ceasefire by the guerrillas. Colombia's government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, have signed a framework for the talks, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said in a televised address Tuesday. -- Peace talks to negotiate an end to Latin America's oldest insurgency will begin in October in Oslo, Norway, officials said Tuesday. In a video statement recorded in Colombia's mountains and broadcast to reporters in Havana, the leftist guerrilla group's leader thanked the governments of Venezuela, Cuba and Norway for facilitating the agreement to begin peace talks.
