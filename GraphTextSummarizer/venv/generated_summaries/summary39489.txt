Air pollution in China has gotten so bad lately that one environmentalist's wacky idea for a solution doesn't seem all that far-fetched: putting clean air in a can. Fixing China's air pollution is not just about the country's image or economy, although those certainly suffer because of smog, too. An environmental official, Wu Xiaoqing, also told state media this week that "China will formulate regulations, standards and policies to reduce air pollutants and control coal burning." Such creative and public protests should help push forward much-needed national reforms to combat air pollution in the country. Air pollution in Los Angeles was handled in a similar fashion.
