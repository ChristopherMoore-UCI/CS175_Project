-- Independence for South Sudan is around the corner, but new satellite images released Wednesday reveal a heavy north Sudanese military presence in an oil-rich border region. "South Sudan will be born into crisis," said Susan Purdin, who oversees International Rescue Committee aid programs in South Sudan. Peter Wittig, the U.N. ambassador of Germany, which holds the rotating Security Council presidency this month, said Council members will meet July 13, four days after South Sudan's independence ceremony, to talk about U.N. admission. "This cycle will continue to be played out with increasingly destructive results for Sudanese civilians until the international community stiffens its spine and imposes swift and severe repercussions for the endless cycle of violence the Khartoum regime continues to fuel. Southerners voted for independence in a January referendum, and with the scheduled July 9 date of separation looming, many fear an escalation of bloodshed could bring both sides back to the brink of full scale war.
