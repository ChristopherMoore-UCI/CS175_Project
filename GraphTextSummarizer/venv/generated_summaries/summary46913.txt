"This last week is all about keeping your cool." Watson became the youngest person ever to sail around the world non-stop and unassisted last year. -- While many teenagers will be focusing on opening presents and eating turkey, this Christmas Day Jessica Watson will be poring over weather maps. Watson says sailing down to Hobart and back last month gave them the confidence they need going into the race. Now aged 18, Watson will skipper the youngest-ever crew in the ocean race. "We've ticked all the boxes", says Watson.
