The Islamist militant group -- whose name means "Western education is sin" in the local Hausa language -- has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders. In that blast, about 130 people were hurt when a parked vehicle exploded in the Nyanya Motor Park bus station crowded with early morning commuters. While security agencies cordoned off the area, response agencies said they moved injured victims to hospitals and bodies to the mortuary. Nigerian radio called for people to donate blood for those with injuries. Eleven unconscious victims received medical attention in different hospitals.
