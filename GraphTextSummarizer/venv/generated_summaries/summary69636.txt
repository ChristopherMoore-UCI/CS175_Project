Seattle authorities arrested McCullough, who also used the name John Tessier, on murder charges filed in DeKalb County, Illinois, DeKalb County State's Attorney Clay Campbell said in a news release on Friday. After serving in the military, McCullough worked at the Lacey Police Department as an officer in the 1970s, said Ed Sorger, the chief of police at Evergreen State College. Her story captured national headlines and the attention of President Dwight D. Eisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, according to news accounts published at the time. The suspect's neighbors and a former colleague in Washington say they cannot reconcile the man charged with murder as the man they knew as John Tessier. -- A Seattle-area judge ordered Jack Daniel McCullough to be held Saturday pending a bail hearing after he was arrested by authorities in connection with the 1957 kidnapping and murder of an Illinois girl.
