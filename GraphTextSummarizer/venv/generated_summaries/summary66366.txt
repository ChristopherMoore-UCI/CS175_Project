-- Cristiano Ronaldo has consistently been linked with a move back to Manchester United -- but Real Madrid star Mesut Ozil insists his club must hold onto the player if it is to challenge at the very top. But Real are unlikely to be deterred with Bale exactly the type of player new coach Carlo Ancelotti could utilize as he attempts to increase the tempo of Real's play. Ozil will be hoping to guarantee his own place in Ancelotti's side and the 24-year-old has been taking advice from former Real legend Zinedine Zidane. "Zidane was one of my idols when I was growing up so it was great to have a chance to meet him at Real Madrid," Ozil added. "Ancelotti has his own football philosophy," added Ozil of the man Perez chose to succeed Jose Mourinho.
