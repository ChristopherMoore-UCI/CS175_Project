Democrats led by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada framed the debate as historic and said the bill would provide vital health insurance for almost all Americans, hold down spiraling costs that threaten the U.S. economy and instill needed reforms to ensure the long-term solvency of the government-run Medicare health program for senior citizens. It also reported that health insurance premiums would remain roughly the same for most people, with costs for lower-income Americans reduced due to subsidies under the plan. In statements laced with heated and conflicting rhetoric, Senate Democrats and Republicans outlined opposing positions on the 2,074-page Democratic measure that would provide health insurance to an additional 31 million people at a cost of almost $850 billion. "In the greatest country on Earth, no American should die simply because they don't have health insurance," said Sen. Max Baucus of Montana, one of the bill's architects, while Reid said the bill "saves money, saves lives and saves Medicare. Both the Senate and House bills would require individuals to buy health insurance, with penalties for noncompliance.
