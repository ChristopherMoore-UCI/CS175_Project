-- The trial of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy got off to a raucous start Monday, with a judge twice pausing what was supposed to be a brief opening hearing as Morsy and his co-defendants loudly spoke over him, rejecting the charges and claiming Morsy still is the rightful ruler. "I am Dr. Mohamed Morsy, the President of the republic," Morsy said. Morsy became Egypt's first freely elected President in 2012 after the overthrow of longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak. Before Morsy and the judge entered the room, some of his seven co-defendants chanted "down with military rule" and "Morsy is my President" from the dock. And the recesses were hardly calmer -- while the judge was away, journalists who were calling for Morsy's execution argued with defense lawyers.
