The troops staged their rebellion on the second day of BDR Week, when officers and troops from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. -- Human rights groups in Bangladesh and abroad are calling for an investigation after 16 borders guards accused of participating in a bloody revolt in February died in custody in recent days. Some of the suspects who died in custody had wounds on their bodies consisted with torture, Human Rights Watch said. When the standoff ended, more than 70 people were found dead -- the majority of them army officers. "Torture is a regular 'investigative technique' in Bangladesh and killing of detains in government custody is an endemic problem."
