-- Maria Sharapova set up a U.S. Open semifinal clash with world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka after battling past French 11th seed Marion Bartoli on Wednesday. They have reached the semifinals of the doubles event in New York, and next week Errani will be ranked as the format's top player for the first time, with Vinci No. 2. " Sharapova will be seeking revenge for her thrashing by Azarenka in the final of the opening grand slam of the season in Australia, but has lost four successive matches in straight sets to the Belorussian on hard courts. She has now won 12 successive times in matches that have gone to three sets since her third-round defeat in New York last year, and 24 out of 25 since the start of 2011. Third seed Sharapova was taken to three sets by the 2007 Wimbledon finalist, who had raced to a 4-0 lead in the first set when their quarterfinal match was halted by rain on Tuesday.
