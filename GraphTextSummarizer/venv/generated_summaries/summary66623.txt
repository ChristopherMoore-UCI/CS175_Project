Among the honors he received, the release said, were the Fatherhood Award from the National Fatherhood Initiative, the Sikh's International Man of Peace Award, and The National Entrepreneur of the Year Lifetime Award for Entrepreneurial Leadership. He founded Covey Leadership Center, which in 1997 merged with Franklin Quest to create FranklinCovey Co. "From the time of the merger to his retirement from the board last year, Dr. Covey devoted essentially all of his time and effort to writing and teaching," FranklinCovey said in a news release. Author Stephen Covey, whose "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People" sold more than 20 million copies, died Monday at Eastern Idaho Regional Medical Center, a hospital spokeswoman said. Covey held a bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Utah, a master's in business administration from Harvard and a doctorate from Brigham Young University.
