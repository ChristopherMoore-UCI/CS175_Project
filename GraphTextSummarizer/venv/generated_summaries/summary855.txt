-- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and midfielder Samir Nasri have both been charged with improper conduct by governing body UEFA following the London club's European Champions League elimination at the hands of Barcelona on Tuesday. At that point the match was level at 1-1 after Lionel Messi had given Barca the lead on the stroke of half time, only for makeshift defender Sergio Busquets to head the ball into his own net in the second half. "UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Arsenal FC coach Arsene Wenger and the English club's midfielder Samir Nasri," read a UEFA statement. The French duo are alleged to have made comments to Swiss referee Massimo Busacca after Barcelona's 3-1 second leg win at the Camp Nou on Tuesday. The Gunners were angered by Busacca's decision to issue Dutchman Robin van Persie with a second yellow card in the 56th minute for kicking the ball away following an offside decision, although the striker claimed to have not heard the referee's whistle.
