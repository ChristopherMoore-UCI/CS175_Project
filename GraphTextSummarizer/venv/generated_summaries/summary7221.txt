Shadow foreign minister Ian Lucas, of the opposition Labour Party, said the motion would be supported by his party but that the timing and manner of deciding whether to recognize Palestinian statehood was a matter for the current coalition government. " In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly voted to grant the status of "non-member observer state," similar to the Vatican, giving Palestinians a certain implicit degree of statehood recognition. However, it lends added weight within Europe to calls for Palestinian statehood. We are clear that Palestinian statehood is not a gift to be given, but a right to be recognized," he said. Therefore, Sweden will recognise the State of Palestine," said Prime Minister Stefan Lofven in his first statement of government policy.
