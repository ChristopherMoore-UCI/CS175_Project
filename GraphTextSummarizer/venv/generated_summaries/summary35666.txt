-- This month on Inside the Middle East, CNN travels to explore the constantly-expanding city of Abu Dhabi and talk to Sheikh Nahayan bin Mubarak Al Nahayan, Minister of Higher Education. Reflecting on how far Abu Dhabi has come, Minister of Higher Education Sheikh Nahayan bin Mubarak Al Nahayan gives IME a rare interview. Schams Elwazer tells us how the "magic" of science such as diet cola fountains and cube-shaped bubbles are actually a long-term investment in human resources. We look at Abu Dhabi's growth from palm leaf huts to landmarks like Yas Island, Emirates Palace, and Sheikh Zayed mosque. Currently 80% of public high school students choose the liberal arts track over science.
