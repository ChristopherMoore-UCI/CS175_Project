Alec Kornacki was in the family garage Saturday working on a car when a jack holding it up slipped, according to Kristen Kornacki, another one of his daughters. "She proceeded to lift up the car, pull him out and then give him CPR," said Kristen Kornacki. According to his daughter Kristen, Alec Kornacki is "healing fantastically." He has several broken ribs, some numbness and other fractures, but likely suffered no permanent damage, according to WWBT.
