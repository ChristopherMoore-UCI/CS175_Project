The report said the government appears "reluctant to order regular army units to fire on demonstrators, though it has done so in some cases where regime protection forces were inadequate." "There are signs that army units are increasingly identifying with protesters, especially where security forces are employing violence against unarmed demonstrators," according to a report by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a think tank. The report, written by Washington institute defense fellow Jeffrey White and published Monday, is entitled "Syrian Army Shows Growing Signs of Strain." And escalating regime violence will likely provoke a more violent response over time, fueled by armed defectors. Clashes within army units and between army and security forces may increase as well.
