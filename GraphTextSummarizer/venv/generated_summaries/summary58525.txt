But, as queasy as the whole thing is, violent video games do not cause more violence. Several researchers, including myself, met with Vice President Joe Biden on Friday to inform him that studies are unable to support the contention that violent video games contribute to societal violence. Responding to calls for gun control, the National Rifle Association attempted to shift blame for mass homicides away from guns to cultural influences such as video games or entertainment. As for the NRA's assertion that games create violence, it is nakedly self-serving. Sensible changes will not occur if the nation indulges in a moral panic about violent video games as it did after the Columbine massacre.
