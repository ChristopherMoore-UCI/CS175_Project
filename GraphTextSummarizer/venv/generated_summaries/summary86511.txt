Populations of all types of slender loris, which are native to the rainforests of Sri Lanka and southern India, have been in decline in recent years because of destruction of their forest habitat by logging, agriculture and development. ZSL Conservation biologist Dr. Craig Turner said the study was the first close examination of a Horton Plains slender loris ever conducted. Researchers from the University of Colombo and the Open University of Sri Lanka also took part. -- Wildlife researchers in Sri Lanka have photographed one of the world's most reclusive primates for the first time. Research leader Saman Gamage said more than 1,000 nocturnal studies in 120 different forest areas had been conducted as part of the study.
