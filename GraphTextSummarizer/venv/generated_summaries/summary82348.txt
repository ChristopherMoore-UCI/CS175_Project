The NBA announced Friday that it will donate all proceeds from the sale of Collins jerseys to the Gay, Lesbian & Straight Education Network (GLSEN) and the Matthew Shepard Foundation. Collins' path from a little-known, aging NBA center to gay rights icon who was invited by first lady Michelle Obama to the State of the Union is one that speaks to the nation's changing attitudes about homosexuality. For years as he chased his dream, shooting hoops and racing up and down the court, professional basketball player Jason Collins wore the No. 98 jersey. "I know everyone in the NBA family is excited for him and proud that our league fosters an inclusive and respectful environment," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said after Collins' signing last Sunday. "I've grown so much as an individual, I've come across so many great people, great organizations, heard so many great stories, inspiring stories," Collins said, adding "... it's nice to have a positive impact on someone's else's life, and I feel like with my actions that I've had a positive impact on someone's else's life."
