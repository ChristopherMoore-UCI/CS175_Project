The Washington Post reported in December that the Obama administration reached a tentative deal with Taliban negotiators that would have included the Taliban's public renunciation of international terrorism and the transfer of five Afghans from Guantanamo Bay. " A top Afghan peace official said he was "cautiously optimistic" about the Taliban statement. " It appears to be the first time the Taliban -- who ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until 2001, when they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion -- have offered talks without the condition of an American withdrawal from the country. "We ask our international friends not to hold any kind of talks with the Taliban leaders," Qassemyar said December 27. "We support an Afghan-led reconciliation process in which the Taliban breaks with al Qaeda, renounces violence and accepts the Afghan constitution, especially protections for minorities and women," said Gavin Sundwall, a U.S. Embassy spokesman.
