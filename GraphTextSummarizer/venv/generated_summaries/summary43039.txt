Meanwhile, in the once bustling commercial capital of Aleppo, residents dropped mock ballots in a makeshift ballot box "to withdraw the citizenship of President Bashar al-Assad," social media video showed Tuesday. The outcome is hardly in doubt: President Bashar al-Assad is almost guaranteed to emerge victorious in a vote that opposition groups and many Western countries say has been be rigged from the start. The U.S. State Department says the Assad regime has taken steps "to make it difficult if not impossible to have a fair and free election in Syria." War continues amid election Warplanes bombed anti-government neighborhoods Tuesday as Syrians cast their ballots, the opposition-run Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. When al-Assad came to power 14 years ago, he ran unopposed, securing more than 99% of votes, according to state media.
