" European Parliament President Martin Schulz said the body's leaders had decided unanimously to grant the prize to Mukwege "for his fight for protection especially of women. At the Panzi Hospital, many women are treated for vaginal fistula -- a muscular tear caused by violent rape -- and are also given counseling and treatment for the psychological repercussions of their experiences. " In February of this year, Mukwege was awarded the Hillary Rodham Clinton Award for Advancing Women in Peace and Security. The gynecologist is thought to have operated on more than 40,000 women since setting up his hospital during the 1998 war in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. He thanked the European Parliament for shining a spotlight on the "horrific and abhorrent barbarism" that plagues eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and called for united action to bring peace, justice and democracy to the troubled region.
