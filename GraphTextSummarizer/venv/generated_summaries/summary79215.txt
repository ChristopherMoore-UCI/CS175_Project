-- Amanda Knox again protested her innocence in the 2007 killing of British exchange student Meredith Kercher Tuesday, in a written statement to the Italian court hearing her retrial. Knox's ex at retrial: Life has been a nightmare Acquittal overturned Sollecito and Knox were convicted in 2009 of killing Kercher, 21, who was found stabbed in November 2007 in the villa that she and Knox rented in the central Italian university town of Perugia. The retrial began in September without either Knox or her former boyfriend and fellow accused Raffaele Sollecito in court. In it, Knox said "there is no scientific proof that puts me in the crime scene" and that Kercher's killer had left enough traces behind for the court to be satisfied it was not her. Prosecutor Alessandro Crini last month said both Knox and Sollecito should be convicted and handed a 26-year sentence for homicide, with an additional four years for Knox for slander.
