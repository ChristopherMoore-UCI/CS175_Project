Unknown hotel, Vientiane, Laos Just as many abandoned hotels are famous for their once lavish accouterments and celebrity guests, others are notable for their anonymity. Already the grand Statler, Tuller and Madison-Lenox hotels are gone, leaving this stately 1929 art-deco high-rise the sole unoccupied survivor of heritage status. -- Luxury hotels and resorts conjure images of sunny skies, designer furnishings, lavish restaurants and the well-to-do milling about in grand fashion. Not one, but dozens of hotels are slowly falling apart as the urge to resettle this region has long diminished. Scenic beauty regardless, the river powering the falls is one of the most polluted in the world and, coupled with the hotel's "most haunted" reputation, soon put overnight guests off.
