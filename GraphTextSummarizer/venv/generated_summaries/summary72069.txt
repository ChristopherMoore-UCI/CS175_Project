At the Cannon Falls meeting, Obama hit on recent themes blaming economic problems in part on turmoil in the Mideast, debt problems in Europe and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but he said the biggest problem was intransigence in Washington, particularly among Republicans unwilling to accept any tax increases to help solve the nation's budget problems. -- President Barack Obama laced into his conservative Republican congressional critics Tuesday, accusing them of putting partisan political concerns before the country's interests. It was meant as an opportunity for Obama to visit with residents in their own communities to talk about national economic policy, they said. Obama's remarks on Tuesday echoed comments he made Monday, in which he slammed partisan politics and called on lawmakers to prioritize economic growth. "During his Magical Misery bus tour this week, it is unlikely President Obama will speak with unemployed Americans, to near-bankrupt business owners or to families struggling to survive in this economy," the statement reads.
