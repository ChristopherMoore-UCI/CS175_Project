Frank M. Lombard, 42, was arrested last week at his home in Durham, North Carolina. He made an initial appearance in federal court in North Carolina but was transferred to Washington to face the charges there, court documents show. During the chat, according to the complaint filed against Lombard, he told the officer that he had performed multiple sex acts on the boy and that the officer could do the same if he came to Durham. -- A Duke University official is accused of offering his 5-year-old adopted son for sex on the Internet, according to the FBI and court documents in the case. Attempts to contact the Durham attorney who appeared in court with Lombard were unsuccessful Tuesday.
