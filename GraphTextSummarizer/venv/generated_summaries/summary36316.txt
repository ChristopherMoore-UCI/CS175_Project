In his partial dissent -- which represents his opinion, but does not equate to law -- Bea contended that local and state officers do have a role in addressing federal immigration laws. Among other things, this legislation would have required local law enforcement in Arizona to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants. In its ruling, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit sided with the U.S. Justice Department and against Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who signed the measure known as SB 1070 into law last year. "Congress intended that state officers be free to inquire of the federal officers into the immigration status of any person, without any direction or supervision of such federal officers -- and the federal officers 'shall respond' to any such inquiry," he writes. That includes a ban on "sanctuary cities": municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants.
