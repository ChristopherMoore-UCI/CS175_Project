In London on Tuesday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for more Western involvement in Syria to fight ISIS, and praised the U.S.'s British allies for everything from their love of defending freedom to the boy band One Direction. "This attitude of cultural relativism, it certainly doesn't approve of harsher violent actions," he said, "but it does question the right of Britain, the U.S. or other western powers to do anything about it." Perry, referring to himself as a "proud patriotic Texan," outlined a moral argument in favor of robust Western intervention in Syria by drawing a stark contrast between the "so-called religious warriors of ISIS" and the "special strength and character" of Western forces. "To see to it that security is defended -- that is what is required of Western nations and the great alliances we have formed," he said, admitting that the overseas conflict "will draw heavily on our wealth, our will and our wisdom. His decision to travel away from Texas as a second case of Ebola was diagnosed there has drawn the ire of top Texas Democratic party operative Will Hailer, who called the governor an "irresponsible leader," according to Bloomberg news.
