Key Bank spokeswoman Anne Foster declined to comment on the incident, saying it's under investigation, and Nicholson's termination, saying it's a personnel matter. The 30-year-old bank teller said the suspect, dressed in black and wearing sunglasses, walked up to his counter at the Key Bank branch in suburban Seattle, Washington, demanding he fill the man's bag with cash. "Our policies and procedures are in the best interest of public safety and they're consistent with industry standards. I threw it on the floor," Nicholson told CNN Radio. "Lives are not." Nicholson said he knew about the company's robbery policy before the incident, but said he acted on instinct.
