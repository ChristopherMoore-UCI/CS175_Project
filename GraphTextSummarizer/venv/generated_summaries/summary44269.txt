When he chaired the aviation board, Kahn was also remembered for his campaign to eliminate "'bureaucratese' or gobbledygook" at the agency, said colleague Robert Frank, a professor of management at Cornell's Johnson School. Airlines such as Pan Am, Eastern and Braniff ruled the skies, and the aeronautics board governed them, controlling routes and ticket prices, keeping fares high and eliminating competition. When the administration admonished him for alarming the public that the country could face a "deep, deep depression" if Carter's anti-inflation policies failed, Kahn began using the euphemism "banana" for the word "depression," Cornell university said in a statement. He died at his home in Ithaca, New York, on Monday, according to a statement from Cornell University where he was a professor emeritus of political economy. "Nobody could fly an airplane commercially on any route without specific permission from the Civil Aeronautics Board, and price competition, cutting prices, was illegal," Kahn told CNN in 1998, recalling that period.
