Bell was a founder of critical race theory, which examined the intersection of race, power and law in a harsh portrayal of American society as one dominated by class and racial conflict. "Bell's pursuit of racial and social justice and his dogged critique of liberal incrementalism in universities and elsewhere was like a persistent wind that changed the landscape of law schools and influenced the larger academic world as well," wrote Harvard law professor Lani Guinier and Texas School of Law professor Gerald Torres in a remembrance of Bell published in the "Chronicle of Higher Education." His book "Race, Racism, and American Law" is taught in civil rights courses today, and those in the legal world offer a more comprehensive description of critical race theory than Pollak's assertion that it "is all about white supremacy. " The clip made public on Breitbart's website this week shows Obama introducing Bell at a Harvard demonstration in 1991. Obama encourages the crowd to "open up your hearts and your minds to the words of Professor Derrick Bell" and then embraces him.
