Tied up in a garage Hannah shed new light on the night she was kidnapped -- the same night her mother and younger brother were killed and their bodies burned in DiMaggio's house. The next day, the bodies of her mother, Christina Anderson, 42, and 8-year-old brother, Ethan, were found about 45 miles east of San Diego, in DiMaggio's burned house in Boulevard. It has recently drawn heavy criticism as a hive of cyberbullying however, following several instances of teenage ask.fm members committing suicide after being harassed on the site. The 16-year-old fielded anonymous questions on the website ask.fm, where she shared details about her abduction by the man she knew as Uncle Jim, James DiMaggio. Alan MacNabb, whose son is one of Hannah's closest friends, confirmed to CNN Wednesday that the postings on ask.fm were by Hannah.
