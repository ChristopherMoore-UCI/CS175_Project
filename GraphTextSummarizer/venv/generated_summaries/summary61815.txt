Okapi meat reportedly poached from the park is now regularly on sale at the nearby town of Beni -- and if hunting continues at the same rate, okapi could become extinct within the park within a few years, the ZSL said. Though focused on okapi, the study has also managed to find other species including shrews and duikers, a kind of antelope, a ZSL spokeswoman said. "The photographs clearly show the stripes on their rear, which act like unique fingerprints," said Theirry Lusenge, a key member of ZSL's survey team in the DRC. The U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society said in August they had found 125,000 Western lowland gorillas living in a swamp in northern Congo, adding significantly to the existing worldwide population of the threatened species. A third image released by ZSL was taken at night and gives a vivid side view of the animal.
