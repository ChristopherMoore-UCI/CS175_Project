San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said without elaborating that it was clear Chamberlain was "absolutely growing more desperate." "This subject, Mr. Chamberlain, was a very dangerous and desperate person," Suhr said. Authorities had been looking for him after searching his neighborhood Saturday on a tip that he had "items of great concern" at his home, FBI Special Agent in Charge David Johnson told reporters. Chamberlain, 42, was arrested Monday night at Crissy Field, a scenic waterfront area popular with tourists where Golden Gate Bridge spans the Pacific entrance to San Francisco Bay. Ryan Kelly Chamberlain II was unemotional during the 15-minute hearing in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The affidavit says Chamberlain fled from agents after Eldridge interviewed him for a short time at a coffee shop near his apartment on Saturday.
