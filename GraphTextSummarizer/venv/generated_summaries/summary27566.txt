Iraq has been in the throes of relentless violence, much of it stemming from discord between Sunnis and Shiites. -- A string of car and roadside bombs exploded across Iraq on Monday morning, killing at least 43 people and wounding nearly 200 others, police said. Sunnis have long felt politically marginalized under a Shiite-led government in the post-Saddam Hussein era. Interior Ministry officials said more than 20 attacks were carried out by the "enemies of Iraq." Most of the casualties occurred in the capital, Baghdad, the officials said. According to a CNN tally, the violence has killed nearly 600 people in Iraq this month.
