It was funded by Applied Food Sciences Inc. This year, the Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint (PDF) against the company, saying it paid researchers in India to conduct a trial on Green Coffee Antioxidant. "In prior seasons, we covered Green Coffee Extract and its potential as a useful tool for weight loss," the show posted on its website this week. The FTC says the study's unnamed lead investigator "repeatedly: (1) altered the weights and other key measurements of the subjects; (2) changed the length of the trial; and (3) confused which subjects took either the placebo or GCA at various points during the trial." While this sometimes happens in scientific research, it indicates that further study is needed regarding any potential benefits of Green Coffee Extract." Now a study supporting one of those products, diet pills made with green coffee bean extract, has been withdrawn by its lead researchers.
