"By beginning this important process, NJ Transit will be better able to support the state's response to Hurricane Sandy by freeing up buses or other resources that may be needed for hurricane relief," Department of Transportation Commissioner James Simpson said in a press release. For all the potential headaches at airports, train stations and bus terminals, the type of transportation affected first and most directly by Sandy may be boating. Officials say they'll decide Sunday whether to suspend service on the subway, as well as on buses and commuter rail, depending on Sandy proceeds. Planes, trains and automobiles -- all these modes of transportation were affected Saturday by Hurricane Sandy, even with the storm many hours away from making landfall. The storm is expected to cause massive flooding and widespread power outages when it hits the East Coast, in full, late Sunday and into next week.
