"It was the first time to see this kind of a game because in Kenya cricket is not famous," says team captain Sonyanga Weblen Ole Ngais. " 'Just like throwing a spear' Ngais, 24, says that cricket came naturally to him and his fellow Maasai warriors. " 'Love for the game' Bauer then decided to introduce cricket to the local community. Looking ahead, she says the goal is to introduce cricket development to more schools in order to bring success on and off the field. Local stars Bauer says that all this social engagement, along with the team's rising profile, has turned the Warriors into ambassadors for positive change within their communities.
