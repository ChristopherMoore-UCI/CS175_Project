Fein and other federal officials. According to court documents, an internal e-mail from a senior manager in September 2001 suggested that officials at Pratt & Whitney Canada knew the sales could violate U.S. sanctions. -- A Canadian subsidiary of a U.S.-based multinational firm pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to illegally sending software to China, which it used in the development of its first advanced attack helicopter, according to the U.S. attorney in Connecticut. The firms are expected to pay $20.7 million to the Justice Department and another $55 million to the State Department "to resolve outstanding export issues, including those related to the Z-10," court documents said. " "American military prowess depends on lawful, controlled exports of sensitive technology by U.S. industries and their subsidiaries," added John Morton, director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
