State Fair Commission Chairman Andre Lacy issued a statement Wednesday saying the organization has created a new position of emergency management officer "to assist with improving emergency action plans, and completed emergency evacuation training for all employees." "On the evening of the incident one of our employees reconfirmed with State Fair leadership that if there was lightning or wind speeds of 40 mph or more, the area should be evacuated. "Despite these warnings, the Indiana State Fair Commission, who controlled the venue, and Sugarland, who controlled the concert, refused to postpone the concert and failed to implement an evacuation plan away from the temporary roof structure. Metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the Indianapolis fairgrounds on August 13, 2011, right before country music group Sugarland was to perform. "The State Fair Commission and State Fair personnel are ultimately responsible here. Mid-America Sound, based in Greenfield, Indiana, was cited for "failure to develop and implement an Operations Management Plan, the failure to develop a risk assessment plan, failure to maintain and use current engineering calculations and documentation, and failure to provide appropriate, qualified supervision," the labor department said.
