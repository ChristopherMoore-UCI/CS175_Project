Guo Meimei, 23, best known for showing off her wealth, looks and extravagant lifestyle on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter, appeared on state television without make up and in orange prison garb after being detained by police last month for operating an illegal gambling den. On Monday, the charity called on donors to "please forget Guo Meimei" and provide help to people affected by the earthquake in Yunnan that has killed almost 600 people. Some social media users said her case was being used to draw attention away from bad news stories such as an earthquake in southwestern China and a deadly factory explosion. Last month, she was arrested for breaching China's strict gambling laws after boasting about her winnings from betting on World Cup matches. "I'd like to sincerely apologize to Red Cross, also to the people and especially to those who need to receive help but haven't."
