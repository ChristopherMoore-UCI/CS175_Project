The department issued a  statement saying that after a "careful and thorough" review, there is not enough  evidence to prove that New York Police Department detectives "acted willfully"  when they opened fire on Bell and his friends. -- New York City will pay  more than $7 million to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the estate of a man killed by police outside a Queens' nightclub in 2006 and by his two friends, who were seriously wounded, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department said Tuesday. The incident quickly  became a touchstone for those who believe police -- in New York and elsewhere --  have a record of excessive force, particularly against black men. "The city regrets the  loss of life in this tragic case, and we share our deepest condolences with the  Bell family,"  Michael Cardozo,  attorney for the New York City Law Department. Sharpton and Bell's fiancee and  parents were among more than 200 people arrested in New York  City.
