Here's the announcement presidential candidate Hillary Clinton should make: "Today in America, women earn on average 77 cents for every dollar men earn. And so, I'm announcing that if elected president, I will take a 23% pay cut, equivalent to the current gender wage gap, to stand in solidarity with working women in America. Clinton has deftly put her finger in the wind and sensed the winds of populism blowing through America. Because what Clinton would be reminding us is that across America, the aggregate salaries of all working women is 23% less than the aggregate salaries of all men. Clinton wouldn't just be saying she stands with the working women of America, she'd be showing it.
