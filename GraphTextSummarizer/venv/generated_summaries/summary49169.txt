Harrison says it is part of the AMI's efforts to eventually develop Africa's first full-blown Massively Open Online Course (MOOC), in conjunction with three of Africa's leading business schools -- Nigeria's Lagos Business School, Kenya's Strathmore Business School and South Africa's Gordon Institute of Business Science "What we want to do is leapfrog the traditional bricks-and-mortar approach to business schools and business training," says Harrison. For sure, creating one million well-trained, locally grown managers by 2023 to spearhead Africa's business development is an overly ambitious proposition in a continent where top business schools are few and far between -- there are about 90 institutions offering an MBA in Africa, according to an AMI report, whereas India has more than 1,500. The "Launchpad: Success@Work in 21st Century Africa" module, which will have low bandwidth requirements and be available on mobile, will cover topics such as effective communication, goal setting and time management. Educating future managers To achieve its target, the AMI, which gets most of its funding from the Lundin Foundation, in Canada, has started launching a series of initiatives designed to expand access to key education tools, including a virtual campus tailored specifically for African managers and entrepreneurs.
