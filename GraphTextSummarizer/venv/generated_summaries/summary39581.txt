A doctor at a clinic said he had treated dozens of protesters for cuts and injuries caused by flying glass and rocks. Meanwhile, people were throwing Molotov cocktails, rocks and glass. -- Six people were killed and at least 300 were injured when pro-democracy activists clashed Friday with Egyptian security forces in central Cairo, a government official said. "This situation has nothing to do with the police or the Ministry of Interior, and we do not have forces at the site of the clashes," said Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a ministry spokesman. "It all started when the military arrested one man, and then an hour later he emerged from building barely able to walk from the beating," said activist and video blogger Walid Nada.
