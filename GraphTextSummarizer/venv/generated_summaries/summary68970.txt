About real meaning... and about myself: Life is more a mosaic than a measurable frame of joys and sorrows, laughter and tears. It has included many twists and turns: from the joy of marrying my high school sweetheart to the sorrow of being rejected by the first church to which I was appointed as pastor. About simplicity: More, bigger, nicer, pale in comparison to gifts like sunsets and the laughter of children at play. I run to make life matter, seeking more than the right way to go, but actually going there and watching the race mean something. And, to so many over the years who have known my story, I am a man in a race -- a race against illness, against fear, against discrimination.
