In the past week, the President visited Michigan, Arizona and Tennessee, where he announced proposals focused on the economy and helping the middle class -- highlighting a strengthened auto industry, policies aimed at making homes more affordable, and a plan to make community college free for most students. On Monday, the President will visit the Federal Trade Commission, where he will lay out proposals and executive action on identity theft, Internet privacy and technology in schools, the official said. Obama will meet with congressional leaders from both parties Tuesday to "discuss a wide range of issues including places where he hopes we can work together to grow the economy and protect our national security," a White House official told CNN. Cybersecurity and Internet access will be themes in the coming week as President Barack Obama highlights the agenda he will be emphasizing in his State of the Union address. But Republicans -- such as Sens. Bob Corker and Lamar Alexander, who accompanied the President on his trip Friday to their home state of Tennessee -- have already voiced some skepticism.
