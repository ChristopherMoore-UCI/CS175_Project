"Sarah's passion for 'Mechs' and her battle with cancer had a profound impact on everyone at Piranha," said Russ Bullock, president of Piranha Games, in a news release. The courage and energy she displayed along the way inspired Infinite Games Publishing and Piranha Games, the makers of "MechWarrior," to honor her in a unique way. Five-year-old Sarah Marie Alida Parries of Vancouver, British Columbia, was one of them. Such was the case recently when players and game developers turned heartbreak over the death of a young compatriot into cash to fight cancer. "The outpouring of heartfelt sympathy from the MechWarrior community and the support and encouragement we've received to develop this unique 'Mech' has been nothing short of incredible."
