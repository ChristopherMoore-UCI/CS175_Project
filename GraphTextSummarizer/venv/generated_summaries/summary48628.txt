-- British police investigating abuse claims against disgraced TV host Jimmy Savile arrested a London man Sunday on suspicion of sexual offenses. "Now the BBC risks squandering public trust because one of its stars over three decades was apparently a sexual criminal; because he used his programme and popularity as a cover for his wickedness; because he used BBC premises for some of his attacks; and because others -- BBC employees and hangers-on -- may also have been involved," BBC Chairman Lord Patten wrote in an editorial published Sunday in the Daily Mail. How scandal has rocked BBC Sunday's arrest comes a day after Savile's family made its first public statement since a slew of claims of sexual abuse of under-age girls destroyed the reputation of a man they had regarded as a hero. A TV documentary a month ago detailed allegations of sexual abuse against Savile. But authorities have said they are preparing an arrest strategy for others, still living, against whom allegations have been made in connection with the Savile case.
