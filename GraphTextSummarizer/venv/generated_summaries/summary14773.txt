The parents also each face seven counts of aggravated child abuse and seven counts of child neglect. The actions of the Florida Department of Children and Families also are being looked at in a separate case, in which 10-year-old twins were found last month in a pest control truck on the side of Interstate 95 in West Palm Beach, Florida. -- Child protective investigators in Florida had "prior involvement" with the family of the two children found dead in a canal this month, an official said Tuesday. The bodies of two children -- a brother and sister, ages 10 and 6 -- were found in a south Florida canal last week. Days before the twins were found, the Department of Children and Families received tips alleging poor treatment of children at the Barahona household in Miami-Dade County.
