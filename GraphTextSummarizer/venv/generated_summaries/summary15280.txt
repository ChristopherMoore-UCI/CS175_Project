-- At least 26 bodies have been recovered from the sea after a Libyan trawler got into trouble last week, but hundreds are still missing, according to Tunisia's state-run TAP news agency. As many as 270 Libyan refugees were missing in the Mediterranean Sea after the overcrowded boat they were in encountered bad weather, the Tunisian state-run TAP news agency reported last week. Bad weather is preventing the recovery of more bodies, the head of the Sfax coast guard told TAP Monday. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked this dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. Between 200 and 270 people were missing, while 577 people were rescued, the coast guard official told TAP Monday.
