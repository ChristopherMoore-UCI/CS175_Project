Britain's Telegraph newspaper reports Friday, citing "well-placed sources," that medical staff at St. Mary's Hospital -- where Catherine is expected to give birth -- were told the due date was July 19. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. The first indication that the royal baby is on its way will be an announcement in the media that the duchess has been admitted to the hospital in the early stages of labor, royal sources tell CNN. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected to give birth in the private Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital, next to Paddington Station in London. The Telegraph reported that a contingency plan is in place for Catherine to give birth at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, if she goes into labor while staying at her parents' home in Berkshire, and its swift progress means the journey back to London is impractical.
