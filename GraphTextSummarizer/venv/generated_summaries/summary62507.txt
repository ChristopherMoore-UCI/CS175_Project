-- Moscow, Russia, authorities have cut the daily sales hours for beverages with more than 15 percent alcohol, making it illegal to buy such beverages in stores between 10 p.m. and 10 a.m., according to Russian state-run news agency RIA-Novosti. The new law will only affect the Moscow region because there is no nationwide alcohol sales regulation, leaving alcohol available on store shelves 24 hours a day throughout the rest of the country, according to RIA-Novosti. The cut in sales hours doesn't affect bars, restaurants or night clubs in Moscow, which can still obtain 24-hour liquor licenses and serve beer, wine or bottled cocktails with less than 15 percent alcohol. The tightened limits on alcohol sales also prohibit local prefectures from issuing 24-hour sales permits to shops. The move, which reduces by three hours a day the time those beverages can be sold in stores, will go into effect at the beginning of September, RIA-Novosti said.
