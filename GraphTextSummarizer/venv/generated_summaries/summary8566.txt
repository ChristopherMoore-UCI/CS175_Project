-- When Chelsea and Bayern Munich walk out onto the pitch at the Allianz Arena for Saturday's European Champions League final, it will mark the culmination of a competition rightly regarded as the finest -- and the hardest to win -- in club football. "I think a victory for Bayern is definitely a victory for the supporter-owned model of a club," says Conn. "(German clubs have) standing areas and affordable tickets, so young people and poorer people from all sections of society can still support football, as they have done since the game began -- until 1992 in England." It was also the last bow for Pep Guardiola, arguably the greatest coach in charge of the greatest team of the modern era, who left Barcelona shortly after Champions League semifinal defeat against Chelsea. "That is a great beacon for the collective way of running football, and gives the lie to the Premier League argument that selling the clubs to overseas buyers, making them available for people to profit from, and unleashing ticket prices to maximize income is a necessary basis for success. Anglo Saxon economics Though the cheapest ticket for a top-grade match in Munich may well cost less than $20 -- compared to over $80 at Chelsea -- Bayern, and German clubs in general, have enjoyed far less success in Europe over the past decade compared to their English counterparts.
