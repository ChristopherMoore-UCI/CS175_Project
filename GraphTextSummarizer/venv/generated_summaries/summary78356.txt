It is hard to believe that some kind of military action against Syria won't now take place, likely in the form of U.S. cruise missile attacks from ships in the Mediterranean. " On Thursday, the British government released a similar statement saying that the grounds for military action against Syria "would be humanitarian intervention; the aim is to relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring or disrupting the further use of chemical weapons. Such attacks have the merit that they won't put U.S. aircraft at risk, which could well encounter problems with Syria's reputedly formidable air defense systems. " But on Thursday night the British parliament voted against authorizing military action--a real setback for the Obama administration's plan to assemble something of a coalition to participate in any forthcoming operation in Syria. But making a claim that the Syrian regime threatens the U.S. is implausible, and therefore some kind of unilateral American action seems quite unlikely.
