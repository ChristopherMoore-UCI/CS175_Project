Opinion: Don't blame immigration for Boston bombings The first hearing, held last Friday, was also marked by several references to security fears raised by the recent bombings. Schumer, in turn, insisted that "what I am saying is, if there are things that come up as a result of what happened in Boston that need improving, that require improvement, let's add them to the bill because certainly our bill tightens up things in a way that would make a Boston less likely."

Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said "those who are pointing to what happened -- the terrible tragedy in Boston -- (are looking for an) excuse for not doing a bill or delaying it many months or a year.
