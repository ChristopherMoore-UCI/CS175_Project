Netflix's goal was to convert current clients from "DVDs and streaming" to "DVDs or streaming" and charging a premium for customers wanting to stay with both. While Netflix is taking a beating, with rapidly declining market valuation, angry customers and negative media coverage, Hastings' announcement actually signals the company's willingness to keep tinkering until it gets the service right. He is that rare public company CEO who is willing to take a risk, make mistakes in public and keep trying new things. Since the initial July announcement, Netflix has inked favorable streaming deals with several major studios, including Dreamworks, Epix (Lionsgate, MGM and Paramount), Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel -- a fact Hastings referred to in his most recent blog post. This was Netflix's third major announcement relating to changes in pricing and service offering in four months.
