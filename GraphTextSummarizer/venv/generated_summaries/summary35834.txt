Memin is a poor Cuban-Mexican kid with bug eyes, thick lips and protruding ears. But fans of Memin say the valuable lessons of a beloved comic book character tackling real-life problems have been lost in translation. Comic book character Memin Pinguin is "a disgrace," an African-American activist says. But the dark-skinned Memin's exaggerated features in "Memin for President" came as a shock to Houston, Texas, Wal-Mart shopper Shawnedria McGinty. Wal-Mart spokesman Lorenzo Lopez said the retailer has instructed stores to remove the books from shelves and discontinue sales.
