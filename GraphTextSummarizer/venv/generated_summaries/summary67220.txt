Taliban spokesman Mujahid said they "strongly reject these false claims of the enemy" and urged "our fellow countrymen, Mujahideen and the rest of the Muslims not to believe these intelligence lies and false reports." Pakistan's Interior Rehman Malik also denied that Omar was dead, saying in a news conference that the claims were "baseless." The United States led an invasion of Afghanistan soon after the attacks, toppling Omar's Taliban and sending bin Laden into hiding. " Omar vanished after a U.S.-led coalition booted the Taliban and its leaders from power in Afghanistan in December 2001 for refusing to hand over Osama bin Laden after the 9/11 terror attacks. With most of the country under Taliban control, he set himself the goal of transforming Afghanistan into the purest Islamic state in the world, declaring himself Amir-ul-Momineen, or head of the Muslims. Nonetheless what Omar said passed as law when the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, and to challenge him was unknown.
