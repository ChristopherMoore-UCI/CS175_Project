Morocco will still host next month's Club World Cup, saying that few visitors from sub-Saharan Africa visited the North African nation when it first hosted the FIFA event last year. National coach Badu Zaki should be fine tuning preparations for his team, perhaps hopeful of success given that over a third of Nations Cup hosts have won the tournament. We should just support the countries that have been affected by the disease and move on." Despite knowing where the Nations Cup will be held in nine years' time (Guinea), African football fans still don't know where the tournament will take place in just over nine weeks. After Morocco requested its postponement in October, CAF contacted several countries to see if they would consider hosting should the North Africans pull out. After stripping Morocco of the right to stage the competition, CAF says it is now studying the applications of an unspecified number of countries prior to announcing a new host.
