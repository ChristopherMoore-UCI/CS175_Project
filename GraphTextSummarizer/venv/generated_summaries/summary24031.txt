A California wind farm is on track to get the first-ever permit allowing it to avoid prosecution and penalties in the event of eagle deaths from farm operations. But the group has supported the permits as a way to work with the industry to help it minimize the number of bird deaths on wind farms. "The Shiloh IV eagle permit sets a precedent for proactive and collaborative eagle conservation at wind farms in northern California," according to a statement from service director Dan Ashe. It's unclear exactly how many eagles, in addition to other birds, are killed by the powerful turbines on wind farms every year. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the permits help protect wind farms from accidental eagle deaths.
