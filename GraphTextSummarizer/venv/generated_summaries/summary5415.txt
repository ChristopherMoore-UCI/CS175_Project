Cleveland police removed Knight's name from an FBI database of missing people in November 2003 -- 15 months after her family reported her missing -- police said. Her grandmother, Deborah Knight, went to the house where DeJesus is staying on Friday, said she'd heard Knight might be there and "besides, Gina's parents here have been waiting to meet us." They did so after "failing to locate a parent, guardian or other reporting person to confirm that Ms. Knight was still missing. Even as of Friday night, Knight hadn't spoken yet with her mother, Barbara, a family spokesperson said. In Friday's statement, city officials said police checked on Knight's case in November.
