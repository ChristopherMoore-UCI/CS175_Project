Some adults may still think bullying is just a youthful rite of passage, but it seems worse than in previous generations for many parents, educators and kids. These are kids and parents who have taken their pain, their suffering, their grief and turned it into action.

Our unhealthy love of reality TV bullying I first started reporting on the problem of bullying a few years ago when a rash of suicides of children propelled the issue into the national spotlight. In the last few years, awareness about bullying has increased dramatically.
