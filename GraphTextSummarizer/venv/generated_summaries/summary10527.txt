London's other big draw for Dickens fans, the Charles Dickens Museum, housed in his former home, is -- perhaps surprisingly -- to close for a large part of the bicentennial year, as part of a major refurbishment program, but it is expected to reopen just in time for Christmas 2012, when a further round of Dickens celebrations are planned. And on Tuesday, the anniversary of Dickens' birth, the Prince of Wales will lay a wreath at Dickens' grave in Poet's Corner, Westminster Abbey, while actor Ralph Fiennes, Dickens' biographer Claire Tomalin and the author's great-great-grandson, Mark Dickens give readings. Clare Pettitt, Dickens specialist at King's College London, puts his continued popularity down to his modernity. It features items from Dickens' own life -- including the desk he wrote at, his bank ledger, and the manuscripts for some of his most popular novels -- alongside items evoking life in London in the 19th century, from playbills, pub signs and theatre costumes to heartbreaking evidence of the extreme poverty Dickens knew well from his own childhood. Dickens 2012 will see everything from readings to royal visits, celebrating the man who gave the world "Oliver Twist," "David Copperfield" and "Great Expectations."
