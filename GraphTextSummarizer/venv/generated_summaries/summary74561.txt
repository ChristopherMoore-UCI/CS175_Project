The Patriots had largely outplayed Seattle before the interval, Brady wearing down the Seahawks defense drive by drive. They were helped by one of the less likely calls in football history, as Seattle threw a second consecutive Super Bowl title into the hands of Malcolm Butler. Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski mowed down KJ Wright to restore New England's advantage, but that only served to cue up one of the gutsier plays in Super Bowl history. "I can't even tell you, I can't even feel it," said Seahawks coach Pete Carroll of the decision to throw the ball. Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson, essentially anonymous to this point, struck back with the night's first phenomenal pass to 25-year-old rookie and former shoe salesman Chris Matthews.
