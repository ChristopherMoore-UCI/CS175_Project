Admittedly, I am a fan of school choice in general and Success Academy in particular. If inequality and opportunity for minorities were more than empty slogans to him, de Blasio would  go to Success Academy on his knees, hoping to find something to duplicate, not destroy. How does de Blasio, or anyone who says he or she stands for the progress of the underprivileged, justify looking at the percentage of minorities who fail to graduate from high school -- in 2013, 32% of Latinos and 38% of African-Americans --  and get rid of a way out for them? De Blasio hates the founder of Success Academy, Eva Moskowitz, who is also a Democrat, and he's made no secret of it. There are two theories as to why de Blasio would evict hundreds of minority children in Harlem.
