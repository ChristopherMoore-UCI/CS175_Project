-- Gun control supporting candidates facing tight races for governor in Connecticut and Maryland are the beneficiaries of a last-minute ad buy from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In Connecticut, the group hopes that support for gun control will emerge as a salient theme for voters in the wake of the state's Sandy Hook massacre in December 2012, where 20 young children and 6 adults were shot and killed at an elementary school. Gun control is a "simmering issue" in these states, said Bloomberg spokesman Stu Loeser. Loeser said these ad buys represent an attempt to make sure gun control stays on the agenda in these states. Bloomberg -- a noted philanthropist and media magnate boasting a net worth of $34 billion -- has pledged to spend $25 million through his political action committee to raise awareness on gun control across the country.
