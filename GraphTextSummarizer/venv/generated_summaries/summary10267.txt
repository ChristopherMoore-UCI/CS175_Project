It is not just in the marfishes that young Somalis are being targeted for radicalization; the internet is now a treasure trove for radicals and Al-Shabaab boasts of having dozens of recruiters online at all hours in pro-jihad internet forums, even tailoring their videos in English to their target audience. The chances are you will have stumbled over a marfish -- the cafes British Somalis come to chew the vegetable stimulant, khat. There have been some cases here in the UK where the young people have been taken away from marfishes back to Somalia. Fertile territory for Al-Shabaab in chaos of Somalia The British-Somali community is one of the UK's oldest immigrant communities, tracing their roots to seamen who traveled to the UK in the 19th century. Even those who had no direct experience or involvement with extremism were terrified that on any given night they might get a knock on the door from a police officer accusing them of terrorism or -- worse still -- an e-mail or a voicemail threat from Al-Shabaab for being "un-Islamic" or a "traitor." To an outsider like me, none of these fears seem founded, but for Somalis in the UK much of what they thought they'd left behind in their war-ravaged homeland appears to have followed them here.
