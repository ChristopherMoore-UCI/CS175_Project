In an announcement that triggered massive jubilation among supporters in Cairo's Tahrir Square, Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi was declared Egypt's new president Sunday. The movement went underground in the 1950s, and decades of oppression by successive Egyptian rulers led many of the Brotherhood's members to flee abroad, while others were jailed. There are branches of the Muslim Brotherhood in countries across the Middle East and North and East Africa, including Sudan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. Egypt's largest Islamist party, the Muslim Brotherhood, lost its grip on legislative power earlier this month after the country's highest court declared parliament invalid. But Egypt's interim military rulers -- who have long been at odds with the Brotherhood -- declared full legislative authority in the aftermath of the ruling.
