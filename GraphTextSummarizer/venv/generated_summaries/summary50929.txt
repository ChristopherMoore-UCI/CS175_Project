"Having been involved in operations even before bin Laden, it was clear that there is no kind of silver bullet here to suddenly be able to destroy al Qaeda and that includes going after bin Laden," Panetta told reporters Friday after a meeting with defense counterparts in South America. " The answer came about 20 minutes after the SEALs entered the bin Laden compound, with the utterance of the code word "Geronimo." " "I don't think there's any question that America is safer as a result of the bin Laden operation," Panetta said."... Panetta has said he remains convinced that someone with authority in Pakistan knew bin Laden was hiding at the compound. Panetta's assessment came just days before the one-year anniversary of the U.S. commando raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, that ended a manhunt for the al Qaeda founder that began following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.
