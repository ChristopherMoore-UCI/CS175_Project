Demanding that innocent Muslims always make new statements about crimes they could not have stopped, from which they do not benefit, and have always condemned anyway, is an act by the powerful assigning collective guilt against the powerless. The vast majority of victims of jihadist groups are other Muslims, and when an attack takes place in the West it is the Muslim community that suffers the backlash from the societies in which they live. They should know that groups like ISIS and al Qaeda believe fanatically that most Muslims are misguided and hell-bound, and that only a small group (themselves) are members of an exclusive "saved sect," a belief that makes them immune to critique. In connection with the recent Paris killings, some mainstream commentators such as New York Times columnist Roger Cohen ask why "moderate" Muslims cannot simply "come out and say" that "I do not support this." Moreover, it is Muslims themselves who stand to lose the most when crimes are committed by these vigilantes.
