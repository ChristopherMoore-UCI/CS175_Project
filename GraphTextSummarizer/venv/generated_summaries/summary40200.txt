"I feel very happy with Santos, that's why I'm staying," Neymar told reporters on Thursday. The 33-year-old is expected to sign a one-year contract and will be eligible to play in the Chamions League should Tottenham overcome Swiss side Young Boys in the second leg of their qualifying round tie. In other transfer news, former Arsenal captain Williams Gallas is on the brink of a shock switch to rivals Tottenham. Brazilian media have claimed that the player's annual salary of $1 million per year is to be increased with merchandising deals following his decision to stay. Gallas, who failed to agree a new contract with the Gunners at the end of last season, would become the first player to move across the north London divide since Sol Campbell's controversial switch from Tottenham to Arsenal in 20002.
