The scene is a familiar one: women and men decked out in traditional dirndls and lederhosen while they swig steins of beer to the toe-tapping tune of oompah bands. Popular travel guide publisher Lonely Planet urges revelers in its book "A Year of Festivals" to "Come with good beer legs -- doppelbocks are going to really test them." "Doppelbocks are usually reddish-brown bottom-fermented lagers, and generally show a toffee-like, bready aroma and a rich malty palate with notable residual sweetness," according to "The Oxford Companion to Beer." Starkbierzeit, loosely translated as Bavaria's "strong beer festival" and literally translated as "strong beer time," is the lesser known but notably stronger of the sud-soaked events for MÃ¼ncheners. During the festival, participating beer halls keep shorter hours than in Oktoberfest to account for the potency of the beer served in the one-liter ceramic steins.
