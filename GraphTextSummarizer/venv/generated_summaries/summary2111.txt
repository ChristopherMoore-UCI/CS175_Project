Instead of simply promoting Buzz and urging users to sign up for it, or opt in, Google chose instead to sign up Gmail users as Buzz users. This move may bolster short-term value for Google but reduces privacy for Gmail users. Google is also unfairly expecting Gmail users to opt out of a service they never signed up for to maintain their current expectations of privacy. By using Gmail addresses to autocomplete messages from Google+ users, Google is basically giving strangers who may not know your e-mail address a way to connect with you through Gmail. That happened when Google decided to revise its privacy policy for Gmail and other Google products so that it could target more advertising and do more profiling of users.
