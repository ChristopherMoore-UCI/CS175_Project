North Carolina prosecutors allege he killed Lauterbach on December 14 and used her ATM card 10 days later before fleeing to Mexico. Laurean and Lauterbach were stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. The law enforcement source familiar with the case said a DNA swab was taken by court order from Laurean after he was extradited from Mexico in March to face charges in North Carolina. Laurean has been indicted on charges that include first-degree murder, financial card transaction fraud and obtaining property by false pretenses. At the time, a Mexican reporter asked Laurean whether he had killed Lauterbach.
