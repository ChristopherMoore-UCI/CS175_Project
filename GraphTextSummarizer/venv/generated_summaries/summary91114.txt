The safety of the 182 passengers on board was not compromised, said Northwest spokeswoman Kristin Baur. Northwest Airlines Flight 478 landed in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday as scheduled, a spokeswoman said. -- Northwest Airlines is investigating why the nose cone on one of its planes was damaged on a flight Sunday from Detroit, Michigan, to Tampa, Florida, a spokeswoman said. The nose cone appears bashed in, according to pictures that CNN obtained from a passenger awaiting the plane's next leg, to Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. The Northwest plane didn't continue onward but was towed away, said the passenger, who was still waiting for a replacement plane five hours later.
