Amnesty International said Jabbari was convicted of murder after "a flawed investigation and unfair trial." Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, was sentenced to death for the 2007 killing of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security. A Facebook page dedicated to saving Jabbari from execution has been created, with more than 14,000 likes. Rights groups have criticized the Islamic Republic of Iran for a surge in executions under Hassan Rouhani, in his first year as President. The United Nations and international human rights groups have taken up Jabbari's cause.
