"More young people were being hospitalized and ended up staying in hospitals longer," said Dr. Reka Gustafson, director of communicable disease control for Vancouver Coastal Health, the regional health care provider. "We figure that we'll be able to blunt it quite a bit," said Vancouver Coastal Health spokeswoman Anna Marie D'Angelo. "I can categorically say that we are not planning that." Canadian health officials will be using a stockpile of vaccine to make the shots easily available during the games -- although experts point out that it takes seven to 10 days to develop immunity after the vaccine. Athletes are not more likely to contract the flu because of close contact with other athletes during competitions or in locker rooms, said Gustafson. As they plan for the worst, Vancouver health officials are expressing confidence.
