Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by military coups and attempted coups since the nation of 1.5 million gained independence from Portugal in 1974. -- President Malam Bacai Sanha of Guinea-Bissau died early Monday, according to an official at the West African nation's embassy in Paris. Sanha became president in September 2009, months after the assassination of President Joao Bernardo Vieira. The official said Sanha was in Paris for treatment, and died at Val-de-Grace Hospital. Sanha had served as interim president and defeated another former president, Kumba Yala, in a runoff election.
