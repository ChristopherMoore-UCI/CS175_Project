" Gebrselassie, a two-time Olympic 10,000 meters champion, is the world marathon record holder after setting a time of two hours three minutes 59 seconds in Berlin in 2008. -- Ethiopian distance running legend Haile Gebrselassie has shocked the world of athletics by announcing his retirement. Gebrselassie, who has set a host of world bests over several distances in his storied career, had told his twitter blog that he was struggling with a knee problem, but gave no hint he would quit the sport. The 37-year-old dropped out of Sunday's New York City marathon with a knee injury then told reporters he had run his last race. He was the star attraction in New York, but pulled out in obvious pain on the Queensboro Bridge while in the leading group at 16 miles.
