The Obama administration said the so-called sequester would hit air travel, particularly hard, through cuts in spending on air traffic control and security. -- Airline passengers may be asking themselves: Are those longer lines at airports due to federal spending cuts? "With TSA staffing levels decreasing over time, we expect that during busy travel periods wait times exceeding 30-40 minutes could double at nearly all of the largest airports," the TSA said in a statement. The Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday that there were "no immediate impacts" from spending cuts. TSA says you'll be experiencing longer wait times in coming weeks and months -- the result of furloughs, overtime cuts and a hiring freeze.
