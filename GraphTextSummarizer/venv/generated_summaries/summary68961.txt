-- A 27-year-old man with a history of mental illness was detained after he jumped a fence at Tampa International Airport Monday evening and ran onto an active runway. The man, who was not hurt, was given a trespass warning and taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation, airport spokeswoman Janet Zink told CNN. Air traffic controllers, pilots and airport police were recorded talking about the event on LiveATC.net tapes. Zink said the man jumped a fence shortly after 5 p.m. and ran toward Runway 1 Right.
