For their next prank based on Nepal's ban on plastic bags, Ashish Prasai and Akash Sedai were in Jawalakhel, Sedai said in an email to CNN. But earthquakes are a fact of life in Nepal, and "we were still thinking it was a just a simple earthquake," Sedai said. The town, in Lalitpur District, is home to Nepal's famed Central Zoo. They continued filming as they made their way to to the historic Dharahara tower and Basantapur Durbar Square, a UNESCO world heritage site, where people crawled among the ruins. The camera was rolling when they felt the ground shaking around 11:55 a.m., Sedai said.
