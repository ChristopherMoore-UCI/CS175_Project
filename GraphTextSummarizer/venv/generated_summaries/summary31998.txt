"Isn't that a little hypocritical," said Daughtrey, "to allow people to marry who can't procreate, but prevent same sex partners from marrying, and in some of those marriages, one of the partners is able to procreate? Two of the three judges on the panel this week were appointed by Republican presidents, leading to predictions they would uphold state bans.
