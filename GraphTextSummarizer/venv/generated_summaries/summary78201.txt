-- President Barack Obama defended his proposed education spending increases Friday, telling an audience of students and teachers in Florida that such investments are necessary to spur future economic growth. The president appeared with Education Secretary Arne Duncan and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Republican, at Miami Central Senior High School -- a previously underperforming school which has improved in recent years. Obama's proposed budget for fiscal year 2012 includes an 11% hike in federal education spending, to more than $77 billion. "If we want more good news on the jobs front, then we need to make more investments in education," Obama said. Teachers are "feeling beat up" right now, Obama said.
