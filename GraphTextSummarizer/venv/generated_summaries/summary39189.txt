Weeks after leaving MSNBC, Olbermann inked a deal with Current Media, a company founded by Gore and Hyatt. "Nevertheless, Mr. Gore and Mr. Hyatt, instead of abiding by their promises and obligations and investing in a quality news program, finally thought it was more economical to try to get out of my contract," the left-wing news personality wrote. Current TV's co-founders, including former Vice President Al Gore, announced March 30 that the network was ousting its highest-profile on-air personality, Keith Olbermann. Olbermann responded sharply in a series of Twitter messages on the day of his dismissal, saying that for more than a year he had been "imploring" Gore and Hyatt "to resolve our issues internally." "It goes almost without saying that the claims against me in Current's statement are untrue and will be proved so in the legal actions I will be filing against them presently," Olbermann added, vowing later that the "truth of the ethics" of Gore and Hyatt eventually "will come out."
