Authorities in Portage worked to evacuate residents as the levee approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the Midwest last week. The levee's failure comes after a week of rainfall that dumped as much as 11 inches of rain in parts of Wisconsin and neighboring Minnesota. "This is a 120-year-old relic," Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources spokesman Greg Matthews said Sunday. But the levee system, built in the 1890s, was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- "without any engineering design or adherence to any standards," the Natural Resources department said in a statement last week. -- As many as 100 homes could be affected by flood waters in Wisconsin due to the failure of a 120-year-old sand levee along the Wisconsin River.
