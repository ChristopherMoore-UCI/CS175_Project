Five men -- Suveg Singh, 84; Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Ranjit Singh, 49; Sita Singh, 41; Prakash Singh, 39 -- and a woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur, were killed by Page. On Thursday, the first lady first met with the gurdwara secretary, Kulwant Singh Dhaliwal, and Mayor Stephen Scaffidi in the hallway of Oak Creek High School. The gunman, identified by police as 40-year-old Army veteran Wade Michael Page, later killed himself. "I'm sorry it's under these circumstances, but I am anxious to meet with the families and lend whatever support I can." One of the survivors Obama met was Santokh Singh, who was released from the hospital last week. The shooting -- which left six people dead and four others wounded -- occurred August 5 at a gurdwara, or Sikh house of worship, in Oak Creek.
