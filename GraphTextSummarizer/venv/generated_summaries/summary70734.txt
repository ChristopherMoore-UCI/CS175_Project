Doc Watson made his share of music for museums and dignitaries and international audiences, but it was the same music he would have made in your living room: extraordinary music for ordinary occasions. The British folk rebels of the early 1970s explained their rocked-out Child ballads as a way of taking folk music out of museums and giving it back to folks. If the one great book of American popular music is ever written, Doc Watson might not even need his own chapter. Watson merely changed gears; he was comfortable with the ballads and tunes he'd grown up with, and he was equally deft at re-creating the brother duets he had heard on the radio when he played them with their author, Bill Monroe, the prickly creator of bluegrass music. He recorded music he liked with performers he liked, and he kept an ear out for the generation that was coming up behind him.
