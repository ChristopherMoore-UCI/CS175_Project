The 15-day route from Cape Town to Dar es Salaam is a train lover's dream, taking a meandering route from the Cape through the heart of South Africa, up to the Madikwe Game Reserve and then onto Zimbabwe for an overnight stay at the Victoria Falls Hotel. Rovos Rail offers a series of journeys across South Africa and beyond that allow passengers to encounter the region's spectacular scenery and some of the big beasts that roam it. It's best to claim a spot at the very rear of the car, which is gloriously exposed so passengers can sit on a long bench or lean over the railing to claim uninterrupted views of the goldfields, the Karoo and eventually the mountains and winelands that surround Cape Town. The train then crosses the length of Zambia, sometimes churning, sometimes crawling until it reaches Chishimba Falls in the rarely visited Northern Province. Itineraries include trips between the South African cities of Pretoria and Durban that take in the Nambiti Conservancy (a Big Five retreat in KwaZulu-Natal) or to Victoria Falls via Botswana, Zimbabwe and the Hwange National Park wildlife sanctuary.
