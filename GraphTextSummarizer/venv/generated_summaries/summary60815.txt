A superb Alessandro Diamanti free-kick and a second from Carlton Cole proved enough for the Hammers, giving new owners David Sullivan and David Gold victory against the club they used to own. But United levelled soon after when Ryan Giggs' pull-back was put through his own net by defender James Collins. However, his spot-kick lacked power and direction and was comfortably saved by goalkeeper Petr Cech. The home side scored the only goal in the 16th minute when goalkeeper Boaz Myhill diverted Martin Olsson's cross into his own net. Manchester United would have gone top of the table with a win at Aston Villa, but the defending champions drew 1-1 after playing most of the match with 10 men following the dismissal of Portuguese winger Nani.
