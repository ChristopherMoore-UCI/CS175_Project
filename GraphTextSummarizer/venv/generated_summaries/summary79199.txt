-- The pastor of a Maryville, Illinois, church was shot to death during a service Sunday in front of horrified church members who then tackled the gunman, state police said. Winters and the gunman apparently exchanged words before the 27-year-old man fired four shots, hitting the pastor's Bible and then the pastor, said Illinois State Police Director Larry Trent. Trent said police are still trying to determine a motive in the shooting and that church members did not recognize the gunman. Two of those who went after the attacker suffered injuries that aren't life-threatening, while the suspect's injuries are "very serious," Illinois state police spokesman Ralph Timmins said. The man then pulled out a knife before being tackled by some of about 150 worshippers attending the service in southern Illinois, near St. Louis, Missouri.
