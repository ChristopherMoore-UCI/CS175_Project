-- If you think drag racing is extreme, you should try doing it uphill and on sand. In contrast, Jasem Al-Ali of Team Victory learned how to build his vehicle from online videos. Perhaps nothing tests all of these better than the Liwa International Festival, which ended last month, where 100 dune-bashing competitors battled it out to be the fastest up the tallest sand hill in the UAE. The annual event also features a classic car show, as well as traditional sports such as falcon, camel and horse racing. Dune bashing is an action-packed motorsport popular in the Gulf, enjoyed by both local Emiratis and foreign tourists alike.
