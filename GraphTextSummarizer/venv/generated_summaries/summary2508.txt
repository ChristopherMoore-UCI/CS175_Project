"Officers attempted to contact Mr. Jones at his residence Sunday evening, but were unsuccessful," Albuquerque police said in a statement. Jon "Bones" Jones, the reigning UFC light heavyweight champion, is wanted for "his possible involvement in a hit-and-run accident" Sunday morning, Albuquerque police said. Jones is scheduled to fight Anthony Johnson in UFC 187 on May 23 in Las Vegas. One of the biggest stars in mixed martial arts is wanted for questioning after a hit-and-run crash in New Mexico. A pregnant woman in her 20s who was driving another vehicle suffered minor injuries in the accident, police said.
