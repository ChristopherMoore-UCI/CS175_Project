"The Russian visitor explosion has been so fast that perhaps some hoteliers still haven't quite picked up on it," says Matt Walls, vice president of Hotels.com -- a booking site that recently released a global survey on Russian tourists. Russian travelers are increasingly booking trips abroad, and hotels and touring companies are working overtime to win their patronage. In 2012, Russian tourists spent $43 billion abroad -- making them the fifth highest-spending segment of the travel industry. "Now is the time (for them to do so), because unless you can cater to the needs of Russian customers, they'll go and stay somewhere else," he adds. At the Jumeirah Carlton Towers, special menus cater to Russian tastes and Russian-language shopping guides help guests navigate the city's department stores.
