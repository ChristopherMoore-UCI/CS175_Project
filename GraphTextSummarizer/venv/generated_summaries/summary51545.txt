The two played in Cincinnati just a few weeks ago and Monfils stretched Federer to a deciding third set. Federer saved two match points and rallied from two sets down to defeat enigmatic Frenchman Gael Monfils 4-6 3-6 6-4 7-5 6-2 in a late-night thriller in New York. " Federer faces the resurgent Marin Cilic in Saturday's semifinals after the big-serving Croat dispatched Czech sixth seed Tomas Berdych in straight sets. He double faulted twice to drop serve in the next game, Federer held to claim the set and the 33-year-old then cruised in a quick fifth set. While Federer saved the second match point with a winning forehand, Monfils had an opportunity on the first match point, only to miss a backhand long.
