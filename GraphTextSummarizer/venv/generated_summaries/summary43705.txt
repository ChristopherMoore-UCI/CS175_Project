The former world champions face a humiliating early exit from the tournament if they fail to beat hosts South Africa, or if Group A rivals Mexico and Uruguay draw in the day's other game. French hamburger chain Quick has already canceled ads featuring Anelka. " The squad, who said they only turned out to greet fans, promptly walked off and were joined by Domenech on the bus, who then emerged to read a statement on behalf of the players to declare their unanimous opposition to the decision of the French Football Federation to send Anelka home. But French captain Patrice Evra was reported to be incensed that details of the incident were leaked to the media, claiming there was a "traitor" in the French camp. Accordingly, and to mark their opposition to the highest level of French football, all players decided not to participate in the work-out.
