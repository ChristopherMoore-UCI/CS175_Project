It is also the largest number of House pickups since Democrats picked up 75 seats in 1948. Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, will be the new Speaker of the House, replacing Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California, as the GOP rolled in Tuesday's midterm elections, gaining a majority for the first time in four years. The GOP made sizable inroads in Virginia, where a trio of Democratic incumbents were projected to lose, according to CNN analysis of exit poll data. In a statement early Wednesday, Pelosi defended the work Democrats have done in the House. With about 100 of the 435 House seats at stake considered "in play," or competitive, an anti-Democratic mood was predicted to result in big Republican gains.
