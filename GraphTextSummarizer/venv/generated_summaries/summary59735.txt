The Times reported that Sharpton is still liable for personal federal tax liens of more than $3 million, and state tax liens of $777,657. Civil rights leader Al Sharpton sharply denounced an extensive New York Times report that he and his companies are subject to $4.5 million in current state and federal tax liens. Sharpton's former aide Rachel Noerdlinger is also adviser to the wife of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, Chirlane McCray. Sharpton has been a regular face in New York and Washington political circles. His press conference came as his group prepares for the grand jury decision regarding police officer Darren Wilson to be announced in Ferguson, Missouri as soon as this week.
