Petty Officer 2nd Class Samuel Lewis Stiles was discovered surrounded by seven or eight alcoholic drink cans on the platform in Haiki Station in Nagasaki Prefecture at 5 a.m. Sunday, Haiki police said. -- A U.S. Navy sailor has been found dead with a head injury at a Japanese train station, local police said Monday. Stiles was stationed at the U.S. base in Sasebo, the city in Nagasaki where Haiki Station is situated. The death, which police say they are investigating as either an accident or a crime, comes at a delicate time for the U.S. military in Japan after two U.S. sailors were arrested earlier this month on accusations they raped a local woman. That case provoked an angry reaction from Japanese officials, and the U.S. military responded by imposing a curfew on its troops in Japan.
