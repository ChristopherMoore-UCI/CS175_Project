" Tensions between the side were stoked before the match started when India batsman Gautam Gambhir criticised Siddle, saying the bowler could only perform his own wickets. Captain Michael Clarke and his predecessor Ricky Ponting, who both made double centuries in Australia's first innings of 604-7 declared, were unbeaten on nine and one respectively at the end of the third day. Australia reached stumps on 50-3 in their second innings, an overall lead of 382 runs after India's first-innings 272. Kohli also complained about abuse from the crowd -- a single-day record 35,081 for Australia-India matches at the venue -- when he was fielding later. Ajmal, who took 7-55 as Pakistan won the first test in Dubai by 10 wickets, dismissed opener Alastair Cook (94), Kevin Pietersen (14) and Eoin Morgan (three) in the last 30 minutes.
