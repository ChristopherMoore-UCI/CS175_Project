He will be joined in the quarter-finals at Halle by Federer, who beat Germany's Florian Mayer. -- Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer began their grass court seasons with straight-sets victories in the first round of the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany. The world number two, whose only previous visit to the Halle tournament in 2005 ended in a shock first round defeat to Alexander Waske, was relieved to come though the match after a gruelling clay court season. Home player Mayer put up a brave fight against the world number three, with Federer securing a solitary break in each set to seal a 6-4 7-5 victory. Nadal, playing in his first singles match since winning the French Open at Roland Garros last week, cruised to a 7-5 6-1 win against Slovakia's Lucas Lacko.
