-- A Virginia man pleaded no contest to capital murder on Tuesday in the death of his girlfriend and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole, Roanoke County officials said. He dropped the "abduction with intent to defile" charge and sentenced him to life in prison with no chance of parole. In January 2011, Easley wrote a letter to the Roanoke Times, saying the girl was his willing cross-country companion. Circuit Court Judge James Swanson accepted Easley's plea and found him guilty of capital murder. Jeffrey Scott Easley, 33, was accused of murdering 41-year-old Tina Smith and abducting her 12-year-old daughter.
