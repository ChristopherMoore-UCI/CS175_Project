Stewie making a joke about holding a handgun sideways has very little if anything to do with background checks or mental health care. Why it's so difficult to solve America's gun problem can somewhat be explained within 20 seconds of the 17th episode of "The Family Guy's" eighth season. Instead of constantly searching for sweeping laws that approach all gun violence as one in the same, we need to recognize that the comedic bit in episode 17 of the eighth season of "The Family Guy" has nothing to do with Newtown. When it comes to the conversation on guns, we must remember one size does not fit all. Pretending the weekly gun violence that grips places such as Chicago and Baltimore doesn't run along racial lines is counterproductive.
