At exactly 9:15 a.m., a bell rang out over the city of Beslan and the remnants of School Number 1, where 32 heavily armed militants took more than 1,200 people -- children, parents and teachers -- hostage on the first day of school in 2004. Mourners visit the Beslan school gymnasium on the fifth anniversary of the massacre. But relatives of the Beslan massacre victims are still searching for answers, and asking if anything has changed in the still-restive North Caucuses. Officials say a militant set off a bomb on the third day of the siege, prompting special forces to respond with a barrage of gunfire. In an address Tuesday marking the first day of the school year, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev made no mention of the Beslan massacre.
