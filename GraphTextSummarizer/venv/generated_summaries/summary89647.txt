The stars of those teams -- Walt Frazier, Willis Reed, Bill Bradley, Dave DeBusschere, Jerry Lucas and Earl Monroe -- could appreciate the way the Knicks have transformed with Lin as point guard. He could knock down the stereotype that Asian-Americans can't excel at team sports, opening opportunities for countless others. But they have been playing a pretty brand of basketball since Lin took the reins as point guard. And, as any old school Knicks fan can tell you, it won't be the first time it's happened. But for years, with few exceptions, the Knicks have put predictable, star-driven teams on the floor, living and dying on the abilities of a couple of great players rather than an entire unit.
