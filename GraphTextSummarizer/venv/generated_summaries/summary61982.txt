U.S. air safety authorities have ordered the replacement of a part on A330 planes following the crash of Air France Flight 447. The FAA order requires aircraft operators to replace certain Thales pitot probes with certain Goodrich or newer-design Thales pitot probes. All 228 people on Air France Flight 447 were killed when the Airbus A330 plane crashed June 1 en route to Paris, France, from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. airlines Thursday to replace a part that has come under suspicion in the crash of Air France Flight 447. A spokeswoman for Delta airlines, Northwest's parent company, said affected Northwest planes are getting new parts.
