"While the ICC makes itself feel good and diplomats can chatter about their commitment to international law, the fact of the matter is their action takes off the table any possibility that Gadhafi could flee to a retirement haven outside Libya. -- The International Criminal Court is still trying to link Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, his son and his brother-in-law to rapes, but it does not yet have enough evidence to do so, prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said Tuesday. The court is not asking international forces operating in Libya to arrest the suspects, he said, explaining that Libya has the primary responsibility to do so as a United Nations member. It has evidence that rapes have taken place in Libya's civil war, he said, but he cannot prove Gadhafi ordered them. But "by far the greatest crimes committed in Libya are committed by the Gadhafi forces," he said, explaining why the court investigation began with them.
