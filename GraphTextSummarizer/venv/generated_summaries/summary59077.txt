Having seen homes in neighboring villages sink, Xiao realized his long-held fears were coming true. In recent years, local officials tried several creative solutions for the sinkhole crisis, transforming the gaping holes into water theme parks, fishing ponds and lakes. "Local government would not consider filling sinkholes," Gu said. "The fund from central government for fixing sinkholes can barely cover expenses," government official Han Xizhong told CNN. The land here is honeycombed with coal mines, which can form massive sinkholes that leave thousands of homes uninhabitable every year.
