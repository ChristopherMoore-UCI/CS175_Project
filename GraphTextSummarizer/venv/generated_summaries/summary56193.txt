Data is constantly being processed and transmitted to regulate internal systems, from flight controls to fuel systems and hundreds more. Pilots verbally report set latitude and longitude positions on their cleared flight plans to a ground-based service called AIRINC. It is also possible the airplane flew out of ATC radar range by navigational error. Boeing recommended both a mechanical and procedural modification for the potential, but not totally verified, problem for many Boeing airplanes. If the airplane deviated from its assigned route because of an emergency, no problem would be indicated until the next reporting point because of the lack of ATC radar coverage.
