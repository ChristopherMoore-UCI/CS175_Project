" Pinette was in college working on an accounting degree when he started performing at open mic nights at Boston comedy clubs in the 1980s, Schapiro said. Although past addiction problems "took a toll on his body," Pinette was "clean and sober" at the end, his longtime manager Larry Schapiro said Monday. Comedian John Pinette was found dead in a Pittsburgh hotel room Saturday, the Allegheny County medical examiner's office said Monday. His dramatic weight loss was the subject of a new comedy set he was developing that he titled "They Call Me Slim," Schapiro said. "He went to work the next day but  went to lunch and never came back," Schapiro said.
