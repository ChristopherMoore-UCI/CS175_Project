Army Maj. Gen. Harold Greene worked his way up the military over 34 years to become a training leader and infrastructure expert in the U.S. effort to heal war-torn Afghanistan, where he was killed Tuesday. Greene had served as deputy for acquisition and systems management in the Army's headquarters in Washington before deploying to Afghanistan, according to an Army website. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno described Greene and soldiers who were wounded in Tuesday's attack as "professionals, committed to the mission" in Afghanistan. His prior assignment was the program executive officer leading the group responsible for "research, development, acquisition, and life cycle management of the Army intelligence, electronic warfare and sensor systems. " When he was promoted to brigadier general in 2009, Greene earned praise for what one military leader called his "singular ability to display wisdom." "He has the rare abilities to make others better, and that's something very special too because at the level he's at right now his ability to inspire others, to show others the way, is so important as well," Lt. Gen. Stephen M. Speakes said at the time.
