"This is probably the only definitely habitable environment that we've described and recorded," said Paul Mahaffy, principal investigator for Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars investigation at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. And if there were microbial fossils in the rock,  the rover would not be able to resolve individual fossil microbes even with the many cameras on board Curiosity, including the high-powered MAHLI, Grotzinger said. The rock that Curiosity found, on the other hand, has calcium sulfate and seems to have been in water with a neutral pH. "This rock quite frankly looks like a typical thing that we would get on Earth," Grotzinger said.
