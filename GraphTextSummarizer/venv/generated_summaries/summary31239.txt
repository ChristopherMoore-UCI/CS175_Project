Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres, operates six hospitals and four health centers in northern Syria and has been trying to help Syrian refugees who have fled the violence that has gripped the country since the war began in April 2011. -- Five workers for Doctors Without Borders were abducted from a house the organization was using in northern Syria, the group said Friday. He said that he does not know all the nationalities of the workers and would not release more information, citing safety concerns for the workers. Rebel forces and Islamic militants control much of Syria's northern territories. The five were abducted Thursday evening "by a group allegedly for questioning," said Guillermo Agar, a Doctors Without Borders representative.
