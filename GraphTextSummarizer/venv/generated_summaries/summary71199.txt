The awards, announced Tuesday, are based on the popularity of destinations and take into account insights from millions of the travel review site's users. Europe is a hit with TripAdvisor users, with 7 of the top 10 destinations located there. New York and San Francisco top that list, followed by Chicago, Las Vegas, Orlando, Washington, Boston, Los Angeles, Honolulu and New Orleans in the the top 10. The lasting draw of these destinations is borne out in TripAdvisor's fifth annual Travelers' Choice Destinations awards. Awards are also bestowed upon the top U.S. destinations.
