-- Former News of the World journalist and royal editor Clive Goodman told a court in London Thursday that Princess Diana had leaked a royal phone book to him, UK media reported. Others include Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International and onetime editor of The Sun and News of the World newspapers, and Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor who went on to work for Prime Minister David Cameron. The News of the World was closed down by News International, a UK division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., in 2011 amid public outrage over claims its employees had hacked the voice mail of a British schoolgirl who went missing and was later found murdered in 2002. Goodman is one of seven people on trial on phone hacking charges. The jury has previously been told that Goodman pleaded guilty in 2007 to phone hacking charges.
