Kashif Parvaiz was wounded four times, and his wife, Nazish Noorani, was fatally shot about 11 p.m. Tuesday as the couple pushed a stroller carrying their 3-year-old son, Morris County Prosecutor Robert A. Bianchi said at a news conference. Parvaiz and Antoinette Stephen of Boston, both 26, have been arrested, charged with murder, conspiracy and unlawful possession of a weapon, Bianchi said. " Bianchi said Stephen was arrested in Boston on Thursday night. On Friday, prosecutors would not characterize the relationship of Parvaiz and Stephen. While being treated for his wounds, which were not life-threatening, Parvaiz described the shooters as three men who shouted "slurs about terrorists" at the couple before fleeing on foot, according to a release from Morris County prosecutors.
