According to a memo the Holocaust Museum found among Kempner's documents, Kempner received permission from the Office of the Chief of Counsel of War Crimes to keep unclassified documents "for purposes of writing, lecturing and study" as the trials drew to an end and he returned home with an unknown number of documents in his possession that were kept out of reach of other scholars. See pages of Rosenberg's diary (in German) Kempner, a German-Jewish lawyer who fled to the U.S. during the war and later returned to serve as the deputy chief counsel at Nuremberg, removed the Rosenberg diary from U.S. government facilities and kept them until his death in 1993, according to the release from the Delaware U.S. attorney's office. In examining the papers, Mayer and other researchers hope to learn more details about how Rosenberg carried out his role as head of the German-controlled territories in Eastern Europe, including Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine and parts of Belarus, where a large number of war crimes were committed. David L. Hall, an assistant U.S. attorney who investigated the case, said Kempner was not given title to the documents. "There would not have been any authority to do that because they were U.S. government property," Hall told CNN.
