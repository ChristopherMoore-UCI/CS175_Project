CNN has been a leader in modernizing debates, turning them into two-way communications events, connecting voters not only with candidates but also with each other. This year, there is no better example than Ohio, where incumbent Republican Gov. John R. Kasich is leading his Democrat challenger, Cuyahoga County Executive Ed FitzGerald, by a healthy margin -- after FitzGerald spectacularly imploded, effectively destroying himself, his campaign staff and all political life in his vicinity. In less headline-grabbing state and federal contests, political debates have often become empty theater, scripted to be meaningless and do everything but inform voters. The days of relying on only a few static pillars of voter education -- debates and newspaper endorsements, for example -- are over. Ed FitzGerald will not be the next governor of Ohio, so voters won't appreciably benefit from being informed on his positions, whether policy or personal.
