Meanwhile, crews battled the massive Wallow fire in eastern Arizona on several fronts Thursday as they dealt with strong winds and low relative humidity. It has grown into the largest fire ever in Arizona, according to fire officials. The raging blaze started last month in eastern Arizona, devouring hundreds of thousands of acres before spilling into New Mexico. "This whole part of the country is in extreme drought," said Dale Thompson, a spokesman for fire crews. -- The Monument fire, which has scorched 40 homes in southern Arizona, has quite an arsenal to use against firefighters.
