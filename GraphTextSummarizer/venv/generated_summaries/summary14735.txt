Hersman said the safety board hopes the accident will be a catalyst for change at WMATA and lead to greater federal oversight and improved safety standards for rail transit systems nationwide. "The layers of safety deficiencies uncovered during the course of this investigation are troubling and reveal a systemic breakdown of safety management at all levels," NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said. The safety board is recommending that the government set standards for the ability of transit cars to withstand crashes, as well as the ability of passengers to get out of damaged cars. -- A year after a Washington, D.C., subway crash killed nine people and injured dozens, federal accident investigators on Tuesday blamed faulty track circuits for the wreck, but also criticized the numerous local and federal entities entrusted with keeping passengers safe. Automated systems should have prevented the two trains from occupying the same stretch of track at the same time.
