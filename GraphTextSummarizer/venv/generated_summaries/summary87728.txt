" Nabil Sha'ath, senior Palestinian official "The death of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela caused a lot of sadness here in Palestine and in my heart as well as for President (Mahmoud) Abbas, who had a long meeting with him in Caracas that he always remembers. We hope that as Venezuelans mourn the passing of President Chavez and recall his positive legacies -- especially the gains made for the poor and vulnerable -- the political leaders will move the country forward by building a new consensus that ensures equal opportunities for all Venezuelans to participate in every aspect of national life." U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee "Hugo Chavez ruled Venezuela with an iron hand and his passing has left a political void that we hope will be filled peacefully and through a constitutional and democratic process, grounded in the Venezuelan constitution and adhering to the Inter-American Democratic Charter. " Chinese Foreign Ministry "President Chavez has been an outstanding leader of Venezuela and a good friend of the Chinese people. My thoughts are with the family of President Chavez and the people of Venezuela. Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter "President Chavez will be remembered for his bold assertion of autonomy and independence for Latin American governments and for his formidable communication skills and personal connection with supporters in his country and abroad to whom he gave hope and empowerment.
