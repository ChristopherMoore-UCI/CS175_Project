The bill as currently written commits additional resources to southern border security and establishes a new system of metrics to measure border control effectiveness, but critics insist the plan is full of holes and will ultimately do little to help stem to the tide of illegal immigration. "When it comes to border security, for whatever reason, Democrats are going to be inclined to say it is secure and Republicans are going to be inclined to say it's not," said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina. " "Don't make an effort to kill a bill that is the best hope for immigration reform," Schumer said. While claiming to strengthen the border, the legislation would also create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants while bringing dramatic change to labor policy on America's farms. Cruz's amendment, similar to Grassley's, would have blocked any legalization of undocumented residents until "operational control" of the entire Mexican border has been established.
