But instead of following the usual path of producing cocoa to be exported to EU countries, the two friends decided to start manufacturing cocoa products themselves. Last May, their startup began selling a variety of locally-made treats, including milk chocolate, cocoa powder, cocoa butter and white chocolate. In global terms, chocolate consumption across Africa is fairly uncommon, apart from South Africa and a few markets in North Africa. In reality, 68% of cocoa grown in the world is from small-family farms in Africa, with a third of the global supply hailing from a single cocoa production powerhouse in the continent: the Ivory Coast. The Ivory Coast's lion's share is increasing year-on-year with cocoa bean production in the country expected to reach an estimated 1.730 million tons for the 2013/2014 cocoa season, compared to 1.449 million tons recorded for the previous period.
