-- Former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas has spoken of his relief at finally making public the fact he is gay -- and now wants to become a role model for gay people in sport. I loved rugby so much and it was so important to me that I made the decision to keep my sexuality secret. I think it proves there is a place for gay men in every walk of life. "Every gay man will tell you that 'coming out' is like a weight lifted from your shoulders and beng able to walk down the street knowing that there is nothing for me to hide has been a liberating experience, " admitted Thomas -- the most capped player in Wales history with 100 appearances for his country. "What I am trying to do is break the trend in rugby and sport in general and show any aspiring sportsman, regardless of his age, that the mould has been broken.
