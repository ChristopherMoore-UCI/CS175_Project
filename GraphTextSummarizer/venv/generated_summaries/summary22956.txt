Pregnant women are among the groups at increased risk for flu complications like pneumonia, infections and dehydration. The CDC says seasonal flu vaccine shots have not been shown to cause harm to pregnant women or their babies. The viruses in flu shots are killed during the production of the vaccine, which means they cannot cause infection. For example, the CDC says preliminary data for the 2010-2011 season show that it was about 60% effective for all age groups combined, and studies for earlier years found protection rates of up to 90%. And, of course, people change from year to year, meaning that your response to a viral infection one year may not be the same as your response in another.
