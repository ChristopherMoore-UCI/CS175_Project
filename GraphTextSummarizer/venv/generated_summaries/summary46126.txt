A US Airways spokeswoman said, "We are in the process of responding to the FAA and believe the flights were flown in compliance with applicable rules." In a letter to the airline dated August 3 but disclosed Wednesday, the FAA said the airline performed maintenance on a Boeing 757-2S7 on August 3, 2010. As a result, US Airways returned the aircraft to service in a condition the FAA deems unairworthy, the letter says. -- Federal officials have proposed penalizing US Airways $354,500 because, they say, the airline flew a jet 916 times after failing to perform required tests and an inspection on an engine repair. By law, the airlines has 30 days to respond to the FAA.
