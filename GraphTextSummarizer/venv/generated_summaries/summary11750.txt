O'Neill has faced heat from other Navy SEALs who have either discredited his claims or said that it's impossible for O'Neill to know that it was his bullets that struck and killed bin Laden. O'Neill said he and his colleagues, all senior SEALs, initially assumed the target was Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhaffi as the timing coincided with the NATO intervention in the North African country. and we're gonna get arrested by the Pakistanis and we're going to spend the rest of our short lives in Pakistan prison," O'Neill said. Without directly addressing O'Neill and his claims, the military brass wrote a timely letter criticizing SEALs who take public credit for their actions. The former Navy SEAL who says he shot and killed Osama bin Laden had just returned from his 11th deployment when he was called back for the 2011 raid on the U.S.'s most wanted terrorist's Pakistan compound.
