Underneath the national park's attractions and walking paths is enough hot rock to fill the Grand Canyon nearly 14 times over. Long before that, 2 million years ago, volcanic activity blew 600 cubic miles of Yellowstone debris into the air. To understand the consequences of Yellowstone's previous eruptions, open the history books to 1815, when Mount Tambora blew many cubic miles of debris skyward and killed about 10,000 inhabitants of Indonesia in an instant, according to a report in Smithsonian Magazine. Even if the next explosion is many thousands of years away, Yellowstone's cavernous heat tanks poke up an occasionally surprise. But those great magma expanses do not mean that the two hellish hollows could overflow the Grand Canyon with molten rock.
