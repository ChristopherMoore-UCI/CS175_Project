Grand Teton is the highest peak in Grand Teton National Park, located outside Jackson, Wyoming. -- Park rangers have recovered the body of a Colorado man who fell to his death on the slopes of Wyoming's nearly 14,000-foot Grand Teton over the weekend, the National Park Service reported. Tom, 40, of Boulder, Colorado, was at a backcountry camping site known as Petzold Caves when the storm hit, bringing heavy wind and hail. Edward Tom was looking for a campsite in a strong storm Friday evening when he fell nearly 100 feet, according to the Park Service. He and a climbing partner planned to spend the night there before climbing the 13,770-foot peak on Saturday, the Park Service said.
