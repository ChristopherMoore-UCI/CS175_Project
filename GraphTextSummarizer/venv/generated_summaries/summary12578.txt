Other artists inducted by the Hall under the performer category included the '60s British group The Small Faces -- best known for their psychedelic hit "Itchycoo Park" -- and their subsequent incarnation, The Faces, which featured Rod Stewart. So did Guns N' Roses, the hard rock standard bearers of the late '80s and early '90s, and Laura Nyro, the innovative pop songstress. "It's quite a thrill and honor to make it in the Hall of Fame a second time," Stewart said in a statement. The Faces' Ronnie Wood added in a statement: "Needless to say we are all very excited about this great honor. "We (The Faces) were always synonymous with a good party, and with this list of fellow artists being inducted I'm looking forward to a true piss up ... and it's a hell of a good reason to reunite and celebrate with my old mates.
