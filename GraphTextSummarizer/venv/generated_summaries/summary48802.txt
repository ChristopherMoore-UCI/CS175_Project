" Davis, a Democrat who's running against Abbott for governor this fall, told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio on Saturday that Abbott has unfairly tried to block cases as attorney general that have similarities his own history. " But Davis, who trails Abbott in recent polls, argued this weekend that he "has shown that he cares only about advancing his own interests, and often to the exclusion of other people." Texas state senator Wendy Davis defended her campaign's political ad that features an empty wheelchair and attacks Greg Abbott, saying "the intent was to demonstrate (his) hypocrisy. "But ever since he's been actively fighting to close that door and deny access to others who have been wronged and who deserve to have their day in court." Abbott, who was elected attorney general in 2002, was partially paralyzed after a tree fell on him while he was jogging at the age of 26. Davis' campaign ad, which was released Friday, opens with an empty wheelchair and mentions the money Abbott received after his freak accident.
