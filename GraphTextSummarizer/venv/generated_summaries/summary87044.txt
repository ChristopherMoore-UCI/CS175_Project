Mavi Marmara -- owned by the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation, or IHH -- and five other ships were on their way to Gaza carrying humanitarian aid and about 700 activists from various countries when Israeli soldiers swarmed aboard it in international waters on the night of May 30-31, 2010. On the first anniversary of the Israeli raid on a flotilla headed to Gaza, organizers of another flotilla planned for June held a news conference Monday that concluded with a minute of silence for the nine activists killed in that raid. The crowd, including men, women and children, carried banners saying "Support Gaza," "Mavi Marmara martyrs are our honor" and "Palestine will win." The ships will carry a wide variety of humanitarian aid for Gaza, ranging from children's toys to construction and medical supplies. It had been mostly kept closed after Hamas, an Islamic militant group, got control of Gaza in June 2007.
