Saturday marked Gabor's 24th wedding anniversary with Von Anhalt, her eighth husband. Gabor, 93, is "in very serious condition" at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt. Gabor has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. "It's a sad time for them right now," spokesman John Blanchette said Sunday.
