The staggering truth is Marlie is just one of the scores of Haitian children IKF and other organizations are scrambling to save. IKF Director Jinelle Prieto said the recent controversy surrounding a group of American missionaries accused of child trafficking has left people unwilling to transport children for fear of legal action. " In addition, IKF's efforts to get Marlie to Miami for further care have been stalled. Prieto said nearly 30 of their kids are stranded in Haiti waiting for help, and there are countless more who could be endangered by lack of care for otherwise treatable conditions. "When she was sick, we were so worried," said Stellecie Casseus, Marlie's sister.
