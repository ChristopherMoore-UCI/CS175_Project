For the past few days, thousands of supporters of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan have joined a march on Islamabad from Lahore to demand the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif amid claims of vote-rigging during last year's election. Qadri led protests against the government last year that brought the capital to a standstill, and has accused Sharif of corruption and campaigned for more to be done for the country's poor. Qadri: My vision for Pakistan Sharif has denied the accusations against him, and has offered to set off an investigation into last year's vote. They've been joined by followers of outspoken cleric Tahir ul Qadri, who declared the protest a "revolution march." By late Tuesday, many had managed to get beyond barricades made up of barbed wire and steel shipping containers -- with some even using a hijacked crane -- to reach parliament without provoking a reaction from security forces.
