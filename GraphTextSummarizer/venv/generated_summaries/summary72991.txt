Missile strikes on Syria likely response to chemical attack Pre-emptive force to protect U.S. allies Ashley Deeks, who worked in the Legal Adviser's Office at the State Department for a decade, wrote on the Lawfare blog that the U.S. "might believe that a Syrian use of chemical weapons is likely to affect neighboring (and friendly) states such as Turkey and Jordan," depending on where they were used. "Why should the U.S. be willing to intervene if chemical weapons kill 1,000 civilians, but not if ordinary weapons kill tens of thousands?" Anxious that Iranian troops were about to make a strategic breakthrough, "U.S. intelligence officials conveyed the location of the Iranian troops to Iraq, fully aware that Hussein's military would attack with chemical weapons, including sarin, a lethal nerve agent," wrote Shane Harris and Matthew Aid in "Foreign Policy." "When you start seeing chemical weapons used on a large scale ... that starts getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region. And history shows the U.S. has been selective in intervening, or even condemning, previous use of chemical weapons.
