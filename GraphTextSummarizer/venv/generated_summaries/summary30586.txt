A recent poll from ABC News/Washington Post showed Obama leading Romney among women, 57% to 38%, despite his single-digit lead among all voters over the former Massachusetts governor in a hypothetical general-election matchup. Rosen responds to firestorm over Ann Romney comment Rodgers, who was one of the women dispatched by the Romney campaign to capitalize on Rosen's comment last week, told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley that her candidate's policies will "help women succeed in this country and all people in this country succeed. Polls show a majority of female voters favor President Barack Obama over presumptive GOP nominee Mitt Romney. " "President Obama's policies are the ones that are failing, Americans failing women," she added on CNN's "State of the Union." He specifically pointed to Romney's claim that 92.3% of jobs lost in the country were among women.
