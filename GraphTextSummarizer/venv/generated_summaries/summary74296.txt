Facing a sharp increase in bedbug cases, New York became the latest state Monday to require landlords to disclose an apartment building's bedbug infestation history within the previous year to potential tenants, according to a release from New York State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal, who sponsored the bill. According to the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development, it issued 4,811 violation notices to residential landlords for bedbug infestations in 2009, compared with 82 in the 2003-2004 fiscal year. " New York is the second state after Maine to adopt such a measure, commonly referred to as a "right-to-know" law, according to Missy Henriksen of the National Pest Management Association, which researches and tracks bedbug trends around the country. In recent months, bedbugs have struck high-end retailers, movie theatres and office buildings. However, such statistics represent only a fraction of bedbug cases in the city, as they come almost exclusively from buildings in the rental market.
