A new tool from Wolfram Alpha churns out an extensive and personalized analytics report all about you based on Facebook data. You can also get a report on your willing Facebook friends by typing "Facebook Friends" into the Wolfram Alpha search field. It could inspire some people to clamp down on the amount of information they share online, and others to record even more and embrace all the interesting possibilities of tracking personal data. "I've no doubt that one day pretty much everyone will routinely be doing all sorts of personal analytics on a mountain of data that they collect about themselves," says Wolfram in the blog post. Wolfram Alpha is a computational search engine that is known for, among other things, being part of the brains that power Apple's voice-assistant, Siri.
