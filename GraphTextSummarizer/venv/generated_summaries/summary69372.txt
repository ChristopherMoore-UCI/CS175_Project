Prosecutors had argued that Hayes and Komisarjevsky went into the Petit home, beat and tied up Dr. William Petit, raped and strangled his wife, molested one of their daughters and set the house on fire before attempting to flee. On October 13, Joshua Komisarjevsky was convicted of 17 charges, including three counts of murder, four counts of kidnapping and charges of burglary, arson and assault, in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, Hayley Petit, 17, and Michaela Petit, 11. "When I looked at the Komisarjevsky family photos, I realized that Dr. Petit doesn't have any family photos anymore, because they were burned," Dearington said. He also contrasted defense discussion of Komisarjevsky's family history with that of William Petit. Beginning at 10 a.m. Monday, the New Haven-based jury will now decide whether to sentence Komisarjevsky to death or to life in prison.
