Reflecting Craffonara's passion for nature and art, Lovegrove has designed an "alpine capsule" which will rest atop Craffonara's private mountain. For his latest project, Lovegrove has teamed up with restaurateur and club owner Moritz Craffonara, who dreams of having a "bed under the stars," nestled on the peaks of the Dolomite mountains. I live in London and I absolutely gasp for good air and here at the top of a mountain it feels perfect; the air feels perfect for my body temperature, the light in my eyes means that I can see things better than I can normally see things. You don't need to be able to speak a language with design, the design itself can unite cultures, it can unite global ambitions. This whole mountain top where I am sitting is owned by Moritz.
