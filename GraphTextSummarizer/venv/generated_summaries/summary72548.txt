-- Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has met in Beijing with Kim Jong Il, the reclusive leader of North Korea, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Thursday. "Kim Jong Il wants to get something from South Korea or the U.S. or China -- economic aid or security assurances -- but at the moment he is not getting anything, and China is preventing North Korea from further provocations," Choi Jin-wook of Seoul's Korea Institute of National Unification has said. "Over the years China, within its means, has provided some assistance to (North Korea) aimed at helping it improve its people's livelihood and developing its economy," said Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry. " Kim noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a friendship and cooperation treaty between North Korea and China, Xinhua reported. It quoted him as saying that China and North Korea have made "extensive achievements in their trade cooperation in recent years" and that they "took a significant step forward in building a new cross-border bridge over the Yalu River."
