Toure de Force After a modest opening it was Ivory Coast talisman Yaya Toure who made the first decisive impact on the game, as he so often does for his club -- English Premier League champions Manchester City. Gervinho and Toure both went close before defender Wilfried Kanon scored the vital third, knocking home from close range after Serge Aurier's header had been saved by goalkeeper Robert Kidiaba. But having got themselves in front, Ivory Coast switched off moments later to allow DR Congo back into the match. It signaled the end of DR Congo's fairytale run after it scored four goals in the final half an hour to defeat neighbors Congo in their last eight clash. Ivory Coast are one step away from ending 23 years of painful African Cup of Nations memories after sweeping aside Democratic Republic of Congo in the semifinals.
