The effort to rescue hundreds of trekkers stranded for six days in a town near Nepal's iconic Mount Everest due to bad weather continued Monday. "The target is to transport 1,500 tourists to Kathmandu today," Hari Basyal, spokesman of the Nepal Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation told CNN. Lukla, a popular starting point for people on their way to the world's tallest peak, is located in northeast Nepal. With weather conditions improving Monday, the process of transporting the tourists to the nation's capital was fully under way, the tourism ministry said. Stranded tourists took 48 flights and helicopter rides out of Lukla on Monday.
