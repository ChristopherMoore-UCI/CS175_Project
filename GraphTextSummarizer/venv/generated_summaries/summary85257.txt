Breazeal, who has pioneered work in making robots more social and interactive, believes Jibo can be an organizer, an education tool, even assist elderly family members. There is, however, much Jibo can't do yet, so keep your expectations in check. The software running the robot is an open developer platform and Breazeal and her team fully expect that community to come up with novel ideas that will help Jibo mature. "Jibo is this helpful presence that helps support your family, your human network, to be more efficient and feel more connected," says Breazeal. What is being billed as the first family robot -- Jibo -- is on the way.
