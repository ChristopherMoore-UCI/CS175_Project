The victory, Wozniacki's 56th of an impressive season, means she becomes the 20th player in WTA history to hit the top spot and has been attained after tournament wins in Ponte Vedra Beach, Copenhagen, Montreal, New Haven and Tokyo. The 20-year-old overtook Serena Williams in the WTA world rankings following her comfortable 6-3 6-2 success over Czech Petra Kvitova on Thursday. " Wozniacki will face Ana Ivanovic in the quarterfinals after the Serb continued her recent good form with a surprise 7-6 7-6 success over seventh seed Elena Dementieva. "There are only two players this year that have reached the fourth round of all four grand slams events -- Caroline and Venus Williams," Allaster told reporters. WTA Tour chief Stacey Allaster told reporters that Wozniacki was a worthy world number one, despite never winning a grand slam title.
