" Young volunteers were tasked Monday with planting milkweed because, as Shelby Wanzor noted, "It attracts monarch butterflies." Shelby's mother, Elizabeth Wanzor, said volunteer work at Arlington National Cemetery gives children "a chance to see history and a chance to see people who died for our freedom ... "In addition to the fertilization, and the spreading of lime, we do tree work here, to protect the trees from lightening by cabling them, making them stronger and resisting wind and other storm factors. Scores of lawn and landscape professionals, joined by hundreds of volunteers including children as young as 3, spent the day working on the preservation of land surrounding thousands of grave sites. It's a very complete service," said PLANET president Norman Goldenberg.
