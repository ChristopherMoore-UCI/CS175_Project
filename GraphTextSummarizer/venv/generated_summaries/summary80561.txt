Robust support for the African Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) operations and stabilization efforts is vital to securing Somalia and denying the fighters operational space. Perhaps the most important lesson for all countries focused on countering extremists is that young people need to be given the tools and knowledge required to repulse those who seek to radicalize and then recruit them into such networks. Of those that executed last year's attack, at least two were foreign fighters drawn from the ranks of those who came to fight alongside Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Indeed, before ISIS, there was the effective merger of Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda, which led to increased movement of fighters and weapons to Somalia. The fragile security environment in Somalia still affords international terrorists a haven from which to launch their attacks.
