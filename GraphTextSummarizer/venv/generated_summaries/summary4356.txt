Political and emergency personnel leaders in Oklahoma City, St. Louis and Chicago, among other locales, vowed they were prepared to weather the storm. CNN St. Louis affiliate KSDK indicated the storm could be "historic" in that eastern Missouri metropolis, saying it could rival a 1981 system that left 13.9 inches of snow in St. Louis and some surrounding areas with more than 2 feet. AirTran passengers traveling through two dozen cities, including Chicago, St. Louis and Boston, can change their reservation without penalty. Blizzard or near blizzard conditions are expected as far south as Oklahoma City on Tuesday, where snow accumulations there will be measured in feet, not in inches. Still, some of the biggest concerns entering Tuesday were in cities like Chicago.
