Plano police in October released a video -- dated in April -- showing a man with a distinctive swagger who they believe is responsible. The alleged attack in his city, 35 miles northwest of Dallas, took place on October 14. The alleged victims -- all females in their mid-50s to mid-60s -- were alumnae of the same predominantly African-American sorority: Delta Sigma Theta, according to police. Delta Sigma Theta President Cynthia M.A. Butler-McIntyre this fall issued a statement urging members in the Dallas area to take precautions. The police captain said authorities do not know how the suspect learned details of the victims, speculating it may have been over the Internet, by accessing an old directory or noticing would-be victims with Delta Sigma Theta jewelry, placards or other paraphernalia out in public.
