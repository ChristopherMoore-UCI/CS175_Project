Her lawyers argued that Caylee accidentally drowned in the Anthony family's above-ground pool, and that Casey Anthony and her father, George Anthony, panicked and covered up the death -- something George Anthony denied on the witness stand. " Anthony's scattershot defense included challenges to forensic evidence; allegations that she had been molested by her father; an attempt to cast suspicion on the meter reader who discovered the girl's body; and an unsuccessful attempt to call her own competency to stand trial into question. " Anthony was acquitted last week of killing her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee, but convicted of four misdemeanor counts of lying to investigators. The case began drew national attention in part because Anthony failed to report Caylee missing for a month, during which she moved out of her parent's home, partied in Orlando nightclubs and shopped. " Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said that despite the "plethora of chatter" surrounding the controversial verdict, investigators have not received any "credible threats" to Anthony and won't offer any special protection to her upon release.
