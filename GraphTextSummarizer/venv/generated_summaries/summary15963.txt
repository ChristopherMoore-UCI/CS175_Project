Female gamers and parents playing with their kids are growing in numbers and game makers are working on games to reflect that more diverse audience. The development of new technology is expanding the reach of quality games to more players. Battling a soft reception for the Wii U, the company released a wide range of games for hardcore players as well as casual, family-friendly titles, including a return of the always-popular Mario in the new "Super Mario 3D World." Established PC and console game makers (Firaxis and UbiSoft to name just two) pushed into the mobile market aggressively in 2013, making games for the casual as well as the dedicated gamer. The Nvidia Shield, released in July, tries bridge PC gaming and portable gaming.
