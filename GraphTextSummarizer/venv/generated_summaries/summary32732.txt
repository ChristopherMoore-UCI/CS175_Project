The 1986 World Cup winner accused AFA president Julio Grondona and general manager Carlos Bilardo of lying to him and betraying him. The former international player, who took Argentina's under-23 team to a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics, will also take the side for the prestige friendly against world champions Spain in Buenos Aires on September 7. The new coach will be appointed after the AFA's annual meeting in October, the UK Press Association reported, and will take charge until the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil. Sergio Batista, the coach of Argentina's under-20 team, will remain in temporary charge until then -- with his first match being the friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on August 11. -- The Argentine Football Association will not replace outgoing coach Diego Maradona before October, it announced on Wednesday.
