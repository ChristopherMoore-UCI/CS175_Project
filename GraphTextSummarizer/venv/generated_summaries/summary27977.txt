Witnesses for the prosecution have characterized Manning as being troubled by Army discipline and testified that he allegedly bragged on the Internet about the leak of classified documents. Prosecution witnesses testified that Manning downloaded and leaked 400,000 DoD field reports from Iraq and 90,0000 similar documents from Afghanistan. Coombs has argued that the Army should have known about Manning's emotional issues and kept him away from classified materials. Daniel Padgett who served with Manning in Iraq and witnessed one of several angry outbursts witnesses have described. Padgett was the senior enlisted man on the night shift in the intelligence office where Manning worked.
