That's what it looks like now that former "Two and a Half Men" star Charlie Sheen has dropped his stage name for birth name Carlos Estevez for Robert Rodriguez's Latino-centric new action film "Machete Kills." Sheen passed on "Estevez" to his four children: Emilio, Ramón, Renée and Carlos (Charlie Sheen). I see it as him integrating himself into Latino culture," said Gabriel Reyes, president of Reyes Entertainment, a public relations and marketing agency. In "Machete Kills," Trejo returns as ex-Federal agent Machete, recruited by the president of the United States, played by Charlie Sheen, asked to go on a mission to take down a madman revolutionary and eccentric billionaire arms dealer, played by Mel Gibson, who has come up with a plan to spread war across the world. Charlie Sheen is going FULL Latino in Machete Kills.
