Earlier this year Bayern surprised the football world by announcing Guardiola would replace Jupp Heynckes as the club's coach for the 2013-14 football season, with the Bavarians subsequently going on to clinch an historic European, German League and German Cup treble. " Earlier on Monday, Tottenham Hotspur coach Andre Villas-Boas suggested the biggest task facing Guardiola will be to impose his brand of football onto the German champions. In front of a crowded press room, and in fluent German, Guardiola outlined his pride at taking control of the recently-crowned European champions on Monday. As well as Estiarte, Guardiola has brought three other members of his backroom staff from his Barcelona days -- assistant coach Domenec Torrent, scout and video analyst Carles Planchart and fitness coach Lorenzo Buenaventura, "It's great that these people were willing to follow me," added Guardiola. But Bayern's heritage -- the club has been crowned champions of Europe on five occasions -- tempted Guardiola.
