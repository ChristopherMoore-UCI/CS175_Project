"We congratulate Darrell Wallace Jr. on his first national series victory, one that will be remembered as a remarkable moment in our sport's history," said NASCAR chairman and CEO Brian France. Still, it is notable given that no African-American has won any NASCAR national series race since December 1, 1963, when Wendell Scott became the first ever to win a race at NASCAR's top level, in a victory at Speedway Park in Jacksonville, Florida. Nonetheless, NASCAR wasted no time Saturday in hailing Wallace's on-track success at Martinsville Speedway in southern Virginia. Wallace took the Kroger 200 on the racing circuit's Camping World Truck Series, which is on NASCAR's third tier. The Mobile, Alabama, native -- who lives in Concord, North Carolina -- won in his 19th start on Camping World Truck circuit.
