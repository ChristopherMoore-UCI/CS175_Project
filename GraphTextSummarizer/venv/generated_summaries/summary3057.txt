" The Huffington Post's Mike Ryan was also pleasantly surprised, saying in a review that Drake reminded him of Bruno Mars from last season: "An energetic host that's been given so-so material that he's able to elevate -- to a point. In the end, "SNL" went with a third option: It used Zamata liberally throughout the show as a supporting player, but her debut was virtually overshadowed by the night's host, Drake. "(G)ive credit to host and musical guest Drake for shifting through characters as if he'd always belonged on the late-night sketch show," the Los Angeles Times said in a review. In addition to performing, the 27-year-old artist participated in nearly every sketch and nailed them, from his opening monologue that recalled his bar mitzvah ... ... to his impersonation of comedian Katt Williams, and his spoof of colleagues Jay Z and Lil Wayne in "Before They Were Stars." " And the fact that "SNL" fully integrated Zamata into the episode (versus trying to break her out as a more prominent star) also meant there was more time for Drake, Entertainment Weekly noted, "and Drake was really, really great," particularly in the "Before They Were Stars" sketch.
