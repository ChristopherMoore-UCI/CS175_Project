Fifteen years ago, the movie's class-war theme -- the swells in their tuxedoes lounging amid the Titanic's creamy classical splendor, versus the lugs in steerage, led by Leonardo DiCaprio's penniless rapscallion bohemian Jack -- seemed a fairly standard old-movie trope. In recent years, a hint of off-putting harshness has crept into Winslet's work (in "Revolutionary Road" and "Mildred Pierce," she did too much gloomy suffering for our sins), but in "Titanic" she plays Rose as a spiky princess, trapped by privilege, who allows herself to melt like a girl and, in doing so, melts her own prison and finds herself as a woman. As scrupulous a job as Cameron has done, I can't really say that I recommend "Titanic 3D" in order to experience this landmark movie with an added dimension. The Titanic, that splendid vessel, is like the 20th century itself, launching forth in all its looming luxe and promise, with Jack as the symbolic new man on the rise -- the aristocrat of the spirit who uses his charm and talent to enter realms from which he would previously have been barred. In the early underwater scenes, when a robot-cam pokes around the wreck of the "Titanic," with Bill Paxton and his team of hipster techies hovering in anticipation, the ocean debris flies right out at the audience.
