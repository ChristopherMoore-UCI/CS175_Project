Apple does not let shoppers send e-books as gifts via iBooks, however. About a quarter of holiday shoppers plan to buy virtual gifts this year, according to a research report from e-commerce provider Elastic Path. An album from iTunes or a Kindle e-book from Amazon have become viable gift options for shoppers, especially on the eve of a holiday or for people living far away. Gift cards are always a popular alternative, but for people who would rather give a specific present, many of the big digital retailers are providing ways to send downloads via e-mail. Barnes & Noble: The bookseller's Instant Gifting covers both apps and e-books for the Nook tablets and e-readers.
