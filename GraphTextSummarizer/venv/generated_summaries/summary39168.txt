Celebration, surprise, humor after Augusta National admits first women Mitt Romney -- the Republican party's presumptive presidential nominee who, in April, had said that he'd admit women if he were in charge of the club -- offered congratulations on Twitter to both his friend Rice and Augusta National. -- Augusta National Golf Club opened its exclusive membership to women Monday for the first time in its 80-year history. The choice of Rice and Moore will ensure that women admitted to Augusta will be equals to their male counterparts, Burk said. The uproar led Augusta National to decide not to have advertising for the CBS broadcast of the Masters in 2003 and 2004.
