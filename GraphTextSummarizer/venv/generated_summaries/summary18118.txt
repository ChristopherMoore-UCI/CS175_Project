-- Former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick walked out of prison a free man Tuesday after serving just over 14 months of a 5-year sentence at a state facility in Jackson, Michigan. He was given "a small amount of cash from the cashier's office" upon his release, said John Cordell, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections. Kilpatrick had been serving time for violating probation related to a 2008 case against him. But on May 25, 2010, Wayne County Judge David Groner sentenced Kilpatrick to five years in prison for failing to report assets that could be used to pay the restitution, a violation of his probation. Kilpatrick will be subject to usual restrictions for parolees, plus an order to pay back what his lawyer called $860,000 in restitution.
