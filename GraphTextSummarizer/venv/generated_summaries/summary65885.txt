It said the results were "completely at odds with other tests carried out by independent bodies" and with "the experience of the large number of users of this product all over the world." Both the ADE651 and GT200 use technology that some scientists dismiss as little more than a car antenna mounted on a plastic box designed to act much the way a dowsing rod is used to find water. Also this month, the Thai government said a similar device, the GT200, failed rigorous tests carried out by scientists and the army in Thailand. The company declined to comment to CNN earlier this month, citing ongoing legal action. The government said it was looking into the possibility of legal action against its manufacturer. The British government has banned the ADE651, made by British firm ATSC, from being exported.
