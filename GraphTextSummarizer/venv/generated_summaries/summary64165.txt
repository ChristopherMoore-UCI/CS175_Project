They did a full physical, blood work, health history, breathing checks. It's the first to test this kind of Ebola vaccine in humans. The vaccine doesn't use live virus and can't infect volunteers with Ebola. I heard about the vaccine study from going to preliminary meetings for a different study. In the initial phase, 10 healthy volunteers were given a low dose of vaccine.
