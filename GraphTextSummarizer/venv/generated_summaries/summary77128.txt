-- Internet search giant Google is bracing for a fine that could top $500 million, after a federal probe of illegal online pharmacy ads placed on the website over the past three years, CNN has confirmed. "Well, where do they get them?" Califano warned that illegal online pharmacies are a pipeline for children who want to obtain drugs, and said Google "can do something about this that nobody else can do. " "This suggests that Google is profiting from advertisements for illegal sales of controlled prescription drugs online," Califano wrote. In 2008, not long before Califano sent his letter to Google, CNN correspondent Drew Griffin was able to purchase the potentially addictive drug Percocet without seeing or talking to a doctor. Why are we having such an explosion of prescription drug abuse among teenagers and kids?'" Califano, now 80, told CNN.
