A 16-year-old boy was charged with murder and sentenced to jail in the act, which drew condemnations from Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other government officials. The group's latest report cites the February 2006 shooting death of "an Italian Catholic priest" in Trabzon by a boy "angered over the caricatures of the Muslim prophet in Danish newspapers." Church officials expressed "shock and sorrow" over the death of Padovese, who was also the president of the Turkey Bishops Conference "I can only express an immense pain over this violent act that has taken us by surprise," Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said. "We were dismayed to hear that Bishop Prof. Luigi Padovese lost his life as a result of being stabbed by his driver today in Iskenderun, Hatay," the ministry said, saying the death is "a human, religious and academic loss." In July 2009, a "mentally disturbed young man" killed Gregor Kerkeling, a Catholic German businessman in what has been described as an anti-Christian hate crime.
