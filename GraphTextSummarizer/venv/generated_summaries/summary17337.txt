-- A cigarette smuggling scheme that cost New York state millions of dollars in sales tax revenue may have raised funds for militant groups, authorities said. New York state imposes a tax of $4.35 per pack of cigarettes. The lucrative business of cigarette smuggling Adel Abuzahrieh, 42, of Brooklyn, would allegedly drive from New York to the storage facility several times a week with tens of thousands of dollars in cash to be exchanged for untaxed cartons of cigarettes. New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said authorities are still working to trace the "astounding profits" generated by the scheme. One of the suspects had financial ties to Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind cleric serving a life sentence for a conspiracy to blow up New York City landmarks.
