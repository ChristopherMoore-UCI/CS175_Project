-- Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke has delivered an emotional tribute to friend and fellow cricketer Phillip Hughes at his funeral, telling mourners he felt his spirit with him. Haigh told CNN that cricket fans and the wider Australian public were "all making it up as we go along" in terms of mourning Hughes, he said. Australian cricket writer Gideon Haigh told CNN that although Hughes, who was named Australia's domestic cricket player of the year in 2013, had been dropped from the national side on occasion, "no one seemed to doubt that he was a character that we would be watching for the next 10-15 years. Breaking down at times, Clarke spoke of visiting the pitch at the Sydney Cricket Ground where Hughes fatally injured when hit by a "bouncer" -- a short-pitched, aggressive delivery that bounces up towards the batsman's torso -- while batting for the South Australia side against New South Wales. " Hughes' funeral service took place Wednesday in a packed school hall in his home town of Macksville, New South Wales -- a small town on Australia's eastern coast, where he was raised on a banana and beef farm.
