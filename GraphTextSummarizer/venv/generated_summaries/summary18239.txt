-- Afghanistan officials said 26 people across the country were killed in election day violence, although they hailed Thursday's vote as a success. Afghanistan observers and experts said a high turnout would help marginalize the Taliban which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 until the 2001 U.S.-led invasion. An American service member was killed in a mortar strike in eastern Afghanistan, the U.S. military said. " Election observers from 30 groups -- both domestic and international -- said voting in Kabul province was fairly smooth, though a few reports surfaced of irregularities at various polling stations. Organizers from Afghanistan's Independent Election Commission said 11 polling centers in Daikundi province were closed because of security concerns.
