Corwin, the pregnant wife of a Marine, went missing in Southern California on June 28 while scoping out photography locations at Joshua Tree National Park. Earlier this week, police found Corwin's car in Twentynine Palms, near the military base where her husband is stationed. Since her disappearance, search teams have combed through the area on foot and have searched by air, but they have not been able to track Corwin's whereabouts. Days after Corwin's disappearance, her mother learned she was going to be a grandmother. Her husband, Jonathan Wayne Corwin, reported her missing the following day.
