Steinberg said that this is deal was different from other special offers, which offer discounts on existing routes but don't add new ones. For more than 48 hours this weekend, a 10-mile section of Interstate 405 ("The 405" in local vernacular) will be closed for construction, allowing workers to demolish a bridge and add carpool lanes. There will be two trips from each airport on Saturday afternoon and evening. Anticipating the city's impending "Carmageddon," the airline known for its egalitarian seating plans, satellite TV and fancy potato chips offered $4 flights between Burbank and Long Beach. The distance between the two airports is a little less than 40 miles and is the airline's shortest ever flight, JetBlue spokeswoman Allison Steinberg said.
