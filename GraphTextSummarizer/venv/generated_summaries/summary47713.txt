In something like the way the stages of Serra's career have evolved, the sixth floor and garden somehow prepare you for the second floor's majestic march of new, eerie, defining works. This was all done with the express idea of putting capacious new Serra works on view. Until then, MoMA's new exhibition, "Richard Serra Sculpture: Forty Years," reveals that sense of humor along with the sophisticated spatial concepts the Californian explains as he leads you, glad for your interest, across a terrain all his. Made to be entered, explored, felt in terms of how they divide and define space around you, these gentle, giant landmarks of a 40-year career place Serra today at the very heart of the Museum of Modern Art's mission and capabilities.
