That was the standard applied to several universities as part of CNN's national look at the reading levels of college athletes. "We were going back to letters and sounds," Willingham told CNN, recounting stories of athletes, one who could not read multisyllabic words. Willingham, who has spoken publicly about that scandal and has received threats since talking to CNN, insists she worked with several student-athletes who would not have been able to read this article on the day they were admitted to college. The university also released some of its own data, which it claims shows that the allegations of academic problems highlighted in a CNN investigation by whistle-blower Mary Willingham are not true. While UNC says it will do its own review of what Willingham found, it also disputes the claim that it admitted students who could not do work at UNC.
