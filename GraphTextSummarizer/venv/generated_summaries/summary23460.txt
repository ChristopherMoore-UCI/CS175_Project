Hogan suggests parents be honest in their explanations, acknowledging their own fears and doubts about telling the truth. The lighthearted message masterfully sidestepped gossip and scandal: His mother, actress Mia Farrow, divulged to Vanity Fair magazine that ex-husband Frank Sinatra could "possibly" be the 25-year-old's father. "Secrets are inherently destructive to families," Hogan said. Hansen and his wife were expecting their first child, and he told his cousin he was scared of the type of parent he would be because of the angry father he had known. "For parents, the important thing to understand is that we get a lot of identity from who our immediate family is."
