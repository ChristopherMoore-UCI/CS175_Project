Reports suggest recurring iPhone alarms did not adjust to the new time. Earlier in October, websites in Australia reported an iPhone software bug caused alarms to go off an hour earlier than expected. An alarm set to repeat 'every day'" The blog TheNextWeb says Apple should announce a software fix: "We imagine Apple engineers will be working overtime to get this fixed before daylight saving time hits the USA next weekend. The glitch highlights what appears to be a trend of people using their phones to wake themselves up in the morning -- instead of using traditional alarm clocks. Reports from Europe suggest a bug in the iPhone's alarm app caused it not to adjust to the end of Daylight Saving Time in that part of the world.
