Sharing Secrets can be transformative and this project has changed my life. Most fascinating to me are the stories behind the secrets or the intimate connections that can happen between people when they share secrets. Hundreds of secrets like these arrive in my mailbox every week. I learned early on that there are two kinds of secrets; the ones we keep from others and the ones we hide from ourselves. This project has helped me uncover secrets from my past that were haunting me.
