Politics: Romney in a bind over 'binders of women' comment A 2011 national survey of thousands of lawyers, business leaders, educators and political activists, for example, revealed that women and men tend to assume traditional gender roles. The mere existence of this burgeoning literature shows that balancing family roles with professional responsibilities is part of the bargain for contemporary women. For the past decade, women have outnumbered men in law school admissions. The report showed that in families where both adults worked (generally in high-level careers), women were roughly six times more likely than men to handle most household tasks, and about 10 times more likely to be the primary childcare provider. It also demonstrates a lack of commitment to the change necessary to allow women and men to lead fully integrated professional and personal lives.
