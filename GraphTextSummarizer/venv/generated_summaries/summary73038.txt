The plea agreement filed Thursday alleges that Barrett recorded videos of Andrews while she stayed at hotels in Columbus, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Nashville, Tennessee. -- A man accused of taping ESPN sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude through hotel peepholes and posting the videos online will plead guilty to a federal stalking charge, according to a court document filed Thursday. The filing alleges Barrett made reservations at the hotels and altered the peepholes to shoot video of Andrews. He apologizes to Ms. Andrews, and expresses his deep regret for his conduct that caused her so much pain. A criminal complaint filed in October accused Barrett of taping Andrews then making seven videos that he posted on the Internet.
