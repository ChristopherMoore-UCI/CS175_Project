-- Justice was done Friday as Burkina Faso star Jonathan Pitroipa was cleared to play his part in the nation's quest for Africa Cup of Nations glory. The red card is withdrawn," CAF secretary general Hicham El Amrani told journalists after the disciplinary commission's decision. "It is good news for Burkina Faso, for the team and especially for Jonathan because he is a player who did not deserve to be suspended," Burkina Faso coach Paul Put told AFP. Pitroipa, who was wrongly sent off by referee Slim Jdidi during the semifinal win against Ghana, was left devastated after being shown a red card in the 117th minute. But the Burkinabe will now go into Sunday's final at Soweto's Soccer City dreaming of pulling off a triumph with Pitroipa ready to lead from the front.
