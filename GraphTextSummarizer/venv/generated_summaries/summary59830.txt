Fischetti said he and their third bandmate, Devin Lima, gave Cronin the large back bedroom of their tour bus so he could rest up for the shows. Cronin was diagnosed with leukemia in 2005 and underwent chemotherapy, said bandmate Brad Fischetti. When Fischetti sent Cronin a text message last week to wish him a happy birthday, he did not get a reply -- which he said was uncharacteristic. Cronin suffered a stroke, an adverse reaction to the treatment, and was left with severe pain in his leg, according to Fischetti. -- Rich Cronin of the 1990s boy band LFO has died, his bandmate told CNN Wednesday.
