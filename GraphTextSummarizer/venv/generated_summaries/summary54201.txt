The brainchild of New York architect Steven Holl, the mixed-use unit is a ring of eight 21-story towers, linked at the 20th floor by gently sloping public sky bridges, lined with galleries, cafes, restaurants, bars and shops. For Washington-based architect and urbanist, Howard Decker, buildings like Linked Hybrid form part of the problem and not the solution, although he applauds the efforts to "green-up" the project. "First, last and always, great places, great cities, begin with great public domains, and in particular with their streets. " Decker, a former Chief Curator of Washington's National Building Museum, believes the concept of a street in the sky is "antagonistic" to how cities should work. Linked Hybrid is sited just 2.5 miles from the Forbidden City and its residents can apparently see into the former palace on a "clear day," Holl tells CNN.
