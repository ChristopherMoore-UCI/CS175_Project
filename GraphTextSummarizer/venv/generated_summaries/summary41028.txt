-- A New Jersey mayor is compelling gun manufacturers bidding for gun and ammunition contracts with the city police to answer questions on gun safety in what is believed to be the first such move in the nation. A pro-gun control organization in Jersey City known as Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America praised the move, according to New Jersey chapter leader Mandi Perlmutter. The six questions are: "What do you do to combat illegal gun trafficking and illegal gun crime? Do you fund research related to gun violence and smart gun technology? Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop said Wednesday that answering questions about social responsibility is now part of the bidding process.
