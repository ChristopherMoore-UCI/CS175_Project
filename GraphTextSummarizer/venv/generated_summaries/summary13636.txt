Williams fatally stabbed a man about 20 years ago, leading to a manslaughter conviction, said New York Department of Correctional Services spokeswoman Linda Foglia. In addition, records on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration website show that the bus line involved -- World Wide Travel -- was involved in a crash in New York in 2009 that resulted in one injury, and a crash in New Jersey in 2010 resulting in one injury. A New York City official said Monday that a 15th person had died because of injuries related to the crash, which took place in the Bronx, about 5:30 a.m. on a stretch of I-95 called the New England Thruway not far from Westchester County. Staff from the inspector general's office will coordinate with the New York state police, as well as the Bronx district attorney's office, in the investigation, according to Cuomo. The company has been cited five times for "fatigued driving" between December 2009 and October 2010 -- twice in in New Jersey, twice in Pennsylvania and once in Connecticut, records show.
