Those reported to have spent their vacation time there include the late Diana Princess of Wales, Hollywood stars Kate Winslet, Eddie Murphy, Geena Davis, Kate Moss and Robert De Niro as well as statesmen such as Jimmy Carter, Nelson Mandela and Tony Blair. Now the founder of the Virgin Group has provided access to his very own private Caribbean resort, Necker Island, for a new book by Australian fashion and celebrity photographer Russell James. If you're short a buck or two, we suggest clicking through a selection of James' best photos in the gallery above as a more fiscally prudent way of attaining the Necker experience. Featuring more than 150 deluxe images, "A Virgin Island" reveals Necker's idyllic beaches and spectacular tropical wildlife as well as dipping inside Branson's luxury residences. In 1984, he opened a luxury resort on Necker that has since welcomed a long line of rich and famous guests.
