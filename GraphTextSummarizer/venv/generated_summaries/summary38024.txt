Yet its eponymous resort offers the sorts of amenities one would find at much larger properties, including a full-service, 15-slip yacht club; a 10,000-square-foot Ayurvedic spa; a dive shop and water-sports center; and several restaurants and bars (one of which hosts a weekly vintner's dinner). -- The Caribbean -- home to cerulean waters, vibrant coral reefs and sugar-white beaches -- is a near-perfect vacation destination, especially when it's arctic cold at home. Guana's single private resort maintains some 12 miles of walking trails that allow guests to explore its tropical forests, seven beaches and sugar-plantation ruins on foot. Instead of checking e-mails or uploading Instagram photos, guests can enjoy cruises aboard the resort's lovely traditional wood sailing sloop, snorkeling with sea turtles in the nearby Tobago Cays or lazing in one of the property's ubiquitous shady hammocks. Guests stay in one of five tree house-style villas and bungalows, all built of Guyanese wood with floor-to-ceiling windows and outdoor showers.
