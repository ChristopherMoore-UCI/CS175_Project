The oldest Roman colony on the Rhine, the site contains a well-preserved theater as well as the remains of a forum, amphitheater and aqueduct. To delve even further into the area's past though, you need to go 12 miles east of Basel to the 2,000 year-old Roman settlement of Augusta Raurica, located on the south bank of the Rhine. After taking a chair lift up the mountain, buckle in for a heart-in-the-mouth ride of steep curves and white-knuckle loops. At an open-air museum visitors can see a reconstruction of a Roman house and recreations of daily life from the period. At 1.8 miles long, Hasenhorn (located around 25 miles east of Basel) is the longest toboggan run in Germany and open all year round.
