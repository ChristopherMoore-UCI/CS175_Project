In Colorado, Conley allegedly told FBI agents that she was going to be with a member of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, that she had met online. According to court papers, Conley's parents were aware she had converted to Islam, but did not know about her interest in violent jihad. More than 100 Americans have tried to join various militant groups in Syria, U.S. officials say. "It's a difficult time for us," her mother, Ana Conley, told CNN last month, when court documents in the case were unsealed. When she was arrested, Conley had in her possession certification papers for first aid and nursing, the U.S. Army Explorers and the National Rifle Association, according to court documents.
