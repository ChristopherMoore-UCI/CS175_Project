That's where the Sunborn Yacht Hotel comes in, with Stevendale saying it could pave the way for similar vessels across the world -- and even be used at temporary events such as the World Cup or Olympics. Sunborn Gibraltar CEO, Brian Stevendale, told CNN. That's exactly the thinking behind Gibraltar's new $200 million Sunborn Yacht Hotel; a permanently moored vessel which could spell the future of architecture in land scarce cities around the world. "In Gibraltar there's a huge demand for hotels, but how do you do it in such a small jurisdiction?" Much like Monaco or Singapore, Gibraltar is a sunny tourist destination with a thriving economy -- yet lacks the space for urban development.
