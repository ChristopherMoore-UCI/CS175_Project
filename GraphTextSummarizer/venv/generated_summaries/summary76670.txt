"The British government sincerely regrets that these abuses took place and that they marred Kenya's progress towards independence," British Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Kenya went on to gain independence from Britain in 1963. The abuse occurred between 1952 and 1961, when fighters from the Mau Mau movement battled British forces for land and freedom. -- Decades after the end of colonial rule, thousands of elderly Kenyans are getting compensation and an apology from Britain for years of torture during the fight for independence. The veterans filed a lawsuit, but the British government asked the judge to throw out the case, saying it transferred all liability to Kenya when the country gained independence.
