When asked about the phone call Monday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to offer up how much the White House knew ahead of time. Secretary of State John Kerry's call to Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein last Friday surfaced administration tensions over the torture report detailing Bush-era CIA interrogation tactics. According to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki, Kerry -- who served alongside Feinstein in the Senate for decades -- was simply reiterating concerns about the safety of Americans following the report's release, not backing away from the administration's support for doing so. It portrays the CIA as misleading the Bush White House and Justice Department, among others. Judges have taken a dim view of the need of the CIA to completely block the release of documents on this program, and the administration's determination was that the agency is better off with a controlled release of documents, which began Tuesday morning with the disclosure of only the 480 page executive summary, plus a shorter Republican counter-assessment and the CIA's own assessment.
