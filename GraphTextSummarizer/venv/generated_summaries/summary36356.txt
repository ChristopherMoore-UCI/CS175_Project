A statement from Red Bull's headquarters in Austria said: "Dietrich Mateschitz and Bernie Ecclestone have reached an agreement which will see Formula 1 return to Styria [a state in south-east Austria] as early as next year. Red Bull founder Dietrich Mateschitz and F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone have struck a deal to return the race to the sport's global calendar after an 11-year absence. -- Red Bull, whose Formula One team has won the drivers' and constructors' titles for the past three years, could have a home race in Austria from 2014. New circuits added to the F1 calendar also have to be pass the FIA's safety tests. Mateschitz bought and rebuilt the circuit, branding it the Red Bull Ring, and now his long held hope of bringing F1 back to his homeland could be about to be fulfilled.
