A few weeks later, around my 10th birthday, I was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome and Asperger's syndrome. It got so bad that I dropped out of high school. Throughout this process, I figured out that no matter how bad of a day I had at school, I could come home and create my own world within the music. I told the school officials about the bullying and they did what they could, but I would rather be sitting on my butt at home than being bullied and beat up at school. Then my mom discovered a musical interest in me after my older sister was in musical theater at her high school.
