The justices by an 8-1 margin struck down a broader 1999 federal law designed to stop the sale and marketing of videos showing dogfights and other acts of animal cruelty, saying it was an unconstitutional violation of free speech. Alito at the time predicted more crush videos would soon flood the underground market, because the ruling has "the practical effect of legalizing the sale of such videos. "Our legislation would ban animal crush videos that fit squarely within the obscenity doctrine -- a well-established exception to the First Amendment," said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, a co-sponsor. "It also takes the important step of banning non-commercial distribution of animal crush videos, which is necessary given the nature of the Internet and the propagation of file-sharing and peer-to-peer networks that exist today. The courts, he said, have "erred in second-guessing the legislative judgment about the importance of preventing cruelty to animals."
