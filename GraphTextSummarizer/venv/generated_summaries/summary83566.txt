Sheffield United boss, Nigel Clough, has said only that he has had talks with club officials about the possibility of Evans returning, according to the BBC. "An article in The Sun today, that Sheffield United has offered a contract to former player Ched Evans is false and damaging to the club," read a statement on its official website. In another life, photographers had trained their lenses on the 25-year-old Evans for very different reasons -- he was the prized player of third-flight English league club Sheffield United, signed for Â£3 million ($4.8 million) in 2009. " Evans was never sacked by the Sheffield club, which instead allowed his contract to expire while he was in prison. "You are taking on a role model, particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that, and he has committed a very serious crime." Club statement With the media furore increasing, Sheffield United took the unusual step Saturday of denying a report in an English newspaper that Evans has been offered a contract by them to play again.
