Best choice of (possible) ghostwriter Ulysses S. Grant should have been on sound financial footing when he finished his second term in 1877. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's memoir, "A Journey," is sparking all sorts of picketing and protesting around the U.K., so we thought it might be a good time to take a look at a few presidential memoirs from this side of the pond. At least Ford was in good company; Nancy Reagan's memoirs also outsold her husband's. Today, the book is considered by many to be the best presidential memoir ever written, but there's some controversy over who actually did the bulk of the writing. Cash-strapped Grant had little choice but to accept Twain's offer, and the Civil War-focused "Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant" hit stores in 1885.
