High court listens to arguments on Medicaid expansion At stake is the survival of the signature legislation of Obama's presidency as he seeks re-election in November: the health care reform law that requires most  Americans to have health coverage as part of a systemic overhaul intended to lower  costs.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. Two families, two viewpoints on health care reform Once the tallies are sorted out, opinions will be assigned to individuals to craft over the next three months. The Supreme Court concluded a marathon public debate on health care Wednesday with justices signaling an ideological divide that could topple some or all of the the sweeping reform bill championed by President Barack Obama.
