This is not the first time the UAE has come under pressure for stopping Israeli athletes from entering. The team's spokeswoman Esther Bal says the team was told just one day before the trip that defender Dan Mori could not enter the UAE. "Vitesse did not have to go to the UAE to protest the refusal to let Mori in." Like most Arab countries, the UAE does not recognize Israel, and its immigration policies stipulate that Israeli citizens will be refused admission. In October, Israeli contestants participated in the Swimming World Cup in Qatar, but images of the Israeli flag were omitted from parts of the competition.
