" "Chinese authorities have done nothing to stop companies supplying these sickening devices for export or to prevent policing equipment falling into the hands of known human rights abusers," said Patrick Wilcken, security trade and human rights researcher at Amnesty International. These are some of the torture devices being made and exported by Chinese companies, fueling human rights abuses in Asia and Africa, according to a new report from campaign group Amnesty International. It also urged Beijing to suspend or deny trade license for the supply of equipment when there is a substantial risk that the equipment will be used to commit or facilitate serious human rights abuses. Amnesty said the global trade in law enforcement equipment is poorly controlled and China is not alone in its failure to regulate the supply of law enforcement equipment to countries where there is a clear risk that it will be misused. Most of the companies highlighted in the report are state owned, the report said, and openly promote their products at international trade shows and online.
