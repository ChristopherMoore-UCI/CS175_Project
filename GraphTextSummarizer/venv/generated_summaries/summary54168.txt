No one is sure, but the headstone of Hillary Clinton's father, Hugh Rodham, was found tipped over this week, just a couple of days after she announced her run for the White House. " McGloin said he's tended to the grave site at the Washburn Street Cemetery in Scranton, Pennsylvania, since Rodham was buried there in 1993. "The more I thought about it, there were no serious winds or weather events," he said. McGloin believes it's no coincidence that it happened within days of Clinton announcing her second presidential bid. "And all of a sudden the headstone is tipped over, two days later," he said. Funeral director Neil Regan also said vandalism is the most-likely cause, not the weather.
