China has traditionally relied on executed criminals to harvest transplant organs in a country where few people donate organs. In 2007, China introduced new regulations that banned organ trading and trafficking, and cracked down on "transplant tourism" by non-Chinese nationals. China plans to phase out involuntary organ donations of executed prisoner by 2014, state media reported. State media pictures on CCTV news Weibo showed pictures of a boy with bandages over his eyes recovering in hospital while his stricken relatives cried at his bedside. On September 1, national health officials will launch a computerized system to match organs to patients among the 165 hospitals permitted to carry out transplants.
