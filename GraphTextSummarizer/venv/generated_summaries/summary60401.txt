ISIS has released a new propaganda video showing what appears to be Kurdish Peshmerga fighters paraded down Iraqi streets in cages. In recent months, the Peshmerga have been battling ISIS as the terror group tries to establish a radical Islamic state across parts of Iraq and Syria. A man with a microphone bearing the ISIS logo interviews some of the captives, who say they are Peshmerga soldiers. The Peshmerga are armed forces protecting Kurdistan, a semiautonomous region in northern Iraq. The prisoners, under duress, call on their fellow Peshmerga soldiers to give up their fight against ISIS.
