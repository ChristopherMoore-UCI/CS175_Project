-- Wayne Rooney will be sidelined for up to three weeks, missing crucial games for club side Manchester United and England. United manager Alex Ferguson confirmed Tuesday night that the striker's ankle problem had flared up again. He was substituted in the 2-2 Premier League draw at Bolton on Sunday and did not travel with the United squad for their tough Champions League tie in Valencia on Wednesday night. The injury update from Ferguson means Rooney will miss the Premier League game at Sunderland on Saturday and also England's Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on October 12. "The boy is starting to realize probably, finally, without any question, what kind of focus is on him as a human being," Ferguson told Italian newspaper Gazetta dello Sport recently.
