-- A prominent supporter of Sen. Barack Obama on Wednesday compared Bill Clinton's appeals for his wife, Sen. Hillary Clinton, in South Carolina to the tactics used by a former Republican strategist that are infamous within Democratic circles. Are those the ideas Barack Obama's talking about?" Obama's campaign has said the Clintons are mischaracterizing his comments, and Obama spokesman Bill Burton called it a "negative, dishonest attack." Sen. Hillary Clinton is focusing her attention on states with contests next month on "Super Tuesday," leaving the campaigning for this week's South Carolina primary to her husband. But then, at the same time, Bill Clinton is here in South Carolina by proxy, running against Barack Obama down here in South Carolina." The senator from New York is zigzagging across the country, while Bill Clinton makes the rounds in South Carolina and doubles up the attacks on Obama.
