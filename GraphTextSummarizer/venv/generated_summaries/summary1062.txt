Initially, Boko Haram militants crossed the border into neighboring Cameroon to steal food or kidnap foreign nationals, but more recently the group has attacked military installations. A military operation in northern Cameroon has freed 24 of 80 people kidnapped by suspected Boko Haram militants, according to Cameroonian officials. Mijiyawa Bakary, the regional governor, told CNN on Monday that soldiers from the Cameroon army's Mobile Intervention Battalion freed some of the captives during an operation against Boko Haram. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. Communication Minister Issa Tchiroma Bakary said Sunday's mass abduction was the largest that Boko Haram has conducted inside Cameroon.
