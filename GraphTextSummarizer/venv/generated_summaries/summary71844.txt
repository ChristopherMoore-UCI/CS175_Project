This year's Ryder Cup, starting on September 26, has meant the FedEx Cup playoffs have had to take place back-to-back straight after the PGA Championship -- a schedule the U.S. tour's commissioner Tim Finchem admits has been something of a mistake. Due to the way the competition is structured, victory Sunday for one of the five would secure them the $1.44 million Tour Championship as well as the FedEx Cup, which brings with it that elusive $10 million jackpot, as Henrik Stenson managed to do last year. Americans Mahan, Kirk and Horschel go into Thursday's opening round with confidence off the back of their respective Barclays, Deutsche Bank Championship and BMW Championship wins. It has been a relentless summer, not just for the Northern Irishman, but for all involved in the world of golf -- 13 weeks have passed since the U.S. Open began on June 12, and in that time three majors, a World Golf Championships event and three of the four FedEx Cup playoffs have all come and gone. That elite quintet have earned their stripes after earning enough points in the earlier stages of the FedEx Cup, as well as over the whole of the 2014 PGA Tour season.
