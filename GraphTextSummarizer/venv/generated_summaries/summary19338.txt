-- Actress and animal rights activist Eva Mendes hopes you'll shun fur as you shop for the holidays. Mendes says she's confident that anyone who watches it will eventually ditch furs as fashion. " Mendes said her dog, Hugo, "changed her world" and convinced her to campaign against fur. But there is a great substitute for animal fur, she said. "Because he's just so precious and I can't imagine wearing him or eating him, and what's really the difference between him or some little raccoon or some bunny or seal?" Mendes stopped eating beef, chicken and pork two years ago, but she still consumes animal products such as cheese and milk.
