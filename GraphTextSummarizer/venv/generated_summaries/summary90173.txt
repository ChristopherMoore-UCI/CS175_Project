In fact, possession of nuclear weapons by a regime with Iran's radical ideology would dramatically change the geo-strategic map of the region and trigger nuclear proliferation throughout the Middle East. Imagine what might have happened if Moammar Gadhafi had nuclear weapons just a few months ago or if Iran's principal ally, Bashar al-Assad in Syria, had them now. In 2012, hard-nosed rhetoric from the United States and Israel has accompanied an ever louder drumbeat for a possible "military option" to combat Iran's nuclear program. Nuclear Iran would also serve as an umbrella for Islamist movements, such as Hamas and Hezbollah, emboldening them and leading to greater radicalism throughout the region. Israel seems to suggest that unless decisive steps are taken to halt Iran's nuclear plans, the military option may be inevitable.
