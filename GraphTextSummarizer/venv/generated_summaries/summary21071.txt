"Mr. Choudhury and the College have been successful in getting dismissed at an early stage multiple claims by several of the plaintiffs and awaiting decisions on other claims," they added. "Instead, they signed on to become plaintiffs in these cases following a world-wide and lengthy period of solicitation through letters and social media seeking to convince women to sue Mr. Choudhury." Choudhury is the founder of Bikram's Yoga College of India. It accuses Choudhury of rape at that training, and at a variety of other locations, including India, where he visited Lawler in 2013. The organization offers teacher trainings, which is where Choudhury allegedly met and groomed several victims. According to the lawsuit, it began with the married Choudhury trying to put his hand inside Lawler's pants, eventually escalating to rape, which continued for years.
