It seemed really clear that we're working this side of the street with old movies and they're working new movies. For Cinematic Titanic we use certain vendors who search for movies, so occasionally they'll bring stuff to me. We're kind of like different gangs all intersected because our times at "Mystery Science Theater" didn't all overlap. But that's getting kind of muddled now because they're coming back and doing old movies. Well, when we started we were really interested in doing very quirky movies, and [RiffTrax] were doing big movies.
