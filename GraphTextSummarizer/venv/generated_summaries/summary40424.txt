"I think we need to continued pressure on Pakistan using all elements of pressure that we're able to apply to what really should be a friend to get them to realize that the Haqqani network poses a threat to their own country and to take the steps that we've asked them to take." Former congresswoman and Wilson Center director Jane Harmon said both the United States and Pakistan have made mistakes and miscalculations. -- With U.S.-Pakistan relations in the deep freeze, former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf and American officials called Thursday for a thaw. "It definitely saddens me to see the deteriorating Pakistan-United States relations," he said in a speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center. Musharraf denied he knew during his time as president or later that bin Laden was hiding out in Pakistan. He suggested that it was negligence and not complicity of the Pakistan government that allowed bin Laden to stay there undetected.
