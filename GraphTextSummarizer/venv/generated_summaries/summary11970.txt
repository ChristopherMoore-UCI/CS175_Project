Moscow banned imports of fresh vegetables from the European Union earlier this month following an outbreak of E. coli in Germany that is blamed for 47 deaths. The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control said on Monday the number of deaths in the outbreak centered in Germany had risen to 47, including one death in Sweden. French health officials said Monday the same strain of E. coli appeared to have resurfaced in an outbreak in the Bordeaux area that has left nine people in need of hospital treatment. Onishchenko told Russian news agencies that Belgium and the Netherlands were the first to have the vegetable import ban lifted because they have reliable laboratories and because no one there has been affected by the recent cases of E. coli. The Netherlands is Russia's biggest supplier of fresh vegetables, providing one-third of such imports in monetary terms, he is quoted as saying.
