Other 1960s classics from the team include "Walk On By," "Message to Michael," "Alfie," "I Say a Little Prayer" and "Do You Know the Way to San Jose?" David and Bacharach, who parted ways as regular collaborators in the 1970s, came together recently to write several new songs for Warwick's 50th anniversary album, Warwick's rep said. " Lyricist Carole Bayer Sager, who also worked extensively with then-husband Burt Bacharach, said David made Bacharach's melodies seem "effortless." David was president of ASCAP from 1980 till 1986. Warwick was a 21-year-old songstress backing up the Drifters in a New York recording session in 1962 when David and Bacharach -- who began collaborating on pop tunes five years earlier -- fell in love with her voice. David started working with Bacharach in the late 1950s on tunes recorded by artists including Perry Como, Gene Pitney, Dusty Springfield, Tom Jones, Frank Sinatra, the Carpenters, Barbra Streisand and Warwick. -- Hal David's last songwriting project was a reunion with two people with whom he had some of his greatest success starting 50 years ago: Burt Bacharach and Dionne Warwick, according to Warwick's representative.
