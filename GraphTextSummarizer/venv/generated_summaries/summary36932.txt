Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital spokeswoman Candace White said that Duncan is in serious condition at her Dallas hospital. The New York Times reported Thursday that Duncan had direct contact with a pregnant woman stricken with Ebola on September 15, days before he left for the United States. Witnesses say Duncan had been helping Ebola patients in Liberia. So who is Duncan, besides the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States? This doesn't mean that Duncan actually got infected with Ebola in the United States.
