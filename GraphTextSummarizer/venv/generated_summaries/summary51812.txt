-- A maverick Chinese artist has filled the main hall in London's famous Tate Modern art gallery with 100 million sunflower seeds. It became a mecca for radical Chinese contemporary artists like Ma Liuming. Sunflower seeds are a popular Chinese street snack and one of the country's most famous exports, according to the gallery. Shortly after, Ai -- who is one of China's leading social activists and bloggers -- distanced himself from the Olympics calling for a boycott and saying the Chinese government was using them as propaganda. Around 150 tons of seeds have been used to make an inches-thick carpet that visitors to the gallery will be encouraged to play in and crunch under foot.
