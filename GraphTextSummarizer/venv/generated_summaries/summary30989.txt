Rains over the Philippines were only intermittent by Thursday at about 4 a.m., when the typhoon -- packing winds of 157 kph (98 mph) was making landfall in northeast Taiwan, said Ward. Taipingshan, a mountainous in northern Taiwan, got more than 1.7 meters (5.6 feet) of rain. In all, Saola dropped as much as half a meter (1.5 feet) of rain over the Philippines, said CNNI Meteorologist Taylor Ward. The U.S. government's National Hurricane Center describes a Category 2 storm as one with sustained winds of 154-177 kph (96 - 110 mph) that "will cause extensive damage." "The mountains really help enhance the rainfall," Ward said. Another typhoon -- Typhoon Damrey -- was expected to strike about 150 miles north of Shanghai, Ward said.
