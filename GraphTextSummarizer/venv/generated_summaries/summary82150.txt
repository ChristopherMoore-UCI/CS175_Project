A goalless draw in Turkey against Besiktas in the first leg of its Champions League playoff means the pressure will be cranked up another level when the two teams face up at Emirates Stadium next Wednesday. Reduced to 10-men following the sending off of Aaron Ramsey, Arsenal will hope it can successfully see off a plucky Besiktas side and secure a 15th successive season in the group stage of Europe's top club competition. Arsenal, which left it late to win its opening Premier League game of the season against Crystal Palace on Saturday, appeared to struggle with the poor quality of the playing surface. With the game becoming ever more fractious, Ramsey was shown his second yellow card to leave Arsenal a man down for the remaining 10 minutes of the contest. Arsenal had won all 12 of its previous playoff matches in the competition but Wenger remains confident his side will progress and secure a healthy financial reward.
