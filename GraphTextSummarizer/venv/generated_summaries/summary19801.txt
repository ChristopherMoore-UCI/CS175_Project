The kind of wars America fights have also changed with new kinds of military technology that have developed along with the sophistication of special operation forces. While the promise that new technology will save the nation from ground wars is not new, right now it is increasingly fulfilled. The system, put in place in 1940, offered presidents a virtually unending source of military personnel that they could tap into when going to war. Although Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were cognizant of the political costs of drafting Americans into war, the system still provided a huge resource that could be put into place quickly. When the United States went to war against Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, President George W. Bush cut taxes even further, abandoning the tradition of raising taxes in time of war.
