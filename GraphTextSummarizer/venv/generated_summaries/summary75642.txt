Analysis: North Korean execution raises more question than answers Jang's ascent Jang, 67, was born in northeastern North Korea and was the youngest of five children, according to the respected North Korea Leadership Watch blog. He was instrumental in the nation's transition from former leader Kim Jong Il to his son and heir, Kim Jong Un. Then, the most powerful man, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, had him executed. The secretive nature of the North Korean regime makes it a challenge to deduce why Jang fell out of favor, though one expert sums it up this way: Kim Jong Un outgrew his guardian and took him out. To the outside world, the transition of power from Kim Jong Il to Kim Jong Un appeared smooth, but the revelations made in the indictment cast a different light on the change in power.
