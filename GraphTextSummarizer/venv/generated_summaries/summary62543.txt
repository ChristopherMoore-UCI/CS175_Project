On Sunday the whistle-blowing website began publishing more than 250,000 cables from U.S. embassies around the world, in what it said was the largest-ever disclosure of confidential information. " Dalton also cast doubt on the contention that U.S. personnel serving abroad would be in greater danger as a result of the leaked cables. The French government released a statement Wednesday calling the controversial website a "threat to democracy" after President Nicolas Sarkozy was described in U.S. embassy memos as "thin-skinned and authoritarian. "It will be an embarrassment in terms of the public perception of relations between the U.S. government and other governments." But Richard Dalton, former British Ambassador to Iran, told CNN Wednesday that although it was a "wake-up call" for the U.S., it would not suffer any lasting damage.
