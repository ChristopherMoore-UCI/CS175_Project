The tribute page features a video of Deah Barakat explaining that he hoped to go to Turkey and provide free dental procedures for Syrian war refugees. He said he planned to work with 10 other dentists to hand out toothbrushes and paste at refugee camps and show good oral hygiene and teach refugees how to care of themselves. Barakat worked tirelessly to raise money in the hope of providing dental care to Syrian refugees in Turkey. " The son of Syrian immigrants, Deah raised money to provide dental care to Syrian war refugees. "Two children of ours, and our son-in-law...three outstanding, stunning, clean-cut, exceptional, articulate, intelligent, dedicated, charity-working kids, involved in community work, volunteer work, the whole nine yards, the best you can imagine an American kid to be."
