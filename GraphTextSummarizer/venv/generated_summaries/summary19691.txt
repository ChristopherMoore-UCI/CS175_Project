Exclusive only in this cafe The Hong Kong restaurant features dishes not available in Japan, such as Moomin House Pancakes -- an impressive stack drizzled with cream and accompanied by a three-story ceramic Moomin house containing custard pudding, chocolate mousse and mango jelly. The timing of the Hong Kong cafe's opening could not be better -- this year marks the 100th anniversary of the birth of Moomin creator, Tove Jansson (1914-2001). "I really want to introduce Moomin and Finnish lifestyle to Hong Kong people." "I thought if people can stay and sit with Moomin characters like Moominmamma and Moominpappa (parents in the Moomin family), it'd be more interesting," says Mickey Kera, who came up with the cafe concept. "Unlike Japan's anti-lonliness cafes, Moomin characters will be placed at various tables and joining a Moomin character will be up to luck," says cafe spokeswoman Cindy Wu.
