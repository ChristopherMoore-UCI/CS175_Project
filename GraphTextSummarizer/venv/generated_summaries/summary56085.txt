"There's only three other skeletons that will match the completeness of one of the specimens we're excavating right now," said paleontologist Peter Larson, president of the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. Most of the remains found before now have included fewer than half of the prehistoric creatures' bones, Larson said Monday. Larson called the discovery of a young Triceratops a "very significant" find as well, since it will give scientists an insight into how the great lizards grew up. "The largest, more mature individual appears to be the most complete," Larson said. "The fact that there are three of them together is really cool," Larson said.
