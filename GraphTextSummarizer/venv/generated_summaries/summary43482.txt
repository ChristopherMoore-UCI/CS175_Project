That also had implications for Nel and Campillo as their scores will not count for the record books because players were allowed to use preferred lies on the rain-sodden fairways at Mount Edgecombe. Meanwhile, Ryder Cup teammates Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose shared the lead at the halfway stage of the $1 million Thailand Championship at Amata Spring Country Club in Bangkok. U.S. Open champion Rose carded a 68 to leave the pair two clear of overnight leader Alex Cejka of Germany, France's Alexander Levy and India's Anirban Lahiri. America's Rickie Fowler shot a superb eight-under 64 to be a shot further back while in-form Henrik Stenson moved into contention with a 67 to lie joint seventh. Nevertheless, Nel and Campillo played superb golf, with the latter shooting seven birdies and two eagles to contend for overall victory.
