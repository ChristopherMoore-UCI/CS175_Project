Poland's Radwanska is the defending champion, furthering the Russian's Miami misery last year to add to previous final failures against Victoria Azarenka (2011), Svetlana Kuznetsova (2006) and Kim Clijsters (2005). The victory, which took two hours and 29 minutes to complete, was the second in successive tournaments for the Russian over Errani. Next up for Haas is third seed David Ferrer, who came from one set down to defeat Austria's Jurgen Melzer 4-6 6-3 6-0. In the men's draw, Novak Djokovic's conqueror Tommy Haas moved into the last four with a convincing win against 11th seed Gilles Simon. He also has more match wins than any other player on the ATP Tour this year, with Wednesday's win over Melzer his 24th of 2013.
