Murphy's story appears to be one of levity and laughter, of exposing the absurdity of racial categories, and poking fun at erroneous beliefs in racial purity and white supremacy. He wore the college's colors as a member of the track team, made close friends with white students, danced with and dated white women and ate at local restaurants without incident. Murphy settled into campus life with ease. Murphy explained that he had no intention to "pass," and once at Ole Miss in Oxford, no one inquired about his race. Described by one classmate as "arrogant" and "a loud talker," he even participated in a protest against Sen. Theodore Bilbo, the fanatical segregationist, when he spoke at Ole Miss while Murphy was on campus.
