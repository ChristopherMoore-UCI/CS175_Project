"I'd already done nude scenes in the first season, in the bath and a couple of other moments," Radcliffe said, "but there was this one scene in the second season where somebody breaks into my bedroom at night and starts intimidating me. " It's moments like this where Radcliffe weighs the pluses and minuses of his Harry Potter fame. " The eighth and final film of the series, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2," came out over two years ago, but even before then, Radcliffe started taking roles that he called "slightly off the beaten path. " Initially, Radcliffe said yes, because he likes to give writers and directors what they want, but then he had second thoughts, since the nudity wasn't in the script. At the crux of the film, Allen Ginsberg (played by Radcliffe) falls for Lucien Carr (played by DeHaan), who is attempting to discard past lover -- or stalker, depending on your interpretation -- David Kammerer (played by Dexter's Michael C. Hall).
