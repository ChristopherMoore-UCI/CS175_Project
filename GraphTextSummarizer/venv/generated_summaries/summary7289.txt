After almost being knocked out in the opening round of the hardcourt event, she had few problems in winning her next two matches and then on Friday won her quarterfinal against Uzbekistan's Akgul Amanmuradova, who earlier upset top seed Jelena Jankovic. The 22-year-old, who before this week had won back-to-back matches only twice this year in reaching the semifinals in Brisbane and Rome, was seeking to reach her first final since Indian Wells in March 2009. 10th seed Sharapova had to battle for two and a half hours to beat fellow Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4 3-6 6-2 in their later night match. Ivanovic will be hoping that the injury does not ruin her chances of continuing her improvement at next month's U.S. Open in New York, the final grand slam event of the tennis year. Fourth seed Clijsters was leading 2-1 in the opening set of her last four match when fellow former world number one Ana Ivanovic withdrew.
