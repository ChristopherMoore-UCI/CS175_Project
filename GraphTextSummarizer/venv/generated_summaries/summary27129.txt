So how exactly did the British Royal Navy vessel get from exploring undiscovered far flung lands to lying in waters off the east coast of the United States, sharing the ocean floor with torpedoes and other 18th Century vessels? For years, the whereabouts of one of the most famous ships in nautical history -- HMS Endeavour -- has remained a mystery. It was a voyage on which it first came close to its demise by running aground on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, a section later renamed Endeavour Reef, which Cook navigated in the dark and from which he escaped by ditching weapons on board to lighten the load of the vessel. Cook also provided the first accurate map of the Pacific and is believed to have shaped the world map more than any other explorer in history. "I'm 60 years old and growing up there was a picture of Captain Cook and the Queen in most school rooms," he recalls.
