The problem is, because there is a big gap between our understanding of manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft, we somehow have got to work together to bridge that gap and that's what the ASTRAEA programme is all about," says Dopping-Hepenstal. Instead, Dopping-Hepenstal believes the technology could first be adopted for cargo flights and for aircraft operating during hazardous emergencies such as wildfires. " For seasoned pilots such as Fraser, however, the potential of this technology is about far more than the prospect of a profitable new industry. " BAE Systems and partners need to prove to regulators that it is possible for unmanned aircraft to fly safely in commercial airspace. These developments could then be fed back into military design and used to make commercial aircraft safer.
