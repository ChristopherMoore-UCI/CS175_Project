These events come less than a month after Sanders held a three-event tour of Iowa, where the senator spoke to audiences in Des Moines, Dubuque and Iowa City. The Vermont senator will headline an Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement town hall meeting in Davenport, Iowa on Saturday. -- Bernie Sanders is headed back to Iowa and New Hampshire for a handful of events that are sure to stoke more presidential speculation in the independent senator. On Sunday, Sanders will headline the Johnson County Democratic Party barbecue in Iowa City and keynote an Iowa Citizens Action Network meeting in Coralville. In an interview with CNN last month, Sanders broke with that reluctance and challenged Clinton to talk about campaign finance reform, public funding of elections and other liberal issues.
