Israel had initially accused Hamas militants of capturing Lt. Hadar Goldin on Friday, as a temporary cease-fire to the conflict in Gaza rapidly unraveled. Israel's Netanyahu vowed Saturday to "continue to act in full scale" against Hamas until all militant tunnels from Gaza to Israel are destroyed. Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal told CNN's Nic Robertson that Israel thwarted the temporary peace by staying in Gaza and destroying tunnels there. Sirens blared much of the day in Israel as at least 80 rockets were fired from Gaza, according to the Israeli military. "The IDF will respond to any attempt to exploit this window to harm Israeli civilians and IDF soldiers," the forces said in a statement.
