As one of the "four others" it has mattered little that Talha Ahsan's case has more in common with Gary McKinnon's than Abu Hamza's, except that McKinnon admitted he did hack into the Pentagon's computers, whereas Ahsan denies guilt of the cybercrimes he is accused of. Violence isn't always physical -- and UK Home Secretary Theresa May's recent announcements on all things extradition fell one after another as devastating blows to an already beaten and broken Muslim community. The extraditions of five Muslim men to the United States on October 5 followed by the blocking of computer hacker Gary McKinnon's extradition this week has made the Muslim communities of the UK wake up to a glaring reality many tried hard to avoid. IHRC is just one of many organizations, academics, journalists highlighting anti-Muslim bias and depictions in everything from news media to literary classics, through Hollywood movies and even Bridget Jones. The extradition of Talha Ahsan and the reprieve of Gary McKinnon are just two of the products of this process.
