Lake Chad touches four countries -- Nigeria, Chad, Niger and Cameroon -- all of which have been targeted in recent weeks by Boko Haram, the Islamist extremist group blamed for ongoing horrific attacks, abductions and other abuses. This reached a bloody crescendo in early January, when Boko Haram stormed Baga and surrounding towns in what Amnesty International said "could be Boko Haram's deadliest act." Nigerian troops retook the strategic northeastern town of Baga -- where hundreds were viciously killed in a Boko Haram attack last month -- on Saturday, the West African nation's top military spokesman said. Some stopped only to hop onto motorcycles and chase residents who had fled into the bush, firing indiscriminately, said Baba Abba Hassan, a local district head Local officials reported death tolls ranging from hundreds to as many as 2,000 people. And given its location along Lake Chad in Borno State, about 110 miles north of the state capital of Maiduguri, Baga has frequently found itself in the middle of this violence.
