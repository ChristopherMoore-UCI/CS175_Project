-- Six protesters from the Occupy Wall Street movement were arrested early Wednesday in New York's Union Square Park during a confrontation with police, authorities said. The demonstrators were arrested after they were asked to vacate the lower Manhattan park at midnight, according to New York Police Department spokesman Detective Marc Nell. "The occupation at Union Square is considered the first 24-hour occupation since our November 15th eviction from Zuccotti Park," he said. Protesters were allowed to return to Union Square Park at 6 a.m. Wednesday. Wednesday's arrests follow the arrest Saturday night of 74 demonstrators after an attempt to reclaim Zuccotti Park to mark the six-month anniversary of the Occupy movement.
