Human Rights Watch claimed in a report on Monday that it examined dozens of cases from investigation through prosecution, and found many defendants would never have committed a crime "if not for law enforcement encouraging, pressuring, and sometimes paying them to commit terrorist acts. In one example, a Boston-area man, Rezwan Ferdaus, pleaded guilty in 2012 and was sentenced to 17 years in prison for plotting to attack the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol with model planes packed with explosives. Human Rights Watch claimed the FBI targeted Ferdaus "even though his mental health was deteriorating significantly during the time" he was under investigation. We do not and cannot target individuals solely for engaging in activities protected by the First Amendment, which includes free speech and religion," said spokesman Marc Raimondi. The FBI went after particularly vulnerable people, including those with intellectual and mental disabilities and the indigent, according to Andrea Prasow, deputy Washington director of Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report.
