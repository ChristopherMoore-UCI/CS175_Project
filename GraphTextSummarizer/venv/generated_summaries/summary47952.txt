-- Rescuers hoping to find two hikers missing on the frigid slopes of Oregon's Mount Hood faced worsening weather conditions Monday night as forecasters predicted white-out conditions that could severely hinder search efforts. " Search crews will meet Tuesday morning to assess weather conditions and determine how to proceed, the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office said after ending search efforts for the day Monday. Ground efforts have been severely hampered by avalanche conditions, which kept rescuers from accessing the parts of the mountain they wanted to reach early Monday morning. A state deputy medical examiner said Monday that the cause was hypothermia, CNN affiliate KGW reported. Rescue crews took advantage of a brief break in the weather Monday afternoon to search previously unreachable higher elevations of the mountain.
