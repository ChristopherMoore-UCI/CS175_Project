As Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad put it: This is the biggest thing to hit Muscatine since Pope John Paul II's visit in 1979. It was here in the town's historic district that Xi Jinping first feasted on Iowa beef and corn during a visit more than two decades ago. Now with Xi's visit, the global spotlight will shine on Muscatine, if only for an hour on Wednesday. She would have been thrilled to have another Hebei province official visit quiet Muscatine. It's not often Muscatine residents have a chance to do that.
