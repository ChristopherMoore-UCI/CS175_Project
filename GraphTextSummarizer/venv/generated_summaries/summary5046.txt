News consumers expect high quality when they pay for professional journalism from a Chicago brand that built its reputation on stellar news photography. The freelancers, presumably, will be carrying professional camera gear, while the reporters will be trained how to do double duty by using smartphones for visual news gathering and video packages. But smartphones can't replace digital single lens reflex cameras -- and especially can't replace the talent and experience required to make pictures for many types of newspaper assignments. I wanted to be a shooter at the Sun-Times because that was a place that valued the power of hard news photography. But these guys could get anywhere, they knew everybody, and they had the uncanny ability to somehow be in the right place when news broke.
