Kerry warned that, absent a concerted effort by the international community, "Ebola has the potential to become a scourge like HIV or polio that we will end up fighting -- all of us -- for decades." Rand Paul: Ebola is "not like AIDS" "There is no country that is exempt from being able to do something to be able to contribute to this effort and help make a difference," Kerry said. "We live in a world of a lot of close calls, tough decisions on a daily basis -- difficult and contentious issues where you can have an honest disagreement about what the best course of action is, or about what the facts are, or the results of your decision may be," Kerry conceded, adding, "Ebola is not one of them." -- Using some of the most dramatic language yet by a U.S. official, Secretary of State John Kerry on Friday called on world leaders to contribute far more to the international Ebola response.
