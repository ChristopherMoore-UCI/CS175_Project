"A family member came home, found him deceased and called us," Officer Robert Gibbs, an Albuquerque, New Mexico, police spokesman, said Monday. " Tapia started boxing at age 9 and had his first amateur fight at 11. The crazy life of Johnny Tapia -- a five-time world champion boxer who once wrote that he had been "raised to fight to the death" -- ended this week at age 45. " Tapia claimed two Golden Gloves awards in addition to professional titles in several weight classes. Tapia's body was found Sunday night at his home in Albuquerque.
