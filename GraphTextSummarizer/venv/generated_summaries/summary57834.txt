High unemployment tends to be good for Army recruiting, so the latest downturn also has helped sign up more people. The Philadelphia area has proven difficult for Army recruiters, they said, and they hope this center will increase enlistment. Potential recruits play virtual-combat games at an Army recruiting center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The facility, the only one of its kind in the nation, represents a $12 million, two-year experiment by the Army to boost recruiting numbers. As the U.S. wages wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Army has been looking at new approaches to attracting soldiers since a dismal recruiting year in 2005.
