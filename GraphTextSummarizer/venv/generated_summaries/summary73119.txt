"I think a lot of people who pass through Liverpool Street regularly are getting used to this sort of thing." British Transport Police also described it as "mainly a good humored event," adding "No arrests were made and no crimes were reported." Police did not have an immediate estimate of the crowd size, but more than 14,000 people joined the Facebook group "Liverpool Street Station Silent Dance." "It was both good cause we all stuck like a group didn't stop dancing inside and outside but bad cause of the people who could get anywhere User videos shot from the balcony and posted on Facebook showed every available inch of space filled with people, many of them cheering, though the event was billed as "silent." Flashmobs -- groups of people meeting and all doing the same thing together in public, from dancing to freezing in place -- have become increasingly regular events around the world. iReport.com: See an organized mass pillowfight in Taiwan London's Tate Modern art museum was the scene of a flashmob dance in 2007, and hundreds of people froze in place in Trafalgar Square, then formed a conga line in 2008. Videos posted on the social-networking site showed Liverpool Street Station completely filled with people, counting down the seconds until the clock showed 7 p.m., then dancing to music on their mp3 players as the hour struck. The success of the event has prompted Crazzy Eve to call for another silent dance at Trafalgar Square in central London on February 13.
