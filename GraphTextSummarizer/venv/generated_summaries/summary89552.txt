In Friday's attack, a former provincial lawmaker was stepping into the mosque when about a dozen men opened fire, said police spokesman Mir Zubair Mehmood. Sectarian attacks on ethic Shiite Muslims by fundamentalist Sunni Muslims are also common. The battle sent people rushing for cover into the mosque, said Muhammad Ejaz, who was there to pray. "We have launched search operations in different parts of the city," Mehmood said. For years, the Balochistan Liberation Army has complained that the government pays little attention to people and their economic needs.
