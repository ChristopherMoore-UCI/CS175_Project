Authorities described 30 crimes are "politically motivated," with police spokesman Guido Busch saying Friday that the motive has changed during the week. -- A string of arson attacks has hit the German capital, with vandals burning dozens of cars this week, including an additional 11 overnight, authorities said Friday. "Right now, we have reached a new peak of arson attacks in Berlin," said Ehrhart Koerting, the senator for domestic affairs who's responsible for Berlin's police force. "Right now there are about 100 extra police officers out on the streets of Berlin each night to arrest the attacker or attackers," police spokesman Thomas Neuendorf said. Berlin neighborhoods have been transformed in recent years as wealthy people move into areas that used to have high unemployment, and low housing and living costs.
