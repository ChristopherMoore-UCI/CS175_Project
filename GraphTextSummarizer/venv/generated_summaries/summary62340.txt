The three-member presidency council -- Kurdish President Jalal Talabani, Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi and Sunni Vice President Suspects can be held by U.S. forces but must be available to Iraqi authorities for investigation or trial. The agreement -- which stresses respect for Iraqi sovereignty -- "requests the temporary assistance" of U.S. forces, but severely restricts their role. The agreement, reached after months of negotiations, sets June 30, 2009, as the deadline for U.S. combat troops to withdraw from all Iraqi cities and towns. Under the Iraqi constitution, unanimous approval by the presidency council is required for ratification of a law or agreement.
