"The full extent of the damage to the 33,000 kilometers of state roads is impossible to quantify right now," Craig Wallace, Queensland minister of main roads, said in a statement Friday. During a press conference Saturday with Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, Gillard said the situation will get tougher for "many, many people" throughout the state of Queensland. Bligh said she was "very heartened" by Australians helping Queensland residents in need. The seasonal flooding in the state of Queensland intensified last month after monsoon rains caused rivers to spill over their banks and reach record levels. "Of course, that is the money in the pocket, money on the ground now, but there are hundreds of millions more dollars that are going to be required to help Queensland through and to help with the rebuilding," Gillard said.
