" The game, which is part of the McGraw-Hill Practice suite of hands-on, experiential learning games, was tested in schools across the country, including Georgia Perimeter College, Collin Community College in Texas, California State University, San Diego State, Richland College in Texas and Clayton State in Georgia.

Despite the negative press that video games sometimes get, they're changing the way subjects are being taught in classrooms across the country.
