"Many young people now experience long-term unemployment right from the start of their labor market entry," said Guy Ryder, ILO Director-General, during a presentation of the report's findings. The International Labor Organization, which is a United Nations agency responsible for overseeing international labor standards, made bleak projections of another increase in unemployment worldwide by 5.1 million in 2013 -- which would push the total to 202 million. But vast differences remain in the region, as oil-producing countries tend to have low unemployment rates. Youth unemployment is expected to rise in emerging economies in Eastern Europe, East and South-East Asia and the Middle East, according to the report. Youth unemployment tops 50% in some European countries.
