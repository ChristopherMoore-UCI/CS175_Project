"The goal of the project is to have a solar-powered plane flying day and night without fuel," said the co-founder of the project, Bertrand Piccard. An hour before dawn, the plane still had six hours of flying time left in its solar-fueled batteries. During the evening, the plane slowly descended to an altitude of 4,500 feet (1,500 meters), where it remained for the rest of the night using battery power. The plane is equipped with four electric engines and has a top speed of about 43 miles (70 kilometers) per hour. Solar Impulse has a wingspan of more than 206 feet (63 meters) -- the same as an Airbus A340 -- and is nearly 72 feet (22 meters) long.
