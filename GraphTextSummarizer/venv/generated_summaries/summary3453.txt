Boy Scouts to allow gay youths to join Wayne Brock, chief Scout executive, said the group was honored to have Gates as president-elect. The Kansas native received his bachelor's degree from the College of William and Mary, where he is chancellor, his master's degree in history from Indiana University, and his doctorate in Russian and Soviet history from Georgetown University. A former Texas A&M University president, Gates has served eight White House administrations and is the only career CIA officer to serve as the agency's director. "Gates has been awarded the National Security Medal and the Presidential Citizens Medal, has twice received the National Intelligence Distinguished Service Medal, and has three times received the CIA's highest award, the Distinguished Intelligence Medal. On his last day in office as secretary of defense, Gates was awarded the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Obama," the Boy Scouts release said.
