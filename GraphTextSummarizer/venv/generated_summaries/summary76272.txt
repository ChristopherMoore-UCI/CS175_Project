-- Italy's flamboyant former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi plans to marry a former television showgirl-turned-politician a half century younger, he told an Italian talk show this week. In October, a Milan court sentenced Berlusconi to four years in prison for tax evasion. Berlusconi, who dominated Italian politics for nearly two decades, did not reveal a wedding date. Berlusconi has been accused of embezzlement, fraud and bribery over his career, but a tax-evasion case marked the first time he had been convicted of an offense. The woman involved in the long-running case is Moroccan dancer Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed "Ruby the Heart-stealer."
