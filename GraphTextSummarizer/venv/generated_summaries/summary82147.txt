Authorities will request Morgan's transfer to New Jersey to face the homicide charge, Monmouth County Prosecutor Peter E. Warshaw Jr. said in a statement. The stream runs beneath an overpass, suggesting that the child, Tierra Morgan-Glover, and the car seat were thrown from the overpass, said Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni. The FBI had issued a nationwide manhunt for Arthur Eugene Morgan III, who was charged with homicide in Monmouth County, New Jersey. "U.S. Marshals in San Diego received information from New Jersey authorities that Morgan may be staying with friends in East San Diego," the statement said. On November 22, a group of boys discovered the body of Morgan's daughter partly submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County, officials said.
