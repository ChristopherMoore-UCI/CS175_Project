A late own-goal from defender Durval offered Uruguayan side Penarol hope of snatching a sixth Libertadores title, but Santos prevailed at the Estadio do Pacaembu in Sao Paulo. After a scoreless first leg in Montevideo last week, goals from young Brazil striker Neymar and midfielder Danilo ensured Santos won South America's premier club competition for the first time since legendary football icon Pele played for the team half a century ago. Danilo, a Brazil under-20 international, scored what proved to be the winning goal after 68 minutes with a driven shot beyond Penarol goalkeeper Sebastian Sosa. Santos secured the Brazilian club's first Copa Libertadores title since 1963 on Wednesday, defeating Uruguay's Penarol 2-1 in the second leg of an ill-tempered final. Santos' post-match celebrations were soured by a mass brawl which broke out between both sets of players, immediately after referee Sergio Pezzotta had blown the full-time whistle.
