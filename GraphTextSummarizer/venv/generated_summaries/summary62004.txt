-- The delayed stadium in the Brazilian city of Curitiba has retained its World Cup status after satisfying FIFA that all was being done to get the Arena da Baixada ready for June's finals. Some may question the decision to intensify work when six construction workers have died in the rush to meet FIFA's World Cup deadlines. Last month, world football's governing body gave local organizers a deadline of 18 February by which to have made significant improvements or risk losing its four World Cup games. "The special committee instigated by Brazil's Ministry of Sports following an emergency meeting on January 21, consisting of representatives of Atletico Paranaense, the state of Parana and the city of Curitiba, has managed ... to develop a comprehensive recovery plan which includes the solving of the financial challenges involved," said FIFA in a statement. It's a city which lives and breathes football," said a man who is also the executive coordinator within the government for the FIFA World Cup.
