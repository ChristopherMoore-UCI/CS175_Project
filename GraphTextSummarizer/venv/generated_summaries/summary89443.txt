A senior Democratic aide told CNN that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray met Wednesday afternoon and are narrowing down the issues in a potential spending deal.

The talks are especially important because the bill funding government now runs out in mid-January at nearly the same time as another round of forced budget cuts is due to hit. The two lawmakers are the primary negotiators for, and leaders of, a budget conference committee that has a week and a half to come up with an agreement on spending levels.
