It's naÃ¯ve to think it will stop when Mr. Obama is no longer president, whether that is in one year or five. But a month ago, when a Santorum supporter accused Obama of being "an avowed Muslim" who "constantly says that our Constitution is passÃ©" and "has no legal right to be calling himself president" -- For example, Newt Gingrich gained steam early in the primary process by accusing President Obama of having a "Kenyan anti-Colonial mindset," and invoking the specter of a "Obama's secular socialist machine." After his big Nevada win, this line of Mitt's scripted victory speech stood out: "President Obama demonizes and denigrates almost every sector of our economy." The real damage is to the process of running for president itself.
