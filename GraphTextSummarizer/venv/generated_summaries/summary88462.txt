A month after Panamanian authorities intercepted a North Korean ship with military equipment hidden on board, U.N. inspectors were ready to take a look. The captain and 35 North Korean crew members are charged with illegal possession of weapons and international arms trafficking, Panamanian officials said. Because it is pursuing nuclear weapons, North Korea is banned by the United Nations from importing and exporting most weapons. Panama's Security Ministry said that the U.N. inspectors would not make any public comments before or during their inspection. The inspection is expected to conclude next Friday.
