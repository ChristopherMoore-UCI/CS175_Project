This year, CNN employees will dine with actress Diane Lane, as well as New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus on the right, as well as White House spokesman Josh Ernest and Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee on the left. She got the now-coveted job after several years running a similar -- but smaller -- press dinner. That's especially true since Barack Obama became president, in part because he has an even bigger Hollywood following than the Clintons had during their White House years. Joel McHale, best known as host of E!'s satire show "The Soup" and star of NBC's comedy "Community," is this year's host. It's the annual White House correspondent's dinner.
