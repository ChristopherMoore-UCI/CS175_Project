-- Like thousands of other female applicants to Indonesia's National Police, 24-year-old Sari (not her real name) submitted to the mandatory "virginity test" that the authorities require women -- but not men -- to take as part of the application process. Sadly, this isn't the first time that Indonesian government officials have advocated such tests for women. Those efforts prompted colleagues in police recruitment teams in 2010 to defend "virginity tests" as a means of preventing "prostitutes joining the police." Indonesia's National Police has responded to Human Rights Watch's exposure of this abusive practice with defiance. Widodo can begin by instructing the National Police to prohibit "virginity tests" and ordering local governments to abolish local regulations that violate constitutionally-guaranteed women's rights. There also are alarming indications that the use of virginity tests extends to other parts of Indonesia's security forces.
