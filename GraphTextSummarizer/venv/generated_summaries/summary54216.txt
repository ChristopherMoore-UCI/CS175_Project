-- Pope Francis announced on Monday that Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II will become saints on April 27, 2014. Already, Pope Francis is a shining example of the civil society that we aspire to be in Rhode Island and across our country. As governor of a state that is home to many Catholics as well as a diverse group of believers and nonbelievers, these are the values shared in many corners of Rhode Island, where we recently celebrated the 350th anniversary of our founding charter -- the first among the American colonies to protect religious liberty. By canonizing two internationally respected religious icons who were quite different from each other, Pope Francis is once again showing the path toward tolerance and civility that is the basis of our collective humanity. Since taking the helm of the Vatican, Pope Francis has rededicated the pontificate to the causes of economic justice, equality and peace.
