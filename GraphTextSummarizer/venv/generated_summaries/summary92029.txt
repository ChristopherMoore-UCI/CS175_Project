In a different initiative, the Afghan government announced plans last week to send a delegation to Pakistan to meet with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a former Afghan Taliban leader who was released last month from detention by Pakistani authorities. Mehsud, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head for his alleged involvement in a 2009 attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan, was killed Friday in a drone strike in northwestern Pakistan, senior U.S. and Pakistani officials said last week. The Afghan President expressed hope that the death of the Pakistani Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, would not undermine cooperation between Afghanistan and Pakistan aimed at achieving a successful peace process. Mehsud's death happened as Pakistani authorities were working on efforts to hold peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has criticized the timing of the U.S. drone strike that killed the leader of the Pakistani Taliban last week, his office said in a statement.
