On Monday, a day when Sinclair's accuser was slated to continue her testimony from Friday, Pohl dismissed the jury because of 22 pages of e-mails that emerged over the weekend. The e-mails include a January communication in which a senior military lawyer wrote Fort Bragg's chief of military justice casting doubt on the credibility of Sinclair's accuser and a February correspondence in which a lieutenant colonel with the Judge Advocate General's Corps asked for a colonel's "thoughts/opinion" on Sinclair's offer to enter a plea. The defense team is evaluating several options after the release of the e-mails, Zeitz said. Sinclair's attorneys have also filed a FOIA for all Pentagon e-mail communication including keywords in the Sinclair case. Sinclair, formerly one of the top Army commanders in Afghanistan, pleaded guilty to several charges last week, including committing adultery, engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman and obstruction of justice, the public affairs office for Fort Bragg said.
