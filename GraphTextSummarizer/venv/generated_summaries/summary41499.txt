After all the shouting and handwringing, what President Barack Obama appears prepared to do over the next few days to fix some of what's broken with the immigration system isn't likely to have much effect at all. Obama is scheduled to follow up the address with a trip to Las Vegas on Friday, where he'll flesh out the details of what he has in mind during a visit to Del Sol High School, a location that will bring the President full circle -- it was at this school last year that Obama laid out his vision for comprehensive immigration reform. Just a few days ago, David Brooks, the New York Times columnist, insisted that Obama wants to "rewrite" immigration laws through his executive action. It's this kind of discretion that is at the heart of what Obama intends to do about immigration. So, however much manufactured outrage we hear from Obama's opponents on the right in the coming days, the fact remains that the "business" of our nation's immigration enforcement agency is deporting illegal immigrants.
