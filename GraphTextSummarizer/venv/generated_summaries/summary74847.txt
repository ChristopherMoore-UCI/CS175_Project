Johnson was captain of the England team that won the European competition for the 25th time eight years ago and then went on to lift the World Cup in Australia, and he will be hoping history repeats ahead of this year's premier event in New Zealand. Wales went into the match in Paris needing to win by 27 points to finish ahead of England on countback, but the team's preparation was marred by the absence of assistant coach Shaun Edwards due to a reported incident with a fellow member of the backroom staff last weekend. England's only try was a runaway intercept effort from hooker Steve Thompson, which fellow replacement Jonny Wilkinson could not convert. Recalled fly-half Jonathan Sexton kicked 14 points in a man-of-the-match performance, with his four penalties and a try from winger Tommy Bowe giving Ireland a 17-3 halftime lead. Defending champions France finished second following two tries to forward Lionel Nallet and another to winger Vincent Clerc, while Morgan Parra kicked 13 points.
