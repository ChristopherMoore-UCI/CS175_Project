They came from six terror cells in four regions of the country, including Mecca, said Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, a ministry spokesman. Some of the others were trying to travel abroad "to join terrorist groups to conduct terrorist operations." Some of those arrested are "family members who have sent their sons to terrorist organizations abroad," al-Turki said. Saudi Arabia has arrested 88 men who were part of a terrorist network, the Interior Ministry said Tuesday. Most are Saudi citizens, but three are Yemenis, and one person has yet to be identified, al-Turki said.
