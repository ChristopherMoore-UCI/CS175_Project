Dortmund wins the German classic After winning the league title in record time in late March, Bayern Munich lost its lengthy unbeaten streak, lost in the league for the first time this season and, some would say, struggled to eliminate Manchester United in the Champions League quarterfinals. Three days after it was ousted by Atletico Madrid in the Champions League quarterfinals, Barcelona lost 1-0 at lowly Granada in Spain's La Liga to give Madrid's second club a huge boost in the title race. Bayern Munich ended the evening with 10 men after Rafinha was given a straight red for striking Mkhitaryan in the face in added time but worse news for Bayern was keeper Manuel Neuer's calf injury. Henrik Mkhitaryan -- guilty of a miss or two against Real Madrid in the second leg when another Dortmund goal would have forced extra time -- Marco Reus and Jonas Hofmann scored for Dortmund. A combination of inspired goalkeeping by backup Orestis Karnezis and Barcelona misses -- from the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Andres Iniesta -- ensured a night of frustration for Tata Martino's men, who must pick themselves up in time for Wednesday's Copa del Rey final against Real Madrid.
