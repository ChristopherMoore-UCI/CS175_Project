"We believe his resignation is just the first step and will be announcing a series of concrete actions with Brett in coming days and weeks." In his statement Tuesday, Ratner said "it pains me deeply that I may have hurt" his colleagues who "are members of the LGBT community." "Having love in your heart doesn't count for much if what comes out of your mouth is ugly and bigoted," Ratner said. "When we sat down with Brett today, he seemed very sincere in his desire to use this experience as a way to begin speaking out against anti-gay language in popular culture," said Herndon Graddick, senior director of programs and communications at GLAAD. -- Brett Ratner has resigned as a producer of this year's Academy Awards show for an anti-gay remark he made over the weekend, the movie director said Tuesday in an open letter to his colleagues. Ratner met with the representatives of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation prior to announcing his resignation, GLAAD said in a news release Tuesday. When asked during a question-and-answer session about his newly released action comedy, "Tower Heist," whether he rehearses with his actors before shooting a scene, Ratner replied, "Rehearsing is for f*gs," GLAAD said in its release, citing New York Magazine's Vulture blog.
