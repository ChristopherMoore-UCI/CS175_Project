Some of the groups crafting hairpieces include Wigs 4 Kids, Wigs For Kids, Angel Hair for Kids, Angel Hair Foundation, Angel Hair Wig Gallery, Pantene Beautiful Lengths, Locks of Love and Children With Hair Loss. My father had died a few years earlier, but he had instilled in me since my teen years that certain things don't belong on boys, long hair among them. I confessed to knowing about the sideburns, though I hadn't given them much thought as they'd been obscured for months. But this will probably (read, most definitely) be my last foray into writing about hair. I chose Wigs 4 Kids because it focuses on children, had great reviews, spends 80% of its budget on programs and its website features a charming before-and-after photo gallery of wig recipients.
