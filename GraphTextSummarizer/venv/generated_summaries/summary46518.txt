As the 34th America's Cup kicks off in San Francisco next month, all eyes will be on the new fleet of futuristic -- and stripped back -- vessels. Earlier this year, British Olympic gold medalist Andrew "Bart" Simpson was killed when the AC72 he was training on capsized in San Francisco Bay. Along with its shorter hull, the new vessel will also have far fewer members on board -- down from around 17 to 11. But that hasn't stopped the $10 million boat -- dubbed AC72 after its 72-foot hull -- making big waves in the sailing world. At just 22 meters long, the new hi-tech America's Cup yacht is more than three meters shorter than its predecessor.
