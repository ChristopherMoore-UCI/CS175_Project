"I congratulate Sen. Santorum and Gov. Romney on a hard-fought effort during the closest contest in caucus history," Iowa GOP Chairman Matt Strawn said in a written statement. Rick Santorum finished the Iowa Republican caucuses 34 votes ahead of Mitt Romney, but results from several precincts are missing and the full actual results may never be known, according to a final certified tally released Thursday by the Iowa GOP. A top Romney staffer disputed that any concession occurred, while campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul said: "Gov. Romney called Sen. Santorum to congratulate him on the Iowa results." "The results from Iowa caucus night revealed a virtual tie," Romney said. One week after Iowa's January 3 caucuses, Romney won the New Hampshire primary with nearly 40% of primary votes.
