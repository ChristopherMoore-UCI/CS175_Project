Saudi blogger and opinion writer Tamador Alyami, a supporter of the campaign who recently posted a video showing her driving in the city of Jedda, noted that a Twitter account supporting Saudi political prisoners recently "tweeted a message saying you have to take advantage of this day, that it's an opportunity to go out there and demonstrate and ask for the rights of the political prisoners." "As soon as I read the Interior Ministry statement, I was sure the message was meant for them, not for those who will go out to drive," she said, adding that women drivers will not be demonstrating that day. " Saudi blogger detained, but she's hopeful about campaign to allow women to drive Saudi Arabia's government made what may be its first official reaction to a campaign calling on Saudi women to defy the country's de facto driving ban on Saturday, saying the kingdom's "laws will be fully enforced" that day. In late September, an online movement was launched urging Saudi women to get behind the wheel. In addition, numerous Saudi women have already taken to the streets -- filming themselves driving through the streets of various cities, and then uploading those videos to YouTube.
