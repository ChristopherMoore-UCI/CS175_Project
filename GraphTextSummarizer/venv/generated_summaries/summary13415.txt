Transparency International later quit, raising questions over FIFA's commitment to reform because Pieth was being paid by the world governing body. For example, in the section related to the former FIFA Executive Committee member, Mohamed Bin Hammam, it is noted that Oceania Football Confederation's (OFC) intention to support Australia's bid "was publicly reported as early as October 17, 2010." Wrong. It was an extraordinary and unprofessional attack by one or both of the two men who preside over FIFA's Ethics Committee. First, the report is an investigation into FIFA of the world governing body's decisions and processes, conducted by Garcia who is paid by FIFA. Together with Al-Majid I've been invited by British MP Damian Collins to help arrange a FIFA reform conference in Brussels in January, which I hope will produce the reforms that the IOC put into place.
