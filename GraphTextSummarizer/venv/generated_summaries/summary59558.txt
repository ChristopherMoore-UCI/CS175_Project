Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia used to take scuba diving vacations together. Weir says there were times when the band members were worried about Jerry Garcia's drug use and considered holding an intervention for their frontman. Weir says the pair had "a lot of fun underwater," and that Garcia especially loved diving because underwater he was weightless. According to Weir, Garcia was doing heroin, marijuana and cocaine, and he would trust Weir to hold it because not only was the (relatively) health conscious Weir not going to use it, he would also limit how much Garcia could have at once. Weir talks in the film about how he had to be Jerry Garcia's "bag man" for a time, holding Garcia's drugs.
