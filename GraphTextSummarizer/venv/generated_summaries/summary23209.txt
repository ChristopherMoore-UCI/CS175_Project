His hobby began 13 years ago, when the photography professor at Rochester Institute of Technology first began tinkering with how to capture the fleeting beauty of individual flakes before they melted. He catches the snowflakes on a piece of black velvet, runs into his garage and places the delicate flakes on a microscope slide with a dissecting needle before they melt. " Peres shares his photos of snowflakes and other objects on his Instagram account with the hashtag #tinythings. "I have a love-hate relationship with winter," said Peres, who has lived in Rochester, New York, for 30 years. Michael Peres is obsessed with photographing snowflakes with a microscope.
