The purpose of the review is to fully understand the program and to help "shape detention and interrogation policies in the future," Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the committee, and Sen. Kit Bond, the committee's ranking Republican, said in a statement Thursday. Newly appointed CIA Director Leon Panetta says review should not target CIA interrogators. The Senate review will look at how the CIA determined detainees knew valuable information and whether the coercive techniques used against them resulted in gaining information that stopped terrorist attacks. CIA Director Leon Panetta said last week he would cooperate with any congressional reviews. But Panetta said the reviews should not target the CIA interrogators.
