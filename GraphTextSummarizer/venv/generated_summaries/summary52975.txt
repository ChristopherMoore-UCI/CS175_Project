It is not immediately clear from the official's statement how long Ebel was supposed to wear the monitoring device or whether he was wearing it when authorities say he killed Colorado Department of Corrections director Tom Clements. In Texas, Ebel was driving a black Cadillac, a car which matches a description that witnesses in Clements neighborhood said they saw idling near Clements' home the night of his slaying. The corrections chief earned widespread recognition not only for prison reforms but also for a crackdown on prison gangs, including the white supremacist 211 Crew, who once counted Ebel among their ranks. The release of the records came the same day that a Colorado law enforcement official told CNN that Ebel left prison after serving the entirety of his sentence wearing tracking ankle monitor. Investigators have said they are looking into whether Ebel might have conspired with other inmates to kill Clements.
