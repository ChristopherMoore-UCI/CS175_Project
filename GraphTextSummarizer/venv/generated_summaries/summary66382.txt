It seems that all the victims of the multiple tragedies and woes of Africa and the Middle East -- grinding poverty, war and the rise of ISIS -- are washing up on the shores of Italy. They've been fed, clothed, received medical treatment, and will be taken to migrant camp in northern Italy. Others will stay in Italy, trying to eke out a living in the twilight economy as street vendors and beggars. And as they settle in, somehow or other, more and more will come to Italy's shores. Most will then try move further north, to countries like France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, where economic opportunities are better than in austerity-wracked Italy.
