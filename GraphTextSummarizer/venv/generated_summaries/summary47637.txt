The weather two years ago was dire on race day -- the second wettest on record as 1.46 inches of rain fell as I'll Have Another seized the victory -- while last year half an inch of rain fell in the six hours prior to Orb riding to victory. Churchill Downs has suffered multiple days of heavy rain but even when 2.31 inches of rain fell on Derby day in 1918 the race was run with Exterminator winning. However, wet weather is nothing new to Derby day, the National Weather Service pointing out that 46% of all Derby days have had rain at some point. Known as "The Greatest Two Minutes in Sports" for its approximate run time, the Derby is the first race in horse racing's coveted Triple Crown, which also includes the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes. -- It's the race that never stops -- come rain, hail or sleet.
