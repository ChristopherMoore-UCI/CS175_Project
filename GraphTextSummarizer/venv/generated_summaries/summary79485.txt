-- A line of law enforcement vehicles stretched for a mile along a rural Pennsylvania road Tuesday as the hunt for suspected cop-killer Eric Matthew Frein entered its 11th day. For the moment, the reopening of schools and roads Tuesday provided a sense of relief to a community under virtual lock-down since Frein -- a 31-year-old self-styled survivalist and war buff -- allegedly killed a state police officer and shot another officer September 12 during an ambush outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. On Tuesday, two days after authorities discovered an AK-47 rifle, some magazines and a small bag of ammo in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where they believe Frein is hiding, the search moved slightly north, police said. Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers, but not civilians. They are combing about 200 to 250 square miles of wooded area not far from Frein's family home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, about 20 miles from where Frein allegedly shot the police officers.
