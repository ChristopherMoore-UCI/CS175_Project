Elsewhere at the games, Australia won a thrilling women's hockey final, clinching the gold medal after a penalty shoot-out victory against New Zealand. Australia led twice in the match, with New Zealand fighting back on each occasion before Jessica Arrold converted the winning penalty for the Hockeyroos. In shooting, the men's skeet singles title was won by England's Richard Brickell after he beat defending champion Georgios Achilleos from Cyprus in a shoot-off. In the pool, English diver Tom Daley won his second gold medal in two days, adding the 10 meter platform title to the synchronized diving crown he had already claimed in Delhi. "This is the first time we have won the gold in men's doubles, so it's certainly historic," Sharath told the official Commonwealth Games website.
