My father and I appreciate it." Protesters 'die in' At New York's Grand Central Terminal on Tuesday night, protesters re-enacted the chokehold that killed the elder Garner and then laid on the ground and chanted. But unlike Sunday night, when some protesters looted businesses and damaged several police cars in the Oakland and Berkeley areas, there were no reports of major destruction in Northern California on Monday or Tuesday night. In downtown Phoenix on Tuesday night, dozens of protesters shut down traffic and light rail tracks for about an hour, angry over last week's shooting death of an unarmed drug suspect during a scuffle with a police officer. Eric Garner Jr., the son of the man who died after a New York police officer held him in a chokehold, said he was proud of how protesters are carrying on. The protests over police brutality that the recent deaths of unarmed black men may have started in those cities, but the experience is hardly limited to those communities.
