Brown's attorney, Mark Geragos, tried to persuade Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin to release his client from jail so he could fly on his own to Washington. Brown's probation officer reported at a February hearing that the singer "continues to make great improvement" in dealing with anger, stress and drugs, but the judge decided he could not go free until after his trial for an assault charge in Washington on April 17. The U.S. attorney in Washington petitioned for Brown to be extradited from Los Angeles to Washington for his April 17 trial. Brown, 24, was transferred into the custody of federal marshals after an extradition hearing Wednesday in federal court in Los Angeles, according to U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman Laura Vega. At that rate, Brown could complete the labor in mid-October and possibly be free from probation requirements by the end of the year.
