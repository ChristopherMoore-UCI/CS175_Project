Situated on the banks of the Tigris river, one mile south of Saddam Hussein's Republican Palace -- U.S. headquarters in Baghdad since 2003 -- the new embassy opened early Monday afternoon in a closely controlled ceremony that included Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker, and Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte. The new U.S. Embassy covers 104 acres and is the largest in the world, housing 1,200 U.S. diplomats, soldiers, and government staff from 14 federal agencies, according to a U.S. State Department news release. The American flag is raised at Monday's dedication ceremony for the new U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. Three police officers and three civilians were also wounded in the attack, which took place near Shaab stadium in eastern Baghdad at about 1:15 p.m. local time.
