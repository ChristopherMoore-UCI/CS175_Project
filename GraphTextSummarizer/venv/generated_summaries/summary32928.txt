-- Four wildfires were burning in Yellowstone National Park on Tuesday, the 25th anniversary of a devastating day in 1988 when massive wildfires in the park suddenly grew by tens of thousands of acres. The fires now burning in Yellowstone, all of them in Wyoming's corner of the park, are minimal compared with those of 1988, which ended up affecting almost 800,000 acres -- or 36 percent -- of park territory. A much larger fire was burning Tuesday in California in the Stanislaus National Forest, just east of Yosemite National Park. Two other fires in Yellowstone, also caused by lightning, were modest by comparison: The Snake Fire, burning near the park's south entrance along the boundary with Grand Teton National Park, was at 200 acres; and the Druid Fire, near the park's northeast entrance, was at 100 acres. The lighting-caused fire was discovered last Wednesday and grew quickly over the weekend, but it had limited activity Tuesday, according to InciWeb, a federal website that collects information from agencies like the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
