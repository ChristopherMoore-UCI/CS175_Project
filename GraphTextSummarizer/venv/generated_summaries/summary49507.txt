Several airlines, including Continental Airlines, Singapore Airlines and All Nippon Airways, have postponed introducing aircraft recently because of delays in getting seats from Koito, the newspaper said. Koito is Japan's largest supplier of aircraft seats, manufacturing them for 32 carriers worldwide. The seats are mainly aboard Boeing and Airbus planes, The New York Times quoted Koito President Takashi Kakewaga as saying Monday in Tokyo. The Japanese government has ordered repairs to seats aboard planes operating in several countries after accusing the manufacturer of falsifying safety test results. Koito Industries Ltd. falsified fire- and shock-resistance test results in the design and manufacturing of its aircraft seats, the Japanese Transport Ministry said in a news release.
