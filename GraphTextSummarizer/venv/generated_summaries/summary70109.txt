See, I take seriously the importance of fathers -- men -- in the lives of children. It's time for men to man up, so children can grow up with an equal amount of love and affection from both parents. And unless our religious and cultural institutions say enough is enough, we are going to see another generation of children growing up with dad absent and unaccounted for. My wife and I don't have children of our own, but we are raising four of my nieces because they were struggling at home. Roland Martin says fathers across America are failing their children by shirking their responsibilities.
