A tornado of black smoke drove me into the ground and filled my mouth with chewable soot. Museum officials tell me it's one of several survivor artifacts and is displayed alongside a written portion of my story. Within a year, I had co-edited "Covering Catastrophe: Broadcast Journalists Report September 11," donating the proceeds to 9/11-related charities. Journalists are often taught to distance themselves from the people and stories they cover. The National September 11 Memorial and Museum now has the rights to the book to support its programming and exhibitions in perpetuity.
