Across the old shipyard, a wind turbine now provides most of the electricity needed for the town, footpaths and cycle tracks have priority, water is drained through a series of ponds, channels and moss-covered rooftops, and geothermal reservoirs underground provide heat in winter and cool air in summer. In the Swedish city of Malmo, an old shipyard has been converted from industrial wasteland to spotless eco-district, setting a world class example for sustainable living. "We learned a lot from Bo01," says Christer Larsson, Director of city planning in Malmo. But the experts hope to feed these successes into the next generation of projects across Malmo. The experimental principles of this project are now being applied in other cities, like Tangshan in China, as part of an eco-district currently under construction that will span over 30 square kilometers.
