Commonwealth Games President Mike Fennell was to meet Indian Cabinet Secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar in New Delhi late Friday afternoon to discuss the troubled preparations for the games, which take place every four years among members of the former British empire. Such concerns led New Zealand cyclist Greg Henderson to announce his withdrawal from the games on Friday. Security questions also emerged after two visitors from Taiwan were injured by gunmen who fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi on Sunday. "I am certainly pleased to arrive in Delhi with the news that Australia has moved into the village to get ready for the arrival of their athletes and with the confirmation late yesterday that England and Wales will be on their way to Delhi shortly," Fennell said in a news release Friday afternoon. Australia's Olympic Committee leader said Friday that the Commonwealth Games should not have been awarded to India, considering how preparations have gone, but the clock is ticking and it's time to move ahead.
