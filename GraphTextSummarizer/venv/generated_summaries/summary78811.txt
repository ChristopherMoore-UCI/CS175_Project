In 2013, Jindal began expressing concerns about the program after his staff held meetings with Common Core opponents in the state. In 2012, after Jindal and other governors implemented the program, Common Core became a lightning rod issue among grassroots conservative activists who bemoaned it as a "federal takeover of education." When Louisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal recently finished a speech blasting the Common Core education standards, a room full of activists from the conservative American Principles Project jumped from their seats in applause. In the context of the burgeoning presidential race, the opposition has one added bonus: It lets Jindal use Common Core as a proxy to outline a case against former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a consistent Common Core supporter who has also shown interest in running for president. Amid a separate education battle with the Department of Justice over the use of school vouchers in Louisiana, Jindal began to accuse Democrats of standing "in the schoolhouse door to prevent minority kids," comparing them to segregationists who fought against the civil rights movement in the 1960s and blocked black students from attending classes with white students.
