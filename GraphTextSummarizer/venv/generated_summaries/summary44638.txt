Weeks recounted to the court graphic details of how Bulger killed Arthur "Bucky" Barrett, Joey McIntyre and Deborah Hussey. However, Weeks defended his actions, saying he had been shown Bulger's informant file by fellow South Bostonian, or "Southie," and disgraced FBI agent John Connolly and that, "You can't rat on a rat." In the summer of 1983, Weeks said Bulger organized a meeting with Barrett under the guise of having stolen diamonds that he needed to have taken off his hands. When Barrett arrived at the house, Bulger, his crime partner Steve Flemmi and Weeks were waiting. Weeks said Bulger left the house to pick up the cash while he and another associate watched Barrett.
