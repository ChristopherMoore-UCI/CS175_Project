If Republicans succeed in blocking the two, Democrats might carry out a threat to change Senate rules over GOP objections, the so-called "nuclear option," to prevent future filibusters of presidential appointees. Since Millett was chosen a few weeks ago, Republicans have said Democrats and the President are trying to change the balance on the court, which currently has four judges who were appointed by Democratic presidents and four judges who were appointed by Republican presidents.
