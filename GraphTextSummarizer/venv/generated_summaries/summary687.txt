"I saw that building a bridge could change lives and transform communities." Parker has been building bridges ever since, and in 2003 he founded the nonprofit organization Bridging the Gap. " Kakuko is working alongside other local residents and Harmon Parker, a master mason who has been building bridges through Kenya's mountainous terrain since 1997. The organization oversees the building of bridges that not only save lives but connect isolated villagers to resources that can improve their way of life. Parker, a Lexington, Kentucky, native who came to Kenya in 1989, has seen firsthand how flash floods -- and the threat of predators such as crocodiles and hippos -- can make rivers impassable in isolated communities. I build bridges because I want to save lives, lives that I will never know about.
