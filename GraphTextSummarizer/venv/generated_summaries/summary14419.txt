To Kenneth Lieberthal, director of the John L. Thornton China Center and a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, the balance of human rights issues such as the Chen case with other significant issues for both the United States and China marked a maturing of relations between the countries. " "They must seize this golden opportunity to help save Chen and his family and demonstrate to the world that the (United States) stands firm for fundamental human rights and the rule of law," said Smith, the chairman of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. In comments Thursday at the high-level talks with China, Clinton made no mention of Chen while saying the topic of human rights was part of the discussion. Human rights advocacy groups raised doubts about whether Beijing would stick to the promises it reportedly made regarding Chen's ability to live free of persecution in China. President Barack Obama faces a third front of vulnerability on his administration's record of defending human rights with the muddled situation involving activist Chen Guangcheng.
