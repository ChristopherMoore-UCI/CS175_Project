Not cheap by any means, but only Â£6 more expensive than the price fans of English champions Manchester City had to pay when they watched their team take on London-based Arsenal last month at the Emirates Stadium Of the 59,000 Wembley seats on sale to the public for the biggest game in European club football, 20% will be sold at the cheapest "Category 4" price.
