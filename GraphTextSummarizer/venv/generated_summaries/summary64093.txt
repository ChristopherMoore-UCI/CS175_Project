-- One of the key demands from the national wave of demonstrations protesting recent police killings of unarmed black men is that law enforcement agencies expand the practice of equipping officers with dashboard cameras, body cameras and other recording devices, on the theory that visual recordings of controversial encounters will make it easier to discover the truth in situations like the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, or the choking death of Eric Garner in New York. " Washington Post blogger Radley Balko points out that merely having cameras isn't enough: "In addition to making these videos public record, accessible through public records requests, we also need to ensure that police agencies implement rules requiring officers to actually use the cameras, enforce those rules by disciplining officers when they don't and ensure that the officers, the agencies that employ them, and prosecutors all take care to preserve footage, even if the footage reflects poorly on officers. The device can be a physical reminder to crime victims that they are on camera at times when they are most vulnerable and in need of privacy." Since statistics show that fewer than 20% of police calls involve felony crimes and only 1% of calls result in the use of physical force, the vast majority of recordings will capture vulnerable victims rather than document instances of police using force. " An additional problem is that evidence suggests that the presence of cameras doesn't necessarily make police officers more courteous or careful. "In our field research on body cameras, there have been many times when cameras made matters worse for the officer," the professors write.
