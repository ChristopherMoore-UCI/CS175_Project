This must be the final decision on health care reform, right? Those two bills have to be merged before the full Congress can make the big vote on health care reform. It's serious because this committee has been the biggest roadblock to passing health care reform. But the committee's top Republican says he's concerned about the direction that the bill might take health care in America. Next, their bill has to be stitched together with another bill passed by a different Senate committee, and that new health care bill will go to a full vote of the U.S. Senate.
