The Senate has moved quickly, in Washington terms, to confirm a replacement for slain federal Judge John Roll, killed in the mass shooting at a Tucson shopping center in January. Senate Democrats have been pushing for similar action on another pending District Court nominee in Arizona, Rosemary Marquez. The seat was declared a "judicial emergency" because of Roll's death, other bench vacancies, and a rapidly growing caseload fueled by illegal immigration cases. Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, praised the bipartisan cooperation that led to the relatively swift action on Zipps, saying it "sets the benchmark for how judicial nominations should be being treated." As a former federal prosecutor Zipps, 47, had appeared often in Roll's courtroom.
