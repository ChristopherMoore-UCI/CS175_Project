Work is under way to establish political stability in Egypt following the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy, the country's interim foreign minister told the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday. "It has so far succeeded in establishing the principles of justice, freedom and democracy as a basis for governance," said Fahmy, who is part of the temporary government established by Egypt's military following Morsy's ouster. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood supporters have been killed and thousands more have been injured in clashes with the military and its supporters following the ouster of Morsy. After the Morsy ouster, Egypt's military began to crack down on his party, the Muslim Brotherhood. Nabil Fahmy sought to assure the world that the temporary government is following a road map that will see nationwide elections by next spring.
