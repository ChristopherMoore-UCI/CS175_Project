-- Lauryn Hill has been performing her song "Black Rage" in concert for years, but on Wednesday she released a recording of the song in support of the residents of Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the Michael Brown incident. After dumping a bucket of bullets over his head in a YouTube video posted on August 18, the actor spoke out about the slaying of Brown and what has resulted in Ferguson. Rapper and St. Louis native Nelly, joined protesters as they marched, and artist J. Cole, visited and released the song "Be Free" in tribute to Brown. The unrest in Ferguson has even caused a crossover of sorts. Sung to the tune of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "My Favorite Things," the lyrics include "Black rage is founded on/Blatant denial/Squeezed economics/Subsistent survival" and "When the dogs bite/ When the beatings/ When I'm feeling sad/ I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I don't fear so bad."
