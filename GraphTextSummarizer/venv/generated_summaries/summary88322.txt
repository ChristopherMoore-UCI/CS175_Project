"Although the circumstances were unimaginable, Bruce's wife and extended family will be forever thankful that he and his wife were together in his last moments," Clark's wife and family said Friday. Clark -- known by many as Kevin -- was a chief nurse in the Army who amassed many honors in his military career, according to his family. Clark's family said in a statement that they'd hoped for "a miracle" after his wife Susan saw what happened to Clark during their chat on Monday, but "it was not to be." In addition, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo directed that all flags at state government buildings be flown at half-staff Monday in Clark's honor, as he's done with other Empire State troops who have died in combat zones. While no dates have been given, the family said that Clark's funeral will be in Spencerport and a memorial service will be held in Addison, Michigan.
