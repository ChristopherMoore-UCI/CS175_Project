In addition to accusations of ordering the killing of protesters, Mubarak faces corruption charges. -- A former Egyptian interior minister and his aides ordered the killings of anti-government protesters in the days before Hosni Mubarak was overthrown, according to testimony from an Egyptian security official, an attorney told CNN on Thursday. But Thursday, there were only a handful of victims' families and no sign of Mubarak supporters. Esam Shawky, who works in the administrative department in charge of anti-riot security forces, testified Thursday that Habib el-Adly and his aides ordered the killings and gave the order to cut Internet services on January 28 amid the unrest, lawyer Khaled Abou Bakr said. " Earlier this week, clashes erupted outside the courtroom between security forces and families of those killed in this year's uprisings.
