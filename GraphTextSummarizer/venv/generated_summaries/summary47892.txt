With boundless health information available at the click of a TV remote or computer mouse, patients such as Patti and Cliff have come to rely on these media as they would a doctor's visit. Patients who play an active role in their care, which can include searching symptoms online, have better health outcomes, Bergquist said. "There's a lot of useful information that people get from TV," said Dr. Sharon Horesh Bergquist, assistant professor of medicine at Emory University. Dr. Mehmet Oz had spoken about symptoms that precede a heart attack on Oprah's show the day before -- one of which was erectile dysfunction because of slowed blood flow. "I wasn't aware that could be a potential side effect ... and since she's brought it to my attention, I can tell other patients," Bergquist said.
