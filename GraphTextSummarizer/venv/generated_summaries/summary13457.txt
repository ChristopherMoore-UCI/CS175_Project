Shots were fired Tuesday at the McKinney Police Department near Collin College's Central Park Campus in McKinney, Texas, according to campus spokeswoman Lisa Vasquez. The college's emergency alert system notified students and staff immediately about the shooting and the campus was on lockdown for two hours. Vasquez said it does not appear that any students, faculty, or staff were injured in the incident. The incident took place shortly after 9 a.m.  The gunman parked his car at the McKinney Police Department before the shooting took place, Vasquez said. Campus activities have since resumed, Vasquez said.
