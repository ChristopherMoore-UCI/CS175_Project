Whether that means Apple plans to abandon an iPhone-like naming routine (iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S) in favor of occasional upgrades to "the iPad" remains to be seen. Apple rolled out a high-definition iPad on Wednesday with a faster processor, a better camera and a display screen that promises to be dramatically sharper than the current model, the iPad 2. Surprisingly, "the new iPad" was as close to a name as Apple gave the gadget Wednesday. Apple surprised many observers last year when the iPad 2 was priced the same as the original iPad: ranging from $499 to $829, depending on 3G capability and storage capacity. Predictions had bounced back and forth between "iPad 3" and "iPad HD" before the event.
