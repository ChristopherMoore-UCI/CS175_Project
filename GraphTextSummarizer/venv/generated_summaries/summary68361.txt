When to go Yakushima is enjoyable year round, but you'll need snow gear to hike during the winter months, even though temperature at sea level remain relatively mild. That otherworldly backdrop was inspired by the very real forests of Yakushima, an Eden-like island in southern Japan. Witham's book, can direct hikers on a six hour trip on the Yodogawa trail, a varied walk through lush forest, over rushing streams, up to Hana-no-ego, the most southerly high altitude marsh in Japan (look for frogs). Yakushima is the wettest place in Japan, a fact best appreciated at the foot of one if the many waterfalls. The granite bedrock is covered by cedar forests, some primary, others the result of reforestation after Edo-period logging.
