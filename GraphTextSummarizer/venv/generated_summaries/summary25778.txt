Wilkinson's career has been blighted by injuries since 2003, and his failure to regain his form as England's influential playmaker in this year's Six Nations tournament means he will struggle to feature at the next World Cup in New Zealand in 2011. -- Jonny Wilkinson's international rugby career could be coming to a close after the former World Cup hero was dropped by England for Saturday's Six Nations finale against title hopefuls France. Winger Chris Ashton will make his debut in a backline that sees veteran World Cup winner Mike Tindall recalled at center and Ben Foden start at fullback, with Delon Armitage dropped from the squad. Wilkinson went off after a heavy blow to the head against Scotland last weekend, when Flood made a big impression after coming on as a substitute to earn England a 15-15 draw. The 30-year-old will be replaced by Toby Flood in Paris, having been dropped for only the third time in his England career.
