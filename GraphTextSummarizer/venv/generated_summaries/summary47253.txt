"The way sedatives work is by suppressing brain activity, so we get better recordings if we don't use any sedatives," explained Dr. Kelly Foote, also co-director of the Center for Movement Disorders, who performed the surgery. But after years of suffering and unsuccessful therapies, Comfort was selected for experimental surgery by specialists from the University of Florida's Center for Movement Disorders. Experimental surgery In September 2014, Comfort had the DBS electrodes implanted in her brain -- a 12-hour process that involved six operations. From the age of five, Comfort has suffered from Tourette's syndrome, a neurological disorder that causes her to make involuntary movements and loud noises, known as tics.
