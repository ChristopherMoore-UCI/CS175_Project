"We have received hundreds of tips, but we are far from a solution," Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters Thursday. At a dual fundraiser Monday at Dodger Stadium and AT&T Park in San Francisco, where the two teams played, more than $120,000 was raised, said American Medical Response spokesman Jason Sorrick. Other issues being examined include lighting and camera systems, said former Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton, whose risk consulting company Kroll is working with officials. At Dodger Stadium, collection bins will be available for those wishing to donate, officials said Thursday. -- Increased security was put in place at Dodger Stadium ahead of Thursday's baseball game between the Dodgers and the St. Louis Cardinals in the wake of a March 31 attack in which a San Francisco Giants fan was seriously injured.
