National Hurricane Center Director Bill Proenza said he was reprimanded for comments about replacing a key satellite. Proenza caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite called QuikScat. Hurricane center staffers told CNN's John Zarrella they were not consulted before Proenza made the remarks and replacing the satellite would not be one of their priorities. The center's current director, Bill Proenza, took over in January after the retirement of Max Mayfield. But they said their dissatisfaction stems not only from Proenza's comments, but also from the environment at the center -- one of closed doors and the public airing of dirty laundry.
