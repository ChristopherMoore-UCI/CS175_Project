Shamsullah Sahrai, a Sangin resident and a candidate in Saturday's parliamentary election, told CNN that residents in the district are happy that the United States is taking over because "they believe that the United States has more decisiveness in the war than the British." Sahrai said that under British control the security situation worsened, adding that residents are waiting to see whether security improves under U.S. control. The switch of command in Sangin is not a defeat for British troops, but simply works well militarily, said Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute, an independent defense and security think tank in London. -- British forces in southern Afghanistan have handed responsibility for security in the Sangin district of Helmand province to the U.S. Marines, the British and American militaries said Monday. " With the arrival of some 18,000 U.S. Marines in the region by the end of August, it makes sense for the British troops to reorganize themselves and reinforce their numbers in central Helmand, Clarke said. It follows heavy British losses in the area, a Taliban stronghold.
