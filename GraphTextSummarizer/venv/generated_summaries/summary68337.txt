It struck in nearby Cleburne County at 9:05 p.m., said Renee Preslar, spokeswoman for the Department of Emergency Management. -- One person was killed and three others were injured after a series of powerful tornadoes ripped through dozens of homes in central Arkansas on Wednesday night, officials said Thursday. "The storm seems to be shifting to the east, so the severe weather should be out of this area by [Thursday]," said John Lewis, a senior forecaster with an Arkansas office of the National Weather Service. The tornado damaged 22 homes, an Arkansas Emergency Management spokeswoman said. Along with tornadoes, central Arkansas was raked by powerful thunderstorms and golf ball-size hail, the National Weather Service said.
