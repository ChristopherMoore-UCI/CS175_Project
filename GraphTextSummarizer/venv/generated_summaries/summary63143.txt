CNN was not immediately able to confirm the exact casualty count, with medical officials saying a final number would come after they had a chance to comb through the premises looking for bodies. Home Minister Sahara Khatun "oversaw a rescue campaign along with a government delegation in search of bodies of officers, BDR soldiers, their family members and relatives," the agency said. -- The rebellion by paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles troops apparently ended Thursday after they handed over their weapons inside their headquarters in the capital city's Pilkhana district, the national press agency quoted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as saying in a nationwide televised address. Meanwhile, police in about six other towns reported shooting incidents involving Rifles troops, another government official confirmed to CNN. Earlier Thursday, the country's home minister, Sahara Khatun, said mutinous paramilitary troops were close to laying down their arms and many had returned to their barracks.
