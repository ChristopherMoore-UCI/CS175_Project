Jackson sold Neverland ranch, his former home, last year. "We resolved everything with Michael Jackson," Julien's Auctions owner Darren Julien said. The items, including the iconic Neverland gates, the singer's famed white-jeweled glove and a stretch Rolls Royce, were removed by the auction house last year at Jackson's request, the auctioneer told CNN. The public can still "get a glimpse at Neverland and the life and career of Michael Jackson" because the items will remain on exhibit in Beverly Hills, California, until April 25, Julien said. The singer sued the auction company last month, claiming he did not authorize the sale of items that were removed from Neverland after he sold the ranch.
