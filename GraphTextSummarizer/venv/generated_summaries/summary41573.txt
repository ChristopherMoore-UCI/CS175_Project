"His conduct of vandalizing and damaging SCLC property proves that Hutchins will do anything to try to control the SCLC. But the current crisis stems from accusations that former officers diverted SCLC funds into non-SCLC accounts, he said. The doors to the headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference civil rights group have been welded shut and padlocked, an escalation in a power struggle between two factions claiming leadership of the organization, the two sides said Tuesday. "Hutchins has no right to be on SCLC property," Tucker said. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the co-founders of the SCLC, which was formed in 1957 to coordinate protest activities across the Southeast, the group's website says.
