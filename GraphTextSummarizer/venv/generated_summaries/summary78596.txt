Besides Montana, Republicans are also optimistic about capturing seats in two other states that vote red in presidential elections: neighboring South Dakota, where Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson is not running for re-election; and West Virginia, where Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller is retiring. Schweitzer captured nearly two-thirds of the vote in his 2008 re-election as governor of the red state and was seen by many as the best chance for the party to keep the seat of retiring Sen. Max Baucus blue. But sources said that may have just been the tip of the iceberg when it came to opposition research Schweitzer may have faced had he decided to launch a Senate bid. The only other seat Democrats hope to put in play is in Kentucky, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who's running for a sixth-term, is facing a challenge from Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. The two Republican retirements are in states that appear to be safe for the GOP: Sen. Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, although Democrats think an ugly primary in Georgia could lead to a very conservative nominee who would be beatable in the general election.
