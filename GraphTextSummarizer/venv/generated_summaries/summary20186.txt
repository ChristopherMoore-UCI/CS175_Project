"We are all heartbroken and will miss him dearly." Contradicting reports that Hernandez was a behavior detection officer, TSA Administrator John Pistole said he had other duties. Source: Angry, rambling texts "I'm shocked, the guy is a very nice guy," one of Hernandez's neighbors in the north Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch, Habib Bonakdar, told CNN affiliate KCAL-KCBS. Hernandez was shot in the chest and abdomen, and pronounced dead upon his arrival at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, CNN affiliate KABC reported. The suspected gunman, 23-year-old Paul Anthony Ciancia, walked up to checkpoint at Terminal 3 where Hernandez was working, pulled a ".223-caliber MP-15 assault rifle out of his bag and fired multiple rounds at point-blank range," U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. said Saturday. -- A California husband and father became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty in the agency's 12-year history, the lone fatality in a frightful shooting at Los Angeles International Airport.
