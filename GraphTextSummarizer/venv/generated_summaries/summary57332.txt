South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham is getting encouragement from a close colleague and friend, Sen. John McCain, to run for President. As the libertarian wing of the GOP has gained prominence, led by expected 2016 presidential contender Sen. Rand Paul, members of the party's more hawkish old guard have floated presidential runs to offer a contrasting voice in key national security debates. " Graham floated the possibility of a run in an interview with the Weekly Standard last month, telling the magazine he'd be interested in running to guide the conversation on national security. "I know of no one who is better versed and more important on national security policy and defense than Lindsey Graham, and I don't think these challenges to our security are going away.
