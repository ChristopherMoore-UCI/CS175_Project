U.S. and Israeli officials told CNN that Hamas militants in Gaza have received support from Iran in the past in the form of weapons, training and cash. Hamas security sources said the targets included the homes of two commanders of Hamas' military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, in the Jabalya refugee camp just north of Gaza City. "But this is an all-out war against Hamas and its branches." Israel continues to strike Hamas targets in Gaza, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN. The Israeli air force carried out at least 20 airstrikes on Gaza on Monday, Israeli military sources said. Israel allowed more than 50 trucks carrying relief aid into Gaza on Monday -- in addition to 40 on Sunday -- Israeli military sources said.
