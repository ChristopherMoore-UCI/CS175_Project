The effort is part of a larger plan to restructure the mining industry to prevent deadly accidents and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Xinhua reported, citing the National Energy Administration (NEA). Small coal mines, which use outdated technology, will be replaced with larger coal mines, increasing capacity. China has one of the world's deadliest records for miners, with poor safety standards accounting for thousands of deaths each year. China is the largest global producer and consumer of coal, comprising 75 percent of China's total energy consumption. -- China closed 1,355 small coal mines this year, according to Xinhua, the country's state-run press agency.
