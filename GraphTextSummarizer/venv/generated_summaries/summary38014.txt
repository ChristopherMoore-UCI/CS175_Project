Behind the main stage and stripper pole sits the 15-gallon brewing system, where club owner Scott Conrad makes batches of the club's signature suds. He describes Pinup Pale Ale, the club's first and only offering, as very approachable, appealing to Bud drinkers as well as craft beer aficionados. "Those who normally would not go to traditional clubs are starting to come here to try the brew, plus enjoy the entertainment aspect," said K.C., a bartender and server at the club. Pinups and Pints is located, appropriately enough, in a strip mall outside of Dayton, and according to the Dayton City Paper, it's the first strip club microbrewery in America. Kevin J. Gray assessed the beer for his Dayton City Paper story and noted, "Pinup Pale Ale was a solid pale ale, a good start on a new system."
