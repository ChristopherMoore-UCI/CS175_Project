In fact, after the expiration of the ban, The New York Times, whose editorial pages are now awash with calls for more gun restrictions, wrote in early 2005, "Despite dire predictions that America's streets would be awash in military-style guns, the expiration of the decade-long assault weapons ban in September has not set off a sustained surge in the weapons' sales, gun makers and sellers say. According to anti-gun advocates, such an increase in guns would cause a cause a corresponding increase in gun-related violence or crime. Therefore, more guns must lead to more crime. And yet, there is a near impenetrable belief among anti-gun activists that guns are the cause of violence and crime. If we're going to have a national debate about guns, it should be acknowledged that guns, in the hands of qualified and trained individuals subject to background checks, prevent crime and improve public safety.
