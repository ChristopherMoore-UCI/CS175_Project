-- When asked over the years if he can use executive power to stop deporting illegal immigrants, President Barack Obama has responded: When Hong pleaded with Obama to put the brakes on deportations and stop separating families, Obama responded: "Now, what you need to know, when I'm speaking as President of the United States and I come to this community, is that if, in fact, I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. Yet, two years later, while facing re-election and eager to reignite support among Latinos, Obama managed to get something done without Congress' approval. Obama has issued 164 executive orders on such things as climate change and student debt. But, on October 26, 2011, at the University of Colorado-Denver, Obama said this when talking to students about using an executive order to reduce student loan debt.
