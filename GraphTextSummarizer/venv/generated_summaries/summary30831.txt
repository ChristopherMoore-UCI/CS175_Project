"I do not believe that the individuals bent on vandalism and violence in our city have finished with their intent, so we will remain vigilant," Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said Saturday night. The group also made note of other thorny issues in their final statement issued Saturday, singling out Iran and North Korea for criticism. Blair said police used tear gas after warning a group of protesters "engaged in acts of destruction" Saturday. There were no reports of serious injuries to either protesters or police, according to the ISU, which said the safety of summit participants was never compromised. Some of the detained protesters were released Sunday from the prisoner processing center -- an old film studio converted to a makeshift jail amid the protests -- while others were being held for bail, Ontario Provincial Police Constable Rodney Petroski said.
