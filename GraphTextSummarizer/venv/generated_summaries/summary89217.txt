Francesco Schettino abandoned the cruise liner Costa Concordia after it wrecked in 2012 while hundreds were still on board, according to testimony and recorded phone calls played in a court in Grosetto, Italy, on Monday. In phone calls played in court, Schettino said from a life boat that only a dozen people were still on board the ship, when the coast guard had reported hundreds. Gregorio Di Falco of the Livorno Port Authority, the man who repeatedly ordered Schettino to get back on board, told the court he initiated rescue efforts on his own after distressed passengers called police. Schettino faces charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. The cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off Italy's Giglio Island in the Tyrrhenian Sea in January 2012, killing 32 of the 4,200 people on board.
