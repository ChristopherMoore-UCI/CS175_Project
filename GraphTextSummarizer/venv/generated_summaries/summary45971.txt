-- New Orleans police have issued arrest warrants for former NFL star Darren Sharper and another man in connection with the alleged rapes of two women. Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last week. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. Sharper has also been charged in California with two counts of rape by use of drugs and other charges, according to Los Angeles County prosecutors. "Mr. Sharper must stay in Los Angeles County," a judge said at a bail hearing.
