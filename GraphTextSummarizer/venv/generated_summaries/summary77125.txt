" Pakistan's upper house of Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution this week demanding Musharraf be arrested and tried for treason for unconstitutional acts during his regime, Sen. Muhammad Ibrahim Khan said. -- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf has postponed his return from exile until the political situation in Pakistan and the court cases against him are resolved, a senior leader in his party said Friday. A U.N. report in 2010 accused Musharraf's government of failing to protect Bhutto, who had returned to Pakistan from exile to run for office. Musharraf has denied the allegations, arguing that Bhutto had police protection and took unnecessary risks. The charges against Musharraf are in connection with the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
