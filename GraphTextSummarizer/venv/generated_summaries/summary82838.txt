The pair walks east, toward the Boston Marathon finish line, Tamerlan Tsarnaev in front of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, wearing a knapsack on his back. "Virtually" everyone along Boylston turns toward the finish line, "in apparent bewilderment and alarm," but not Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The 19-year-old faces charges of using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death, and of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death. On Monday, as he remained hospitalized for injuries incurred during a massive manhunt and a pair of shootouts last week, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev heard from his hospital bed his Miranda rights being read, and then he heard read the federal charges now filed against him in connection with the Boston Marathon bombings. As told via the criminal complaint: At 2:38 p.m. on Monday, April 15, roughly 11 minutes prior to the first blast, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are caught on camera turning onto Boylston Street, the thoroughfare where the finish line is located.
