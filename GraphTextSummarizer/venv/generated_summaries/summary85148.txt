He added that morning impairment is not limited to products with zolpidem. In making its recommendations, the FDA looked at findings from a large driving simulation study that showed some people taking products containing zolpidem had higher levels of the drug in their system and could not operate a vehicle as well as those who did not take the drugs, or who took lower doses. Patients who use the extended-release forms of these drugs have an even higher risk for next morning impairment, according to the FDA. The FDA said using lower doses of zolpidem will cut down on the amount of the drug found in the bloodstream the following morning. And all patients, the FDA said, should be told about the possible "morning after" risks.
