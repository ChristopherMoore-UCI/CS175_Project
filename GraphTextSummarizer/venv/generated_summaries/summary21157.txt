It's that last combination that has the Huffington Post declaring "It's only a matter of time before jars of Nutella get pushed toward the back of grocery shelves and begin collecting dust." The announcement of Reese's new spreads came on Election Day - fitting given that the vote is still out on whether this creamy concoction will portend the death of Nutella. Daren Russ, brand manager for Food & Beverage Enhancers with The Hershey Company, said in a statement that the spreads "offer an authentic Reese's experience to fans who are looking for delicious snack options throughout the day." "Since 1928, we have been delivering the perfect combination of chocolate and peanut butter," he said. According to its website, Nutella was first imported into the United States more than 25 years ago from Italy. The 13-ounce jar will compliment Hershey's existing spread flavors including chocolate, chocolate with almond and chocolate with hazelnut.
