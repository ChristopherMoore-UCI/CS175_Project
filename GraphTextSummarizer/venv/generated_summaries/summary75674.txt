"I am not a fan of big protests, but I wanted to express that we are not afraid, that this is not going to make us renounce our liberty of expression." Rallies also unfolded Wednesday night in Tours, Toulouse, Brest, Lyon, Rennes and Poitiers, among other cities in France, long regarded as a cradle of democracy and liberty. The most immediate rallying cry against the attack was "Je Suis Charlie," or "I Am Charlie," in reference to the weekly satirical magazine's title, Charlie Hebdo. "The world has become so sick that (being a humorist or cartoonist) has become a dangerous profession!" said a poster carried by one woman in a mass of protesters in Paris' Place de la Republique. They wrote "liberty" and "free expression" on placards in rallies that came hours after a terror attack killed 12 people Wednesday in Paris. As the initial shock wore off, the grand boulevards in most of France's major cities became scenes of mourning and solemn demonstrations, with crowds declaring themselves unbowed by the gunmen's assault on the offices of the magazine Charlie Hebdo.
