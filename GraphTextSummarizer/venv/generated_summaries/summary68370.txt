"You suddenly realize that even though they look like insects, when you really look at them they take on these personalities," said producer Fenton Bailey. "There is a really powerful connection between a human being and a bee because we've tended bees for thousand of years," Bailey said. Nomadic beekeepers truck their bee colonies across the country, following the pollination seasons for almonds, apples, cotton and other crops dependent on their insects. Apiarists -- the professional title for bee scientists -- estimate that one out of every three bites of food you eat is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees. And mites, believed to have been brought in by bees that were imported to replace lost hives, are also a problem, she said.
