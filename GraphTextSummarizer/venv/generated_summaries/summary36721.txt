My mother has always told me that beauty comes from within and what's exciting about being a woman is you can say today I feel like being, today I feel really conservative, today I'm feeling classy, today I am going on a date and I want to just be a showstopper and you know there is this variety of beautiful clothes that can bring out whatever you feel inside Do you consider this more fashion than style and the idea being you're sort of universal, you are for the universal woman -- who is the House of Dereon woman? I started designing things out of necessity because there were budgetary restraints. Beyonce: Yes someone bold, someone who wants to stand out, someone confident, hard working and I think it is more about style than fashion -- it's a lifestyle and we just want to bring out that inner confidence and inner beauty in every woman. and we decided we should mix these great cultures together and make something original and beautiful, and this show celebrates the global nomad, and one day at the rate we're going which is such a beautiful thing, there won't be all these different races we'll all just be mixed up and beautiful and that is so wonderful exciting and refreshing you know we have the mixtures of the African hair wraps and some of the Asian prints and we mix it with different textures sequins and gold jewelery
