Paul didn't mention Bush or any other potential 2016 candidate by name, but the former Florida governor has been a vocal backer of Common Core, a set of national education standards for English and math. Sen. Rand Paul appears to be warning former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and other potential 2016 candidates that support for Common Core would be a losing position in the GOP presidential contest. Bush, who was campaigning for Tillis in North Carolina the week before Paul was there, reiterated his support for Common Core, according to The New York Times. But if states want a share of President Barack Obama's Race to the Top education grants, one of the ways to get it is by adopting Common Core. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has also offered support for Common Core, though he created a panel to review and improve the program's implementation in the Garden State.
