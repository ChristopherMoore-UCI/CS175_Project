-- "We struggled so much in life," says Olga Moran, a wife and mother of three from an impoverished village near Otavalo, Ecuador. Moran says that with the help of American entrepreneur Amanda Judge, she has turned her life around, selling her jewelry in the United States, making her family better off. For Judge, The Andean Collection started as an academic project as she researched ways to help women out of poverty in rural Ecuadorian villages. Judge says all the accessories in the Andean Collection are made with local seeds harvested in the Ecuadorian rainforest and lowlands. " The business has changed Moran's life.
