Those areas are still seeing tar balls and occasional mats of weather oil wash up on the beach regularly, particularly since Hurricane Isaac stirred up fresh oil from the seabed in late 2012. -- The Coast Guard and BP declared the Deepwater Horizon cleanup over in three states Monday but will keep watching dozens of miles of Louisiana shoreline where oil still washes ashore. Murphy said the decision was made when only small amounts of oil were being found by cleanup crews. Only 3% of those holes found enough oil to require cleanup, and that process is "nearly complete," he said. It took three months to cap the well, and federal officials estimate nearly 5 million barrels of oil -- more than 200 million gallons -- poured into the Gulf in that time.
