-- Syrian security forces have committed "gross violations of human rights" since anti-government protests began in March, a United Nations report released Monday said. "The Arabic Syrian military, which we are all proud of, has given martyrs in order to protect the life of civilians," Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem said Monday. Syria's government has consistently blamed armed gangs for the violence and said security forces are protecting the people. According to the report, evidence "documents patterns of summary execution, arbitrary arrest, enforced disappearance, torture, including sexual violence, as well as violations of children's rights. Earlier this month, the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights estimated that government forces had killed at least 3,500 civilians.
