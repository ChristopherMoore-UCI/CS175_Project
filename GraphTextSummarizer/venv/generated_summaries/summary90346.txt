Mount Ontake erupted late Saturday morning, sending a plume of smoke and ash into the sky, the Japan Meteorological Agency reported. Local authorities said there were roughly 150 hikers in the area at the time, according to the agency, which raised the Volcanic Alert Level for Ontake from 1 to 3. The public is advised to not approach the volcano, and police and firefighters have deployed to help hikers near the summit. At least three people have been injured, said a task force in Otaki village, just south of the volcano. About 250 people living near the mountain have decided to remain in their homes, police said.
