New Orleans general manager Dell Demps was on the verge of sealing a trade last week which would have seen Paul head to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the NBA vetoed a three-team deal claiming the Hornets could do better. He has been in the NBA for six years, leading the league in steals on four occasions, and will be paired with Blake Griffin, last year's NBA Rookie of the Year. -- Four-time NBA All-Star Chris Paul has been traded from the New Orleans Hornets to join the Los Angeles Clippers in a deal that sends Eric Gordon, Al-Farouq Aminu and Chris Kaman in the opposite direction. Shooting guard Gordon heads to New Orleans after three years in Los Angeles, while 21-year-old Aminu played his rookie year with the Clippers last season. Last season, Paul played in 80 games averaging 15.9 points, 9.8 assists, 4.1 rebounds and 2.4 steals.
