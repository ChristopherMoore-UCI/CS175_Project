We were at the end of a grueling three days in Alabama interviewing George Wallace, the state's former segregationist governor and nemesis of President Kennedy, for John's maiden interview in his new magazine, George. But one thing John had in more abundance than anyone I knew was grace. What I realized that night, and what has stayed with me these past 15 years since his passing, is this: No one of my generation was born with more privilege or promise than John, yet no one wore it more comfortably. Worse, John himself was sick with a thyroid condition that left him lethargic, cranky and frighteningly thin. I looked over at John, and he at me, and we both realized in that same instant: we'd been played.
