Ivory Coast's Constitutional Council invalidated earlier results from the Independent Electoral Commission that named opposition candidate Ouattara the winner, and Gbagbo was sworn in for a new term on Saturday. The AU, in its statement Thursday, called upon Ivory Coast residents, "at this delicate stage in the history of their country, to exercise utmost restraint and to refrain from any action that could jeopardize peace and the process for a way out of the crisis." It said it "strongly urges Mr. Laurent Gbagbo to respect the results of the election and to facilitate, without delay, the transfer of power to the president-elect." Both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory after the November 28 voting. He enjoys popular support in the rebel-held north, and Gbagbo has accused Ouattara of masterminding the civil war -- an allegation the challenger has denied.
