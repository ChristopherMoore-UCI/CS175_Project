Other Second Life experiments aim to make experimentation itself easier -- especially important for those with little programming knowledge. "The possibilities on Second Life are endless," says Janet Travers, who designs virtual ball gowns she hopes to bring to the real world. Whether Second Life continues as a popular place to hold such experimentation remains to be seen. In just fours years of existence, Second Life has moved far beyond people simulating other lives on the Internet. He notes the ability within Second Life to rapidly construct objects and experiences "without having to build the world from scratch." Indeed, it's relatively easy for residents to build objects that others can use, sit on, walk through, pick up and so on.
