Many people began returning to Louisiana on Tuesday, including to New Orleans, where Mayor Ray Nagin said people who "jumped the gun" by trying to return to the city ahead of the lifting of the evacuation order -- set for midnight -- would be allowed in. Jindal noted that several cities continued to receive heavy rain Wednesday, such as Monroe, where 9.2 inches had fallen since Tuesday night. The governor of hurricane-battered Louisiana said Wednesday that the prospect of some areas of the state being without electricity for weeks, as power company officials have warned, is unacceptable. The president has declared 34 of Louisiana's 64 parishes federal disaster areas, making residents there eligible for federal aid. Both he and President Bush, who visited the state Wednesday to see areas damaged by Hurricane Gustav, called restoring power the state's priority.
