The official Malaysia Airlines website has been hacked by a group claiming to support Islamist terror group, ISIS. On logging into www.malaysiaairlines.com on Monday morning, users were presented with an image of a Malaysia Airlines Airbus and messages that read "404 -- Plane Not Found" and "Hacked by Lizard Squad -- Official Cyber Caliphate." But the hackers, identifying themselves as the Lizard Squad, took to Twitter claiming they had penetrated Malaysia Airlines' email account and posted a screenshot. The Malaysia Airlines homepage later changed to a black background featuring a mocked-up image of a lizard in a top hat complete with monocle. It said its Domain Name System (DNS) had instead been hijacked, with users redirected to the hackers' website.
