Cherry blossom fans commonly seek photo ops of train tracks beneath a canopy of pink flowers, and around Yeojwa stream and promenade, which is lined with blossoming trees and canola flowers. Thanks to its southern location, Jinhae's cherry blossoms peak earlier than most in South Korea. As with most festivals in South Korea, the Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival can be crowded. Springtime is famed as cherry blossom season and greatly anticipated in a number of cities and towns across South Korea. Honoring Admiral Yi Sun-Shin, famous for guiding victories against the Japanese during the Joseon Dynasty, the naval festival marks the only time during the year when Jinhae's Republic of Korea Naval Academy campus and Naval Museum are open to visitors.
