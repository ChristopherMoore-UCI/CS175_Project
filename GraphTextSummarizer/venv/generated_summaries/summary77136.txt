Needing just a draw to be crowned world champions in the final game of the tournament, Brazil lost 2-1 to Uruguay and missed out on a first World Cup triumph -- an event referred to by playwright Nelson Rodrigues as "our Hiroshima". Oscar, the third of Chelsea's Brazilian trio, Paris-Saint Germain's Lucas Moura and playmaker Paulinho of Club World Cup winners Corinthians all struggled to live up to their lofty billing. Next year the FIFA World Cup arrives in the South American country for only the second time, with the nation's near 200 million inhabitants expecting to celebrate a record sixth triumph in the tournament. Luis Felipe Scolari, the coach of Brazil's 2002 World Cup winners, has been drafted in to replace Mano Manezes. So much so that with Brazil falling to an all-time low of 18th in the world rankings, a couple of old stagers are back to try and breathe new life into a nation that in many ways represents the very essence of international football.
