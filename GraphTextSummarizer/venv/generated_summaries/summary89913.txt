-- Novak Djokovic sat out the doubles and saw his Serbian team fall 2-1 behind in the Davis Cup final Saturday as the Czech pair of Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek outplayed Ilija Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic in Belgrade. Serbia captain Bogdan Obradovic kept faith with Bozoljac and Zimonjic, who became the oldest man to play in a Davis Cup final at the age of 37, resisting the temptation to field ATP World Tour Finals winner Djokovic. If Djokovic does level the scores at 2-2, Stepanek will face a deciding singles match against inexperienced World They eventually took it 7-4 to leave their fans celebrating wildly in the Belgrade Arena, with Berdych, who plays Djokovic in the first reverse singles Sunday, saying all the pressure was on the World No.2 with his team trailing. It's a huge challenge to play Novak on his own court," he told the official Davis Cup website.
