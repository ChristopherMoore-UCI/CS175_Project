Other robotic arms have relied on direct signals, whereas the MPL picks up a chorus of muscle motions -- creating a more fluid movement. " Symphony of movement The ambitious bionic limb, seven years in the making, is incredibly lifelike in its movements, thanks to a complex symphony of muscle triggers. "That array of muscle contraction is more like a chord in music, so you are able to get more complexity of motion -- like you would get more complexity of sound." Matheney underwent targeted muscle reinnervation -- surgery that involves rewiring electrical signals in the stump. "You're extending the arm, talking and doing other things -- it just automatically does it." Nerve Center For former baker Matheney, the first step in the ground-breaking project was bringing to life the dead nerves at the end of his residual arm.
