" He also warned that a Pakistani military operation could be worse than Taliban rule in Buner and other regions. -- Pakistani fighter jets pounded Taliban targets in the country's northwestern region Tuesday, part of a wider military crackdown on militants inside its borders. He said that local residents have told Amnesty in recent months that Pakistani military operations have "destroyed houses, destroyed markets, without in any way impacting the Taliban." "And that's what really frightens people," he said. "What people are telling us over and over again from Buner, from Swat, and other areas, is that they're very intimidated, very scared about life under the Taliban," Zarifi said. About 300 militants entered Buner a few days ago in violation of the Taliban's recent agreement to leave the district, he said.
