The Wall Street Journal, which is mentioned in the "Mad Men" season opener, created an iconic "hedcut" of the show's lead character, Don Draper. In other words, the WSJ made a real hedcut of a fake person on a TV show, just as "Mad Men Yourself" encouraged real people to make fake versions of themselves. Since "Mad Men Yourself" launched a year ago, thousands of people adorned their Facebook profiles with the retro caricatures. Probably not for long, as people may get sick of looking the same as all their Facebook friends. Lanham is not basing the portraits on photos but on videos -- although he will snap a screen shot of you for reference if he needs it.
