Seth MacFarlane was referred to with all these adjectives and more after his gig as host of the 85th Academy Awards on Sunday night. Salon pulled some of MacFarlane critiques from the microblogging site, including comic Michael Ian Black's take: "Well, WE thought you were great!" " Talk Back: Did Seth MacFarlane hit or miss at the Oscars? "I'll limit my discussion of 'We Saw Your Boobs' to noting how, um, nakedly it put into relief a recurring theme in last night's ceremony: A defensive anxiety about the ascendant power of women (emblematized, later on, by the pairing of the statuesque [Charlize] Theron with the wee Dustin Hoffman as awards presenters)," wrote Slate's Dana Stevens. But Tim Goodman from The Hollywood Reporter praised the Academy's choice and pointed out that it clearly knew MacFarlane would be a "polarizing choice."
