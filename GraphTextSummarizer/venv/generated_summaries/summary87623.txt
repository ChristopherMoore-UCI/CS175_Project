The steps to avoid the disease, taken after the first cases of mad cow disease appeared in the United Kingdom, include isolating infected animals and prohibiting cattle feed of animal origin or with animal proteins, the ministry said. The victim was a woman who was hospitalized last fall, according to Juan Jose Badiola, director of Spain's national research center for mad cow disease. Badiola said it was the mother and son likely contracted the disease before stricter controls against mad cow disease began in Spain in 2001. -- A Spaniard has died from the human form of mad cow disease, the fifth such death in Spain since 2005, the Ministry of Health said in a statement late Friday. The first confirmed death from mad cow disease in Spain was in 2005, when a young woman died near Madrid.
