-- Two rockets from Gaza slammed into southern Israel on Thursday morning, as U.S. President Barack Obama prepared to leave Jerusalem for Ramallah for meetings with top Palestinian Authority officials. In the ensuing years, militants in Gaza have regularly launched rocket attacks into southern Israel. As Israel targeted Hamas military commanders and weaponry, Palestinian militants continued to fire rockets into Israel, battering the southern region and reaching Israel's two major cities -- Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Israel seized Gaza during the 1967 war, and withdrew settlers from there in 2005. On Thursday, he is expected to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.
