Pet owners told Arpaio that the Hughes misled them about the number of dogs kept at the kennel. The couple was out of town, leaving Austin Flake to dogsit, when a dog apparently chewed through the electric wiring connected to the air conditioning, said Sheriff Joe Arpaio. " Sheriff: Story "seems unreasonable" Sheriff Arpaio said that his office is investigating and that parts of Hughes' story seems suspicious. Austin Flake and his wife slept at the east end of the house, while the temperature climbed to seething heights in the kennel on the west end, Maleisa Hughes said. "It seems unreasonable that dogs could be healthy at 11 p.m. at night and dead by 5:30 a.m. the next morning as the owners suggest," he said.
