What will Pope Benedict be known as once he has stepped down as pope? Benedict was elected pope in 2005 after the death of Pope John Paul II. Lombardi said as far has he knew, the day was "just an ordinary day" without particular significance but that Pope Benedict might have chosen it to ensure a new pope was in place for Easter. According to the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, Pope Benedict will return to being known as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. In 1294, Pope Celestine V resigned after only five months, preferring the simple life of a monk to the majesty of being pope.
