Such stories perpetuate the idea that it's better to be dead than to be disabled, that life with disability is life without meaning, and that tired, stressed, caregivers have no hope. Stories about lack of support services position children with disabilities as burdens to their families. In fact, this kind of killing is typically driven not by a lack of services, but by a warped understanding of disability itself. The common thread is not lack of services, but the parents' own views on disability. For Autism Speaks, a group that has been criticized for having no people with autism on its board, autism is the enemy that must be eradicated.
