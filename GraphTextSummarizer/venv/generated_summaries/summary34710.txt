Reporter who knows Vickers calls him 'an utmost professional' John Vickers describes his brother as "an exemplary individual who, throughout ... his career, put his country and his community first." "I understood that the suspect and Mr. Vickers were behind pillars and exchanging fire," Paulson said. "The suspect repositioned himself to get a better shot at Mr. Vickers ... We heard (a) multitude of shots, and that Mr. Vickers did shoot." The only time he spoke, and the only hint of a smile, came when Prime Minister Stephen Harper walked back to the sergeant-at-arms seat in the back of the hall -- at which point the two shook hands and Vickers whispered a few words in Harper's ear.
