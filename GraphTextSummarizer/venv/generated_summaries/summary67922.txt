The crash has raised fresh questions about driver safety in F1. Former F1 world champion Jacques Villeneuve believes it's time to reevaluate the protocol regarding the deployment of the safety car. Sunday's grand prix, which was won by Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton, was contested in treacherous conditions as heavy rain from Typhoon Phanfone swept across circuit. Some have criticizing the FIA's (motorsport's governing body) race control for not deploying the safety car earlier after track conditions deteriorated. The Ferrari F1 team also tweeted messages of support -- Bianchi is part of the Italian racing marque's driver academy.
