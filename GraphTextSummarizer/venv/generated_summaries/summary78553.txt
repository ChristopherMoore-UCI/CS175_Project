United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said that the incident could be worse than an incident last week in which 400 refugees and migrants died in the Mediterranean. As a boat packed with hundreds of migrants capsized in Mediterranean waters, many were trapped inside behind locked doors. Many of the migrants who board ships to cross the Mediterranean are from sub-Saharan Africa, and travel for weeks just to get to the ships. "Faced with thousands of desperate people fleeing wars and crises, Europe has closed borders, forcing people in search of protection to risk their lives and die at sea," he said. "The desperation subsists -- there are almost a million people waiting to board boats and come to Europe to seek a better life.
