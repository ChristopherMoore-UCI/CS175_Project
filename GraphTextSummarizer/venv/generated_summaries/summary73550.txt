Mitt Romney is to presidential campaigns as the Delta House grade point average was to Faber College -- the worst in history. You can shoot five Bin Ladens, you can save 10,000 banks and 20 car companies, even pass the most sweeping legislation in modern American history; if people don't think that you are connected to their lives and are fighting for their interests they will vote your tush out of office in a nano-second. You think that Democrats around the country are going to win -- as I hear time and time again from people on the street. Did it happen in small elections in Germany or Britain, big elections in France and Greece or how about huge elections in the United States in 2008 and 2010? For historical reference see Winston Churchill election of 1945 and President George H.W. Bush in 1992.
