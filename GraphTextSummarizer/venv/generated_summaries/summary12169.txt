The Japanese transport ministry said All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines, the world's two largest Dreamliner operators, have already begun installing modified lithium ion batteries on their 787 jets. The move follows the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration's online posting Thursday of a directive outlining the modifications necessary for the Dreamliner to fly again after faulty battery systems grounded the aircraft earlier this year. -- Japan has authorized passenger airlines to resume flights of Boeing 787 Dreamliners in the country starting Friday, authorities said. Nearly 50 Dreamliners around the world have been grounded for more than three months, after two incidents on jets operated by the Japanese airlines called the battery systems into question. But it remains unclear precisely when the two airlines will resume scheduled passenger flights of the Boeing planes.
