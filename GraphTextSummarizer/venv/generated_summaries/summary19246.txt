The pride and joy of many residents is owning some land -- even a small parcel -- where they can grow a variety of things including cucumbers, squash, tomatoes and herbs. Although Kalamata does very well with tourism -- and the new national highway will help -- high unemployment and a small but increasing number of immigrants from North African countries, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have put strains on social services, the mayor said. But for most people, the lure of Kalamata is the beaches, with their blue waters and free sun beds. Kalamata has a historical center with beautiful neoclassical houses. Kalamata, the 10th largest city in Greece and the capital of Messinia, is built on the foot of the Tavgetos and near Messinia Bay.
