The father of slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin gave Florida A&M football players an inspiring speech and a great lesson on the virtues of perseverance, said the team's head coach, Earl Holmes. The message he shared with the kids was very positive and they were very responsive." Trayvon Martin was shot and killed in Sanford, Florida, in February 2012 by George Zimmerman. Since the verdict, Tracy Martin has been traveling and speaking on behalf of the Trayvon Martin Foundation, which provides support and advocacy for families of crime victims and seeks to "educate youth on conflict resolution techniques. So Holmes gave Tracy Martin something in return: a captaincy. " "I think what he's doing with the foundation is big and it speaks volumes, and I want the football team and FAMU nation to be part of that," Holmes said.
