David Bowie drops new single, announces first album in ten years A few tracks lack clear antecedents (see: the Jack White-aping "You Will Set the World on Fire"), and some simply lack cohesion, or at least enough melody to anchor them. Following turn-of-the-last-century releases Heathen and Reality (which found him reuniting with classic-era producer Tony Visconti), he suddenly disappeared, cutting short a tour, ignoring music, and making only occasional appearances amidst rumors of failing health so persistent that the Flaming Lips recorded a song called "Is David Bowie Dying?" "The Next Day," his 26th album, finds Bowie very much alive and vacillating between forward-looking restlessness and outright nostalgia. In the meantime, pop stars like Lady Gaga and Beyonc√© got rich crafting their own evil twins and countless bands co-opted Bowie's fashionable bohemian androgyny. But Day is also an excellent reminder that Ziggy Stardust, the Thin White Duke, and the lunatic who sang Christmas songs with Bing Crosby have all been coexisting in the same brain for decades.
