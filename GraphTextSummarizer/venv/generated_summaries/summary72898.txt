Lisa Turkki, 39, of East Syracuse, is being held in Westchester County jail on two counts of assault in the first degree, Lt. Jeffrey Dickan of the Bedford Police Department, told CNN Monday. -- A woman babysitting her two young nieces Saturday night was arrested after police say she stabbed the girls multiple times in their Katonah, New York, home across the street from property owned by Martha Stewart. Upon entering the home, the two girls -- identified as 7-year-old Maeve Kelly and 9-year-old Annabel Kelly -- were found on the kitchen floor with "multiple" stab wounds, Dickan said. The girls' parents, identified as Joseph and Eva Kelly, were attending a concert at a local performing arts center when the incident occurred, Dickan said. The girls were conscious and talking to authorities before they were rushed to Westchester County Medical Center, Dickan said.
