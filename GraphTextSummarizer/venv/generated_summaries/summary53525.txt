Labour leader Gordon Brown on Tuesday announced his resignation as prime minister and said he was recommending his Conservative rival David Cameron as successor. As a head of state, Queen Elizabeth has numerous traditional roles when it comes to elections and government. The 2006 film "The Queen" offered insight into this when Helen Mirren, playing the monarch, invites a nervous and kneeling Tony Blair to become prime minister after his 1997 landslide victory. Typically, although it is her role to anoint prime ministers, the queen does not get involved in the political process, remaining above the fray. But, in the unlikely event that no decision can be reached among the parties over who should become prime minister the queen does have powers to intervene.
