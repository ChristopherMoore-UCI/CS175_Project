-- Serena Williams defeated Caroline Wozniacki for the second time in just over a week to move into the final of the Cincinnati Masters Saturday. Williams will now meet the winner of Saturday's second semifinal between fifth-seed Maria Sharapova and ninth-seed Ana Ivanovic. The Spaniard will now face the winner of Saturday's second semifinal between Roger Federer and Milos Raonic. In the first men's semifinal Saturday, David Ferrer comfortably overcame Julian Benetteua in straight sets 6-3 6-2. She does both really well." For her part, Wozniacki was frustrated to lose but encouraged by how far she pushed Williams given her less than stellar record in matchups between the pair.
