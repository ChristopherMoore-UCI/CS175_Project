"The primary purpose of clubs is beneficial to the cadet experience and beneficial to the West Point goal of graduating cadets," said Col. Charles A. Stafford, West Point chief of staff. These clubs are school-sanctioned, and their numbers are growing, according to cadets and school officials. "All these events have an ulterior motive: to show that gay people are people," Kabay said. Even at the United States Military Academy at West Point, cadets are forming their own Spectrum student group. The dinner will celebrate the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" and the formation of Spectrum at West Point, and it will include cadets, alumni and others, according to Fulton.
