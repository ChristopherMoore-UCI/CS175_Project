A Supermoon, sometimes called a Super Full Moon, is 14% larger and 30% brighter than most full moons, NASA says. This happens when the moon is full and at the same time reaches its perigee -- the closest point to Earth in its orbit, according to NASA. Two weeks later, the moon will swing out to the farthest point in its orbit around Earth, when it will be 252,581 miles away, NASA says. There is nothing to fear from the moon being so close and bright, NASA says. The heavens will deliver a rare treat to moonstruck romantics and werewolves Sunday who rise before the sun.
