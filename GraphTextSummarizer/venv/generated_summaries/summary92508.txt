One of the Twitter users who spotted the mistake is Rebecca Skloot, the author of "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks." Northup's memoir, "12 Years a Slave," was turned into a movie that won the best picture Oscar at this year's Academy Awards on Sunday. The Times explained that the article in question told the story of Solomon Northup, a free African-American man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery. As the Oscars focused attention on "12 Years a Slave," a Twitter user unearthed the old article from The Times archives, and it spread quickly on social media. "The errors came to light on Monday after a Twitter user pointed out the article in The Times archives," the correction said.
