Specifically, Paul references research that questions the data on the importance of father involvement because it compares mother-father families to single mother families. The answer to the second question is what makes social scientists so concerned about the benefits of father involvement and the costs of father absence. Instead, Paul reaches her conclusion that fathers are not necessary by pointing to some researchers who think there are limitations in the available social science research on families. Even though research shows that mother-father families produce better outcomes for children, Paul writes that it's unclear whether its the father himself who makes a unique difference, and not just the additional financial and emotional resources a second parent can bring. -- The Atlantic Magazine just published an article entitled, "Are Fathers Necessary?"
