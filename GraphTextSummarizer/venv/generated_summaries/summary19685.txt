So while we shouldn't expect a platform like Meetup to make any presidential candidate a viable challenger the way it did in 2003 and early 2004 with Dean, it (along with other online platforms and social networks) is helping do something even bigger: It is enabling Americans to create quasi-third parties that are bringing new voices and new issues into the national debate. It wasn't until Dean and his campaign manager, Joe Trippi, went to a New York City Dean Meetup in early 2003 -- and were stunned to find hundreds of people lining the street -- did they understand the power of the platform. As Meetup founder Heiferman describes in this talk I filmed of him, given Monday to an audience of foundation and nonprofit types in New York, the tea party was, in some ways, born on Meetup. In fact, Meetup was so little known that at first, Dean staffers themselves had no idea that people were using it on his behalf. Politically inclined grass-roots activism on both the right and left is alive and well on Meetup in the thriving number of tea party and Occupy Wall Street groups using the site.
