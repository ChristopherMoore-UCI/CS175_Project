Azarenka shrugs off injury to reach Qatar final It was her 11th career title and cements Azarenka's place as the dominant force in women's tennis in 2012. -- Victoria Azarenka surrendered just three games to Samantha Stosur as she claimed her third title of an impressive year at the Qatar Open. Though the Australian retained two service games, another break sealed the third title of Azarenka's year. " Azarenka rarely looked in any danger against Stosur, the reigning U.S. Open champion, breaking her opponent three times in the opening set. Last year in Doha, she lost in the opening round to Daniela Hantuchova -- a defeat that caused her to contemplate quitting the sport.
