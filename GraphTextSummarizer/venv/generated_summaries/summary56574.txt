In a city which has finally regained its status as one of eastern Europe's leading cultural capitals after the devastation of World War II and decades largely isolated from the West behind the Iron Curtain, Kaye said the orchestra's message of peace through music was especially resonant. WOP Director Charles Kaye told CNN that it was the unique diversity and internationalism of the musicians which made the group so special. " But with barely 72 hours to rehearse -- Kaye received the first copy of Pendereki's score only on Thursday -- the director said it was Gergiev's abilities to bring the best out of the musicians which brought the orchestra to life. "In our business Maestro Gergiev is acknowledged as one of the great orchestra trainers," said Kaye. " Following Tuesday's performance -- which features the premiere of a specially commissioned piece by Polish composer and Krakow native Krzysztof Penderecki entitled "Prelude to Peace," as well as Gustav Mahler's perennially popular Fifth Symphony -- the orchestra flies to Stockholm to play a festival marking 200 years of peace between Sweden and Finland.
