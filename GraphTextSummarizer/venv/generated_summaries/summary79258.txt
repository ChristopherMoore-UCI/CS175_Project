Elena Russo, spokeswoman for the Maryland State Police, told CNN affiliate WJZ that Walker's wife and three children were in his vehicle at the time of the shooting. One of the drivers, Joseph Harvey Jr., and a passenger then exited their vehicle and walked toward Walker's, according to a news release from Maryland State Police. Joseph Walker, a sworn officer of the Hudson County prosecutor's office, is accused of fatally shooting a motorist Saturday during an altercation off of Maryland's Route 3. Hudson County prosecutor's office spokesman Gene Rubino says his office is aware of the fatal shooting involving one of its detectives, who was off-duty and traveling in Maryland with his wife and children. He is being held on a $1 million bond, Maryland State Police said.
