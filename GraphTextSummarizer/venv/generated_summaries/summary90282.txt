What the terror raids say about an 'Obama Doctrine' Al Libi Interrogation On Monday, al Libi was on a U.S. Navy warship, where he was being questioned by a high-value detainee interrogation group -- an FBI-led team with intelligence experts from the CIA and other agencies -- which is determining whether he has information about al Qaeda operations, future attacks or the whereabouts of known associates, U.S. officials have said. Libya's justice minister held a "cordial" meeting with U.S. Ambassador Deborah Jones on the capture of alleged al Qaeda operative Abu Anas al Libi by American forces over the weekend in Tripoli, two senior State Department officials said Tuesday. Libya's General National Congress on Tuesday demanded that U.S. officials hand over al Libi, spokesman Omar Hmidan said. He was indicted in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia. Wife: al Libi no longer with al Qaeda Civilian trial President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try individuals such as al Libi in American courts.
