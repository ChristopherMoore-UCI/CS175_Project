"As a member of the one of the most influential rock and roll groups, The Band, Levon Helm produced music that was as much timeless as it was timely," it said. That song was credited to The Band's primary songwriter, Robbie Robertson, who has said he was inspired by tales of the South from Helm and others. After the Band's split, Helm recorded a handful of solo albums and toured with his old bandmates, minus Robertson. Levon Helm was born Mark Lavon Helm in Elaine, Arkansas, on May 26, 1940, the son of a cotton farmer. -- Levon Helm, the drummer, multi-instrumentalist and singer for The Band who kept the band's heart for more than three decades, died "peacefully" Thursday afternoon, according to his record label, Vanguard Records.
