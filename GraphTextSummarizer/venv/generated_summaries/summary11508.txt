" Mack will always have some problems, but dad Wally Mack said that Grafman's diagnosis and treatment answered a lot of questions and gave him hope. The only answer, Grafman said, was that Mack's brain has rewired itself. "Dr. Grafman explained that the right hemisphere is taking over, and it might take her a little while longer to get there with all the rewiring that has to take place," he said. While it was clear Mack has some problems, Grafman said he and the family were shocked by the extent of the damage. In the 10 years since Grafman first diagnosed Mack, she has seen some intellectual functions improve, the doctor said.
