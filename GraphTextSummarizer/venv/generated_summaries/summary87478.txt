A South Korean navy destroyer and Lynx helicopters fired warning shots as elite forces, in pre-dawn darkness, silently approached the deck of the freighter Samho Jewelry, hijacked by Somali pirates Saturday, according to the Yonhap news agency. "This mission shows that the South Korean government will not negotiate with pirates,"  Lee said. When the pirates seemed exhausted and after intelligence that suggested a pirate "mother ship" was leaving a Somali port, the South Koreans decided to attempt the rescue, Yonhap said. Somali pirates have seized seven other South Korean ships. -- It was code-named "Dawn of Gulf of Aden," and when South Korea gave it a green light Friday, its daring execution led to five hours of chilling drama on the high seas.
