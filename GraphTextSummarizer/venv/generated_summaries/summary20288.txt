The movie credits Randazzo, a New Jersey native, with proving that East Coast surfers are worthy contenders. Early in his career at contests around the world, he would often be asked, "Are there waves in Jersey?" As filmmaker Alex DePhillipo shows in his newly released surfing documentary "Dark Fall", not only is the surf good in New Jersey, but there are a lot of good surfers in the state. For years, professional surfer and cancer survivor Dean Randazzo has been among those in the frigid waters, wearing a full wet suit, hoodie, gloves and booties. Gesler -- the narrator of "Dark Fall" and a professional surfer -- concurs, "Randazzo is our big brother, coming from New Jersey you don't have a lot of people that have made the impression that Dean has." Currently residing in California, Randazzo frequently returns to New Jersey.
