Lourdes deJesus Correa, mother of the victim, Rolando Correa, told CNN affiliate WLS Tuesday. Gary police say that they have no jurisdiction in Illinois, and that prevented them from having someone guarding Cherry. Just before midnight on December 1, Cherry and two other men allegedly forced their way into a home where Rolando Correa was staying. At some point during the home invasion, shots were fired and Cherry allegedly shot and killed Rolando Correa, Gary Police spokeswoman Cpl. Cherry was also wounded and transported to a local hospital, and then airlifted across state lines to a hospital in Illinois, she said.
