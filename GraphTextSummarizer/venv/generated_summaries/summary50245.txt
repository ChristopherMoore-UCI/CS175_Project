"I think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished, Mr. Hernandez believed he had killed Etan Patz. In the early 1980s, Etan's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country, and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children. The little boy's disappearance, more than three decades ago, sparked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children. Another man's name has also hung over the Patz case for years -- Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. "It awakened America," said Ernie Allen, president and chief executive officer of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.
