For more than 25 years, "Car Talk" has been one of NPR's most popular shows, a laid-back free-for-all that's only occasionally about cars. NPR has been airing archival material since the Magliozzis stopped making original shows two years ago. "His laugh is the working definition of infectious laughter," Doug Berman, the longtime producer of "Car Talk," told NPR. Tom Magliozzi, half of the "Click and Clack" team of brothers who hosted NPR's "Car Talk" radio show, died Monday. "Car Talk" debuted in 1977 on Boston radio station WBUR.
