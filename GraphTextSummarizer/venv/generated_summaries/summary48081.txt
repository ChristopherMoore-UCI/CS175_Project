Nazis then began deporting Jews to concentration camps -- sometimes with the help of Jewish collaborators in the ghetto -- Edelman wrote. He went on to fight in the Warsaw Polish Uprising, a two-month battle against the Nazis in 1944, undertaken primarily by non-Jewish Poles. Edelman was one of the leaders of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, "the largest, symbolically most important Jewish uprising" against the Nazis during World War II, according to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.

He was buried in Warsaw's Jewish cemetery on Friday, the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported
