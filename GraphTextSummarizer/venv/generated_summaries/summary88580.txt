But Republicans aren't necessarily opposed to altering how investment income is taxed: last year's proposal from the top Republican on the House tax writing committee, Rep. Dave Camp, called for applying ordinary income tax rates on 60% of capital gains and excluding the other 40% altogether. The arguments against raising tax rates on investment income are well established: opponents argue it poses a "double tax" scenario, since the corporate profits that drive stock prices are already subject to taxes. In his upcoming State of the Union speech, President Barack Obama will call on Congress to simplify a tax code he deems overly complicated and weighted toward wealthy Americans, administration officials said Saturday. Obama wants to wring more taxes from investment income -- capital gains and dividends -- which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary earnings. Looking to increase capital gains rate To pay for the changes, the administration is proposing about $320 billion in new revenue over the next decade.
