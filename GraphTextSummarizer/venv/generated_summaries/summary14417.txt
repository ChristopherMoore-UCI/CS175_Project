It comes a day after ExxonMobil signed a deal with Russian oil company Rosneft that includes Arctic exploration, a blow to BP. The raid is related to a long-running battle between BP and Russian partner, TNK-BP, over oil exploration in the Russian Arctic. -- Russian law enforcement officers raided the Russian offices of oil giant BP, the company said Wednesday, blasting what it called "illegal" interference in its work. It was ordered by a Russian court in the city of Tyumen, BP said. "If the Tyumen Court decision is allowed to stand, it means any party can raid a company's premises at will and examine all its documents," BP said.
