We have seen it with shows such as "Charlies Angel's," "The Bionic Woman," "Love Boat," "Knight Rider," "Get Smart" and "Melrose Place." Get ready for new versions of "Remington Steele," "Charmed," "Boy Meets World" (which will be updated to "Girl Meets World"), "Love, American Style," "Lifestyles of the Rich and the Famous." " "Honing the 'spirit' of a beloved show is difficult; recapturing it is even more so," writes Brie Hiramine of Flavorwire. This season's "Ironside" was declared "worst new drama" by reviewer Brian Tallerico. But don't think that will stem the tide of reboots yet to come.
