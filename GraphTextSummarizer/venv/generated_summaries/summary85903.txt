A substance described as "white stuff" and "milky rain" is covering parts of Washington and Oregon states, but  its origin is a mystery. "While the substance is likely ash is from Volcano Shiveluch, they are a number of volcanoes that are currently active," they say. The ash is more than likely from the Volcano Shiveluch,"  Washington state's Walla Walla County Emergency officials said in statement. The distances between the volcanoes and the Washington/Oregon areas are staggering -- the Russian volcano is 4,000 miles away and the volcano in Mexico is more than 2,000 miles away. But if we go farther west towards eastern Russia, there's another active volcano there," says CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam.
