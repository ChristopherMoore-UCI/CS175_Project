For Wallrath, giving wounded veterans a place to call home is his way of saying thanks. He decided the best way he could help wounded veterans was by doing what he knew best: building them homes. Wounded veterans or their spouses often have to find a new career or go back to school, making it hard to make ends meet, Wallrath said. Wallrath went to advise Schulz on remodeling his house as a favor to a friend. When the work on Schulz's home was complete, Wallrath realized he was just getting started.
