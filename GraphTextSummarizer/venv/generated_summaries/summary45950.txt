Messages is the most frequently used app in iOS, and is how most users share texts, photos and videos with each other. -- It didn't get a ton of attention Monday, but Apple's next mobile operating system means significant changes for how iPhone users send and receive messages. This feature seems convenient but potentially glitchy if users send accidental messages just by speaking near their phone. With iOS 8, users can listen and respond to audio messages without leaving the lock screen -- just by holding the phone to their ear. Audio and video messages within iOS 8 will automatically vanish within a few minutes (Apple didn't say how many) unless you adjust your settings.
