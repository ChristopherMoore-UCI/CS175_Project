Rose, who is looking to claim a sixth European Tour title, is two shots clear of Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen and Jamie Donaldson of Wales -- both men posting rounds of 69 on Saturday. A seven-under par round of 65 helped Australia's Andrew Dodt jump 28 places up the leaderboard into a tie for eighth place on seven-under with Portugal's Ricardo Santos (66) and How player power tipped Ryder Cup captaincy Thailand's Thongchai Jaidee fired a six-under par round of 66 to leave him in fourth on nine-under par with England's David Howell (68), Scotland's Richie Ramsay (67) and Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano of Spain (71) one shot further back. Another birdie at the par three 12th saw Rose temporarily move four strokes clear of the field before dropped shots at the 13th and 17th checked his progress. With Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods fluffing shots (and their lines) on Friday, it was left to the Englishman to take center stage at the Abu Dhabi Golf Course with another impressive display of ball-striking.
