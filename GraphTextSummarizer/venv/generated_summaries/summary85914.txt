He is aiming to complete the Australian Triple Crown, by adding the Australian Open titles to the Australian PGA and Australian Masters titles he has already claimed. But the 24-year-old golfer finished the day with nine birdies, and just two bogeys to move to 10 under for the tournament, only two strokes off leader and Australian favorite Adam Scott. The 2013 season has largely slipped by the two-time major winner McIlroy, who has struggled to recapture the form which saw him win four PGA Tour titles and two European Tour titles and the PGA Championship in 2012. Robert Allenby in 2005 is the only player to have won the Australian Masters, Australian PGA and Australian Open in the same season. In contrast to McIlroy, Scott has enjoyed a stellar 2013.
