-- Movie director John Landis is suing Michael Jackson, accusing the reclusive entertainer of fraud in his handling of profits from the iconic "Thriller" video the two made together more than 25 years ago. The show, which Jackson is to be involved with, also is to include music from other Jackson albums, the company said. The Nederlander Organization, a Broadway production company, announced Tuesday that it had signed a contract with Jackson to produce "Thriller" on stage. Landis claimed his 1983 contract with Jackson gave him 50 percent of net profits from the 14-minute video and the documentary about the making of it, both works that he directed and co-wrote with Jackson, court documents say. Jackson "wrongfully refused to pay or account for such profits," the suit, filed against the singer and Optimum Productions, says.
