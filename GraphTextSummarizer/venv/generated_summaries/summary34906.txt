And after St. John's took a direct hit from a catastrophic tornado May 22, it became a symbol of something else: Joplin's resilience, the strength and compassion of its people and their determination to rebuild. It was a fixture in the emergency department waiting room of St. John's Mercy Hospital in Joplin, Missouri, a symbol of the hospital's Catholic roots and, perhaps, a comfort to the sick and injured who sought help there. "The future is just so bright," Shaw said, as Joplin's new hospital will be "one of the most up-to-date facilities in the country." Asked what the ceremonies might mean to Joplin residents, he said, "Maybe the word is 'hope.' "It's hard to say goodbye to the building that has been St. John's since 1968," said Gary Pulsipher, president of St. John's Mercy, in a statement. Before the hospital comes down on Sunday, a demolition ceremony will be held on the hospital campus, part of several events designed to help Joplin "say goodbye to the past and celebrate the future," Mercy said.
