"Apparently nothing was done by the school administration to either Mr. Forde or my client, because Mr. Forde was back in the classroom on October 1, as was my client." Madden said the school didn't take any action until after a police report was filed on October 12 about the incident. Mr. Forde bonded out on $10,000 bond and waived his preliminary hearing," Madden said. "Finally Mr. Forde was allegedly removed from the school after the police report was filed and my client was able to return to school. "Not only did my client report the verbal altercation and verbal threat to the vice principal of Mundy's Mill HS, he also reported that Mr. Forde asked him outside the classroom for the inappropriate question of whether he was gay," the statement said. Then "on or about September 30," the two had an argument in class and Forde threatened "to hit him in his 'effin mouth," Madden's statement said.
