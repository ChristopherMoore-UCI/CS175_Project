" The original policy had prompted questions and concerns among Muslim students and organizations, particularly because it meant Muslim women at the college could no longer wear the niqab, or face veil. " Bajwa, who does not wear the niqab, said that having to wear student IDs at all times keeps students safe. Hooper acknowledged that the college's policy focuses on students but said it will inevitably target Muslim employees in the future. " Muslim students had mixed reactions to the original ban. Ibrahim Hooper, communications director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, thinks the policy targeted Muslim students and filed a third-party complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
