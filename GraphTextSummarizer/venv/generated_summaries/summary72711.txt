This year's broadcast, which aired Tuesday night, paid tribute to R&B great Al Green, the multitalented Sting, Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks, dancer Patricia McBride and comedian Lily Tomlin. Tomlin received compliments from Garrison Keillor, Jane Fonda and Jane Lynch, among others. Martin Short leading a seeming cast of thousands (OK, dozens) doing "Yankee Doodle Dandy"? McBride was feted with performances by dancers including Tiler Peck and Misty Copeland, and Hanks enjoyed a speech from David Letterman and Short's song-and-dance routine. (Oh, and Pentatonix did "That Thing You Do!" from the 1996 movie Hanks directed, wrote and appeared in.)
