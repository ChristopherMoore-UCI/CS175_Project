Syrian President Bashar al-Assad says his regime is apprised of U.S.-led coalition efforts against ISIS in his country -- not by the Americans, but through third parties such as Iraq. But now, U.S. allies and the Syrian regime have a common enemy: ISIS, which is trying to solidify an Islamic state across swaths of Iraq and Syria. On Tuesday, the opposition group Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported more barrel bombs falling on the provinces of Aleppo, Hama and Daraa  -- the birthplace of the uprising. In the interview, al-Assad flatly denied that his military is using barrel bombs in rebel-controlled areas, even though opposition activists report near-daily barrel bombs raining from regime helicopters. In the broad BBC interview, al-Assad said Syria won't join the international coalition trying to "degrade and destroy" ISIS.
