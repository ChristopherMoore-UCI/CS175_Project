-- A Georgia judge Thursday sentenced Hemy Neuman to life in prison without the possibility of parole after jurors convicted him of fatally shooting a father outside a suburban Atlanta day care center. "He had limitless potential, which now can never be realized because of this man," Sneiderman told the court Thursday, referring to Neuman. On the day of the murder, witnesses told police they saw a man -- later proven to be Neuman -- come up from behind Sneiderman and open fire in Dunwoody, a community about 15 miles north of Atlanta. "If you cannot trust the ingredients on this insanity sandwich, then I'm going to ask you -- don't eat it." Doug Peters said that he and other defense team members plan to talk soon with Neuman, to discuss what their next step will be. Andrea Sneiderman said, claiming that Neuman said he'd cared about her, her husband and her family before the shooting.
