A recent study done at Harvard University found that patients with Parkinson's improved after researchers transplanted tissue from fetal dopamine cells into their brains. Your body uses a chemical called dopamine to control movement, according to the National Institutes of Health. A medication called levodopa is often given to patients to help their brains make more dopamine. Symptoms include slowness of movement, a loss of balance and slurred speech. Patients with severe symptoms experienced 50% fewer symptoms in the years after surgery.
