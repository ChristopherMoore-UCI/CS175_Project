Appliance giant LG shared its vision of a "better and more beautiful future" in which its HomeChat platform might allow your LG smartwatch to understand that you're sleeping restlessly, and instantly tell your LG audio system to play soothing music, your LG air conditioner to reduce the temperature, and your LG air purifier and humidifier to pump some scented mist into the room. (All of which will give you more time to watch "Game of Thrones" on your LG widescreen OLED Ultra HD television and play Candy Crush Soda on your LG tablet, naturally.) If you're constantly worrying about whether you have enough fuel to fire up the family gathering you've been planning (and who doesn't?), Quirky will sell you a wi-fi enabled Refuel Smart Propane Tank gauge for just $50. This year, at the annual gargantuan gadget gathering known as CES, the titans of technology stood on stage to deliver virtually the same message, one after the other: We have arrived at a turning point in human society -- one in which the world around us is so deeply embedded with intelligent electronic objects that we can essentially outsource huge aspects of our life to them! Meanwhile, your LG coffeemaker is grinding some fresh beans for next morning's automatically brewed cup of joe, and your LG smartphone is transmitting your daily schedule to your LG-enabled car system, so you can be guided directly to your first appointment when you wake up in the morning.
