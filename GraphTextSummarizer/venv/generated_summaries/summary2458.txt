After the shoot-down, rescue teams had to call off the search after two days because of heavy fighting near the crash site in Savannakhet province. The remains of an Air Force major missing since the Vietnam War have been identified after years of searches, the Department of Defense said. Curtis Daniel Miller of Palacios, Texas, was one of 14 men whose plane was shot down on March 29, 1972. Miller and his crew were flying over southern Laos when a missile struck their plane, the Defense Department said Tuesday. In 2005 and 2006, search teams found more remains.
