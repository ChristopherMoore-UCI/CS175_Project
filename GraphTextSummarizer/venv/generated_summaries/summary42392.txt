If Beijing does send out the troops -- the People's Liberation Army forces already garrisoned close to where the "umbrella revolution" demonstrators are holding their protests -- international reaction will prove even less determined and more ineffective than it did in Beijing after that tragic night in Tiananmen Square 25 years ago Beijing knows that if it crushes the protests, there will be little appetite in other countries for major economic sanctions against China. The Hong Kong students, in contrast to the Tiananmen Square protesters, are not demanding that China become a democratic country. When the United States issued mild statements in support of an "open system" and the "highest possible degree of autonomy" for Hong Kong, Beijing promptly shot back that this is China's internal domestic affair and others should stay out. When Hong Kong stopped being a British colony to join China in 1997, Beijing agreed voters there would choose their own leaders through universal suffrage by 2017. Now China has said all voters in Hong Kong can participate in those elections, but they will have to choose between candidates approved by a committee loyal to Beijing's leaders.
