Saif al-Islam Gadhafi has realized there is no escape, and wants to negotiate a surrender to limit the damage, said Anees al-Sharif, spokesman for the National Transitional Council's Tripoli Military Council. "We believe he should be convicted." The court believes Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, along with his father and his brother-in-law, Abdulla al-Sanussi, are responsible for crimes against humanity including murder and persecution across the country beginning in February amid anti-government demonstrations, Moreno-Ocampo said. But, he said, if the younger Gadhafi is captured in Libya, he will be tried there, as his alleged crimes were committed on Libyan soil. -- Libya's transitional government would prefer to try former leader Moammar Gadhafi's son Saif al-Islam in a Libyan court despite an arrest warrant issued for him by the International Criminal Court However, the NTC would prefer to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi in a Libyan court, as it would like to show that he could receive a fair trial, he said.
