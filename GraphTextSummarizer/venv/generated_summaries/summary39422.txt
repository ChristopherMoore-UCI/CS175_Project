In early February, the Australian government made a nomination to include 124,000 hectares of threatened Tasmanian forest into the existing World Heritage Area. I watch as flames leap from the dark silhouettes of trees and embers are flung high into the night sky. I watched the forest change through all four seasons, as the tree exploded with flowers in summer right through to seeing the entire forest carpeted in thick white snow in the middle of winter. There were certainly times when I wondered what on earth I was doing on a tiny platform in the middle of a wild forest, exposed to storms, wind, rain and snow. Within days the reality began to be exposed around the state logging was continuing unabated in those forests nominated for World Heritage.
