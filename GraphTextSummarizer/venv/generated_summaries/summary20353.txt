South Korea first agreed in 1972 to limit its missile range to 180 kilometers (112 miles) in exchange for access to U.S. missile technology. -- South Korea announced Sunday that it reached a deal with the United States that allows Seoul to extend the range of its ballistic missiles, a move a senior security official says will deter military provocation from North Korea. "The important goal in revising the missile pact is to deter armed provocation from North Korea," Chun said. North Korea test-fires 3 short-range missiles, Seoul says CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this report. The plan allows for three times the current payload for ballistic missiles with a range of 300 kilometers.
