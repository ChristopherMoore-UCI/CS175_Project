John and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. -- John and Elizabeth Calvert enjoyed the good life on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, friends said, but they were growing more and more suspicious of the way their business books were being handled. Gerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. The Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. In reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look.
