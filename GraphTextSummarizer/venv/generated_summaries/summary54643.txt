Coast Guard investigators will look into the incident and "prosecute it and investigate it to the best of their ability," Montoro said. The investigation is still active, Coast Guard spokesman Charles Rowe said Tuesday. The focus of the search had been 60 to 65 miles off Monterey Bay, said Lt. Heather Lampert, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. At one point, two Coast Guard cutters, HC-130 planes, MH-65 helicopters and a Navy E2-C Hawkeye were involved, the Coast Guard said on Monday. " "I know we do have successful prosecutions" on such hoaxes, Montoro said, "and it would be taken very seriously."
