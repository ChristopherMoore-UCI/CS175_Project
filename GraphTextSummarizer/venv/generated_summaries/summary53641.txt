Anti-racism organization Kick It Out (KIO) says there's been a 35% rise in fans reporting abusive behavior committed by other fans -- and that's largely due to a new phone app. Later in February, KIO says it contacted the police over social media footage which showed men, thought to be West Ham fans, singing anti-Semitic songs on a train while traveling to Tottenham Hotspur's White Hart Lane ground ahead of an English Premier League game. " Bates admitted that it takes "bravery and courage" for fans to record photographic evidence on their phones, but pointed to the effect British expatriate Paul Nolan has had after he filmed Chelsea fans physically stopping a black man from getting on the Paris metro last month. KIO's mobile phone application, which was released in 2013, encourages fans to report incidents anonymously by pressing a "Report It!" The FA, which released its own witness complaint guidelines in 2013, encouraged fans to be proactive in flagging up incidents.
