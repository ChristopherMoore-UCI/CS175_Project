Estonia's Kaia Kanepi set up a last-eight clash with German second seed Andrea Petkovic after cruising past Russian No. 7 Anastasia Pavlyuchenko 6-0 6-3. However, the American hopes it will not stop her from competing at this month's Australian Open, an event that the 13-time grand slam champion has won five times -- a record in the post-1968 Open era. Elsewhere on the WTA Tour, top seed Sabine Lisicki battled the elements to record a hard-fought 7-6 (7-3) 3-6 6-3 success against fellow German Mona Barthel in second round of the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. The 26-year-old Hradecka will face Peng's compatriot Zheng Jie in the last eight, after the world No. 48 eliminated Romanian eighth seed Monica Niculescu 6-0 6-2. Jankovic next faces Italian third seed Francesca Schiavone, who defeated Kazakhstan's Galina Voskoboeva on Tuesday.
