The launch of the Agni V is "another milestone in our quest to add to the credibility of our security and preparedness and to continuously explore the frontiers of science," India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said Thursday. A successful experiment, Bhaskar said, would bring India closer to the group of nations capable of building intercontinental missiles. Built years earlier, Agni I could travel 700 km, according to Indian defense authorities. Siemon Wezeman, a senior analyst with SIPRI, said last month that India's defense spending reflects its regional security concerns and Delhi's global aspirations. India borders two nuclear-armed states -- its arch-rival Pakistan; and China, with which it fought a brief but bitter war in 1962.
