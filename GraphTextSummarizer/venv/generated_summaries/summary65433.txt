• Minneapolis, which is used to July highs in the mid-80s, might get up to 65 on Monday, 70 on Tuesday and 75 on Wednesday. A sampling: • Marquette, Michigan, could see a low of 45 on Tuesday morning, and it might reach only 58 on Monday and 57 on Tuesday -- a departure from July averages in the mid-70s. Neoguri, the storm that hit Japan this week, made the jet stream wavier than usual, and starting Monday, the stream will dip into the Midwest, allowing cool Canadian air to drop south, CNN meteorologist Indra Petersons said. Chicago could see highs of 78 on Monday, 67 on Tuesday and 72 on Wednesday. Outside the Midwest, the weather won't be particularly cool, but it won't be scorching, either: • Washington will be baking on Monday (93) but might get up to only 81 on Wednesday.
