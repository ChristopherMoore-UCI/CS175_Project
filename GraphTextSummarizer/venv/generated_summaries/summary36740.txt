Prosecutors say Laura Lundquist killed centenarian Elizabeth Barrow, a resident of Brandon Woods Nursing Home in Dartmouth, after the two women had an argument over a table Lundquist had placed at the foot of Barrow's bed. District Attorney C. Samuel Sutter said Barrow repeatedly complained that Lundquist was making her life "a living hell" in the weeks leading up to the woman's death, and that Lundquist remarked that she would outlive her roommate. A nursing home spokesman said the facility twice presented Barrow with the chance to change either rooms or roommates, but she declined each time. " Lundquist's attorney, Carl Levin, contends his client was not involved in Barrow's death, saying, "We maintain her innocence." Barrow was found dead September 24 with a plastic shopping bag tied loosely around her head, according the Bristol County district attorney's office.
