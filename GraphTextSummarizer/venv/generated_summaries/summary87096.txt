Sowell will be able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination from prosecutors, said Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office. During the sentencing phase, the defense could call up to 28 witnesses -- among them family members, acquaintances and five expert witnesses -- according to Cuyahoga County court administrator Gregory Popovich. "We believe that, at the end of the day ... at the end of all the evidence, that you will decide that death is not the appropriate penalty in this particular case," said John Parker, who is representing Sowell. -- An Ohio jury on Monday began the sentencing phase for convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell, ultimately deciding whether he should receive life in prison or the death penalty for killing 11 Cleveland-area women between 2007 and 2009. But if jurors decide to spare Sowell's life, the judge cannot impose a death sentence, Popovich said.
