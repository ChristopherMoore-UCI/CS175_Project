Tonga's king is giving up most of the near-absolute power that his family has held for centuries in the South Pacific nation, the country's news agency reported Monday. Tonga, with a population of 119,000, is the only monarchy that remains in the Pacific. Tonga has for years promised to pave the way toward a democratically elected parliament, but reforms have been slow in coming. King George Tupou V will let the prime minister guide the day-to-day governmental affairs, Tonga Now reported. In March, Bhutan held elections that ended more than 100 years of royal rule in the South Asian nation and transformed it into a democracy.
