China's premier has waded into an intensifying trade dispute with Europe, warning that EU investigations into Chinese-made solar panels and telecommunications equipment would backfire by hurting European consumers. The EU must decide before June 6 whether to go ahead with a proposal from Karel De Gucht, trade commissioner, to impose provisional duties averaging 47 per cent on imported Chinese solar products for dumping, or selling goods below cost. " Mr Li's remarks coincide with a comment piece in Monday's Financial Times written by Wu Hailong, China's ambassador to the EU, accusing Brussels of resorting to protectionism and remarking that its "repeated attempts to stir up trade frictions with China are astonishing and confusing". Mr De Gucht was given a green light from fellow commissioners to open an investigation after informing them he believes both companies benefited from illegal government subsidies, including cheap land and financing, and then dumped their products in Europe. Mr Li's comments mark the first time that China's top leadership has weighed in on the trade disputes, and come as the solar case -- the EU's biggest ever trade investigation -- enters a critical phase.
