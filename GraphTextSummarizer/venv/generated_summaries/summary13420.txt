Unintended consequences: 2008 anti-trafficking law contributes to border crisis One proposal by Texas legislators -- GOP Sen. John Cornyn and Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar -- would change a 2008 law that requires immigration hearings for children from countries other than neighbors Mexico and Canada who arrive at the border on their own. His request includes $1.8 billion to provide temporary care for children in government custody, and $1.6 billion to bolster customs and border efforts while cracking down on smugglers. The surge of Central American children illegally crossing the border into Texas has politicians debating possible responses while scattered protests against the influx threaten to become an organized movement in coming days. Other issues cited included dissatisfaction with the government at 16%, the economy at 15% and jobs at 14%, with nothing else reaching double digits. New polls Americans consider immigration the most important issue for now, according to a new national survey released Wednesday.
