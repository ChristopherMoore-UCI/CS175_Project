And on Saturday, Israeli military aircraft targeted a militant in southern Gaza who earlier in the day fired rockets at the town of Ofakim in southern Israel, IDF said in a statement. Gaza and Israeli communities within rocket's reach have seen plenty of intermittent violence in recent weeks. Relatives accuse Israeli forces of beating visiting U.S. teen. That includes more Israeli warplanes striking targets in Gaza, as well as more rockets being fired across the border into Israel early Sunday morning. This comes after Israeli authorities blamed Hamas -- the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza -- for the kidnapping and killing of the three Israel teens whose bodies were found earlier this week.
