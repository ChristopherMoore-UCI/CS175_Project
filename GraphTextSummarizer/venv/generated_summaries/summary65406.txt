" Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles, told CNN that Wu said in court if Drew is convicted of illegally accessing computers, the guilty verdict would set a precedent and anyone who has ever violated MySpace's terms of service could also be found guilty of a misdemeanor. Drew was to be sentenced Thursday, but California U.S. District Judge George Wu -- who heard the case because MySpace is based in Los Angeles -- instead decided to not uphold the jury's finding. Using the statute, prosecutors accused Drew of violating the social networking site's terms of service, which prohibits creating fraudulent registration information, using accounts to obtain personal information about juvenile members and using MySpace to "harass, abuse or harm other members. The misdemeanor charges -- which Drew is tentatively cleared of with Wu's action -- stemmed from an elaborate hoax played out on MySpace. A jury convicted Lori Drew, 49, of O'Fallon, Missouri, in November on three misdemeanor counts of accessing protected computers without authorization.
