"These accidents have demonstrated the need for emergency action to address unsafe conditions or practices in the shipment of petroleum crude oil by rail," the agency said in its notice that included an order for railroads to notify relevant state emergency response offices when planning to ship large amounts of petroleum crude from the Bakken oil field in North Dakota. Last December, a BNSF train hauling more than 100 cars of petroleum crude hit the derailed car of another train in North Dakota. To that end, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration advised those offering oil shipping contracts and rail carriers on Wednesday "to the extent possible to avoid the use of older" tank cars when shipping Bakken crude. Safety officials wary of growing use of trains to ship oil Opinion: Stop shipping volatile oil by rail Regulators are "strongly urging" the use of tank cars with the "highest level of integrity available in their fleets" when hauling that product.
