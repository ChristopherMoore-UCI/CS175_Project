DeHerrera's father, Anthony DeHerrera, told HLN's "Prime News" that Denver police mishandled the situation. On the video, DeHerrera is seen talking animatedly on a mobile phone while police officers kneel over a friend who was being arrested on charges of punching an off-duty officer working security at a bar. He admitted to grabbing police officers he said were struggling with his friend, but denied attempting to punch anyone. The friend was being thrown out of the bar when the altercation occurred, according to police reports. The FBI said Tuesday it will look into an April 2009 beating of a man by Denver, Colorado, police, an incident that resulted in disciplinary action against two officers but no charges.
