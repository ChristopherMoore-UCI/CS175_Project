HPV has also been linked to cervical cancer, penile cancer and anal cancer, according to the CDC. The link between oral sex, HPV and cancer has been receiving more attention in recent years. Not exactly HPV is thought to cause 1,700 oropharyngeal, or throat, cancers in women and 6,700 oropharyngeal cancers in men each year, according to the CDC. Data presented that same year at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting suggested HPV was overtaking tobacco as the leading cause of oral cancers in Americans under the age of 50. There is no certain way to know which people infected with HPV will go on to develop cancer.
