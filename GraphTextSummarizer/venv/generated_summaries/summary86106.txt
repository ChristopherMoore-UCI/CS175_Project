Due to that achievement, Stoke will also be playing in Europe next season in the second-tier Europa League. In Saturday's other Premier League matches, Blackpool remained in the relegation zone despite a thrilling 4-3 victory at home to ninth-placed Bolton. And just two hours later, City capped a big day for the northern metropolis by beating Stoke City 1-0 in the FA Cup final at London's Wembley Stadium. City's last silverware came in the 1976 League Cup final, but the massive investment of owner Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed since the Abu Dhabi billionaire's 2008 takeover is now paying off. Alex Ferguson's United team went into the penultimate match of the Premier League campaign needing just a point to end second-placed Chelsea's title reign.
