The Blue Lagoon -- the most visited sight in Iceland -- is also set up for meetings and conferences. Meet in Reykjavik has adopted the slogan "meet in the middle," a reference to both the country's handy midway coordinates, and to the historic Reykjavik Summit, where former U.S. President Ronald Reagan met with General Secretary of the Soviet Union's Communist Party Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986, to negotiate arms control. "The Blue Lagoon brings more energy to business groups, and makes corporate events more fun and productive," notes Magnea Guomundsdottir, the director of public relations for Blue Lagoon Iceland. "The tourism numbers fluctuate a lot, depending on the season, whereas corporate travel is distributed more evenly throughout the year," explains Thorsteinn Orn Gudmundsson, managing director of Meet in Reykjavik, the official convention bureau for the Icelandic capital. "Though one could say that it was the starting point for Iceland becoming a destination for meetings."
