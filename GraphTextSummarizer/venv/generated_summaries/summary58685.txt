Young is known as a flamboyant dresser and Larry Yarrell, the Tech principal, said school staff had been trying to get him to "tone down" his accessories. School officials are investigating the incident, but none of the students who allegedly surrounded Young has been positively identified. After six other students surrounded him at school on April 16, calling him names and threatening to beat him up, Young pulled the stun gun from his backpack. "I got kicked out of school for me bringing the weapon to school, but I honestly don't think that that was fair," Young said. -- An Indiana mother who sent her gay son to school with a stun gun after administrators apparently didn't do enough to stop the bullying against him said she would do it again -- even though the teen now faces expulsion.
