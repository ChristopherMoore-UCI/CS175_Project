Joe Ledley scored the only goal of the game as Celtic beat Rangers 1-0 in the Old Firm derby clash Wednesday night. On such tight decisions these often frantic affairs are decided and victory for Neil Lennon's men saw them revenge defeat in the first Old Firm match of the season at Ibrox. Elsewhere, St Johnstone beat Kilmarnock 2-0, St Mirren and Dundee United drew 2-2, Aberdeen and Hearts ended goalless while Pat Fenlon picked up his first point as Hibernian manager in a 1-1 draw with Inverness. Wallace saw his seventh minute header from a Sone Aluko header clawed away via the post by Fraser Forster, but it was the home team who had the better of the chances and Rangers keeper Allan McGregor was kept busy. Bombs, songs and soccer, Glasgow confronts a religious divide Scott Brown and Mulgrew came close to adding a second while Nikica Jelavic wasted a volleyed opportunity in a rare glimpse of goal for Rangers.
