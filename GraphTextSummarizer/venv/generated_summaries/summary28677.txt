-- Five days after a British sailor died training in San Francisco Bay, America's Cup organizers announced Tuesday that the historic race will go on. Among others, the group will include two-time U.S. Sailing Yachtswoman of the Year Sally Lindsay Honey, race executive and former Canadian Olympic coach John Craig and French boat designer Vincent Lauriot Prevost. On that website, America's Cup organizers "confirmed that this summer's events remain on track." Specifically, race organizers on Tuesday detailed who will be on a safety review committee that's been created in the past few days. That means no change in the start time of the Louis Vuitton Cup -- the America's Cup Challenger Series -- set for July 7 and the America's Cup Finals scheduled to begin on September 7 off San Francisco.
