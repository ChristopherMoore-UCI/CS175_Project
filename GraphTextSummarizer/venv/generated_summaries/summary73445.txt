Two years ago, Sea Shepherd activists boarded another Japanese ship and handcuffed themselves to the vessel with plastic ties, according to the Institute of Cetacean Research, a branch of Japan's fisheries ministry that deals with whaling. The incident highlights an ongoing feud between Japanese whaling fleets and conservation agencies -- especially Sea Shepherd. Sea Shepherd has accused the Japanese ship "Shonan Maru 2" of destroying their vessel during the skirmish in the Southern Ocean -- a term used to describe parts of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans that surround Antarctica. Japanese authorities called the incident the latest "publicity stunt" from the animal rights group and said they have not decided what to do with the activist. However, Japanese authorities deny their ship intentionally hit the catamaran and have said the activists were harassing their whaling fleet.
