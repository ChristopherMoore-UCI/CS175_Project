Watch Chamberlain discuss the hidden fees Virginia is one of two dozen states that use debit cards as one means of distributing child support payments, a move that allows them to reduce the amount of money spent issuing and mailing checks.

Virginia also uses debit cards to distribute state retiree payments, and it is one of 30 states to use them to pay unemployment benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In a CNN report on the practice earlier this month, the Labor Department said debit cards are safer and more secure than checks, allow the unemployed to avoid check-cashing fees and frees them from keeping excess cash around. Young told CNN that he had no idea how much money Wachovia made from debit card fees, but said most of them could be avoided with "wise" use of the cards.
