Affected service was limited in many cases to high-definition service, he said. Technicians worked overnight to resolve the problem and expect service to be restored by tomorrow morning, the spokesman said. -- Customers of Dish Network's satellite television service were unable to access many channels on Tuesday. Tom Tait, a Dish customer who lives in Santa Clarita, California, said he had trouble getting through to telephone support lines and accessing the company's website. Dish is currently expanding the scope of its business, having recently acquired Blockbuster in a bankruptcy auction for $320 million and is moving into mobile data services.
