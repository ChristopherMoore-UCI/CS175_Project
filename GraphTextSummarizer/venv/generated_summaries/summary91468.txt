The boy and his five siblings -- two sisters and three brothers ranging in age from 11 to 7 months -- were taken into custody by the New Jersey Division of Child Protection and Permanency. Authorities are continuing to investigate in Camden County, which is across the Delaware River from Philadelphia. Florence Pollard, 31, and her boyfriend, Brian Craig, 29, were arrested Monday and charged with endangering the welfare of a child and criminal restraint, the Camden County Police Department said. "This level of depravity inflicted upon a child is chilling," Chief J. Scott Thomson said in a statement. He also said that his hands were occasionally restrained by plastic zip ties.
