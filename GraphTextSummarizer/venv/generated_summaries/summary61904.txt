Malaysian acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein made the comments about the data from satellite company Inmarsat as he toured a newly constructed terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Publication of the raw satellite data could allow for independent analysis of what happened on March 8, the day the Boeing 777 veered sharply off its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and dropped off radar screens. -- Raw satellite data about missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 will be released Tuesday, a Malaysian official said Monday. "In line with our commitment towards greater transparency, all parties are working for the release of the data communication logs and the technical description of the analysis for public consumption," Inmarsat and the Malaysian aviation officials said in a joint statement. CNN's Saima Mohsin and Mitra Mobasherat reported from Kuala Lumpur, and Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong.
