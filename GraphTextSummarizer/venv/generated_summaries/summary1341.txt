"We are honored to have such a great champion choose to make the Southern California Open her first tournament back on tour," said tournament director Alastair Garland. Williams will next play Anna Tatishvili of Georgia, who beat Swiss wildcard and junior Wimbledon champion Belinda Bencic 2-6 6-4 6-4. The World No.1 suffered a shock defeat at Wimbledon to Sabine Lisicki, but returned to competitive action Tuesday with a straights sets dismissal of Sesil Karatantcheva at the Bastad Open in Sweden. " Hingis, who also won nine grand slam doubles titles in a glittering career, teamed up with Hantuchova in the final three events she played in her first comeback. There is no indication if Hingis will extend her second comeback to singles competition, but has been successful with Washington Kastles in team tennis.
