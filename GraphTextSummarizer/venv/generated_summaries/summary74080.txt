"He feels he can speak to you and me and everyone else using this box," said Garrido's friend and former business client, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Even so, Allen and several other former Garrido clients signed declarations saying the device worked. Garrido so believed in the power of his invention that he wanted to have the device patented, so he solicited the help of a private investigator last year. Documents obtained by CNN include a news release that Garrido produced: "A Bay area man has made a major discovery concerning the phenomenon of voice," the release says, accompanied by a photograph of Garrido. Meanwhile, investigators will begin excavating part of the Garridos' California property Monday afternoon after two sheriff's dogs trained to find human remains alerted authorities of possible buried bones, officials said.
