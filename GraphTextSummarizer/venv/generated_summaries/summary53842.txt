When police arrived at Andersson's apartment on Sunday, Trujillo, who had recently worked as a massage therapist, answered the door with blood on her clothes and hands; Andersson was lying in the hallway face up, with a stiletto by his head, KTRK reported, citing court records. Andersson, a research professor from the University of Houston, had 10 puncture wounds on his head -- some as deep as an inch and a half -- and 15 to 20 puncture wounds along his face, arms, and neck, prosecutors say, according to CNN affiliate KTRK. Ana Lilia Trujillo, 44, is charged with murder for striking Alf Stefan Andersson "with a deadly weapon, namely a shoe," Houston police say in the official complaint against her. Trujillo has said in the past that "if anybody ever messed with her," she'd get them with her shoe -- "a big stiletto heel," Jim Carroll, former manager of a motel where Trujillo lived, told KTRK. Trujillo had recently moved in with Andersson, and she told investigators that he grabbed her, and a struggle followed, KTRK reported.
