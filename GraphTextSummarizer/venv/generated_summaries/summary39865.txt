The Transportation Security Administration is unveiling new technology this month at several airports aimed at verifying boarding passes and IDs of passengers. "We don't have data with passengers at this point," said TSA spokesman Greg Soule, noting it was a pilot program. The machines do not save the information collected once the agent clears the data to advance to the next passenger, according to the TSA, and passenger data is not checked against any watch lists or other databases. "We feel that this technology is a step up from the current technology we are using today," said Domenic Bianchini, director of TSA's checkpoint technology. "Once the testing is complete, TSA will make a final determination if we can roll out one or more of these technologies into the airports," Bianchini said.
