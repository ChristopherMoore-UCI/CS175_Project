Cambodian Buddhist monks walk at Preah Vihear temple on Monday. Thailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory. -- Cambodia and Thailand failed to resolve a weeklong military standoff over an ancient border temple that sits on disputed land. The current flare-up began July 15, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. It sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side.
