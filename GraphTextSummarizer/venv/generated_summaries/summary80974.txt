At a time when most Americans still want Wall Street held accountable for crashing our economy, President Hillary Clinton would likely be cozier with big banks than Barack Obama has been. (And some would agree with Jessica Valenti that Clinton has no choice but to be boring, given that "any emotion that Hillary Clinton shows has always been used against her, and it has become a kind of stand-in for the many reasons women are said to be oh-so-unfit to lead.") In what was presumably a dig at Obama, Clinton said during the CNN town hall, "Some people can paint a beautiful vision. And then Clinton went on to mirror Republican talking points about border security and the need to "send a clear" message to would-be migrants, including children who "should be sent back." I confess I already have a chip on my shoulder about the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency.
