The young then-unmarried couple, attending Yale Law, weren't interested in letting off steam with their Democratic colleagues in Austin, Texas, according to Mauro, who's now a strategist with Sen. Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The Clintons had just started dating, said Mauro, who years later became Texas land commissioner. Texas election workers often looked with suspicion at the so-called "out-of-staters." When Bill Clinton returned to Texas for his own presidential run, they frequented Guero's Taco Bar in Austin's funky South Congress Avenue neighborhood, which trendsetters like to call SoCo. Clinton and her Democratic rival Sen. Barack Obama have been dueling in the state for weeks, as polls show the candidates locked in a razor-thin race to win the biggest share of 193 Texas delegates, who are crucial to sewing up the party nomination.
