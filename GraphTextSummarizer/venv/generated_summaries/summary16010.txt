Human Rights Watch has said that ISIS and other extremist groups "have specifically recruited children through free schooling campaigns that include weapons training and have given them dangerous tasks, including suicide bombing missions." The United Nations has said there are confirmed reports of children as young as 12 undergoing military training. The decision of three British teenage girls to travel to Syria last month was a stark example of ISIS' ability to attract young Westerners. As ISIS encourages foreign fighters to bring their families into the parts of Syria and Iraq where it imposes its brutal rule, the catalog of children taking part in shocking acts is grim and growing. Another boy told CNN last year that ISIS forced his father to send him to one of its children's camps in northern Syria when he was just 13. ISIS' recent video showing a child shooting a man whom the extremist group claimed was an Israeli spy is the latest example of how the militants exploit children in their propaganda.
