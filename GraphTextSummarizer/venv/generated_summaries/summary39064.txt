-- Mexican officials said they have identified two suspects in this week's slayings of two Americans in northern Mexico. " The LeBaron brothers belonged to the "Community of LeBaron" in the municipality of Galeana, a township founded by ex-communicated Mormons. A security camera at a toll booth near the municipality of Galeana captured images of the suspects, Chihuahua state Attorney General Patricia Gonzalez Rodriguez said Thursday, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Benjamin LeBaron, 32, and his brother-in-law, Luis Widmar, who was in his mid-30s, were beaten and shot to death after armed men stormed into their home Tuesday morning in Galeana. "There are no leaders here, or we are all leaders," LeBaron's brother Julian LeBaron told CNN affiliate KINT-TV in El Paso, Texas, this week.
