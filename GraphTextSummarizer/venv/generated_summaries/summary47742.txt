The state will pay local communities' debris removal costs for 30 days "to make sure there is no delay in getting this recovery and rebuilding process moving quickly," Gov. Robert Bentley announced, eliciting applause from legislators. Alabama officials have said they would not release further death toll and injury reports until all the missing can be accounted for and final totals of the dead and injured can be confirmed. The National Weather Service has confirmed that more than 20 large tornadoes touched down in Alabama alone, leaving behind "utter devastation in towns large and small," Bentley said. Bentley said 38 counties in the state have been declared disaster areas by the federal government.. "We have spent much of the last six days in a rescue stage," Bentley said.
