Full Tilt Poker has damaged his reputation by not paying back $150 million owed to U.S. players, according to a lawsuit Ivey filed Wednesday in District Court in Clark County, Nevada. But if it does, the company looks forward to presenting facts demonstrating that Mr. Ivey is putting his own narrow financial interests ahead of the players he professes to help. I am equally embarrassed that as a result, many players cannot compete in tournaments and have suffered economic harm," Ivey says on his website. Ivey has won eight World Series of Poker bracelets and more than $5.6 million during his career, placing him sixth in WSOP rankings, according to the organization. "My name and reputation have been dragged through the mud, through the inactivity and indecision of others and on behalf of all poker players I refuse to remain silent any longer," Ivey said on his website.
