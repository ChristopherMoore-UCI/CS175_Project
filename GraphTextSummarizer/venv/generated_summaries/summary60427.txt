"While we cannot predict where and when attacks may take place, we have consistently seen a cycle of violence in East Jerusalem neighborhoods following incidents like the one today," the consulate said Tuesday on its website. While no group claimed responsibility for the attack, Israeli officials say the attackers came from East Jerusalem, where Palestinians can move more freely about the city than those living in the West Bank and Gaza, who must pass through stringent checkpoints. The U.S. consulate in Jerusalem warned Americans that disturbances in East Jerusalem were possible. It follows recent deadly stabbings and vehicle attacks which, while not the same as the large-scale suicide bombings that defined last decade's second intifada, have left Jerusalem on edge. Israeli authorities moved into the attackers' East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber to demolish their homes on Netanyahu's order.
