Both as a solo artist and leader of the Heartbreakers, Petty is one of America's top recording artists, selling more than 57 million albums, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. -- For classic rocker Tom Petty the waiting is the hardest part after five guitars were stolen from a soundstage where the Heartbreakers were rehearsing for their upcoming U.S. tour. The band's tour is set to start Wednesday in Colorado. "Sometimes people make mistakes, but we'd like these back," Petty said on his Twitter account Friday. The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.
