That idea is probably making several Bruce Wayne fans cringe as they hurry to sign a petition begging Warner Bros. to drop Affleck from the role. " Film School Rejects disagrees with those who call the decision ho-hum, arguing that "Affleck as Batman in 'Man of Steel 2' is actually some pretty exciting casting news. From the perspective of the studio, Warner Bros. (which shares a parent company with CNN), Affleck's casting is "a major win," The Wrap says. So is it any wonder that within hours of Warner Bros. announcing the actor was going to play Batman in the upcoming "Man of Steel" sequel, Twitter immediately tried to recast the part using the hashtag #BetterBatmanThanBenAffleck. "He has the acting chops to create a layered portrayal of a man who is older and wiser than Clark Kent and bears the scars of a seasoned crime fighter, but retain the charm that the world sees in billionaire Bruce Wayne."
