Welcome to the world of fan fiction, where fans tweak or add to existing series, novels and characters -- oftentimes with a steamy twist. Fan fiction grew popular in the 1960s thanks to "Star Trek" as fans developed their own story lines to swap with other devotees. Weir said that since a lot of young adult novels have such broad fan bases now, the success of "Fifty Shades" will probably be replicated more and more. And while the early "Twilight" novels were decidedly chaste (at first, anyway), writers of fan fiction will tell you there's a huge desire for erotic novels. And the genre has flourished, allowing fans to adapt beloved stories and tailor existing literature to fit their own preferences, said Francesca Coppa, an English professor at Muhlenberg College and founding board member of the Organization for Transformative Works.
