Older voters don't necessarily vote for older candidates, just as younger voters don't always support younger candidates. That's a polite way of saying that voters often prefer younger candidates to older ones. Already, we've seen one headline that spells out what a lot of Americans may be thinking: "Is Hillary Clinton Too Old to be President?" We're not supposed to ask that question or mention Hillary's age. Rounding out the top tier of GOP hopefuls, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker will be 49 years old, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will be 54 years old. The bad news: Capping applicants at 60 would exclude one of the best Republican prospects â€” former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who will be 63 in 2016.
