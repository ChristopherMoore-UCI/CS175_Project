The second strip is more reminiscent of Watterson's "Calvin & Hobbes" days and features a "Martian robot attack" that could be seen as nod to Calvin's alter ego Spaceman Spiff. -- Almost 20 years ago, Bill Watterson walked away from "Calvin & Hobbes" -- the wildly popular comic strip he created and illustrated from 1985 until 1995. When the woman asks which strip he draws, Pastis says "Ever heard of 'Calvin and Hobbes?'" Stephan Pastis writes "Pearls Before Swine," which chronicles the lives of its main characters -- Pig, Rat, Zebra and Goat, and the dreaded Crocs. The series of strips ran nationally this week with the premise that a small girl named 'Libby' (or 'Lib') would stand in for Pastis.
