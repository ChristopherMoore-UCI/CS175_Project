Neil Patrick Harris to host Oscars CBS had tried to sell him on taking over for David Letterman, Harris told Stern, but Harris had no desire to do a talk show. Harris told New York that he's looking forward to the challenge, since he's a big fan of "Takeaway." New York magazine said that a number of networks were bidding for Harris' services, and NBC won. The onetime "Doogie Howser" and "How I Met Your Mother" actor, who's impressed audiences with his turns on Broadway (in "Hedwig and the Angry Inch") and on TV awards shows (he'll be hosting the Oscars next year), told Howard Stern of his hopes earlier this year. CBS head Les Moonves was interested, Harris said at the time.
