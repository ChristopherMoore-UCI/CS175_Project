"Discoveries like this remind us that the waters off our shores are museums that speak to powerful events, in this case not only that tragic wreck, but to a time when racism and anger were set aside by the heroism of a crew who acted in the best traditions of the sea," said James Delgado, the director of maritime heritage for NOAA's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries. NOAA said in a news release that the discovery is an important one for the Chinese-American community in the San Francisco area. Scientists rediscovered its burial site recently after using sidescan sonar to confirm data first gathered last year. For more than 125 years, the City of Chester passenger ship has been at the bottom of San Francisco Bay. The City of Chester was carrying 90 people on a trip to Eureka, California, on August 22, 1888, when it was hit in the fog by the Oceanic, a ship arriving from Asia.
