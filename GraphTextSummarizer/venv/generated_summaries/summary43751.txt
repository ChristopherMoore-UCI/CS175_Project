"We owe Mrs. Thatcher a minute's silence," Whelan had told the BBC ahead of his side's FA Cup semifinal against Millwall on Saturday. "It is not my decision, it is for the FA to decide, but I would be in favor of wearing an armband out of respect to Mrs. Thatcher." But on Saturday, Wingate & Finchley will do something unique: They are the only football club in England to announce that they will hold a minute's silence for former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- MP for Finchley between 1959 and 1992 -- who died of a stroke at the age of 87. He argues that Thatcher saved football from itself. Only two other sports teams have declared they will allow a minute's silence before the game: top division rugby union clubs Exeter Chiefs and Saracens, which is also found in Thatcher's old Finchley constituency.
