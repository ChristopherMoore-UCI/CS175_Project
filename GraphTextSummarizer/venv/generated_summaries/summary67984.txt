" A powerful blast CNN's Reza Sayah said the blast appeared to be "the most powerful bomb attack that we've seen here in central Cairo in recent memory." Speaking from near the scene of the blast, he said the attack will probably intensify the fight between Egypt's military-backed government and the groups that oppose it. A U.S. State Department official said that Washington is "aware of reports" that one of its citizens "has been detained in Egypt." Guards stationed in front of the headquarters in the Abdeen district of Cairo opened fire at the vehicle, and the explosion went off in the building's vicinity rather than inside, he told state news agency Egynews. It was followed by two smaller explosions near police stations in the Cairo area, one of which killed one person. Friday is a holiday in Egypt, so the police headquarters is unlikely to have been as busy as it would have been on a weekday.
