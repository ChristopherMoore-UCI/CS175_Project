A BMW sport utility vehicle crashed through the roof of the family's garage in Escondido, California, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. What remains, according to Strother, is "a hole big enough to drive a BMW SUV through," though he believes there is little overall structural damage to the garage. The driver has not been located, Lt. Eric Skaja of the Escondido police told CNN by phone, and the automobile is a dealer loaner car. The Strothers' house sits below street level, so an out-of-control car that careened off the roadway could land on top of the garage. " Police and firefighters stood by while a tow truck pulled the luxury SUV through the ceiling, into the garage, and dragged it out and across the driveway using the tow truck cables.
