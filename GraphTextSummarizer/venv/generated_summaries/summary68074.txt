Only 49% of children in Camden graduate from high school, one of the lowest rates in the state, according to the New Jersey Department of Education. " In addition to promoting education, Jones makes it mandatory that children commit to 200 hours of community service a year. You have to be on point." Jones also stresses education, as kids in the program have to keep a C average in school. "I don't think people really understand how important it is to have these children succeed as far as graduating from high school," Jones said. "Whether you need it for work, you need it for school, you need discipline, period," said Jones, 40.
