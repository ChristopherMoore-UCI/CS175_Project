Parents messages to anti-vaxxers One other measles case has been reported in suburban Cook County; it isn't clear if that case is connected to the Palatine cases. People who have not had the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine were told this week to stay away from the Palatine day care center and from others who have not been vaccinated for 21 days. Three more babies who attended a Chicago-area day care center are confirmed to have the measles, bringing the number of infant measles patients linked to the business to five, the Cook County Department of Public Health said Saturday. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine generally is not given to children under the age of 1. The day care center said that starting Monday, it will require all employees working in its infant rooms to be vaccinated against the measles -- an effort to prevent exposure to children who are too young to receive the vaccine.
