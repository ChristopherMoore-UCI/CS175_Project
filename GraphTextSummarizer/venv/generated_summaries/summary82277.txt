-- South Korea will conduct naval fire drills near a flashpoint with the North that resulted in the deaths of four people, military officials said Thursday. North Korea Thursday accused the South's new defense minister, Kim Kwan-jin, of "going reckless like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger," state-run KCNA reported. Tensions mounted between the Koreas on November 23, when North Korea shelled the island, which lies in South Korean territory. The South Korean joint chiefs said the drills will be carried out in the presence of officials from the Military Armistice Committee and representatives from U.N. party members to ensure that the exercise is lawful and follows rules of the armistice. The North has accused the South of provoking the attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters.
