-- A military prosecutor said Bradley Manning acted as a "determined insider" in leaking classified information about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and should be locked up for 60 years at least, but the Army private's lawyer contended he can be rehabilitated and should not "rot in jail." " Morrow asked that Manning, 25, serve a minimum sentence of six decades behind bars, saying his actions created grave risk, disrupted diplomatic missions and endangered lives. He faces up to 90 years behind bars for the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history. He avoided a potential life sentence when Lind rejected charges that his actions aided the enemy. The two sides delivered their final sentencing arguments to Col. Denise Lind, the judge who convicted Manning at trial and will now determine his punishment.
