He told Politico recently he thinks Republicans can win a third or more of the African-American vote in 2016 if the party embraces his method of advocating for education and criminal justice reform among other efforts to address poverty and unemployment. -- It might not be the term that Republican Party leaders prefer, but Sen. Rand Paul had a choice word about the GOP's brand: It "sucks. " Following Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential loss, in which he carried only 6% of the black vote, the Republican National Committee has also attempted to retool its outreach by opening up multiple offices in urban areas and hiring more staff specifically tasked with targeting African-American voters. The Republican Party brand sucks and so people don't want to be a Republican and for 80 years, African-Americans have had nothing to do with Republicans," the Kentucky Republican said, according to The Hill. Earlier this month, Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that "the biggest mistake" Republicans have made in the past several decades is not aggressively courting African-American votes.
