-- Several police officials and politicians are pointing fingers at New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio after two New York City police officers were murdered on Saturday, following weeks of protests against police treatment of minorities in New York and around the country. Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned the killings on Saturday night, calling the double-murder a "heinous attack" that "was an attack on our entire city," which he said "tears at the foundation of our society." Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat who represents parts of New York City, lauded those comments and said de Blasio and protest leaders have tried to "bring people together" to discuss minority communities' concerns about the criminal justice system. Ray Kelly, a former New York City police commissioner, also knocked de Blasio for not standing with police officers, accusing him of running an anti-police election campaign when he campaigned against the stop and frisk policies. Former New York City mayor and one-time Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani appeared to sympathize with de Blasio on Sunday, instead dragging in President Barack Obama. "Maybe, just maybe, they should spend the next four months not talking about police hatred, but talking about what they are going to do about bringing down crime in the community," he said, adding that it's police officers and not Obama, Holder or any mayors who are saving lives.
