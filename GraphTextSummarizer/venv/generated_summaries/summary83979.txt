"It was just like in a film," helicopter pilot Ludwig Louwagie told the Belga news agency. Sekkaki is considered one of Belgium's most dangerous criminals, Interpol said, with more than 16 convictions for violence, including bank robbery and kidnapping. The escapees, who include a man considered to be one of the country's most dangerous criminals, robbed a bank, a gas station and two storage facilities, said the Bruges police spokesman Sunday. The jailbreak prompted Interpol to issue an international alert to police around the world to be on the lookout for the men. Jailbreaks by helicopter are becoming "far too common" worldwide, Interpol Secretary-General Ronald Noble said.
