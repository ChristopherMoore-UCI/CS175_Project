Mother: 'I won't stop fighting' for daughter Complications after tonsil surgery Jahi was declared brain dead December 12, three days after tonsil surgery. The judge has ruled that Jahi will remain on life support at least until December 30. Doctors say people don't wake up from Jahi's situation and that in her arguments, Winkfield has pointed to cases in which the patient had brain activity. "We have the deepest sympathy for Jahi's mother, who wishes her daughter was alive; but the ventilator cannot reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that Jahi will ever come back to life," Dr. David Durand, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, said in a statement Monday. -- A judge has concluded that 13-year-old Jahi McMath, who suffered complications after tonsil surgery, is brain dead.
