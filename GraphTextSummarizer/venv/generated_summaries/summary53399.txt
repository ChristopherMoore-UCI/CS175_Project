The controversy came just weeks after Huang publicly slammed the show's producers in a lengthy New York Magazine piece, accusing the network of distorting his memoir into a "cornstarch story about Asian-Americans resembling moo goo gai pan" in order to make it more appealing to white audiences. Arissa Oh, a history professor at Boston College, says the term is painful because "it aligns with Asian Americans always having to negotiate the fear of being perceived as a perpetual foreigner. As Oh explains, "I sort of feel like 'fob' is a family issue, you know -- like internal to Asian Americans? When the show was announced last May, some Asian Americans worried openly -- what if the show inadvertently encourages people to toss the phrase around in an offensive way? The phrase "fresh off the boat," typically shortened to the acronym "fob," is a loaded phrase many young American immigrants will recognize.
