The strategist in charge of electing a Republican Senate majority thanked Democrats on Thursday for keeping President Barack Obama on the sidelines and building their campaigns around women's issues instead of making an economic argument. "They were so focused on independents that they forgot they had a base," Collins said of Democratic campaigns. Collins and NRSC communications director Brad Dayspring agreed that Obama was a political lightning rod for Democrats â€” especially late in the campaign. A number of Democrats, especially those in the party's progressive and labor wings of the party, have highlighted Tuesday winners like Al Franken in Minnesota, Gary Peters in Michigan and Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire as candidates who talked about women's issues but also weaved the debate into a larger economic theme. Rob Collins, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told reporters in a postmortem session that Democrats "sidelined their best messenger" by running from Obama.
