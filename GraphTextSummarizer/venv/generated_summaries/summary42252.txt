People might also ride their bikes, or even walk, to work, once the places formerly used to house cars (that is, parking lots and garages) have been replaced with green housing, parks and open spaces for people. Fire engines, ambulances and other emergency vehicles could still use city streets and would get there all the sooner for having less traffic to wade through. And I haven't even mentioned the global effects of getting cars out of cities, among them: Reducing carbon pollution would slow climate change and habitat destruction. No parking: Studies show that on average 30% of the traffic in cities is the result of people just cruising to find parking. Wasted time: On the whole, cars are a lousy way to get people around.
