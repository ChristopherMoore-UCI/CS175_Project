Now in 2014, the country's advertising market is the world's second largest, perhaps thanks in part  to Taiwan-born Shenan Chuang, CEO of Ogilvy and Mather Greater China.

When Shenan Chuang started out in the advertising industry in the 1980s, Chinese adverts were often dismissed as mere propaganda, unable to compete with powerful Western agencies. So he left, and so did a group of senior people. Learn: How DVF conquered fashion world Inspire: Sandberg: Positive images spur change
