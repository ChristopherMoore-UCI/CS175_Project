Indeed, even today, the combination of the dramatic loss of global status, the perceived dismembering of its country by foreign powers, and the economic hardship many Russians experienced in the transition to the political system of their country's former enemy has produced a toxic cocktail for much of Russian society. And so it was not unreasonable for those who remembered at least one global conflict -- World War II -- to feel a little anxiety about state disintegration and the potential spread of nuclear weapons, among other things. And while it may be no comfort to the people of the former Yugoslavia, or the victims of the genocide in Rwanda, for example, the absence of such confrontation has contributed to the steady decline of conflict worldwide, as well as easing the considerable fears over a possible nuclear exchange and conflict. (And it is also being fought mostly through non-conventional, economic and information warfare, rather than an enormous buildup of hard power, although a more conventional conflict has raged in the east of Ukraine). It is easy for those who live in Europe and North America to forget that this "cold war" did not feel that way at all in swathes of Africa, Latin America and the Far East, where regional conflicts and civil wars both fed and were exacerbated by the wider tensions between the world's two great power blocks.
