As China becomes a bigger factor in Nepal, refugees from neighboring Tibet say they are being squeezed. For decades, Nepal has been a safe haven for Tibetans who escape China. "Since China has given Nepal a lot of money, the Nepali government doesn't let Tibetans do much of anything. The numbers of Tibetans coming to Nepal has declined dramatically since 2008, even as reports of unrest and self-immolations by protesting Tibetans continue to leak out of Tibet. The Nepalese government agrees to allow Tibetans transit through Nepal to India, while UNHCR agrees to facilitate that.
