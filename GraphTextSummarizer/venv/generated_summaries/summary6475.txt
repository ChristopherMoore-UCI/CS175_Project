The Essex County, New Jersey, grand jury issued its "no bill" Tuesday, said Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn A. Murray. -- A New Jersey grand jury declined to indict a mother accused of child endangerment for allegedly allowing her 5-year-old daughter to use a tanning bed, resulting in leg burns, prosecutors said Tuesday. New Jersey law bans children under 14 years old from using tanning salons. Prosecutors had accused Krentcil of allowing her daughter inside a stand-up tanning booth at a salon in the northern New Jersey town of Nutley. Patricia Krentcil, 44, of Nutley, New Jersey, pleaded not guilty last May to second-degree child endangerment and has been free on $25,000 bail.
