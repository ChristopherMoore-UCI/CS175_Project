Hoffman withdraws a total of $1,200 from an automated teller machine in six transactions at a supermarket near his West Village home, two law enforcement sources say, citing bank records. The day before he was found dead in a Manhattan apartment, actor Philip Seymour Hoffman went to his favorite coffee shop for a four-shot espresso. That night, he met two others for dinner at a West Village restaurant. 5 p.m. -- Hoffman is spotted walking along Greenwich Street by Paul Pabst, executive producer of the syndicated "Dan Patrick Show." In New York's Greenwich Village neighborhood, where Hoffman lived, it was common to see him riding a bicycle and walking his children to the public school they attended.
