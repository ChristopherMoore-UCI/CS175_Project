It's not clear exactly what this deal would entail, but possibilities include Facebook Chat over a browser to cell phones, and video chat among Facebook friends. According to All Things D's Kara Swisher, Facebook and Skype are about to announce a partnership that includes "integration of SMS, voice chat and Facebook Connect." "The Social Network" movie hit theaters, CEO Mark Zuckerberg donated $100 million on Oprah and, if rumors are correct, the world's biggest social-networking site will be partnering with online phone service Skype to help you chat with your Facebook friends through the site. The question is: Do people actually want to interact with their Facebook friends on a more intimate level? Skype's appeal overseas also would make Facebook much more attractive abroad.
