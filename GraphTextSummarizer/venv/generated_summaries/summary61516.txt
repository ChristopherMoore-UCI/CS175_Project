First lady Michelle Obama dazzled in a Jason Wu original gown. The first lady accessorized with diamond chandelier earrings, a white gold and diamond ring and a stack of diamond bangles by jeweler Loree Rodkin. They include Cuban-American designers Isabel Toledo, who designed her yellow lace inauguration ensemble; Narciso Rodriguez, designer of the red and black dress she wore on election night; and designer Thakoon Panichgul, originally from Thailand, who designed the floral dress she wore the evening her husband accepted the Democratic nomination for president. In choosing Wu, who is originally from Taiwan, Obama continues a tradition of wearing American designers who hail from other countries. InStyle magazine Fashion Director Hal Rubenstein appreciates Obama's straightforward approach to fashion.
