The Russian is yet to win a grand slam and wasted another opportunity to end that particular hoodoo when losing to compatriot Svetlana Kuznetsova in the French Open final last month. She had looked a spent force last year, but has enjoyed some better results this year and comes into the tournament as the 17th seed. A potential third round showdown with top seed Dinara Safina will test her to the limit, although she would undoubtedly have the fans' support should that encounter materialize. Former world number one Jelena Jankovic has slipped down the world rankings this year and she too has yet to win a major, while 13th-seed Ana Ivanovic has not shown anything like the form that saw her win last year's French Open. -- There is a general consensus that women's tennis needs a new name to ignite some excitement into it and, at this week's Wimbledon, it does appear likely that the Williams sisters will once again be the ones to beat at the grass-court grand slam.
