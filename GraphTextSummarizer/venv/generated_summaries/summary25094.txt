It's a gulf that breeds suspicion and mistrust, a gulf that undermines the very legitimacy of our system of justice. Brown's shooting death ignited two weeks of violent protests last summer in Ferguson and rekindled the national debate on race and the criminal justice system. They chanted the names of other black men and women killed by police and quoted civil rights hero the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. His daughter, the Rev. Bernice King, had hoped people would rise above anger and make history. The head of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which for decades has fought racial injustice in the Deep South, said Ferguson underscores a flawed and biased justice system. On the street in front of Ferguson's police station on Monday night, the tension crackled as hundreds of people awaited a grand jury's decision and chanted demands for an indictment.
