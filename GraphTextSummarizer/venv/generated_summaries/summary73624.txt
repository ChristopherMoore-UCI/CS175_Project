" The judge ordered "the state" to turn over Saldate's personnel records to Milke's lawyers, after which "a police official" must state under oath that everything has been disclosed and nothing has been "omitted, lost or destroyed." Once this is done, a district court must order Milke's release unless prosecutors tell the court within 30 days that they plan to retry her soon. A day after seeing Santa Claus at a mall, young Christopher Milke asked his mother if he could go again. The detective, Armando Saldate, said the friend told him that Debra Milke was involved in a plot to kill her son. "In the balance hangs the life of Milke," Kozinski said, explaining the importance of his decision to overturn her convictions. In fact, "no other witnesses or direct evidence (linked) Milke to the crime" other than Saldate's testimony.
