"It's too early to know about the Masters, and I will continue to be evaluated and work closely with my doctors," said Woods, who has won at Augusta on four occasions. In a statement on his website, Woods revealed he telephoned Palmer directly to tell him he would be unable to defend his title in Orlando. Woods, 38, tweaked his back at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami a week later and is facing a race against time to be ready for the U.S. Masters, which starts on April 10. Woods announced Tuesday that he will not play at the event because of a persistent back problem which has troubled him since last year. Tiger Woods has raised fears he may be forced to miss the U.S. Masters at Augusta after withdrawing from the Arnold Palmer Invitational.
