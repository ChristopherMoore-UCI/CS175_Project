From the tomb, the pope and cardinals will go in procession through the Basilica and into the Square, accompanied by the processional chant "Laudes Regiae." Catholic tradition holds that St. Peter was martyred in the square, which was Nero's Circus. Five hundred priests will hand out Communion in St. Peter's Square and in Via Conciliazione (the road leading straight out from the Vatican towards the Castel Sant'Angelo liveshot location.) -- Pope Francis will officially be inaugurated Tuesday as the leader of the world's 1.2-billion member Catholic Church. Pope Francis leaves the Santa Marta residence, where cardinals stayed for the conclave and where he is living until the papal apartments are ready.
