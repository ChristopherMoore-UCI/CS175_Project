The link between black vulnerability and racial profiling -- of setting in one's collective imagination an image of black men as bad people who are liable to commit mayhem at any moment, and who must therefore always be suspected of wrong and subject to arbitrary forms of control and surveillance -- is evident in the pileup of black bodies, from Amadou Diallo to Sean Bell, that testify to the force of police to impose lethal limits on black survival. How dare black folk believe that, regardless of their station or privilege, they have permission to speak back -- or speak black -- to state-enforced authority, one that, not a decade ago, routinely ravaged black communities in blatant displays of wanton aggression. Gates rubbed up against the unspoken code that enforces black silence and often violently compels black compliance. To Gates' credit, he realizes that racial profiling happens regularly to poor black folk, and he has pledged to do something about it. It is for good reason that police brutality is a constant concern for black folk; the stakes are often high and harmful.
