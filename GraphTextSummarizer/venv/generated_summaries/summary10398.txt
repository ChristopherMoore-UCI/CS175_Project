They improved in the second round where high winds caused carnage on the 7,400 yard course, which has been toughened up by designer Gil Hanse. -- Tiger Woods led the world's elite in their fightback against the 'Blue Monster' Saturday as a six-under 66 left the 14-time major winner in touching distance of an unlikely victory in the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Florida. Woods shot a 65 in the third round of the Honda before suffering his injury problems in the final round. Others did not fare so well in the third round, with Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy slipping off the pace with a three-over 75 after being well-placed at the start of the round. Woods, who almost did not start the tournament after suffering back spasms at the Honda Classic last week, opened with a four-over 76 Thursday and his chances of defending the title looked slim.
