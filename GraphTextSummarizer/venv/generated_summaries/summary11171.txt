" It's worth recalling that many gospels were composed in the decades, even centuries, after Jesus -- not only the four that Christians acknowledge. It suggests that Jesus was not only married but had two children, and that Mary Magdalene -- long viewed as a close friend of Jesus -- was indeed the Virgin Mary. This may sound vaguely reminiscent of "The Da Vinci Code," which Dan Brown published in 2003, but in truth questions about the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene have been around for a long time, and the "Lost Gospel" only adds to the legend. The idea that Jesus may have been married to Mary Magdalene was popularized by the wonderful Greek novelist Nikos Kazantzakis in "The Last Temptation of Christ" in 1953. It's obvious that Mary Magdalene was close to Jesus.
