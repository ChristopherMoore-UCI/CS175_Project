-- A man who shot and killed two people at a fiber optics company in New Mexico Monday before turning the gun on himself has been identified as 37-year-old Robert Reza, a police spokesman told CNN Tuesday. Adrienne Basciano, 49, was in guarded condition Tuesday at the University of New Mexico Hospital, said Hamby. Michele Turner, 36, died at the scene and Sharon Cunningham, 47, died at the University of New Mexico Hospital, Hamby said. "We believe this incident to be a domestic violence workplace situation," Albuquerque Police Chief Ray Schultz said Monday. Police responded to a 911 call Monday morning from Emcore Company that multiple shots had been fired.
