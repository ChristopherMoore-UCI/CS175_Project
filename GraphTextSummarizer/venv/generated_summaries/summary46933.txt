"We all want to promote healthy pregnancies by providing pregnant women struggling with a drug or alcohol dependency with the opportunity to seek the best possible prenatal care and substance abuse treatment," Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, wrote in a letter to Haslam this week. "As Governor Haslam should see, the measure is about punishing women â€” mainly poor minority women â€” not getting them into treatment or protecting their babies." SB1391 is constitutionally unsound and enacting this law would threaten the health and well-being of Tennessee women and their families. "He can show he truly cares about protecting pregnant women, children and families by vetoing the bill, as specialists in obstetric medicine and drug addiction, as well as women's rights groups have urged," the editorial read. "One of our primary concerns is making sure women have healthy pregnancies and then healthy children, and the big concern here is that this is going to frighten women away from the treatment they need for a healthy pregnancy, as well as treatment for any substance abuse issues that they have.
