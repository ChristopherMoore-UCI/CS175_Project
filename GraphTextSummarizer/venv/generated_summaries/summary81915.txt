Here's how the Oscars have fared in recent years: -- 2011: 37.9 million viewers / 11.8 adult demo rating ("King's Speech") -- 2010: 41.7 million viewers / 13.3 adult demo rating ("Hurt Locker") -- 2009: 36.3 million viewers / 12.1 adult demo rating ("Slumdog Millionaire") -- 2008: 32 million viewers / 10.7 adult demo rating ("No Country for Old Men") -- Among adults 18-49, there was no contest: Grammys had a 14.1 rating to Oscars 11.7. Even with few box-office heavyweights in contention for top categories, Sunday night's 84th Annual Academy Awards telecast rose slightly in the ratings from last year. Did Billy Crystal rescue the Oscars? If last night's viewership tally is sustained in Nielsen's national ratings release tomorrow, it will mark the first year the Grammys drew a larger crowd than the Oscars since Nielsen started its current ratings system in 1992.
