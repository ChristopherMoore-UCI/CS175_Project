-- Lindsay Lohan's complaint that working long hours caused her to collapse from exhaustion triggered union investigations of the "Liz & Dick" production, two unions said. "We have had union representatives on the set since last Friday and will continue to monitor the hours and working conditions there." "We have thoroughly investigated this matter and our business representatives have visited, and will continue to visit, the set of Liz & Dick," SAG-AFTRA said in a statement late Wednesday. "The IATSE is on top of the situation on the set of Lifetime's 'Liz and Dick,' " IATSE Director Mike Miller said. " Union contract rules limit the number of hours actors and crew members can work on a movie or television production.
