"There have also been many reports of attacks on archaeological lands," the statement said, adding that Hawass has asked all of the second heads within the ministry to prepare reports for each site in Egypt. The Tuesday blog post said that Hawass "would like to clarify earlier statements in which he announced that nothing was missing (from the museum)." "Dr. Hawass stated he hopes tourists from around the world will soon return to Egypt," the statement said. Hawass said Sunday that at least 17 artifacts were missing from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Hawass has formed a committee to prepare reports on what, if anything, is missing.
