"We are following with sorrow and concern what is happening in Lampedusa," Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said. The incident is the latest in a number of tragic ends in what has become a steady flow of people who set sail from Africa -- especially Tunisia -- to the Italian island of Lampedusa. Many of the survivors came from African countries, such as Eritrea, Somalia and Niger, the Italian daily newspaper, Corriere della Sera said. The boat was carrying about 300 people, survivors told rescue officials, according to Italian Coast Guard spokesman Cosimo Nicastro. Though owned by Italy, Lampedusa's closest shore is Tunisia.
