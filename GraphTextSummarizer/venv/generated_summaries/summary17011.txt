-- Three American college students detained in Cairo since Monday night were released from police custody Friday and were headed to the airport to return to the United States, an attorney for one of the men said. Derrik Sweeney's father, Kevin Sweeney, told CNN his flight is scheduled to leave Cairo at 10:30 a.m. Saturday (3:30 a.m. ET) and he will arrive in his home state of Missouri on Saturday night. Sweeney, 19, is a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri; Porter, 19, is from Glenside, Pennsylvania, and attends Drexel University in Philadelphia; and Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana, goes to Indiana University. The men will board three separate commercial flights to return home, according to Joy Sweeney, the mother of Derrik Sweeney. Also Friday, an Egyptian-American filmmaker arrested amid ongoing protests in Cairo was released, her lawyer said.
