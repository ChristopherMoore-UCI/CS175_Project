Jolie's choice carries risks along with benefits Women with breast cancer and ovarian cancer in their families should talk to their doctors about the desirability of testing. By letting us all know about her decision to get genetic testing for susceptibility to breast cancer -- and then, when the results came back positive, to have a double mastectomy -- she has bravely helped inform women with a history of breast cancer in their families about the need to seek out testing and counseling. By making public her story about how she dealt with the high risk of getting breast cancer, Angelina Jolie has done a real service for women around the world. Many insurance companies do not cover the cost of genetic testing for cancer and other conditions. The cost of the breast cancer test that Jolie had is prohibitive for many women.
