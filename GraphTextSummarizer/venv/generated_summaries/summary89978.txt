Prosecutor Alberto Nisman became a controversial figure when he accused Argentina's President and foreign minister of covering up Iran's involvement in a 1994 Buenos Aires bombing. Nisman was set to testify to lawmakers behind closed doors on a report alleging that President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner,  Foreign Minister Héctor Timerman and other officials had covered up Iran's involvement in the bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association building. No cause of death has been released, but according to the Buenos Aires Herald, Security Secretary Sergio Berni and Anibal Fernández, secretary-general to the presidency, said there are signs that Nisman's death was a suicide. I can't venture a hypothesis; that wouldn't be prudent," Viviana Fein, the federal prosecutor leading the investigation into Nisman's death, told reporters in Buenos Aires. Fernández de Kirchner and Timerman wanted to cover up Iran's involvement in order to boost trade -- specifically, oil imports and grain exports -- with the Islamic republic, Nisman alleged last week, according to the Herald.
