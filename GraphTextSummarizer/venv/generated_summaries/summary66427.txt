Four suspected U.S. drone strikes have pounded Pakistan's tribal region since the American military killed terror leader Osama bin Laden, actions that signal an uptick in the U.S. fight against Islamic militants. "I think it's game back on." North Waziristan is one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan, and Datta Khel has a strong presence of militants, Roggio said. Mohmand is believed to be a hideout for Taliban fighters and al Qaeda-linked militants fleeing last year's military operation in the district of South Waziristan and ongoing U.S. drone strikes in North Waziristan. He emphasized that the Pakistani military hasn't taken on militants in the Datta Khel region, which Roggio calls a "snake pit" and a "known al Qaeda hub. Roggio said the Pakistani Taliban represents a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based.
