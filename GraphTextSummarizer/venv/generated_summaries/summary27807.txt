Working with the telecommunications company Qualcomm, the MIT researchers created a device -- or, as the researchers call them, "traces" -- that could track a piece of trash using both GPS and cell phone towers. Before that increased awareness could be created, however, the scientists needed to devise a way to track pieces of trash, some for hundreds of miles and for up to six months. The tracking is not part of some top-secret government program to spy on garbage, but rather the brainchild of MIT researchers who wanted to learn if society could more efficiently dispose of what it throws out. Even though the study has not been completed, the MIT group sees its efforts as a step toward better informing Americans about trash. And a pair of worn Asics running shoes is still logging miles even after being dropped in a bin for used shoes.
