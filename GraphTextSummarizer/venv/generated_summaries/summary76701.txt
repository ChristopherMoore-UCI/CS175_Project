In 1970 he was named the NCAA individual cross country champion, and he helped his California State University, Fullerton cross country team grab a NCAA Division II title the year after. Every year around this time, his phone starts to ring off the hook as he passes another milestone in his "running streak" -- the number of consecutive days he's logged at least a mile. You're trying to finish your run up pretty strong, whether it be a mile, half mile or 10 minutes from your house. That became a little bit of a goal. I hurt it running and when I got back I went to the doctor and he was able to give me a little bit of relief.
