During the visit, the Queen met the show's prop and costume makers and set designers, as well as actors Kit Harrington (Jon Snow), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), Conleth Hill (Lord Varys) and Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark). "Game of Thrones" has been filmed in Northern Ireland since 2009, contributing millions of dollars to the local economy during the past five years, providing thousands of jobs, and encouraging tourism to a region once bitterly divided by sectarian violence. Queen Elizabeth came face to face with royalty of a very different kind when she met the cunning Cersei -- otherwise known as actress Lena Headey -- on a visit to the "Game of Thrones" set in Northern Ireland on Tuesday. "Game of Thrones" showrunner David Benioff and writer and producer Daniel Weiss guided the royal party around the Paint Hall studio in the city's Titanic Quarter. The monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, were touring Belfast when they called in at the sound stage where the hit show -- famed for its violent scenes and frequent nudity -- is filmed.
