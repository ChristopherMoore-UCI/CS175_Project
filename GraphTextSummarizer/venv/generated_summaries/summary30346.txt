-- The body of a man whom authorities described as a disgruntled vendor who shot two people, one fatally, at a Long Island business last week was found dead Monday, according to Nassau County Police. Sang Ho Kim, about age 63, was identified through fingerprints after his remains were found in a river near Bear Mountain in Rockland County, New York, according to Detective Michael Bitsko. The shooting occurred on Wednesday at Savenergy in East Garden City on Long Island, prompting a widespread manhunt that ended with the discovery of Kim's body. A passerby found the remains Monday and contacted authorities. An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death.
