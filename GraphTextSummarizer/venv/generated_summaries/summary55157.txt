-- The United Nations finds a tiny glimmer of good news in Afghanistan in a new report out Wednesday, saying that violence against civilians fell in the first half of the year. Eighty percent of the attacks against civilians are by anti-government forces such as the Taliban, the U.N. said, while 10% are by government forces. He accused "the invaders" and the government of killing, injuring and jailing civilians, and said the U.N. report did not include them. But the drop does little more than to bring levels of violence down to what they were in 2010, says the report from the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan. But even with attacks down 15% compared with the first six months of 2011, violence is taking a "devastating toll on civilians," the United Nations said.
