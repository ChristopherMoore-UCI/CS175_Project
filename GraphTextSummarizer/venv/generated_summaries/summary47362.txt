Citing initial reports, US Airways spokesman Todd Lehmacher said the commercial airliner's pilot decided to abort takeoff after the tire issue. -- A US Airways plane blew a tire during takeoff Thursday evening at Philadelphia's airport, an airline spokesman said, with witnesses recalling seeing the plane "bounce" before screeching to a halt. Philadelphia Fire Department Deputy Chief Gary Loesch said crews sprayed "a protective foam blanket" around where "hydraulic fluid ... was leaking from the front landing gear," saying this was only done as a precaution. Flight 1702 was scheduled to take off at 5:50 p.m. and arrive in Fort Lauderdale about three hours later, according to US Airways' website, though Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said the incident took place around 6:25 p.m. The airport noted there were departure delays of about one hour, with airport spokeswoman Victoria Lupica saying arrival delays stretched up to two hours.
