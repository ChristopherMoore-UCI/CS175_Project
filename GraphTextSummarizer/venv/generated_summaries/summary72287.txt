In the days leading to liberation, she and her mother, Hinda, had hidden under the wooden planks of a barrack as Nazi guards evacuated the camp, forcing prisoners on death marches and shooting those who could not march; she had witnessed musselmen, skeletal figures inhaling their last breaths, collapsing upon each other in a pile of death. The U.N. urged "... member states to develop educational programmes that will inculcate future generations with the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help prevent future acts of genocide." The world continues to suffer from too much hate-driven violence, from this month's terror attacks in Paris, to genocides in Syria, Darfur, Rwanda and Bosnia, all case studies that the lessons of the Holocaust 70 years on remain as relevant as ever. Just as my mother and her child survivor friends sought understanding as they tried to come to terms with the unimaginable, students around the globe must be engaged in education about the Holocaust and the lessons it holds for humanity -- because, tragically, the liberation of Auschwitz failed to deliver an end to terrorism and genocide. The Russian Red Army may have have physically liberated Rena, but mentally she remained imprisoned, still feeling that she was surrounded by death.
