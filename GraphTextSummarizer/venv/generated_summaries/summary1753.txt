The arts-and-craft beads, which have been selling since April at major U.S. retail stores under the name "Aqua Dots," have also been distributed in Australia under the name "Bindeez Beads." The toy had been named toy of the year in Australia and recently crested Wal-Mart's list of top 12 Christmas toys. Anyone with Aqua Dots at home should return the product to the company, CPSC spokeswoman Julie Vallese said. The CPSC said a boy nearly 2 years old "swallowed several dozen beads. China has suspended exports of the Aqua Dots toys contaminated with a chemical that can convert to a powerful "date rape" drug, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Saturday.
