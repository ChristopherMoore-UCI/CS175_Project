Friday's announcement by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office did not say what the charges would be or who would be charged Dr. Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician when he died last summer, had planned to surrender to authorities Friday afternoon at the Los Angeles courthouse branch near Los Angeles International Airport, but that changed when prosecutors delayed filing charges. Los Angeles prosecutors could file charges at any time, however, setting up a scenario for Los Angeles police to find Murray on their own, arrest him and take him to jail. During the two nights before Jackson's death, Murray said, he put together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep. The doctor told Los Angeles police that he was with Jackson through the early morning hours of June 25 in an effort to help the pop star fall asleep, according to a police affidavit. Murray was hired last spring as Jackson prepared for his comeback concerts in London, England.
