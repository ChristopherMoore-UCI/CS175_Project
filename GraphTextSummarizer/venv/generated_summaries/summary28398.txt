When he was indicted in February 2008, Carter pleaded not guilty to a charge of criminal possession of a weapon, the district attorney's office said. Police officers said Carter and another man were smoking marijuana on a street, and the officers found a .40-caliber pistol in Carter's possession. Born and raised in New Orleans, Carter launched his solo career at age 16 with the release of "Tha Block is Hot" in 1999. The Grammy Award-winning artist, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, is due for sentencing in February. Hip-hop artist Lil Wayne pleaded guilty Thursday to attempted criminal possession of a weapon, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.
