In May, we got to meet Egyptian para-table tennis player Ibrahim Hamadto, a man who didn't let a life-altering accident stand in the way of his dreams. Growing up in northeastern Egypt, Hamadto (also spelled Hamato) was a big fan of soccer and table tennis. Almost 250 years later, in the midst of a war that threatened to tear the U.S. apart, President Abraham Lincoln declared that the entire nation would annually honor the last Thursday of November as a "day of Thanksgiving and Praise." In early March, a young woman named Katheryn Deprill posted a message on the social media platform asking for help in finding her birth mother, who left Deprill in the restroom of a Burger King more than 20 years ago. But here's the interesting thing about Thanksgiving: The idea to set aside a day for humble reflection and gratitude was itself inspired by troubling times.
