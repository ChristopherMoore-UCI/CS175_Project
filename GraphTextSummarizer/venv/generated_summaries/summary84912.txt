The possibility of closure for relatives of the passengers and crew of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 may have emerged from the depths of the southern Indian Ocean on Saturday in the form of an unconfirmed pulse signal. Also found Saturday -- spotted by a Chinese air force search plane -- were white objects floating near the search area, about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) from Perth, Australia, Xinhua said. On March 24, Malaysia Airlines and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that the plane had gone down in the southern Indian Ocean and that there were no survivors. Tom Wood, a brother of American passenger Philip Wood, said his family would have no comment until authorities provide concrete evidence. On Monday, dozens of Chinese relatives visited a Kuala Lumpur temple.
