But when Del Rey falls, she really lays out: The flimsy melody propping up ''National Anthem'' collapses under its embarrassing faux-rap, and ''Radio'' takes a ''fame is hard'' stance normally reserved for "Real Housewives." "Born to Die's" wild swings between unqualified stunners and bizarre miscues provide no real answers, but they do produce plenty more chum for the message-board sharks. After six months of fevered conjecture over the very existence of Lana Del Rey, the heavy-lidded chanteuse whose hypnotic ''Video Games'' fiercely divided the blogosphere last summer, it's still not clear exactly what the argument is. The rest play out like ''Summertime Sadness,'' which boasts both alluring melodic menace and lyrical eye-rollers like ''Telephone wires above all / Sizzlin' like your stare.'' Or is it just because she's scored a deluge of prerelease hype that, as her widely panned January 14 appearance on "Saturday Night Live" showed, might not be deserved?
