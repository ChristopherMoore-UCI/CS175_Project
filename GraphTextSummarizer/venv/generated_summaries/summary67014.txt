"The NHL has known or should have known of this growing body of scientific evidence and its compelling conclusion that hockey players who sustain repetitive concussive events, sub-concussive events and/or brain injuries are at significantly greater risk of neuro-cognitive illness and disabilities both during their hockey careers and later in life. "While the subject matter is very serious, we are completely satisfied with the responsible manner in which the League and the Players' Association have managed player safety over time, including with respect to head injuries and concussions," said the NHL statement. The lawsuit says the league hasn't done enough to protect players from concussions in a sport where physical contact is common and often spills over into heated argument. "We have, on our own, a long history, going back to 1997, of taking concussions very seriously," NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said earlier this year. The deal, which also includes multimedia rights, will last 12 years and is the largest in NHL history.
