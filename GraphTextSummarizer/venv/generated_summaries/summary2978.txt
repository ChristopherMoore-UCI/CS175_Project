The surprise snowstorm stranded passengers throughout the Northeast on a number of domestic airlines, including several flights that tested federal ground delay rules. Airlines have dramatically cut lengthy ground delays since the rules were finalized as carriers will now cancel flights rather than risk fines. The plane sat on the tarmac for nearly five hours, according to transportation officials, who alleged PIA made no effort to let passengers off or ask airport officials for help. A consumer protection regulation established in 2010 under pressure from consumer advocates and Congress requires domestic airlines to give passengers a chance to deplane if a ground delay exceeds three hours. The U.S. government on Wednesday imposed its first fine on an international carrier for keeping passengers aboard a plane during an extended ground delay, slapping a $150,000 penalty on Pakistan International Airlines.
