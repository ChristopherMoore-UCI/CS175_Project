-- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday led jubilant legislators and soldiers discharged under the "don't ask, don't tell" policy in singing "God Bless America" to celebrate the upcoming repeal of the controversial law. The "don't ask, don't tell" policy enacted in 1993 banned openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service. she said, adding that the repeal measure will "change the law, improve the policy, make life better for many Americans, and make our country stronger." Once that potentially lengthy process is complete, Obama, Gates and Mullen will each have to certify that the repeal can move ahead without negatively affecting military readiness and unit cohesion. Pelosi, a California Democrat, said the military will be made stronger by including all Americans who want to serve without making gay and lesbian members lie about who they are.
