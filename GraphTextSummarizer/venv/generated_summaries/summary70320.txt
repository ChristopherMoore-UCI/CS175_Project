Sisul Hess, accused in more than 900 deaths, has denied the allegations, said Argentina's government-run Telam news agency. A co-pilot told the judge that Poch had said they "should have killed all" the subversives, Telam reported, and that he admitted "some responsibility" because "when you fly persons on board the responsibility lies with the pilot." An aviator told Torres that Poch had said at a restaurant in Indonesia in December 2003 that there were occasions in which people were thrown out of helicopters and airplanes because the armed forces were dealing with "terrorists," Telam said. Poch had been a navy pilot from 1976 until late 1980, Telam said. Torres traveled to Holland to question Poch's colleagues and others, Telam said.
