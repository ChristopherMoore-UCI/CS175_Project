I paraphrased what Thomas Paine once said: Voting is the right upon which all other rights are protected That's exactly why Ambassador Andrew Young, congressional scholar Norman J. Ornstein and Drum Major Institute Chairman Bill Wachtel founded WhyTuesday.org, why U.S. Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, and Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin, have introduced the Weekend Voting Act into Congress to move Election Day to Saturday and Sunday, and why I went to Iowa in December to ask our presidential candidates what they'd do to protect our right to vote. When Congress set out to pick a day for Americans to vote, ultimately settling on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November, voting could take two days:  a day to get to the county seat to vote and a day to get back for market day on Wednesday. To understand the benefits to democracy of weekend voting, all you need to do is look at  the nations with the highest voter turnout and realize they vote on weekends or national holidays. It's time the United States upgrades to a voting system 2.0, and we should start with weekend voting. And that's not because, as Mitt Romney suggested to me last month, we need great candidates to increase voter turnout.
