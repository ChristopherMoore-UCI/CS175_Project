U.S. seeks China's help against North Korean cyberattacks Sony executives knew that producing a movie about an attempt on the life of an existing world leader "would cause a backlash," the complaint says. The suits alleged Sony was negligent because it didn't prepare for a massive cyberattack despite warnings and previous security breaches. Former employees of Sony Pictures Entertainment have filed four lawsuits against the company following a massive security breach. Michael Corona and Christina Mathis's complaint put the situation in dramatic terms: "An epic nightmare, much better suited to a cinematic thriller than to real life, is unfolding in slow motion for Sony's current and former employees: Their most sensitive data including over 47,000 Social Security numbers, employment files including salaries, medical information, and anything else that their employer Sony touched, has been leaked to the public, and may even be in the hands of criminals." An FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques used by the Guardians of Peace in the Sony attack to previous North Korean cyberattacks.
