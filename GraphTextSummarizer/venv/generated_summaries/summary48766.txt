The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee, from those who knew the young woman to others who rallied behind the effort to find her. A man has been indicted on charges of kidnapping and murder in the case of the Tennessee woman, authorities announced Wednesday. "As this investigation continues, we are still asking for the public's help and support to help us continue to seek out justice regarding the disappearance of Holly Bobo," Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, told reporters. "Obviously, they're devastated," Gwyn said of the Bobo family. Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- turned out to hunt for clues in Decatur, Henderson, Henry, Carroll and Benton counties.
