According to phone records, Summer McStay made a call from her home phone at 2:11 p.m. February 4 regarding purchasing herbal medicine. On February 4, 2010, Chase Merritt received a phone call from Joseph McStay. Who would want to kill Joseph; his wife, Summer; and their two young kids, Gianni, 4, and Joseph Jr., 3? Investigators also found surveillance video showing a family of four matching the McStays' description crossing on foot into Mexico on February 8. So good, in fact, that Joseph was working on a deal that could have been worth $9 million, his father, Patrick McStay, said.
