"The thing we heard consistently (from focus groups) was 'I've never cared for characters as much as I've cared for Joel and Ellie,' " Naughty Dog creative director Neil Druckmann told CNN. "The Last of Us" similarly asks players to tackle a challenging question -- in the horrible circumstances in which many games are set, how do you find, and define, your humanity? Rather than relying on blood, gore and mayhem, a number of game developers are tapping into their inner emotions, inviting gamers along for adventures of the psyche. Recent releases "Tomb Raider" and "BioShock Infinite" evoked an emotional response by creating characters with which gamers could identify and empathize. Druckmann said he wants players to come away thinking about deep issues, such as the dynamics of relationships and what it takes to keep them alive.
