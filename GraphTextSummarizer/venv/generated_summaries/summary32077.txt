NVRQT, or "Never Quit," is both a campaign that supports kids in the fight against cancer and funds much needed research. As I travel the country for away games, I meet kids fighting cancer in almost every city. I couldn't help thinking of how I would feel if Hudson had to go through what I or my dad had to deal with fighting cancer. Together with Farrah, we decided pediatric cancer research would be our cause and our mantra would be never quit. I had visited hospitals on Red Sox trips and met a number of kids battling cancer.
