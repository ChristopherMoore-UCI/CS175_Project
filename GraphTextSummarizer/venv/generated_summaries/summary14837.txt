The floods caused $9.7 billion in damage to homes, roads, farms and other parts of the southwestern Asian country, according to estimates from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. -- Cases of disease are increasing in flood-ravaged Pakistan, but international relief funding for the disaster is drying up, the Oxfam aid organization said Friday. Last week, United States officials announced a $2 billion, multiyear security assistance package to help Pakistan fight extremists taking refuge in safe havens along its border with Afghanistan -- noting that the Pakistani military is stretched thin dealing with flood disaster relief. Citing United Nations figures, Oxfam said 10 million people need immediate food assistance. But as the worst of the flood waters have receded, so has the promise of significant funding," Neva Khan, Oxfam's director in Pakistan, said in a statement.
