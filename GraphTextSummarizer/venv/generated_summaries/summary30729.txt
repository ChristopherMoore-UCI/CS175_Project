"Look, there are lots of threats out there, criminal threats, counter-intelligence-based threats, cyber threats and terrorism threats. When asked if there are ISIS cells in the U.S., Steinbach said "there are individuals that have been in communication with groups like ISIL who have a desire to conduct an attack" and those people are living in the U.S. right now, but he says the term "sleeper cells" is too simplistic, because the threat is much more complicated and diffuse. " Steinbach says U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies don't track individuals leaving the United States to vacation in Europe. In the U.S., the FBI has seen children as young as 15 recruited by ISIS and Steinbach said he "can't speak with 100% certainty that individuals of that age group have not gotten over there successfully. "There are individuals out there who are inspired by the message of terrorist groups and they encourage family members, including their children, to follow that path," he said, adding in those cases, the FBI holds the parents responsible.
