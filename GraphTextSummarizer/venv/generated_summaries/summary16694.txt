Nelson had been arrested Sunday and charged in connection with an assault that apparently left Isaac Kolstad -- a former linebacker for Minnesota State University, Mankato -- in critical condition. "The Rutgers football family's thoughts and prayers are with Isaac Kolstad and his family," football coach Kyle Flood said, referring to the young man whom Nelson is accused of assaulting. A native of Mankato, Minnesota, he played at the University of Minnesota, according to Rutgers' website. Nelson, 20, faces one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault. Authorities in Minnesota also arrested a second person in connection with the assault, a Mankato, Minnesota, city spokeswoman said.
