To show their support, the family held an in-absentia engagement ceremony for al-Obeidy at a mosque in Tobruk Monday. The government said al-Obeidy was freed but she has not been seen publicly since she was dragged away by security men and bundled into a waiting white car outside the Rixos Hotel Saturday. Al-Obeidy's story raced around the world after she stormed into the Rixos Hotel as international journalists were having breakfast Saturday morning. A group of lawyers and human rights activists tried to approach al-Obeidy's sister's house Monday, but were blocked by security forces. As security forces dragged her away, al-Obeidy warned: "If you don't see me tomorrow, then that's it." Ahmad said she has not been able to stop crying.
