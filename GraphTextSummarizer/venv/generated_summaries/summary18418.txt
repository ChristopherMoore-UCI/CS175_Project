Blume was in his law office in a Tuscaloosa neighborhood known as Alberta or Alberta City -- a working-class residential area east of downtown that's predominantly African-American and Hispanic. As bad as the destruction is across Tuscaloosa, Ground Zero lies in Alberta, where homes and anything else in the tornado's path were demolished for blocks on end. "I've never seen devastation like this," President Obama said as he toured Alberta during a visit to Tuscaloosa on Friday. "All I can say is God Bless America." 'The woman with the baby is screaming' The CVS lies in the heart of Tuscaloosa's commercial district, next to the city's main mall and the Wood Square Shopping Center, just west of Alberta. The destructive force of Mother Nature that day won't ever be forgotten by the 93,000 people who call Tuscaloosa home.
