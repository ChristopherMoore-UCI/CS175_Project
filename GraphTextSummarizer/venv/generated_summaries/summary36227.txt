Allowing Nadal to convert a forehand winner down the line, Djokovic pounded his head with his racket. With every passing encounter against Djokovic at the French Open, the Serb had won more games and kept Nadal on court for longer. Nadal couldn't convert a handful of game points but slammed the door shut when Djokovic suddenly found himself with a break point. There were upset defeats in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, and Nadal's coach, Toni Nadal, admitted he only won in Madrid because his opponent, Kei Nishikori, was hurt. Nadal won an unprecedented ninth title at Roland Garros and now only trails Roger Federer on the men's grand slam ladder after seeing off Novak Djokovic 3-6 7-5 6-2 6-4 on a third consecutive day of steamy weather in Paris, which did no favors for the Serb -- who appeared to vomit slightly in the last set.
