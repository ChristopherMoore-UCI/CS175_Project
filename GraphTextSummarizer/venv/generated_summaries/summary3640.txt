Guinea's parliament is holding negotiations with the military, Africa News reporter Mamdou Dian Donghol Diallo told CNN. In effect, that would make Camara president of Guinea, which was thrown into turmoil Monday after the death of President Lansana Conte. To appease the unions and end the unrest, the Factbook says, Conte named a new prime minister in March 2007. The country did not hold democratic elections until 1993, when Conte was elected president. Conte came to power in 1984, when the military seized control of the government after the death of the first president, Sekou Toure.
