Tip learning curves in the players' favor by slowly introducing added depth at a comfortable pace There's a reason why social games, including "FarmVille" and "Mafia Wars," and iPhone apps such as "Angry Birds" and "Pocket God" continue to rack up millions of plays. -- The holiday season is always a win for video gamers, as software makers jockey to one-up each other with slicker graphics, deeper play and more expansive 3-D worlds. Even the most sprawling modern-day gaming experiences, such as "World of Warcraft" and "Call of Duty: Black Ops," still bow to the classic game design principle of keeping play easy to learn but hard to master. But even in the era of sprawling odysseys like "Alan Wake" and "Red Dead Redemption," they remain secondary to a fun, engaging and approachable core game experience. In short, we'd weep for a world without the latest "Civilization" or "Gran Turismo."
