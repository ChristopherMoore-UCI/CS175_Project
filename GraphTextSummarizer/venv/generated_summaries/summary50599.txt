On August 15, Abu Bakr was beaten and threatened by Sons of Mubarak members while conducting a TV interview outside the Police Academy. -- Since the revolution which ousted former president Hosni Mubarak from power after 30 years, the world has grown accustomed to seeing Egyptian revolutionaries protesting on the streets of Cairo. " "We are standing beside former president Hosni Mubarak because he stood by us in liberating Kuwait during the invasion and we cannot forget that he stepped down to avoid the bloodshed of his own people, " Faisal al-Otaibi, one of the Kuwaiti lawyers told CNN at the press conference. "The media does not give us a voice and many Mubarak supporters want to take to the streets but are scared for their well-being. "We were all hurt by the treatment of President Mubarak, he is no dictator and insulting him is insulting Egypt," said Fouda at one of the group's weekly meetings, in a Cairo coffee shop.
