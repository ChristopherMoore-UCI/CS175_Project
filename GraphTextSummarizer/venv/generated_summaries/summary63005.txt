"Those two girls were evil, and they were spies for the enemy [the Somali government], but the mujahedeen caught them and after investigation, they admitted their crime, so they have been executed," said Sheikh Yusuf Ali Ugas, commander of Al-Shabaab in Beledweyne, a town in central Somalia. The five-count indictment alleges conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country, money laundering and providing material support to terrorists. Before his death in May 2008, Al-Shabaab militant leader Aden Hashi Ayrow had called "for foreign fighters to join Al-Shabaab in a 'holy war' against the Ethiopian and other African forces in Somalia," the indictment states. Al-Shabaab is one of almost 50 groups that have been designated by the State Department as foreign terrorist organizations. -- Separate federal indictments claim that supporters of the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab have funneled money for brutal terrorist operations.
