Lee is not running for re-election this year because South Korean presidents are limited to a single five-year term. Lee's brother is not the first relative of a South Korean president to face criminal charges. South Korean president Lee Myung-bak apologized to his country for what he called "shameful incidents" involving his family and inner circle on Tuesday. This week, prosecutors in Korea sought arrest warrants for two former aides to Lee on the suspicion of receiving bribes from the same two banks, according to Yonhap, a South Korean news agency. Earlier this month, his older brother, Lee Sang-deuk was arrested on bribery charges involving two troubled Korean banks.
