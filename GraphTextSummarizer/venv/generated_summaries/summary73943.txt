Henry Ford started at the beginning of the last century with four wheels and a running board; 1908 was the birth of American car culture. So many folks were either employed at General Motors or the other two major car makers, making steel and all the other components that go into cars. Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Schultz's civics classes at David Brearley Middle School in Kenilworth, New Jersey. It was the first to hire designers instead of engineers to create new car concepts; think big fins and chrome of the 1950s and 60s. Military and intelligence networks have been penetrated, and tests have shown a cyberattack can destroy critical infrastructure, like this generator.
