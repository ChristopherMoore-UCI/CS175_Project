The queen will still attend Monday evening's Commonwealth Reception at Marlborough House, the statement said, where she will sign a new charter calling for equal rights in all Commonwealth nations. -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II will miss a service celebrating the Commonwealth Monday, as she continues to recover from an illness that left her hospitalized last week, Buckingham Palace announced in a statement.
