Atlanta manager Fredi Gonzalez stormed out of the dugout to protest the call, while angry fans pelted the field with cups, bottles and other debris. -- A controversial -- and potentially pivotal -- call in a one-game playoff Friday night between the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals prompted a vehement argument by the Braves' manager and fans to toss debris onto the field. Still, he said he was "a little disappointed" with fans who threw objects on the field and pointed out how the Braves' three errors and inability to drive in more runs also contributed to the loss. With one out and runners on first and second base, Braves shortstop Andrelton Simmons skied a pop-up to shallow left field. Atlanta fans responded to the final out with more boos, as well as a smattering of more debris flying onto the field.
