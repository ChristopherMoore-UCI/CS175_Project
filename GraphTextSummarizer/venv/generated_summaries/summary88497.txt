The Board of Control for Cricket in India held an emergency meeting on the matter in Nagpur on Wednesday, and president Shashank Manohar said the dispute between Rendezvous Sports World and a group of investment firms who share the ownership must be resolved. However, Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris said all three should be ready to play for their state teams next month and be available for the first match of five against the tourists in Brisbane. Meanwhile, Australia expect Doug Bollinger, Simon Katich and Ryan Harris to be fit for the first Ashes Test against England starting on November 25. Fast bowler Bollinger suffered a stomach strain in the first Test in India and was ruled out of the rest of the tour plus the upcoming home one-day series against Sri Lanka. Both parties had filed separate replies to a 10-day notice from the BCCI, PA reported.
