The win put Schalke on 31 points from 16 games, enough for second place on goal difference behind Bayern -- who travel to Stuttgart on Sunday. Striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar put the visitors ahead with his 14th league goal this season, while Teemu Pukki fired the winner just before halftime after Adrian Ramos equalized for Hertha. Borussia Monchengladbach can go top on Saturday with victory at bottom side Augsburg, while third-placed champions Borussia Dortmund can also move up to 33 points by beating another team in the relegation zone, Kaiserslautern, at home on Sunday. Schalke joined Bayern Munich at the top of the German Bundesliga table with a 2-1 victory at Hertha Berlin on Friday. The defeat left Hertha in ninth place with 19 points, and facing the prospect of sliding down the 18-team table by the end of this weekend.
