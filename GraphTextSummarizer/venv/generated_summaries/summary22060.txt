Luxury analyst and author of "The Bling Dynasty: Why the Reign of Chinese Luxury Shoppers Has Only Just Begun," Erwan Rambourg says luxury brands have been caught out by China's luxury consumers because they are young digital natives. " And with a publication like Vogue China on the scene, Chinese luxury consumers are only going to get more refined. In the months before Vogue China launched in 2005, there were many skeptics, people who said it would fail because China's nascent luxury market was not ready for a world-class glossy magazine -- consumers there were just not sophisticated enough. Cheung says today's luxury market is "very multi-layered (and) complicated," adding that most international brands are failing to connect with Chinese consumers. So when the country opened and luxury products started to flood in ... they tried to grab anything they could and at that time people were not sophisticated, or educated enough about luxury, about fashion ... of course they went for something they could easily understand, which was symbols, what we call logos."
