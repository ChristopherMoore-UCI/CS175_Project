Police arrest Michael Brown protesters near interstate Other witnesses also said teen's arms were raised An attorney for the man who filmed the video says it was recorded 40 seconds after the shooting. The video gives new insight into the case, which has spurred a Justice Department investigation, national debate and protests over authorities' handling of the case. The construction workers said they don't live in Ferguson and don't know the Brown family, but their account squares with accounts from several other witnesses of the unarmed African-American teen's shooting death on August 9. The contractor says he saw Wilson fire a shot at Brown while his back was turned. Some witnesses say the teenager assaulted the white officer at the outset and tried to grab his gun; other witnesses say Wilson was the aggressor.
