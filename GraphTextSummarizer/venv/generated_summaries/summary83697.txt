"Parliament will shortly vote on introducing standardised packaging -- a key measure in helping to stop children from smoking," said Chief Executive Simon Gillespie. "Three million children are exposed to second-hand smoke in cars, putting their health at risk," the Public Health Minister Jane Ellis said. England has banned smoking in cars where children are present -- a law that will come into force from October 1, with offenders facing a fine of Â£50 ($77). South Africa and Bahrain do not allow smoking in cars with children present and Mauritius has banned smoking in all cars carrying any passenger. "We know that many of them feel embarrassed or frightened to ask adults to stop smoking, which is why the regulations are an important step in protecting children from the harms of second-hand smoke."
