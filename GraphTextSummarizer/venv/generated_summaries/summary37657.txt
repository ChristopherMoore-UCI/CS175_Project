"Why not donate the money to those in China who cannot afford to go to school, the impoverished areas who cannot afford to build schools?" Part of Lei's gift will help provide scholarships for Chinese students in the International Relations Program at the school's new Jackson Institute of Global Affairs, Yale said in a statement. A poll question on chinaSMACK asked: "What do you think about Chinese graduates donating large sums of money to Yale?" Of the nearly 45,000 votes that the Web site said it attracted, nearly 49 percent indicated that there is nothing wrong with Lei's gift, while 39.5 percent indicated that he should have first donated money to his own country's education. The money also will support China-related activities at the university, including a program in cooperation with China's Ministry of Education to train Chinese university presidents. Lei Zhang's donation will help pay for a new School of Management campus at Yale and a new auditorium there will bear his name, the school announced last week.
