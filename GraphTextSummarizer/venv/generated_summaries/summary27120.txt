Juarez is one of Mexico's deadliest cities and an epicenter of drug cartel violence. Elsewhere Sunday, Mexico's Public Security Secretariat reported that 13 taxi drivers were killed in the resort town of Acapulco in a rash of violence that began early Friday. Municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez told CNN he has read those reports, but that the police department has no official confirmation that a new chief will be appointed. In light of the violence, Juarez Mayor Hector "Teto" Murguia is expected to name a new municipal police chief on Monday, local newspapers reported. Suspected drug traffickers are believed to be behind the violence, setting cars ablaze and destroying street lights and security cameras.
