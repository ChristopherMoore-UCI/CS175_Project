Authorities say their investigation determined that Mykyta Panasenko, 27, carried two improvised explosive devices aboard a Suffern, New York-bound New Jersey transit train on April 7. But he told the New York Daily News, "They were fireworks." Panasenko, who was released on his own recognizance following his arrest, said when FBI agents questioned him, he told them he had no bad intentions and did not know the devices were illegal. A criminal complaint filed on April 15, when Panasenko was arrested, indicates that the devices were constructed "from a cylinder containing Pyrodex," a form of black powder. Common uses for black powder include as gunpowder in muzzle-loading guns, as a blasting powder and as a propellant in rockets for fireworks. Panasenko "did recklessly create a risk of widespread injury or damage to a building" by constructing the devices at his home, Rubino said.
