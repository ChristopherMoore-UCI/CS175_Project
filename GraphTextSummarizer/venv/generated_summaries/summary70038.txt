-- The former partner of French President Francois Hollande said she felt like she "was falling from a skyscraper" when she learned about his alleged affair with an actress, Paris Match magazine said Thursday. "It's not because I'm no longer the first lady that life has to stop," Trierweiler told Paris Match in an interview published Thursday, adding that she will continue her charity work with various organizations. Trierweiler gave an interview to the magazine, where she's worked for years, during a visit to Mumbai, India. "I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler," Hollande told the Agence France-Presse news agency. When she learned about the alleged affair, there was already a "detachment" from Hollande, but the media coverage made the breakup harder, Trierweiler said.
