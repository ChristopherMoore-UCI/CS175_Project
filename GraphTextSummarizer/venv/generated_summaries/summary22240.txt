The three winners, including CNN founder Ted Turner, were personally selected by Mikhail Gorbachev and honored at a gala event to celebrate his 80th birthday in London on Wednesday. The concert raised money for cancer charities, including MacMillian Cancer Support in England, and the Raisa Gorbachev Children's Institute for Transplantology and Hematology in St. Petersburg, Russia. The other winners are Timothy Berners-Lee, the British physicist and computer scientist credited with inventing the World Wide Web; and Evans Wadongo, a Kenyan engineer who invented a solar lamp that would become a clean, healthy alternative to wood fires as a source of light for tens of thousands of Africans. "These three people have each, in their own way, changed the world for their fellow men and women in ways which affect all our lives," Gorbachev said in a news release. "Each and every one possesses the ability to make a difference and the Gorbachev Awards have been established to those people who achieve this and to provide inspiration to all of us to try," said the former Russian president and Nobel Peace Prize Winner.
