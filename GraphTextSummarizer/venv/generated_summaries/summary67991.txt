"All bar three of the top-20 clubs achieved revenue growth during 2009-10, demonstrating the continued resilience of football's top clubs as the full impact of the global economic downturn took hold," Deloitte's Dan Jones said. The top-20 teams generated a record €4.3 billion ($5.9 billion) in the 2009-10 season, an 8% increase on the previous period, says financial advisor Deloitte. "The club has now entered into its first paid-for, multi-year shirtfront sponsorship deal, for a guaranteed minimum of €165 million over the duration of the contract, a new world record," Jones said. Barcelona, who won the Spanish title and reached the Champions League semifinals, will soon become the second team to top €400 million in revenue -- according to Jones -- following its decision to accept paid shirt sponsorship. "The game's top clubs have proved themselves well-placed to meet these economic challenges given their large and loyal supporter bases, ability to drive broadcast audiences, and continuing attraction to corporate partners.
