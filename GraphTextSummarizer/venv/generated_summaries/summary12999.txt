The weekly clinic offers free care to those falling through the cracks of the health care system, says Dr. Rob Rhodes, a family physician who is president and founder of the clinic. "When patients come to see us, they don't know where to go for health care coverage," Rhodes says. " A national survey shows Americans are struggling to pay for health care amid other financial woes. In March, 28.7 percent of those surveyed said a member of the household deferred medical care in the previous 30 days, up from 23.7 percent a month earlier, according to the monthly National Research Corporation Ticker survey. Those who need primary care doctors are referred to The People's Health Center, a federally funded, non-profit community health center that charges a sliding fee scale.
