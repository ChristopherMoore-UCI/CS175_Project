Charlie Hebdo terror attacker Said Kouachi is suspected of slipping off for terror training in Yemen in July 2011 during a trip he made with another French national to Oman in July 2011, according to multiple French officials who spoke to L'Express national security reporter Eric Pelletier. The French responded by placing Said Kouachi under surveillance in November 2011 by issuing a "Fiche de Surveillance" -- a survillance notice, multiple French officials told Pelletier. French security agencies stopped monitoring the brothers who attacked the staff of Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine months before they carried out the attack, despite a previous tip-off from American intelligence agencies that one of them had likely trained with al Qaeda in Yemen, a French news magazine reported Saturday. Morten Storm, a former jihadist who became a double agent working for western intelligence services, told CNN's Nic Robertson that training trips such as Kouachi's were a regular part of operations for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula when the terror group's external operations head was Anwar al-Awlaki, an American imam. But the surveillance of Said was terminated in June 2014 because French security services judged him no longer dangerous, Pelletier was told.
