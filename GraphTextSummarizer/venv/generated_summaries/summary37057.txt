Facebook Home frees Facebook from that prison and gives it wider rein to collect more information about a person's location, actions and communications. Facebook Home is a more convenient way for heavy Facebook users to use the social network's services. In addition to any Facebook messages or calls you already send or make, Facebook Home pulls SMS text messages into the mix. Facebook has long been plagued by privacy concerns over confusing privacy controls and data mining, but such worries don't seem to have had any significant impact on its core users. A recent survey by the Pew Research Center found that 61% of Facebook users have taken a break from the social networking site, but only 4% cited privacy concerns as a reason.
