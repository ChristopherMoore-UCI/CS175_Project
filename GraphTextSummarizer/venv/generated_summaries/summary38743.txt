Like Nadal, he is happy that the Spanish event has reverted to traditional red clay after experimenting with a blue surface last year that was roundly condemned by many players and subsequently banned by the ATP. In Oeiras, Stanislas Wawrinka upset top seed and world No. 4 David Ferrer 6-1 6-4 to win the Portugal Open on Sunday. "Brad wasn't just the president of the ATP but was a player himself, a board member," Federer said on the ATP website. World No. 2 Federer is returning to action this week to defend his Madrid title, having recovered from the back injury that hampered him at Indian Wells in March. I think through what happened last year with the controversy around the blue clay, it was a big eye opener to have a proper court here now.
