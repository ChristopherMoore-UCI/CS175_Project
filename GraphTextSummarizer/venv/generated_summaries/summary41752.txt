" "Ray expanded country music to the masses," Bobby Roberts, Price's agent, said in a written statement. Price "had one of the greatest voices in country music history as well as a great sense of humor," Roberts said. -- Ray Price, the Nashville star whose trademark "shuffle" beat became a country music staple, has died at age 87, his agent said Monday. His first records drew little notice, but he caught the attention of Hank Williams, who took Price on tour with him in 1951 and brought him to Nashville, where he began to sing with the Grand Ole Opry. He died Monday afternoon, Roberts said.
