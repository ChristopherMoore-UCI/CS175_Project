"Last year was the most amazing year of my life, but also it was the worst year. Former national captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir will discover their fate on Thursday, along with agent Mazhar Majeed. Majeed, like Amir, pleaded guilty after being caught accepting money from an undercover newspaper reporter to "spot-fix" outcomes during a Test match against England at Lord's in August 2010. Amir became the youngest player to take 50 Test wickets last year, but has been banned by the International Cricket Council until 2015. "He's lost the captaincy of the Pakistan cricket team and this was a job he had for five weeks, they won two Tests, and this was the greatest honour of his life," said QC Ali Bajwa said.
