Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Antonin Scalia, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Anthony Kennedy and Justice Elena Kagan all attended the 60th annual Mass. In particular, the congregants sang "The Star-Spangled Banner" and "America the Beautiful" at the start and end of the Mass. Others attending the event included Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood, Virginia attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Ken Cuccinelli, and U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Dan Rooney. This was Kagan's first Red Mass. Having six justices in attendance ties a record set in 2009. In Paris, La Sainte Chappelle was built and designated as a chapel specifically for Red Mass. In 2010, Kagan replaced Justice John Paul Stevens, who was the lone Protestant at the time of his retirement.
