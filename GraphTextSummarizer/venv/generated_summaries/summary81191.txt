Pro-Russian separatists have claimed control of parts of eastern Ukraine since the spring, despite a push by Ukrainian forces to defeat them. Regardless of whether Plotnitsky's offer was sincere, it reflected a serious reality: A war that has spread misery in eastern Ukraine and heightened tensions between Russia and the West is still going on, despite a supposed ceasefire that the two sides signed two months ago. Crimea borders southeastern Ukraine, where much of the current unrest is focused and into which Russian troops allegedly have moved. After thousands of deaths and months of futile attempts to avoid more in Ukraine's fight with pro-Russian rebels, leaders on both sides talked past each other Wednesday, with one saying direct negotiations were off the table and another suggesting that the war be settled with a duel. But Kiev did say that two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded in clashes across eastern Ukraine on Tuesday.
