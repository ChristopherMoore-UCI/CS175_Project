"We are delighted to be in the homestretch with the repairs to the Washington Monument almost complete, and we look forward to the re-opening on May 12 so we can once again welcome visitors to this iconic monument to our nation's first President," said National Park Service Director Jonathan B. Jarvis, in a press release. The monument will officially reopen on May 12, the National Park Service announced Tuesday. The National Park Service and the Trust for the National Mall are planning to host a reopening ceremony at 10 a.m. ET On May 12. The park service will offer extended operating hours, 9 a.m.-10 p.m., through the end of summer. Congress allocated $7.5 million to the restoration project, and philanthropist David M.
