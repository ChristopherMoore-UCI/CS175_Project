In France, e-cigarettes have helped reduce tobacco smoking according to one survey. However, high-profile researchers believe that e-cigarettes have the potential to save millions of lives among populations of tobacco smokers. While it's too early to predict the long-term health effects of e-cigarettes, some experts say they are a safer alternative to regular cigarettes, which produce myriad toxic chemicals. Big Tobacco will then get to decide which products are sold such that it can manage its own transition from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, or end e-cigarettes as a product category entirely, whichever better serves its financial interests. For many smokers who have trouble quitting, e-cigarettes are a viable substitute.
