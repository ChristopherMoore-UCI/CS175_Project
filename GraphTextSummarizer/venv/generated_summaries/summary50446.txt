The only time the FDA has approved added caffeine in a food was in the 1950s for cola drinks, says Michael Taylor, the agency's deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, in a statement Monday. "Alert Energy Caffeine Gum is for adults who are looking for foods with caffeine for energy. ... In recent years, controversy has also swirled around energy drinks, which also contain caffeine. According to the Alert Energy website, the gum is "an energy product for adults who consume caffeine for energy" and is not recommended for children or people sensitive to caffeine. Children and adolescents may be exposed to caffeine beyond those foods in which caffeine is naturally found and beyond anything FDA envisioned when it made the determination regarding caffeine in cola," Taylor says.
