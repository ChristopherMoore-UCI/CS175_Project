While authorities have tracked down some of Mangum's sexual partners -- 50 to 60 of whom lived in Stoddard County -- "countless others remain unknown," Oliver said. That diagnosis didn't stop Mangum from having hundreds of sexual partners -- including 15 to 20 instances of unprotected intercourse, sometimes involving a third man, with the victim tied to the charge issued this week -- according to the criminal complaint. This could lead to more counts against the 36-year-old Mangum, who is already facing a felony charge accusing him of exposing one of his former live-in partners to HIV. The pair then had unprotected sex -- though only after the victim told police he "specifically asked if (Mangum) had any disease and Mangum replied no," the document says. Mangum's bail was set at $250,000 during his arraignment Thursday in Stoddard County.
