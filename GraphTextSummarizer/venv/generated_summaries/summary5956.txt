The case of Chafin v. Chafin will be heard by the justices on Wednesday and an eventual ruling could establish an important precedent on the discretion of American courts to decide where children caught in parental fights should stay. Jeff Chafin wants to revive his claim of Eris' custody, arguing the child's normal place of residence is the United States. "And to avoid, as I understood the convention structure, this flight from court to court and this long, drawn-out process from country to country over who's going to make that choice." Lynne Chafin did not see Eris for 10 months while the custody case played in a federal court in Alabama. "I believe that if my daughter's returned to the U.S., I will never see her again," said Lynne Chafin, who said this fight is about Eris' future and well-being.
