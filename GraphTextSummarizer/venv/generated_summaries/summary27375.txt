Police there are seeking to question Internet pioneer John McAfee in the killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. Faull was killed after four of 11 dogs belonging to McAfee were fatally poisoned, said Wired Magazine Contributing Editor Joshua Davis, who said he had spent more than 100 hours with McAfee in recent months. "My goodness," Martinez said when asked previously about McAfee's reported fear. Police have searched the home and, according to witnesses, dug up the remains of McAfee's dogs. Raphael Martinez, a police spokesman, said a person working for McAfee called police about a poisoned dog; when police arrived at McAfee's residence, they found the dogs had been buried.
