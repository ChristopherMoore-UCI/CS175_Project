Still, in Rourke, Cavill, Evans, Stephen Dorff (as Theseus' sidekick Stavros), and Frieda Pinto (as the so-called "Virgin Oracle"), Tarsem has cast actors strong or pretty enough to hold us through the movie's turgid breast-beating, grisly violence and numbskull plotting. What Theseus doesn't know is that the old guy (played by John Hurt on Earth and Luke Evans when mortal eyes aren't peeking) is actually Zeus, the king of the gods, who has been grooming the lad to lead the Hellenics against the onslaught of the blood-thirsty Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). Less "300 2" than "300 3D," "Immortals" is a sledgehammer action spectacle interspersed with bouts of enervating pseudo-philosophical discourse and moments of fine visual embellishment. -- Greece may be in an economic mess these days, but the ancient gods are back in vogue, at least in Hollywood, where the success of "300" and "Percy Jackson" novelist Rick Riordan has not gone unnoticed. There aren't many flicks that Mickey Rourke can't perk up, and here he's adorned in the full enchilada, even more scars than nature intended, a shimmering silver face mask, and a bonnet that seems to have been modeled on a Venus flytrap.
