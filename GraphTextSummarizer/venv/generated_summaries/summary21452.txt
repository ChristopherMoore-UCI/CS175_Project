He had been a stray and was adopted by Chelsea Clinton, the Clintons' daughter, when Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas. -- Socks, the cat who won international fame during his years in the Clinton White House, was euthanized Friday after months of treatment for cancer. Since the Clintons left the White House in 2001, Socks had lived with Betty Currie, former President Bill Clinton's secretary. Socks, who was born in 1989, was put to sleep about 10 a.m. at Three Notch Veterinary Clinic in Hollywood, Maryland, said veterinary assistant Rae Dera. He was often photographed on the president's shoulder and was given free rein of the presidential residence -- showing up in photos in the Oval Office and White House press briefing room.
