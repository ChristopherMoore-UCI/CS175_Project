Within three years of being released from prison, nearly half of prisoners are convicted of another crime with one out of every four ending up back in prison. Almost any activity to which we might sentence low-level offenders --apprenticeship programs, school, literacy or computer science boot camps, community service -- would be a better use of taxpayer dollars than sticking them idle in prison with hardened criminals. The number of people in prison, on parole or on probation, 6.9 million Americans,  exceeds the populations of the second- and third-largest cities, Los Angeles and Chicago, combined. According to the NAACP,  one in three black males born in the United States today is likely to spend time in prison at some point in his life. These measures keep violent offenders off the streets and lesser offenders out of prison, where too often the only education they receive is how to become a more hardened criminal.
