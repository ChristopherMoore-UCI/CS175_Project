Adult lungs are far more available than lungs from children, and doctors believe modified adult lungs might save the girl's life. Attorneys for the family of Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Philadelphia girl with cystic fibrosis, have sent a formal letter to Sebelius, requesting that she "set aside" what they're referring to as the "Under 12 Rule" that, they say, is preventing Sarah from getting priority on the adult waiting list for lung transplants. " "They are only asking that you exercise your authority to direct that an inflexible policy ... be set aside so that medical professionals can exercise their judgment and Sarah can be considered for a set of donated adult lungs under the same requirement that apply to persons aged 12 and over. "It violates her rights under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution." Harvey also argues that the Murnaghan family is not asking for the secretary to intervene "in favor of Sarah to ensure that she receives a set of donated lungs. With just weeks left, Sarah fights the system for life-saving pair of lungs Sarah's parents and attorneys are arguing that the rule is making it all but impossible for her to receive a lung, since children's lungs are so rare.
