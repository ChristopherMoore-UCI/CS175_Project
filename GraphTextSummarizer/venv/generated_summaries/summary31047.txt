Voters rejected O'Malley's Maryland Democratic Party at the ballot box in 2014 when the governor's handpicked successor, Anthony Brown, lost the governor's race to Republican Larry Hogan. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley told an audience at the University of Chicago on Thursday that he has been "seriously considering" a running for president, and suggested his decision on whether he'll jump in to the race will come this spring. He added, "I've been very encouraged as I travel around the country by a number of people who repeat again and again and again their desire for getting things done again as a country and also for new leadership to get those things done." In a December 2014 CNN/ORC International poll, O'Malley garnered only 1% support, putting him 65% behind frontrunner Hillary Clinton. O'Malley has been "seriously considering" running for president since early 2014.
