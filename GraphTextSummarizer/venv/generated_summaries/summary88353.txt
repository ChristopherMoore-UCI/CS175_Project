Although the quake was centered just a mile from San Bernadino's city hall, it was 10 miles below the surface, said Dr. Egill Hauksson, a seismologist with the Earthquake Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology. -- A light earthquake shook Southern California Thursday evening, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude 4.5 quake struck at 7:50 p.m. (10:50 p.m. ET) and was centered in San Bernardino, about 55 miles east of Los Angeles. "It's unlikely that there's going to be damage," said Hauksson said. The USGS said people reported feeling the earthquake as far away as San Diego.
