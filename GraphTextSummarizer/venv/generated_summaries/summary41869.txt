Dr. William Schaffner, head of preventive medicine of Vanderbilt Medical Center explained Wednesday on CNN's "New Day" that MERS can "spread in the context of providing health care. At the same time, WHO said that -- for now, at least -- the illness known as MERS does not constitute a global health emergency Declaring an emergency is "a major act" that can "raise anxieties," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the organization's assistant director-general for health security. But they tested negative for MERS in a state test, the CDC said Wednesday. Four people -- each from different families -- have been tested in San Antonio for MERS because they were on a plane with one of the two confirmed U.S. patients, said San Antonio health department spokeswoman Carol Schliesinger. Twelve days after her flight, she said, her state health department called and sent her a note asking whether she had symptoms such as fever or cough, and also saying she should record her temperature for two weeks.
