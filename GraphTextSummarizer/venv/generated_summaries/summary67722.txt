Protesters say the current Thai government is a proxy for exiled former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The latest unrest, which has seen anti-government protesters occupy Bangkok's international airport, dates back to the controversial premiership of Thaksin Shinawatra. But subsequent governments have been seen as proxies for Thaksin. "Basically since 2006 the protesters have been grappling with the problem that whoever the people elect is a supporter of Thaksin," said CNN's Bangkok Correspondent Dan Rivers. The court found the People Power Party committed electoral fraud, and it barred Somchai and other top party officials from from holding public office for five years.
