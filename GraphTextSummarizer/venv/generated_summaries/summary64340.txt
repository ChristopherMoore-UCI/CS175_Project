The Christian community is predominant in northern Iraq's Nineveh province, in the big city of Mosul and in the nearby Nineveh Plain, where many displaced Christians live. Christians and other minorities represented about 3 percent of Iraq's population before 2003, but many have fled to Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, and other countries. Christians in Iraq face a "bleak future," said Kassab, executive director of the Chaldean Federation of America, a nonprofit group that helps Iraqi Christians. " Youash, who authored a paper on the Iraqi minority crises for the American University International Law Review, warned that the demographic changes will hurt Iraq because Assyrian Christians "are disproportionately represented in Iraq's professional and educated elite." "They are a significant component of the American administrative structure in Iraq," he said. She said Iraqi Christians are suffering as a result of "religious cleansing," and she has urged more help for minorities who have fled their homes in Iraq.
