Now, nearly a century later, Australian explorer Tim Jarvis and his team of five adventurers have set sail Thursday on a voyage to emulate Shackleton's epic survival journey, using almost exactly the same equipment and rations. In 1916, British polar explorer Ernest Shackleton managed to save his entire crew after they had been stranded in the Antarctic for almost two years. During the original, grandly titled "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition", Shackleton had attempted to cross the Antarctic and reach the South Pole with a crew of 27 men on his ship, the Endurance. And, unlike Shackleton and his men, this crew hasn't already spent over 500 days abandoned in the Antarctic. Attempts to repeat Shackleton's rescue mission have been done before, but Jarvis' journey has a special twist.
