The rest is history: Sen. Obama became President Obama and Sen. Clinton became Secretary of State Clinton. It was a very different story four years ago, when Clinton was the biggest and most vocal supporter of his wife, Hillary Clinton, in her historic battle against Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination. Among Clinton's most controversial comments came when he challenged Obama's claim to be more against the Iraq War than Hillary Clinton. After Hillary Clinton ended her bid for the nomination, she and her husband took to the campaign trail to help Obama win the White House. "We need to keep going forward by re-electing Barack Obama president of the United States." Later, at the same event, Obama praised his predecessor and joked that "you guys get two presidents for one out of this event, which is a pretty good deal."
