Meanwhile, consumers in low corn producing states such as Colorado and California are required to buy ethanol in every gallon of gasoline because ethanol use is mandated in those states. Currently, ethanol use is not mandated in top corn producing states such as Iowa and Nebraska. Corn is also diverted to produce ethanol because of our government mandate. This year, the mandate is 13.2 billion gallons of ethanol, which would require 4.7 billion bushels of corn. As a bonus, more sustainable farming practices could return to the Midwest following this frenzy of growing corn on corn, fencerow to fencerow, to cash in on the high prices.
