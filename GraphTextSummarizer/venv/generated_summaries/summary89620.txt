The hand-held auto-injector is designed for family and caregivers to administer a single dose of a drug called naloxone, which rapidly reverses the effects of heroin and other opioids. Noting that there were more than 2,000 opioid overdoses in New York in 2011, Schneiderman said, "It isn't every day that we can announce that we will save lives." More than 500 lives were saved last year in Suffolk County, where police officers have been part of a pilot program since 2012 to carry naloxone, Schneiderman said. Once injected, the naloxone stops heroin and other opioids from slowing a person's breathing down to the point that it stops. Schneiderman says using naloxone allows victims to be brought back "from the brink of death and buys more time to get to a hospital." That was New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's message Thursday as he announced a new program to provide all state law enforcement officers with naloxone and train them to use it.
