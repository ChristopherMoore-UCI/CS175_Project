These conversations happen every day across America amid tension between law enforcement and black communities, said Rashad Robinson, executive director of civil rights group ColorOfChange. Turning a moment into a movement Hashtags like #Ferguson are a means to an end for advocacy groups trying to create movements out of moments like Michael Brown's shooting, said Robinson with ColorOfChange. Ferguson has always been about justice for Michael Brown first and foremost, Robinson said. People have used the hashtag to call out what they see as instances of police misconduct and racist double standards beyond the context of the day Officer Darren Wilson shot the 18-year-old to death. Since August 9, Ferguson the place has come to represent what many see as the ugly side of American racial politics, making #Ferguson the hashtag a social media shorthand for racial inequality, police misconduct and "the value of black life," Mckesson said.
