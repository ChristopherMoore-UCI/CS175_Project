-- High school boys in a California town overlooking San Francisco Bay started a "Fantasy Slut League" targeting girls, school officials said Tuesday. "Male students earn points for documented engagement in sexual activities with female students," the principal wrote, according to KGO. The principal's letter said school staff members learned of the boys' activity during a recent assembly about date rape prevention, KGO reported. Piedmont High School Principal Rich Kitchens said in a letter to parents last week that boys organized "a 'Fantasy Slut League' in which our female students (unbeknownst to most of them) are drafted as part of the league," according to CNN affiliate KGO. But the superintendent is encouraging educators, parents and their teenagers to discuss how "to make good choices and to treat each other with respect and dignity," she said in a statement Tuesday.
