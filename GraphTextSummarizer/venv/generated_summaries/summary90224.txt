Sanford landed the book deal in September, a few months after her husband, South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, admitted having an affair with an Argentine woman. After the governor made a nationally televised admission about his affair, there were calls for Sanford's resignation and investigations by media organizations and the state Ethics Commission into whether he tapped taxpayer resources for personal use. Sanford's book,  "Staying True," will now hit bookstores on February 5 instead of the original April release date, the book's publisher, Ballantine Books, announced Tuesday. In December, Jenny Sanford released a statement,saying she was filing for divorce "after many unsuccessful efforts at reconciliation." "She chose to let Mark Sanford deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character, even in the face of the lies their father has told," the synopsis reads.
