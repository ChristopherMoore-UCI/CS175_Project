According to a news release quoting prosecutors, "The U.S. government has found no evidence that Underwood succeeded in passing classified information concerning the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou to anyone at the Chinese MSS." "Bryan Underwood was determined to make millions by selling secret photos of restricted areas inside a U.S. Consulate in China," said U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen.

He believed the MSS routinely conducted searches of apartments occupied by Americans." Prosecutors said that Underwood's job was to protect the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou -- not to make it vulnerable to Chinese counterintelligence.
