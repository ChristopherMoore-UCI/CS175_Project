Watch Moore describe Bhutto's final moments Â» Moore said he was about 20 yards away from Bhutto's vehicle when he took his photographs. "When I talked with a number of people, they said that people were just afraid to come out, for the simple reason that they all remembered what happened in Karachi." Moore said he himself expected there could be another attack following the Karachi massacre. "I ran up, got as close as I got, made a few pictures of her waving to the crowd," Getty Images senior staff photographer John Moore told CNN's online streaming news service, CNN.com Live, in a phone interview Thursday from Islamabad, Pakistan. "And then suddenly, there were a few gunshots that rang out, and she went down, she went down through the sunroof," he said.
