The rear hatch of the aircraft taking the U2 lead singer from Dublin to Berlin was missing when the aircraft landed at Berlin Schonefeld Airport on Wednesday. Besides Bono (whose real name is Paul Hewson), there were two pilots and four other passengers on board, according to Germout Freitag, an official with the German Federal Bureau of Aircraft Accident Investigation. While officials "have no idea at the moment what caused this and need to examine both the door and the area of the plane," Freitag said he believes the rear hatch was not properly closed. Bono apologizes for free iTunes album "The ground crew realized the door was gone and two suitcases had fallen out," Freitag said. The ground crew discovered that the hatch was missing shortly after the aircraft landed at 12:26 a.m., 11 minutes after it blew off, Freitag said.
