-- The officer in charge of the British nuclear submarine that ran aground in October has been removed from command, the Ministry of Defence said Saturday. "Commander Coles will continue to serve in the Royal Navy and he will be reappointed to a post where his talents and experience can be used to best effect," a ministry statement said. " The HMS Astute ran aground off the Isle of Skye, in northern Scotland, while doing sea trials. The submarine can carry a mix of as many as 38 Spearfish heavyweight torpedoes and Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, according to the ministry. Its nuclear propulsion system was not damaged in the incident and its reactor was declared safe, with no environmental impact, the ministry said.
