Switzerland's double Olympic champion from 2002 in Salt Lake City, Simon  Ammann, showed he is running into form for Vancouver next February, after jumping 132 and 143.5m for 272.4 points and third place. Austrian Andreas Kofler, who won at Oberstdorf, maintained the overall lead in the four-event competition as he came in fourth with leaps of 136 and 137m for 271.9 points. Kofler leads the standings with a 20-point lead over Loitzl with Ahonen third ahead of the next competition at Innsbruck on Sunday. Ammann still leads the overall World Cup standings with Schlierenzauer closing up in second place and Kofler third. It gave him a comfortable advantage over fellow Austrian Wolfgang Loitzl, who twice jumped 135m for 272.5 points.
