The Boston police officer who sent a mass e-mail in which he compared Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. to a "banana-eating jungle monkey" has apologized, saying he's not a racist. " "I would like to take this opportunity to offer fellow police officers, soldiers and citizens my sincerest apology over the controversial e-mail I authored," Barrett said on CNN. Boston Police Officer Justin Barrett has apologized for the e-mail he sent about Harvard professor. In a news conference Thursday morning, Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis denounced the e-mail. In his fiery e-mail, which he sent to some fellow Guard members as well as the newspaper, Barrett vented about a July 22 Globe column about  Gates' arrest.
