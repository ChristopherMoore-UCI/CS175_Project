"We are saddened at the prospect of the sale of Neverland which, under the agreement negotiated during Michael's lifetime, Colony has the right to sell," the Jackson estate said in a written statement Thursday. The zoo and amusement park rides, including a Ferris wheel and a railroad, are long gone, but Neverland remains an important pilgrimage for die hard Jackson fans from around the world. The 2,700-acre property, nestled in the rolling hills and cattle ranches of Santa Barbara County, California, was Jackson's refuge from the world from 1988 until he essentially abandoned it after he was acquitted on child molestation charges in 2005. A video tour inside Neverland Jackson's estate still owns a minority interest in Neverland, but there is no indication from its executors that they are considering buying out Colony Capital's stake to preserve it. "We hope and trust that any new owners of Neverland will respect the historical importance and special nature of this wonderful property," the Jackson estate said.
