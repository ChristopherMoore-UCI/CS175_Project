"The lockdowns will remain in effect until all the staff that we deployed to Chino from other areas go back home," Kostyrko said. Though other races were involved, the altercations at Chino mostly involved Hispanics and African-Americans, Kostyrko said. Hundreds of inmates using pipes and shanks as weapons trashed a California prison, burning a courtyard, ripping beds to shreds and tearing bathroom sinks from walls, a new video of the weekend riot's aftermath shows. The decision to lock down the Chino prison and nine others in southern California was still in effect Tuesday. Video shot by CNN affiliate KABC-TV gave the first glimpse of the damage to the California Institution for Men in Chino from a riot that authorities said was ignited by racial tensions.
