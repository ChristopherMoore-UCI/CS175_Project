Two were detected in north central Tuscaloosa County, while the third hit near the town of Clay in Jefferson County, packing winds estimated at 150 miles per hour. The storm comes less than nine months after a tornado outbreak killed 243 people across Alabama, including 61 in Birmingham and Tuscaloosa. "The one thing that we can say is thank goodness we're not looking at what happened in this state last year in April," Art Faulkner, director of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency, said Monday. -- Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley on Tuesday toured communities hit by a tornado that destroyed or damaged hundreds of homes and killed two people. The National Weather Service confirmed at least three tornadoes touched down in Alabama early Monday.
