The bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway," said Dent Thompson, vice president and chief operations officer at Phoenix Air.

Probably no one knows that better than Phoenix Air, a Georgia-based company that is the go-to for transporting Ebola victims by air. Phoenix Air began developing its system way before the current Ebola outbreak. But Thompson said Phoenix Air held onto the system, knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again.
