Mayflower resident Amber Bartlett, who left her home after the spill, told CNN on Tuesday that a cul de sac in her neighborhood last week was "just covered ... nothing but oil." Bartlett told CNN on Tuesday that Exxon "has been great in aiding the residents in information." Attorney General Dustin McDaniel said Tuesday he asked Exxon Mobil, the owner of the 60-year-old Pegasus pipeline, to preserve all documents and information related to the spill and cleanup efforts. "If you have been harmed by this spill then we're going to look at how to make that right," Exxon Mobil Pipeline Co. President Gary Pruessing told them. An around-the-clock cleanup operation began Saturday, with workers scrubbing streets and driveways in the Northwood subdivision, CNN affiliate KATV reported.
