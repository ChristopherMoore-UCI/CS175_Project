To lower health care costs, we must 1) weed out the rampant overspending in our current system that is driven by the twin forces of trial lawyers and fraudsters, 2) modernize medical regulations that haven't been changed in decades, and 3) make sure the government is helping every American get insurance, not just those who have health insurance through their job. Wednesday, I and my Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives are unveiling common sense health care reforms that focus on increasing the affordability, accessibility and availability of quality health care. Even with these reforms, the cost of health care is still too high for many Americans. And, especially in today's economy where so many workers have been forced to retire early or have been laid off, we recognize that many Americans who have not yet hit retirement age often have an especially hard time finding affordable health insurance. Rep. Dave Camp said Americans pay too much for health care due to waste, lawsuits and fraud.
