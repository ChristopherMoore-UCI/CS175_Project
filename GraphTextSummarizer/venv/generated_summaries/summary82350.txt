Asked if he should be helping to write laws he has trouble following, the Republican lawmaker said, "Well, I mean these are real property tax bills, which is different than what the Ways and Means does with income tax bills. He fought state tax officials for years, refusing to pay nearly $1.4 million in back income taxes, interest and penalties. And he racked up more than $6,200 in penalties and interest on more than $100,000 in taxes, according to county records. At that time, while he strongly disagreed with decision to levy taxes retroactively, Jim Renacci paid the assessment in full, including interest and penalties," the statement said. In 2002, after years of fighting, he paid $1.2 million in taxes -- the amount he insisted he owed -- plus another $1.3 million in penalties and interest he racked up during the fight.
