One prime example is prosthetics specialist Ottobock -- the market leader for artificial limbs. But for less recognized names such as Ottobock, growing globally is what is taking German companies to the next level. The CEO of Ottobock, Hans Georg Näder, says one of the keys to the company's success has been continued family ownership. Taking Ottobock "into the future" is the goal, says Näder. Ottobock has provided athletes such as German Paralympic sprint gold medalist Heinrich Popow with an artificial limb.
