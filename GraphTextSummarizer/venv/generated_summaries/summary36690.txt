A Cleveland teen-ager hacked Vine on Monday, flouting the app's strict time limit and uploading all 3 minutes, 33 seconds of "Never Gonna Give You Up," the '80s pop hit turned bait-and-switch Internet meme. "I think I broke Vine," 16-year-old Will Smidlein tweeted Monday night. Usually, a user will post a provocative looking link (Web lore says the first was supposedly a preview of the much-anticipated "Grand Theft Auto IV" video game) that instead -- surprise! It has since reached unprecedented heights for Web memes. Smidlein, who had experience developing for Android, translated the app's code into a readable format, then tinkered with parts of the program that lets users upload posts.
