Now, six years after it was phased out, English artist and designer Thomas Heatherwick is taking inspiration from the famous Routemaster to re-define the look of London buses. Current buses tend to be lit with fluorescent tubes which isn't the most flattering light, says Heatherwick. " Heatherwick says the new bus is greener too, with a hybrid engine which will be 40% more energy efficient than a standard bus. Passengers can look forward to getting on board the new buses early next year, in time for London's Olympic Games. The new bus also has three sets of doors and two staircases, which means you can get passengers on and off more quickly, Heatherwick says.
