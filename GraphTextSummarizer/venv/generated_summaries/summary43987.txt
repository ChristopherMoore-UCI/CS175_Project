The terrorist threat posed by radicalized Muslim- Americans has been exaggerated, according to a study released Wednesday by researchers at Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, "since 9/11, there has been increased tension among Muslim-Americans about their acceptance in mainstream American society," the study said. This could include the cultivation of Muslim-American informants, the study suggested, a policy that could be developed and openly discussed with community leaders. Leaders and Muslim-American organizations denounce violent acts, for instance, in messages that have weight within communities. Muslim-Americans report feeling a stronger anti-Muslim bias from the media as well as from day-to-day interactions.
