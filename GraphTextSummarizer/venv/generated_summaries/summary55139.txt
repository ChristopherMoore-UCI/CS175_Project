In the wide-ranging interview published March 5 in Corriere della Sera, an Italian daily, the Pope noted that state-sanctioned unions can result from the need to ensure rights such as access to health care. Earlier this month, the Pope reaffirmed the Catholic Church's opposition to gay marriage but suggested in a newspaper interview that it could support some types of civil unions. Later, Obama reiterated criticism of Russian intolerance spawned by a law passed before the Sochi Olympics that outlawed promoting gay rights to children. The Catholic News Service called the comments "the first time a Pope has indicated even tentative acceptance of civil unions. A speech to Europe aimed at Russia sounded a lot like President Barack Obama's successful campaign message from 2012, especially when it came to gay rights.
