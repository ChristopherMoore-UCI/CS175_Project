That's why dentists are working with health and community leaders across the United States through Action for Dental Health, the American Dental Association's nationwide, community-based movement to provide care now to people suffering with dental disease, strengthen the public-private safety net and bring disease prevention and dental health education into underserved communities. Every day, thousands of people without access to a dentist are looking for dental care in our ERs, most of which cannot provide the care these patients need. The new law has no substantive dental provisions for low-income adults, despite the fact that dental health is critical to overall health. And the majority of dental ER visits, nearly 80%, were for common and preventable conditions like abscesses and cavities. For example, one of our local hospitals, the Moses Cone Health Center, finds that about 10% of ER cases are related to dental issues.
