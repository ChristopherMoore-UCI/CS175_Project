"Hollande is in favor of more government action to stimulate the economy, stimulate spending ... whereas Sarkozy wants to improve the climate for business by lowering some taxes, by talking about repealing the law establishing the 35-hour work week -- a Socialist measure from the late '90s -- to make it possible to work more," Leruth said. Comparing Sarkozy and Hollande on their economic policy is not unlike comparing Republicans and Democrats in the United States. Francois Hollande, a candidate from the center-left Socialist Party, has significant momentum after edging center-right incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in the first round of France's presidential election on Sunday. If he wins a May 6 runoff against Sarkozy, Hollande would be the first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand in 1995. Sarkozy received 27.2% of the vote in the first round of voting on Sunday, just behind Hollande's 28.6%.
