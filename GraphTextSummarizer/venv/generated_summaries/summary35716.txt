It's not true in many states, where voter registration closes days or weeks before Election Day. I'm looking to Minnesota for solutions to low voter participation in other states. Becker and McDonald pointed to this factor, too, noting that it could be why the state implements laws designed to encourage high rates of voter participation. Research shows that states with same-day registration have turnout rates 5% to 7% higher than those that don't, according to Michael McDonald at George Mason University. That hearty Midwestern state consistently has the highest rate of voter participation in the country.
