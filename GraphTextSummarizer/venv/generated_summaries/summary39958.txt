Compare Jeremy Lin, Mark Zuckerberg, and Barack Obama to, say, Michael Jordan, Steve Jobs, and Bill Clinton. After a string of losses, they bring him back on board more for the hell of it than anything else, and Lin lights a fire under the team, leading it to a run of dramatic victories. Yet it also evokes the spirit of our current era -- one in which networks and connections are coming to matter more than individual skill or personal gain. His rise to viability, remember, depended on the strength of his Internet fundraising, and his ability to organize new networks of people around his candidacy through tools like Meetup and Facebook. Lin, Zuckerberg, and Obama, on the other hand, are rather underwhelming as tribal leaders.
