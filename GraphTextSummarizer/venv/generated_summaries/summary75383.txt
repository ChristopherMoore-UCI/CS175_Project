-- A Staten Island Ferry lost power and hit a pier Wednesday at full speed, resulting in one serious injury and nine minor injuries, a Coast Guard spokesman said. Coast Guard boats were on the scene, the St. George Terminal on the north shore of Staten Island. The Coast Guard spokesman compared the ferry's loss of power as it neared the pier to a car losing its brakes. Emergency responders were transferring the injured to Staten Island's Richmond University Medical Center. Representatives for the Staten Island Ferry did not respond to calls for comment.
