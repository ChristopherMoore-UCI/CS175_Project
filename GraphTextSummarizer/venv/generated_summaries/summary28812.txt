Dorner's actions have invalidated his notions of justice; killing innocent people is not the proper method to advance the cause of justice, period. I don't want to reference Dorner in any way except for what he was -- someone who was very disturbed, who needed mental health support and who cruelly took the lives of those devoted to service. There are many better spokespeople for the cause of racial justice than Dorner. Before he met his end, Dorner took the lives of several human beings and wounded a few more. Today, with the families of the dead still grieving, it is very hard for me to shift away to focus on Dorner's political views.
