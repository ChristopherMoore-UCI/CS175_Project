Although the exhibition venue at the new China International Exhibition Center is far from the city center, police estimate that the Beijing Auto Show will attract an average of 120,000 visitors every day. "China is now one of our leading markets together with the U.S.," says CEO Torsten Muller-Otvos who was in Beijing to unveil two new models. Throngs of auto journalists crowded around shiny new supercars, luxury sedans and green vehicles during the media preview on Sunday. According to a McKinsey report, China may overtake the United States as the largest premium car market as early as 2016. Despite the Chinese leadership's austerity measures and recent reports of weak profits from Chinese car makers, the country's biggest car show opened today to much buzz.
