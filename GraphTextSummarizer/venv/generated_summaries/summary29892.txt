-- Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, will be the next House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chairman, taking the gavel from California Republican Darrell Issa. "I have great respect for Chairman Darrell Issa and can't thank him enough for his many years of dedicated service leading the Oversight Committee," Chaffetz said in a statement. Chaffetz was nominated by the House Steering Committee, led by House Speaker John Boehner. In one of the few contested leadership roles, Chaffetz beat out two other members for the seat: Ohio Reps. Mike Turner and Jim Jordan. Chaffetz said he is looking forward to working with ranking member Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, who Issa often bickered with.
