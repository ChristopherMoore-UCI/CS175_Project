The IOC said it had looked at ways of increasing universality, gender equity and youth appeal and overall value to the four-yearly Games. "The inclusion of these events on the Olympic Winter Games program is sure to be appreciated by athletes and sports fans alike," IOC president Jacques Rogge said. "These are exciting, entertaining events that perfectly complement the existing events on the sports program, bring added appeal and increase the number of women participating at the Games." "My opinion is that there will not be many such cases," IOC medical commission chairman Professor Arne Ljungqvist told PA. The next Winter Olympics in Russia will feature six new events, meaning that more women will be able to compete at Sochi in 2014.
