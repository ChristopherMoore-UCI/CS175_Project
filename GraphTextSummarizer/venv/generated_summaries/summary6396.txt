The Department of Health and Human Services has been taking down parts of the site during off-peak hours, and officials say that adding more server capacity; moving certain over-stressed components to dedicated hardware; and making software changes to increase efficiency have improved the situation. "We've made software changes to make the system more efficient and be able to handle higher volumes." According to government officials, that data hub and the various levels of identity verification necessary for enrollment are working properly, providing accurate eligibility results and tax credit determinations. "We're in the business of fast websites that don't fail, that's what we do," said Media Temple President and COO Russ Reeder. "We have a unique, cross-sector perspective on health IT that makes us well-suited to partner with CMS for success on one of the most visible efforts in CMS history," CGI Vice President Rich Martin said in a December 2011 statement announcing the contract, the original value of which was more than $55 million.
