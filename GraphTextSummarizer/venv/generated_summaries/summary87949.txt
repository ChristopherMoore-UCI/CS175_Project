Jindakuansanong could not confirm the identity of the shooter or shooters, but said anti-government protesters encountered pro-government supporters, and the two sides exchanged verbal assaults. Thararin's death came after anti-government protesters blocked a voting station and shut it down after officials agreed to suspend the voting, police said. Suthin Thararin, a protest leader for the People's Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC), was killed in front of Sri Eiam Temple in the Thai capital, Police Col. Thawatkiat Jindakuansanong said. Meanwhile, more than 45 out 50 polling stations have been closed due to obstructions by opposition protesters from the PDRC, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Surapong Tovijakchaikul said. After a series of recent outbreaks of violence, Thai authorities declared a state of emergency last week, giving extra powers to security forces.
