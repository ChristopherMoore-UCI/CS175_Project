With a lot of help from volunteers and donors, we've started a program this past spring that encourages hard work and is a fun way to get in shape," said FitWit instructor Ben Thoele. "Success for us is when a kid is thinking about fitness outside of the program, because they enjoy how they feel when they're in better shape," Thoele said. It's common to have a participant double their fitness ability," Thoele said. Each week, volunteers lead three 60-minute sessions that include fitness instruction and physical health education. FitWit's program is a six-week after-school boot camp competition which rewards participants with prizes for meeting fitness goals.
