But Bush will be leaning on a far deeper network of financial supporters that came together to back the winning presidential campaigns of his father, George H.W. Bush, and his brother, George W. Bush. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Monday night that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's steps toward a run for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination would have no bearing on his own decision about whether to jump into the race, a decision he will make later this year. Christie, who has faced many questions about his temperament as he has moved on to the national stage, also waved off questions about whether his brusque and sometimes confrontational manner would wear well over time. Bush's announcement last week that he was "actively exploring" a run was a blow to Christie's ambitions because the two men will be competing for many of the same donors as they test their viability as candidates. During an hour-long interview with Steve Adubato on NJTV, Christie said his decision would be based solely on three factors.
