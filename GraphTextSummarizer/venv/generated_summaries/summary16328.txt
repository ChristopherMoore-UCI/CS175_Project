-- What's at stake in the conflict between the West and Russia over Ukraine is not just the future of Crimea, it's the future of international order. Moscow has been consistent in viewing Ukraine as a satellite country but the West has constantly ignored the risk that Russia could use armed force there. Acting like an empire Beyond Ukraine, this conflict is also a defining moment for future Russian foreign policy. If the operation in Ukraine succeeds, it will scare many neighboring countries and prompt them to try to buy off Russia. Moscow has raised the stakes dramatically with a de facto annexation of this region, which is home of an important Russian naval base and inhabited by a population whose majority is oriented towards Russia (while an important minority, among them the Cossacks, is strongly attached to Ukraine).
