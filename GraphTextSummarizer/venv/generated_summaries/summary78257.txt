She is Christiane Head, scion of France's most famous racing dynasty; the first female racehorse trainer in France and the first woman to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, France's most prestigious race. "Ever since I was very small I wanted to be a trainer but my dad [Alec Head, a successful trainer and breeder in his own right] said, 'No, there are no female trainers in France. That was more than 30 years ago and I've been training ever since." Head, whose family trace their roots back to England, has trained for some of the biggest owners both inside and outside France and has won more than 100 Group races, including the Arc, which she captured in her first full season as a trainer. -- If anyone knows how to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, it's trainer Christiane Head. Sometimes I think we have more horse blood than human blood."
