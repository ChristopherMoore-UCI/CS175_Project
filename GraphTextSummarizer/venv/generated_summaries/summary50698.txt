Exposure therapy often helps the person with PTSD revisit or re-experience their trauma as a means of lessening the effect the memory has on them, said Dr. Albert "Skip" Rizzo, a psychiatrist who works with the military and has pioneered use of virtual reality for treating PTSD. "What happened this weekend with the death of former Navy Seal sniper Chris Kyle at a gun range is exactly the opposite of the evidence-based approach to treating PTSD," termed 'prolonged exposure' or 'virtual reality exposure' therapy, he said. In the general population about 7% of people experience PTSD, and there is a 60% chance of at-risk individuals -- combat veterans, victims of natural disasters or victims of violent crime -- experiencing PTSD, experts estimate. Thirty percent of service members who have fought in Iraq or Afghanistan have been diagnosed with PTSD, according to a Department of Veterans Affairs study released last year. It is never advisable to put someone with PTSD in an environment where there is likely to be uncontrolled exposure to provocative events -- such as gunfire and visuals of people shooting guns -- because this could stoke a flashback in the PTSD sufferer.
