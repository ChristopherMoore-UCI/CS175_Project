(The Frisky)  -- Virgin Airlines heir Sam Branson was hanging out with Andy Roddick, and couldn't resist challenging him to a bet. George Clooney was so convinced he'd still be childless and unmarried when he hit 40 that in 2001, he bet Nicole Kidman and Michelle Pfeiffer $10,000 each. Bruce Willis and Matthew Perry made a bet on the set of "The Whole Nine Yards." Andy Roddick played left-handed against Sam Branson and still won. Since celebrities have so much money to throw around, they often amuse themselves by placing weird bets.
