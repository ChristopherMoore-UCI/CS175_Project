The commission chairman called the acts the "latest sign of the rapidly deteriorating status of religious freedom and other human rights in Iran. The commission said other groups in the predominantly Shiite Muslim country of Iran, such Sufis and Christians, are subject to intimidation and harassment. A U.S. panel says attacks on Iran's Baha'is have increased since Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president. The group -- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- says the arrests are reminiscent of roundups and killings of Baha'is that took place in Iran two decades ago. The commission chairman, Michael Cromartie, echoed the fears that the "development signals a return to the darkest days of repression in Iran in the 1980s when Baha'is were routinely arrested, imprisoned, and executed."
