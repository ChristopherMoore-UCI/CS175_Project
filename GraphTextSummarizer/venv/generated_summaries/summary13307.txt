In a statement issued Thursday, Amnesty International said: "In the current humanitarian emergency in Somalia and amid massive violations of international humanitarian and human rights law, humanitarian workers, human rights defenders and journalists have been particular targets of all parties to the conflict." "We find this attack against one of our teams absolutely intolerable and a serious violation of the humanitarian action to which our late colleagues were so committed," Dr. Christophe Fournier, international council president of MSF, said in the news release. They are the indirect victims of such attacks on humanitarian workers." The medical aid charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres, is pulling international staff out of Somalia after three of its members were killed. The MSF members killed were Victor Okumu, 51, a Kenyan doctor; Damien Lehalle, 27, a French logistician; and a Somali driver named Billan.
