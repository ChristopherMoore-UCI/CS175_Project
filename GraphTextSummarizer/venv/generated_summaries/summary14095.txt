Another complicating factor in IMF negotiations is the fact that Mohamed Morsi, the Islamist president, is reluctant to introduce measures such as a sales tax ahead of parliamentary elections. The reform programme Egypt proposed to the IMF targets a reduction of the deficit from 10.9 per cent of gross domestic product in the current June fiscal year, to 9.5 per cent in the next year. Fearful of provoking social unrest at a time of political instability, the Egyptian programme favours small and hesitant steps towards the implementation of austerity measures aimed at raising additional revenue for the state and reducing energy subsidies that eat up a quarter of the budget. Hany Kadry Dimian, a senior ministry of finance official, told the Financial Times that with the latest increases, the fuel subsidy bill for the June 2013 fiscal year would be about $15bn, but that if no further cuts were introduced, the cost of the subsidy next year would rise to $22bn. The IMF, however, has informed Cairo that its proposed economic reform programme is not sufficiently robust.
