Of course, a big question for parents is whether talking about past drug use will make our children more or less likely to try drugs when they're older. Sue Scheff, an author and parenting expert, calls this a tricky issue for parents, namely because drugs are a "different animal" today than when we were in school. " On the other hand, if the children need rehab or detox, telling them you did drugs could become an excuse where they say, 'Mom did it, so why can't I?"" said Scheff. "They regarded me as a total anomaly who might not understand the pressures kids are facing today concerning drugs," said the children's television host and social media specialist, who is also a Babble.com contributor.
