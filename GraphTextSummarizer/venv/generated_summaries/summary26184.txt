-- Seattle Seahawks routed Denver Broncos Sunday 43-8 in one of the most one-sided contests in Super Bowl history to win the coveted Vince Lombardi trophy for the first time. Towards the end first quarter Manning was intercepted by Seattle safety Kam Chancellor at the Denver 39. AFC Champion Denver was undone by a toxic combination of Seattle's ruthless defense and its own errors, with famed quarterback Peyton Manning having a night to forget. Seattle quarterback Wilson had played a quietly effective game and his pass found Jermaine Kearse, who eluded some more weak defense to add the fourth TD towards the end of the third quarter before Demaryius Thomas finally got Denver on the scoreboard. It got worse for the 37-year-old veteran Manning as Seattle pressure forced him into another errant and off balance pass which was intercepted by Smith.
