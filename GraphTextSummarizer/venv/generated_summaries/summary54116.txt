Libya is facing a battle between government forces and rebel forces. Morale on the part of the opposition seems to be high, while morale among Gadhafi's forces -- which have seen defections as some members of the military have joined the protests -- seems low, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from eastern Libya. Protesters calling for the ouster of longtime leader Gadhafi have taken to the streets for a third week amid clashes with government forces. Opposition forces told CNN they were forging ahead, working to maintain their positions and fend off attacks by pro-Gadhafi forces. The refinery, Libya's second largest, is operating at 80% of its capacity, officials told CNN's Nic Robertson.
