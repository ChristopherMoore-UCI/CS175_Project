It took 19 months for the new genocide trial for former Guatemalan dictator Efrain Rios Montt to get under way, but just hours for it to be suspended. Some observers say they saw the invisible hand of the political elite at work when a court ordered Paz y Paz -- the attorney general who indicted Rios Montt -- to step down seven months before her term was to expire. A long and winding road The indictment of Rios Montt by then-Attorney General Claudia Paz y Paz was hailed by human rights groups. Shortly afterward, the judge who handed down the guilty verdict against Rios Montt, Yassmin Barrios, was suspended by the Guatemalan Bar Association for alleged ethics violations. For observers, the legal process against Rios Montt has been both historic and confounding at times.
