I wore a face mask for three years and pressure garments on my entire body; I wore dynamic splints on my hands, wrists and elbows to increase range of motion, daily dressing changes to my wounds and performing hourly exercises to restore function in all of my joints. I stayed there for 2Â½ years while I went through reconstructive surgeries to regain range of motion in my arms. I also lecture at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to occupational therapy students about all the adaptive equipment I use to live independently. My doctors did everything they could to help me regain range of motion in my arms. They taught me to be content in life no matter what the circumstances.
