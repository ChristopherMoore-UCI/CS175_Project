The department is looking into the women's allegations that school administrators brushed aside concerns about sexual violence on campus and failed to adequately investigate complaints of sexual assault. School administrators have disputed the cavalier attitude toward sexual assault alleged by the students, noting that UNC has removed sexual violence cases from the list of concerns handled by the school's honor court and appointed an administrator to deal directly with victims. The university created a 22-member task force to review and enhance its procedures for handling student-on-student complaints of harassment, sexual misconduct or discrimination. Gambill is one of several students who sparked a Department of Education investigation into how the university handles sex assault cases. In an e-mail to faculty and students on Thursday, Chancellor Holden Thorp said an outside review indicated no evidence of retaliation against Landen Gambill, who accused her ex-boyfriend of rape.
