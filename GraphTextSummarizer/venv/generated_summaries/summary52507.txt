Don't discount N. Korean stories after defector's recanting, advocates say Blaine Harden, author of the book "Escape from Camp 14," said in a statement on his website over the weekend that Shin had changed "key parts of his story. " "On Friday, Jan. 16, I learned that Shin Dong-hyuk, the North Korean prison camp survivor who is the subject of 'Escape from Camp 14,' had told friends an account of his life that differed substantially from my book," Harden said. In his Facebook post, Shin said he was not sure if he would be able to continue his efforts to end political prison camps in North Korea. A Washington Post story based on information Harden said he had provided to the newspaper said "the most horrific details" of Shin's story "still stand," but some of the times and places of the events in his accounts were wrong. Human rights activists argue that changes in Shin's account do not ultimately affect his testimony, saying they still believe he was tortured and that his story highlights the horror of prison camps.
