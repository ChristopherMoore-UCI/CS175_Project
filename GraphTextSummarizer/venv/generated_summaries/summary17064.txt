"While we are all aware that the U.S. does not take sides in disputes, they do have a strategic stake in the freedom of navigation, unimpeded commerce, and the maintenance of peace and stability in the South China Sea." Alan Dupont, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said that the while U.S. was happy to push China to the table, it was unlikely to step directly into trying to resolve the issue. Cambodia's statement on Sunday that ASEAN's 10 leaders had agreed not to "internationalize" the South China Sea dispute by limiting the body to direct negotiations with China provoked an an angry rebuke by the Philippines, which said there was no consensus. -- U.S. President Barack Obama met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday, the first top-level meeting between the two countries since the presidential election and a power transition in China. During the summit, ASEAN leaders clashed publicly about how to handle a bitter territorial dispute in the South China Sea and what role the U.S. should play in resolving it. "The U.S. is not a claimant in the South China Sea dispute but it does have an interest in maintaining freedom of navigation," he said.
