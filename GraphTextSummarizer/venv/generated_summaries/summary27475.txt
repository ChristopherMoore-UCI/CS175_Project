By refusing NBC's offer of a "Tonight Show" shifted to a post-midnight, post-Jay Leno time slot, host Conan O'Brien has protected the 56-year-old tradition of that program. And once Leno hit prime time and began hemorrhaging viewers, things only got worse -- for prime time, for the NBC affiliates and their weakened late-news operations and for O'Brien himself. What do you think about NBC's late-night conundrum? NBC, which announced years ago it would hand the reins of "The Tonight Show" from Leno to O'Brien, was hoping for an orderly transition. Yet NBC, rather than admit to a bad idea or two, made a third, by promising Leno a return to late-night at 11:35 p.m. in exchange for canceling the prime-time "Jay Leno Show." The only good decision NBC has made in this entire process has been to reverse its own decision to put Leno on weeknights in prime time in the first place.
