It also looks like the Kindle was also tested in the same way: "With up to two months on a single charge, the all-new Nook has the longest battery life in the industry and superior battery performance to Kindle 3. "While reading at one page a minute, the all-new Nook battery lasts for 150 hours, where the Kindle battery, using the same page-turn rate, lasts for only 56 hours (both with Wi-Fi off). The field of battle is the ghostly ground of press releases and promo-page blurb, and the last word seems to have been had by B&N. After B&N laid out the specs for its new e-reader, Amazon took issue with the numbers, saying that B&N's claim rested on usage tests of just a half hour of use per day, with wireless switched off. However this works out, it's certain that both e-readers have insane battery life compared to any other kind of gadget. In our side-by-side tests, under the exact same conditions, continuous use of the device resulted in more than two times Kindle's battery life.
