The news comes at an especially interesting time given the recent expiration of Apple's free iPhone 4 case program (which included Apple's no closed-back bumper), and the reported beginnings of mass production for a CDMA version of the iPhone said to be coming to Verizon in early 2011. This wouldn't be the first time cracks have cropped up on Apple's hardware, or the iPhone line for that matter. If Apple is planning to bring any physical design changes to that version of the iPhone, a back that's susceptible to cracking could very well be holding up that process. That's according to a report today from Gdgt, which says that slip-on cases -- the kind that cover the back and sometimes front of the iPhone 4, have been the cause of serious cosmetic damage with the backside of the iPhone. This has become a big enough problem, the report says, that Apple's engineers have been hard at work in "a quiet lockdown," testing various third-party cases to see how widespread the problem is, and presumably to make sure it does not happen with future iterations of the device.
