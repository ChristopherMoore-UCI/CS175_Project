West Indies had lost their last one-day international series against South Africa 4-1 and managed a meager 122 runs in their World Cup warm-up match against England. Former England player Ed Joyce was the most eye-catching of the Irish batsmen with a blistering knock of the 84 runs from 67 balls, while Paul Stirling top scored 92 and Niall O'Brien finished the innings unbeaten on 79. Ireland continued their trademark giant killing with the first shock of this cricket World Cup by defeating West Indies by four wickets. Ireland were set a target of 305 to win the game, with just four successful run chances above 300 having ever been achieved in World Cup history. The once dominant force of global cricket -- West Indies won two World Cups in the 1970s with a mixture of fearsome pace bowling and swashbuckling batting -- the current crop of players looked disenchanted on the field throughout the match.
