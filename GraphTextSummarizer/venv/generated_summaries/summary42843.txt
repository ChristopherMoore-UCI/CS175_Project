Strict building codes and the preparedness of millions of Chileans who live along an arc of volcanoes and fault lines likely kept the death toll -- only six by Wednesday afternoon -- low after an 8.2-magnitude earthquake rumbled offshore and prompted a tsunami, observers said. The keys to surviving the big ones Chile has over the years implemented strict building codes and rigorous evacuation plans, experts said. Bachelet said Chile faced the "first emergency hours very well" and Defense Minister Jorge Burgos said things were calm on Wednesday. The report found that Haiti's quake, which struck closer to the surface than in Chile, was "no match for the homes and buildings. " "In Haiti, in addition to [lack of strict] building codes, you have a population that doesn't have a regular historical experience of large quakes like this," Bellini said.
