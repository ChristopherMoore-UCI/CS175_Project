The airline has lost an estimated $219 million due to the Japan earthquake and tsunami, Queensland floods, Cyclones Yasi and Carlos, and the Christchurch earthquake. Rolls-Royce agreed to compensate the airline in a deal worth US $100 million, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said at a news conference. At Wednesday's news conference, Joyce also updated the company's financial outlook, forecasting annual profit before tax of between US $530 million to $580 million, despite a major impact from weather events and natural disasters. Joyce addressed the struggle of Australia's flagship carrier to turnaround its international business which hasn't kept pace with competitors, alluding that major changes will be made later this year. -- Qantas has reached a settlement with engine-maker Rolls Royce over a 2010 incident that grounded its entire Airbus A380 fleet.
