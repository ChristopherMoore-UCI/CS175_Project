'Real Housewives of New Jersey' stars Teresa and Joe Giudice sentenced On Monday night, both Giudices sat down with Bravo's Andy Cohen for the first part of an interview featured on Cohen's "Watch What Happens Live." As "Real Housewives of New Jersey" star Teresa Giudice faces a 15-month prison term that's set to start in January, it's no surprise she's also been dealing with "sleepless nights." The reality star and her husband, Joe Giudice, were sentenced Thursday to serve time after pleading guilty in March to numerous federal fraud charges. I've had sleepless nights. Being away from her kids, Giudice told Cohen, is what scares her most about prison -- more than the lockup itself.
