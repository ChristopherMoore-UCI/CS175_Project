"The Hatton Garden area has been the epicentre of London's jewellery trade since medieval times. Thieves using heavy cutting equipment and rappelling gear broke into the vault of an esteemed 60-year-old safe deposit company in the heart of London over the past holiday weekend, possibly taking advantage of as many as four days to rifle through an uncounted number of safe deposit boxes. Police were offering few details Wednesday of the robbery at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. Many of those who rent safe deposit boxes at the company are reportedly in the jewelry trade. Hatton Garden is a storied area in London and the heart of the city's diamond trade.
