"The government should attach importance to the rising tensions between doctors and patients, and think about what caused the current situation," said Deng Liqiang, head of the association's legal department. "Only China adopts a 'reverse onus' principle in dealing with doctor-patient disputes, which assumes that doctors are guilty and are asked for evidence to prove their innocence," said Chen Xue, a resident at the Peking Medical University Hospital. "Hospitals here are often understaffed and have to cater to large number of patients," noted an Asian physician who works in a Beijing hospital. In some cases, according to various reports by Chinese media, hospitals have reportedly demanded that patients pay much of their likely bill before treatment. Some 55.6% of respondents said the society is simply prejudiced against the medical profession, 23.5% of doctors did not properly communicate with their patients and 20.6% said treatment cannot meet patients' high expectations.
