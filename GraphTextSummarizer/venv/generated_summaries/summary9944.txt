-- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was sworn in Wednesday as a lawmaker for the first time, a key step in the country's recent shift toward democracy after decades of repressive military rule. Her presence in parliament Wednesday illustrates the pace at which Myanmar is changing: She was released from house arrest less than a year and a half ago. She added that her decision had been encouraged by voters, parliament members and representatives of Myanmar's ethnic minority groups. Suu Kyi led her party to a landslide victory the previous time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990. A genuine transition toward multi-party democracy leading to general elections in 2015 will help build a more prosperous society," Clinton said in a statement, using the other name for Myanmar.
