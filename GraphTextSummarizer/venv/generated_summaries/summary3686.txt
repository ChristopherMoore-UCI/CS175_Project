-- A medical team in Serbia has determined that war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic is in good enough shape to be extradited to face a war crimes tribunal, a court spokeswoman in Belgrade said Friday. But Bruno Vekaric, the deputy prosecutor of Serbia's Special Court for War Crimes, dismissed the family's account of Mladic's health as a defense ploy. An angry Mladic accused Vekaric of being a CIA agent but apologized Friday, the deputy prosecutor said. Mladic was the highest-ranking fugitive to remain at large after the conflicts that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Mladic is in a jail near Belgrade facing charges that he presided over Europe's worst massacre since World War II.
