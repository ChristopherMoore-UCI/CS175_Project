The incident took place ahead of England's World Cup qualifying match away to neighboring Kazakhstan on Saturday. A British Foreign Office spokeswoman said the attack took place in a bar in Bishek on Tuesday. England will be seeking to maintain a 100 per cent record in the European Group Six qualifier in Almaty, having won all five games so far to be five points ahead of second-placed Croatia. Britain's Sun newspaper reported on Thursday that the local in the bar told the England fan and his friends to stop chanting, and shot him in the thigh with a pistol when they continued. Kyrgyzstan, with a population of more than five million people, is a landlocked nation bordered to the north by Kazakhstan.
