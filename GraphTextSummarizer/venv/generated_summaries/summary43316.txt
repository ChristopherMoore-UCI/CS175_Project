California governor seeks $315 million for prison fix The hunger strikers had other demands, including warmer clothing, better mattresses and better food. Inmates in several prisons were demanding an end to long-term solitary confinement and a halt to what is known as the "debriefing" policy, in which inmates are required to provide information on prison gangs to get out of solitary. The strike's leaders were in the maximum-security prison at Pelican Bay, near the Oregon state line, but inmates in other lockups were encouraged to add their own demands. Forty of those had been on strike since the start of the protest, on July 8, Corrections Department spokeswoman Dana Simas said. As of Wednesday, there were 100 inmates on hunger strike.
