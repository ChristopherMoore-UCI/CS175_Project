Daley died about 6 p.m. at home "surrounded by family, including her husband, former Mayor Richard Daley, and her children, Nora, Patrick and Elizabeth," said Jacquelyn Heard, Daley's former spokeswoman and a family friend. "The mayor and his family would like to thank the people of Chicago for the many kindnesses they've shown Mrs. Daley over the years, and they appreciate your prayers during this time," Heard said. " President Barack Obama described her as "an extraordinary woman who dedicated her life to public service," including programs to benefit Chicago youth. "While she will be sorely missed, her initiatives on behalf of Chicago's youth live on as national models for how to create environments for children to learn and grow outside the classroom," Obama said in a statement. -- Maggie Daley, the wife of a former Chicago mayor, died Thursday night after battling breast cancer.
