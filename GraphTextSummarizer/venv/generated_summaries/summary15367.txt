Music and other media content got another boost Tuesday with Apple announcing plans that could move iTunes into the cloud. Although the iPods were largely overshadowed by Tuesday's iPhone 4S news, Apple CEO Tim Cook also announced a handful of tweaks to Apple's iconic music-player line -- in plenty of time, of course, for the holiday shopping season. It's clear Apple wants to move completely to touchscreen and abandon the old-fashioned click wheel on the Classic and Shuffle (the Nano's click wheel disappeared last year). It will work with apps and allow content to be stored on remote servers instead of the users' iPod, iPhone or other device. The new Touch, now the most popular iPod, will be available in both black and white and get a $30 price cut, to $199 for 8GB of storage, $299 for 32 gigs and $399 for 64.
