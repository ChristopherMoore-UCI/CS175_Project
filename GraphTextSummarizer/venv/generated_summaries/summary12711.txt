Greece's vast, derelict, symbol of hope Hellinikon airport was once Greece's flagship terminal and hub for international travel, but has been abandoned since its closure in 2001. -- Greece is hoping a derelict airport on the outskirts of Athens -- one which has sparked a keen contest among international investors -- will help solve its debt woes. Greece's islands, which draw tourist dollars and showcase the country's beauty, have previously been flagged as potential investment gold. Greece is awaiting a financial lifeline of 31.5 billion euros [$40.3 billion] from international creditors, following the approval of a 13.5 billion euro austerity package by Greek lawmakers earlier this month. Proposals from foreign investors are first considered by a board of directors and overseen by representatives from Greece's international creditors, known as the "troika."
