Editor's note: Fareed Zakaria is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts "Fareed Zakaria GPS" on CNN on Sundays at 1 and 5 p.m. ET Fareed Zakaria says Rwanda is Africa's biggest success story. President Obama reached out to Africa earlier this week with a wide-ranging address praising the continent's steady achievements, but he called its persistent violent conflicts "a millstone around Africa's neck." "Despite the progress that has been made -- and there has been considerable progress in parts of Africa -- we also know that much of that promise has yet to be fulfilled," Obama said in a speech to the Parliament of Ghana, a western African nation seen as a model of democracy and growth for the rest of the continent. CNN spoke to author and foreign affairs analyst Fareed Zakaria about Obama's trip and the status of Africa. In each village, the killers stood before their neighbors and confessed, and in turn were offered forgiveness -- part court, and part community council. In Rwanda, however, the killers and the victims live side-by-side, in every village and community.
