Rep. Maxine Waters, for instance, has recently chided him for failing to craft policies that would explicitly target black unemployment and for otherwise neglecting, in her view, to evince a proper acknowledgment of the baleful and disproportionate pain being experienced in black communities on account of the economic downturn. The great bulk of black American voters -- upward of 90% -- supported Obama in 2008 and do so today. " Second, Obama's black detractors receive a degree of attention in the news media that is far greater than their representativeness of black America or their influence within it. Still, the sobering reality is that race remains an important, persistent force in American life despite the presence of a black family in the White House. Moreover, as I document in "Sellout: The Politics of Racial Betrayal," there exists in black America a special anxiety about the loyalties of high achievers, especially when their success is largely dependent on whites and others who are not black.
