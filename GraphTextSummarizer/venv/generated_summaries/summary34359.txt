Even as Ryan fires up conservatives, he may also mobilize votes for Obama -- including senior citizens who reside in key swing states like Florida. All in all, Romney has a tough battle ahead -- even stringent counts of Electoral College votes based on polls show Obama within striking distance of winning. Pluralities of Ohio and Florida independents report that Obama's re-election would hurt their personal financial situation. And, it may produce a campaign focused a bit more on policy than on birth certificates, service records and the other side issues of recent elections. This possible weakness in the Democratic coalition coincides with a bit more slippage among Obama's 2008 supporters (9%) than among McCain voters who won't vote GOP in November (5%).
