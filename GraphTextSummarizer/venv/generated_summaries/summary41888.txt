"Church discipline is not designed to be the end of the process," church spokesmen said, "but the beginning of the road back to full fellowship." Dehlin, who has run the Mormon Stories podcast and a related website for about a decade, told NPR that he stopped attending church last year. Dehlin has said that he suspects his support for female ordination and same-sex marriage, both of which Mormon leaders oppose, was behind the effort to excommunicate him. King said that Dehlin was not excommunicated for criticizing the church, which he has openly admitted to, but for denying core Mormon doctrines. "Church disciplinary trials are usually kept private, but when the member has chosen to air their grievances in public, the Church reserves the right to correct the public record," Mormon leaders said in a statement. Tuesday's excommunication was announced in a letter to Dehlin from Brian King, the stake president, or local church leader, in North Logan, Utah.
