My most vivid memory of the moment was watching the two men embrace after the oath of office (the first one). No need to waste time commuting and spending money on a place where I don't intend to be spending much time. On January 6, 2009, I, too, raised my right hand and was administered the oath of office. Being a member of Congress is nothing short of amazing, but the worst part is not being able to go home to my family at night. At 12:52 a.m. during the first week, the "Capitol Early Warning System" was tested.
