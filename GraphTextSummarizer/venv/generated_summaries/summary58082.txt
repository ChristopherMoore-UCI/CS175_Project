With the rise of mobile phones over the past decade, pay phones have been disappearing. Several pilot programs in New York already use existing payphone infrastructure, from digital advertising on phone kiosks in Times Square to interactive touchscreens around Union Square. Nationwide, the number of pay phones has dropped from approximately 2.1 million in 1999 to around 425,000 today. But thanks to some new initiatives, pay phones may not be doomed to fade from the urban landscape like penny-farthings and oil-lit street lamps. More than 750 million calls are placed on pay phones per year, he said.
