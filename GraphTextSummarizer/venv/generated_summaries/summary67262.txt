HP is set to replenish the supply of TouchPad tablets this week, spokeswoman Bryna Corcoran said in a statement on Sunday. HP CEO Leo Apotheker has said the company has explored licensing deals for webOS with other electronics manufacturers. HP will also drop the price on the Pre3 smartphone to $75, which will not be sold in U.S. stores, a second spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. While HP intends to stop making devices that run the company's downtrodden mobile operating system, Richard Kerris, an HP vice president, wrote in a message to developers on Friday saying his team plans to continue developing the software. The two TouchPad models have shot to the top spots on Amazon.com's list of best-selling electronics.
