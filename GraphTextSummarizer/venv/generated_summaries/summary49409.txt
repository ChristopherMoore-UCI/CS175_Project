By the Numbers 8,000 Approximate number of wildebeests born each day in Tanzania's Serengeti National Park, from December through March 29 Number of elephants per square mile at Botswana's Chobe National Park -- some 120,000 in all 19,300 Size, in square miles, of Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, Africa's largest national park (about the same area as 19 Rhode Islands!) On the approachable end of the spectrum, Kenya and South Africa are among the easiest-to-navigate nations in Africa. A weeklong trip is typically at least $4,000: Guided safaris start at roughly $250 per person per day -- and that's before you've paid for airfare to Africa. "Personally, I think you're missing out if you never see a rain shower in Africa -- they're spectacular," says Bill Given, a biologist and researcher at the Denver Zoo who also guides custom safaris for his company, The Wild Source. Africa's a big place.
