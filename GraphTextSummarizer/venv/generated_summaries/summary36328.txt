Anyway, one song in particular on the new album that seemed to be immediately tugging at the gag reflex of most people on Twitter was the Kidz Bop remake of "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen who, in 2007, finished third on "Canadian Idol." On Monday afternoon, something called Kidz Bop was trending on Twitter. " The Kidz Bop people tout their CDs as "today's biggest hits sung by kids for kids," and this particular volume contains remakes of 16 pop songs that I've absolutely never heard. And much better than my standard pickup line: "So, you ride Greyhound often?" A while back, Justin Bieber actually praised "Call Me Maybe" on Twitter, which instantly made it popular, spawning video lip dub remakes by everyone from Katy Perry to the Harvard baseball team. The Kidz Bop music series is targeted to children aged 5 to 12, and, according to its website, has sold more than 11 million CDs.
