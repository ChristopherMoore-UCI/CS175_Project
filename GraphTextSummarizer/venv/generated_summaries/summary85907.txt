New Mexico law requires anyone under age 15 to be charged in juvenile court, no matter how violent the crime is, said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. Raja was referring to a list of school violence compiled by CNN tracing violence in U.S. schools, including shootings in middle and elementary schools. But last year, when the boy turned age 14, he was charged with first-degree murder -- in juvenile court. It varies from state to state." Still, the 12-year-old suspect could face a serious charge in New Mexico juvenile court. "It's a very complex case, and we need to make sure we get it right," New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said of his investigators' work with prosecutors in preparing juvenile court charges.
