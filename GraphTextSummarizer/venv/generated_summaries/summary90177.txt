Early polls indicate that at least one of them will indeed vote in favor of marriage equality, which is a victory for the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. This is why our history has so many civil rights victories come by way of Congress or the courts and so few if any civil rights victories by election. Though it's a bit of a shame that the Constitution needs such victories and that history has taught us nothing. We like the Constitution when it can be used to endorse life the way we think it ought to be and we ignore it, or vote against it when the Bill of Rights or the various amendments challenge our world view or force us to make accommodations -- however big or small -- for others. and so I am not surprised that all 32 states that have voted on marriage equality, voted against marriage equality.
