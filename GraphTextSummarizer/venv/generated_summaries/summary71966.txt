We went offshore to an oil rig in the North Sea to see how in Norway they manage to produce the greenest barrel of oil in the world. Oil is a commodity that really influences world markets and geopolitics. We get a third of the world's energy from oil, and even optimistic forecasts say it will play a significant part in meeting future energy demands. Some were in Norwegian waters, some in British waters. But the environmentalists we spoke to were all united in calling for an end to the world's, and Norway's, addiction to oil.
