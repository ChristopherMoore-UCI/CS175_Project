"We experienced 'Fukushima's Revenge,'" yacht owner John Sangmeister told CNN by satellite phone hours after his boat sustained significant damage after hitting two telephone poles and other objects. Exhausted Friday from having received little sleep over five days, the boat's captain, Ryan Breymaier, told CNN he was largely blaming what's become a disturbing reality on the high seas: plumes of drifting junk. Shortly after dawn Friday, the crew was just beginning to take vacation time in Hawaii, after a night of post-race celebrations. The racing crew set out Saturday to be the first competitors in an annual Transpacific Yacht Race to beat Bruno Peyron's 1997 record of traveling from Los Angeles to Honolulu on an 86-foot catamaran in five days, nine hours, 18 minutes, and 26 seconds. "The fact of the modern world is that this stuff is out there," Breymaier said.
