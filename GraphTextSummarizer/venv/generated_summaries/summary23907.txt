A man arrested after a knife attack on two soldiers on the streets of Nice in southern France was already known to intelligence services as having been radicalized, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said Wednesday. Officials cannot confirm he's related to Amedy Coulibaly, the man who killed a police officer in the Paris suburb of Montrouge, then took hostages in a kosher grocery in the French capital, a standoff that ended with him and four hostages dead. An official in the Turkish prime ministry told CNN on Tuesday that French intelligence was aware of Coulibaly and had alerted Turkish officials when he flew to Istanbul's Ataturk Airport from Rome on Thursday. The notification meant that when the suspect got on a plane to Turkey last month, an alert was raised, and Turkish authorities expelled him, Cazeneuve said. Intelligence services had detected the suspect's radicalization in the Yvelines area, west of Paris, Cazeneuve said.
