-- As Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu defends her U.S. Senate seat in Louisiana, a new CNN/ORC International poll indicates the third-term incumbent carries a slim advantage over her closest GOP rival in the general election this November. And Republicans, including Cassidy, seized on a recent photo showing Landrieu helping a Louisiana State University fan perform a keg stand during a tailgate party. If the horse race in Louisiana stays relatively the same, Landrieu and Cassidy would be the two candidates heading into the runoff -- and that's when things flip. Like many Democrats in tight re-election bids from reddish states, Landrieu has also kept President Barack Obama at arm's length due to his low approval ratings. The CNN/ORC poll shows that only 40% of Louisiana voters approve of the job Obama is doing in office.
