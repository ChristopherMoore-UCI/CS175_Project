-- There's a classic rap song from the early 1990s called "It Was a Good Day" where Ice Cube chronicles 24 hours of peace and happiness on the otherwise rough and dangerous streets of South Central Los Angeles. But Goodyear must agree to fly the blimp and light up the sky with ICE CUBE'S A PIMP. I spoke with two of the project creators, Jon Barco and Andy Dao, and they explained that their goal is to raise a bunch of money and then guilt-trip (my words) the Goodyear company into flying their iconic airship high in the sky on January 20 while spelling out in lights: ICE CUBE'S A PIMP. Andy Dao told me they want to "rally the masses to donate money ... in hopes to put enough social pressure on Goodyear." *** Update: It was a 'good day' for Ice Cube ***
