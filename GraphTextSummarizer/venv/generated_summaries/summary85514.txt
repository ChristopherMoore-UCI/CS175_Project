DeBolt said security researchers are looking through old malware programs to see if their programming styles are similar to that of Conficker C. -- A computer-science detective story is playing out on the Internet as security experts try to hunt down a worm called Conficker C and prevent it from damaging millions of computers on April Fool's Day. That process-of-elimination approach isn't likely to be effective with Conficker strain C, Morganelli said. DeBolt said Conficker C imbeds itself deep in the computer where it is difficult to track. The first iteration of Conficker is thought to have grown out of a free function for security programs created by Dr. Ronald Rivest, a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
