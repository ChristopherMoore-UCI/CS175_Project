"The pattern of coverage gains was consistent with the effects of the ACA, with major gains for persons likely to be eligible for expanded Medicaid on the basis of their income and state of residence, but smaller and nonsignificant changes for low-income adults in states without Medicaid expansion," the study said. "The Gallup data, which draws on an enormous sample, paint a compelling picture, finding a substantial drop in uninsurance since the beginning of the first open enrollment period, precisely where we would expect to see it -- in states that expanded Medicaid coverage and in income groups targeted by Medicaid or the new subsidies for coverage," said Genevieve Kenney, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute. "This study also reaffirms that expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is important for coverage, as well as a good deal for states." The study found that the number of uninsured adults fell by a little over 5% nationally, from 21% in September 2013 to 16.3% in April 2014, with the most significant declines in the 26 states that expanded Medicaid under the health law. About 10.3 million Americans gained health coverage this year, primarily as a result of the Affordable Care Act, according to a study by the federal government and Harvard University, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
