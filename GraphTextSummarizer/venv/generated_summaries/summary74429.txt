Moab is known for its red-rock landscapes and proximity to Arches National Park and Canyonlands National Park. Brown disappeared June 29 in the vicinity of Skydive Moab, northwest of the town, said owner Clint MacBeth. "It's an extremely rough area," Moab Police Chief Mike Navarre told CNN Salt Lake City affiliate KSL. According to MacBeth, friends initially assumed Brown had gone to Las Vegas to visit his girlfriend. MacBeth found Brown's personal items, including an unspent paycheck.
