Harrington -- who began rallying the techie troops almost as soon as ABC announced that Wozniak would be competing -- said he is rooting for the philanthropist because "he puts more heart and more passion in what he's doing than some of the other dancers." The dance team with the lowest combined score is then voted off the show -- a fate that may await Wozniak on Tuesday night. Joe Patane is a longtime friend of Wozniak's and one of the officers for the official "Vote for Woz on ABC's 'Dancing With the Stars' " Facebook group. Despite dancing through injuries -- including a pulled hamstring that sent him to the hospital in an ambulance last week -- Wozniak failed to impress the experts Monday night. He won an autographed copy of the book "iWoz" for submitting a video of himself imitating Wozniak's dance moves to VoteWoz.com.
