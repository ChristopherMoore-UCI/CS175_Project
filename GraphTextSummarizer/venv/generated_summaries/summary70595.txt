The complaint filed Friday says that King's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., but that Bernice King has "secreted and sequestered" the items in question. Bernice King alleges her brothers Dexter King and Martin Luther King III want to sell the objects, and she told reporters that she won't stand by to let it happen. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting "substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America" for his own use. -- The daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said Thursday that her brothers won't take King's Nobel Peace Prize and traveling Bible from her without a fight. And to anyone who would shake their head at yet another court battle between the King siblings, Bernice has a message: "I would appreciate it if you would refrain from grouping me with my brothers," she said.
