If anyone was protesting in Marlins Park, it was not discernible over the gametime buzz of a pitching duel between Marlins ace Josh Johnson and the Cubs' Ryan Dempster. -- Manager Ozzie Guillen was back in the dugout Tuesday night after serving a five-game suspension imposed by the Miami Marlins for his comments praising former Cuban leader Fidel Castro and angering the city's sizable Cuban-American population. Guillen, in his first season as Marlins manager, told reporters before a game against the Chicago Cubs. The Castro comment controversy appeared to have settled down Tuesday night as Guillen took his spot in the dugout for the game with the Cubs. After those comments, demonstrators rallied outside the Marlins' new $634 million stadium to denounce Guillen.
