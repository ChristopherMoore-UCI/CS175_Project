Instruct students to develop a proclamation of their own using this year's theme, "Writing Women Back into History," which recognizes the importance of women in all aspects of history. Women in the Military Inform students that the U.S. Navy is currently considering allowing women to serve on submarines. Women in Government Have students use the Internet and other resources to generate a list of some of the women currently holding positions in government, including, but not limited to, U.S. Supreme Court justices, state governors, members of the president's cabinet, and members of the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Next, instruct teams to research the roles that women have played in their assigned fields throughout American history. After teams present their information, instruct the full class to design a new memorial in Washington, D.C. that focuses on the contributions of women to American history.
