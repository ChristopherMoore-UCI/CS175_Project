Photos: Gay celebs and marriage "When I really, truly came out was at the Golden Globes, when 'Arrested Development' was nominated," said de Rossi, who started seeing DeGeneres around the end of 2004. De Rossi, now 40, recalled the moment on "Inside the Actor's Studio" Thursday, as she sat among her "Arrested Development" co-stars. As de Rossi explained, it actually wasn't that long before she tied the knot with DeGeneres in an intimate ceremony in Los Angeles that she was totally transparent about her sexuality. The program's host, James Lipton, had been asking de Rossi about her name change -- she took DeGeneres' last name in 2010 -- and the couple's 2008 marriage. She's also the woman who stood by the actress when de Rossi truly came out as a gay woman to the public.
