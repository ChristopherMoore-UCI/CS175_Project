Professional climbers Tommy Caldwell and Kevin Jorgeson may be hours away from reaching a new height: the top of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park. If they succeed, Caldwell and Jorgeson would be the first to successfully free-climb the Dawn Wall, Yosemite National Park officials confirmed. The route Caldwell and Jorgenson are attempting is the notoriously difficult Dawn Wall, more than a half mile high. An accomplished climber, Caldwell already completed five other routes on El Capitan, according to his bio. The team attempted an earlier push on the project several years ago, but were shut down due to weather, according to Caldwell's Facebook page.
