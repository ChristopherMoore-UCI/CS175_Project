What do you say, sexy Boyfriend Pillow?" "I want a Hot Pocket." Nobody blames you for murdering Uncle Dave; everyone's just too happy to see your sweet punim back at home. Feel the warmth and security as you curl its plush arm around your body and rest your head on the half-chested slab of memory foam that oddly happens to be wearing a full button-down shirt to bed. In promoting the Boyfriend Pillow, they write: "This fun and cozy snuggle pillow is excellent for people whose partner is away on military leave or work absence. Maybe you're still trying to rationalize the fact that your projectile shirt button flew across the dinner table and killed Uncle Dave.
