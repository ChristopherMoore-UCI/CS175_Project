"The only way to protect us in the U.S. is to stop it at the source, and to build systems both in Africa and the U.S. that will find, stop and prevent Ebola," said Frieden, likening the spread of Ebola virus to a wild fire. As Ebola fades from the headlines, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other top federal health officials made their case for a multi-billion dollar emergency fund to fight the virus in a congressional hearing Tuesday. The second death from Ebola in the U.S. occurred this week: Martin Salia, a doctor who contracted the disease when treating patients in Sierra Leone, died Monday in Nebraska. In his remarks, the President admitted that media attention over the crisis has ebbed in recent weeks as the number of American Ebola patients has decreased -- but insisted that future risks can be minimized if Congress acts now. "We are nowhere near out of the woods yet in West Africa," Obama said, noting the increasing number of Ebola contractions in Sierra Leone.
