"Ocoa Bay has three pillars, one is the production of high quality wine and fruit cultivation, the others are the hotels and the real estate sector," Acevedo said. Now, a new vineyard and real estate development is looking to tap into this wine-making history by providing the Caribbean's 21st-century own take on enotourism. The Ocoa Bay development lies 90-minutes drive from the capital, Santo Domingo and offers newly built homes with specially designed vineyard plots that allow residents to produce their own wine. A little over five centuries ago, the unassuming district of Ocoa Bay in the Dominican Republic became the first wine-producing region of the Americas. Project leaders say they spent time with ecology, land management and wildlife consultants before commencing building work in an effort to minimize any negative environmental impacts.
