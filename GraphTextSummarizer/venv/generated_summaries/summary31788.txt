Before Hadi took power, the Yemeni government had been engulfed in anti-Saleh protests and for years has been fighting al Qaeda militants. -- Yemen's new president on Saturday promised to continue the fight against al Qaeda, calling it "a religious and national duty" for citizens of his restive nation. Saleh faced a separatist movement in the south, sectarian tensions in the north and the growing presence of what Western officials describe as al Qaeda's most dangerous affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Hadi -- who served as Saleh's vice president and became acting president in November in an agreement brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council -- was sworn in before Yemen's parliament. Speaking about the fight against al Qaeda, Hadi said he hoped an effort to eradicate militants would lead to the return of displaced persons to their towns and villages.
