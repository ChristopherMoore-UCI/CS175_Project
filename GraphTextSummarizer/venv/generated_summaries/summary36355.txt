This is the first image in which Saturn, its moons and rings, and Earth, Venus and Mars are all visible, NASA said. NASA has given the people of Earth a rare treat: A color mosaic that captures not only Saturn, but also the tiny dots of Earth and other planets in the background. Cassini images showing both Saturn and Earth are rare because the sun is so close to Earth, that targeting the blue planet would damage Cassini's sensors, NASA says. Earth appears as a bright blue dot to Saturn's lower right, just above Saturn's outer, halo-like E-ring. People shared more than 1,400 images of themselves from that event, and in August, NASA released a collage of those pictures assembled to look like -- from a distance -- a portion of Earth's Western Hemisphere.
