"I think this is going to be with us for a number of days," Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy told reporters Saturday morning. -- Federal investigators ruled out foul play in a commuter train derailment in Bridgeport, Connecticut, that left more than 70 people injured and shut down service along the busy New York-to-New Haven corridor, officials said Saturday. The accident occurred when a train heading from New York City to New Haven derailed around 6:10 p.m. That train struck the other train in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Weener said Saturday. 'Absolutely staggering damage' The damage to the tracks and several train cars is "absolutely staggering," said U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, who visited the site with other officials Saturday. Because of a bridge replacement project, those two tracks are the only way in and out of New York City by train from that part of Connecticut.
