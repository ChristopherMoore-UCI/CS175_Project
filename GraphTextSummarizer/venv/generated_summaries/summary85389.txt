At night, flames are visible on the ridges of the Jemez Mountains, which separate River's and other Santa Fe, New Mexico, homes from the situation to the west in Los Alamos. Voluntary evacuations began Sunday evening in Los Alamos and White Rock, a town southeast of Los Alamos, but quickly became mandatory for Los Alamos residents by Tuesday, according to InciWeb. Not only have dry conditions and gusty winds threatened the growth of the fires, but residents in Santa Fe and Los Alamos, including River, fear the effect the Las Conchas fire will have on the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a nuclear science center. Doug Tucker, the Los Alamos fire chief, said the Las Conchas fire touches the south border of the lab's 40-square-mile facility, and comes close to the west border. "I look out my front door and see the Pacheco fire and I look out my back door and see the Los Alamos fire," said River.
