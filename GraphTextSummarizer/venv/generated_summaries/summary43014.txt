"The container was apple juice but it had margarita mix in it," Dill-Reese said. Police were called to the Madison Heights restaurant on Friday evening after the parents of Dominic Wilson Jr. noticed their son acting strange during a family dinner. -- A 15-month-old was hospitalized after a behind-the-bar mix-up at a Michigan Applebee's restaurant that left the toddler sipping alcohol instead of apple juice. Wilson was immediately rushed to the hospital, where his blood alcohol content was measured at 0.10, Dill-Reese said. At first, Dill-Reese blamed his odd behavior on lack of sleep.
