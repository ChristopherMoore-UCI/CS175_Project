Hurricane Julio, a Category 2 storm with 100 mph winds at the latest update, is expected to weaken and push north of Hawaii over the weekend, forecasters said. U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz faces a challenge from U.S. Rep. Colleen Hanabusa. Hawaii's most damaging hurricane in recent decades -- Hurricane Iniki of 1992 -- came during an El Nino year, or a year of above-average sea surface temperatures.
