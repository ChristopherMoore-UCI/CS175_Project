-- Pope Francis is being painted as a humble and simple man, but his past is tinged with controversy surrounding topics as sensitive as gay marriage and political atrocities. Although the allegations against Francis have never been proved, they continue to haunt him, so much so that the human rights group Center for Legal and Social Studies in Argentina opposes Francis' selection as pope. The gay marriage issue came to the forefront during Francis' political fight with Argentina's president. Many of the allegations against Francis were researched by Argentine journalist Horacio Verbitsky, who wrote a book about the church's role during the dictatorship. Francis was not lashing out at just the bill but at what he saw as a larger effort by the government to divide the country along political lines.
