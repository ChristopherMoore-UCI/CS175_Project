The newspaper said Baldwin, who "approached with an angry glare," hit Daily News photographer Marcus Santos, who was "standing innocently with two other photographers," in his chin. -- Alec Baldwin claims he was assaulted by a photographer on a New York street Tuesday morning, but the New York Daily News accuses the actor of attacking its employee. The incident happened as Baldwin emerged from the city's Marriage License Bureau, where he obtained a marriage license with fiancee Hilaria Thomas, the Daily News reported. Baldwin's representative, in a written statement to CNN on Tuesday, said the actor and his fiancee were leaving New York City Hall when a "'civilian' walking in front of Alec positioned himself to obstruct the view of a photographer aggressively trying to shoot the couple. " "The photographer was clearly frustrated, pushed past the bystander and assaulted Alec with his camera," rep Matthew Hiltzik said.
