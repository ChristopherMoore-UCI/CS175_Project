The petition claims that daughter Julie Kasem and her husband, Dr. Jamil Aboulhosn, have been unable to check on Kasem's health even though her father signed papers in 2007 giving them the power of attorney over his heath care in the event he was unable to make his own health decisions. Kerri Kasem and other members of the family held a protest at Kasem's Holmby Hills house to raise public attention to their dispute last week. "I've never asked him for anything, nor have I asked Jean for anything." Don Pitts, Kasem's agent of more than 35 years, said he did not want to take sides in the argument, but he did say Casey is still of sound mind. Kasem's daughter Julie Kasem and her husband filed a conservatorship petition in a Los Angeles court Monday, claiming the retired radio host "has been isolated from his daughters, friends and other family" by his wife. Kasem, who for decades hosted radio music countdown shows "American Top 40" and "Casey's Top 40," is suffering from Parkinson's disease and "may have early onset Parkinson's dementia," according to the court filing.
