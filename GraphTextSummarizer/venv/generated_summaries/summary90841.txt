Reports that a white woman was among the terrorists who stormed Nairobi, Kenya's, upscale Westgate Shopping Mall on Saturday -- an operation for which Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility -- have prompted a slew of media speculation that she might have been involved. Some of them apparently had dressed as women, he said. But in the English town of Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire, where Lewthwaite lived with Lindsay for a time, she is remembered by local councilor Raj Khan as a good, helpful woman. Attackers defeated in mall siege, Kenya's president says Interpol on Thursday issued a red notice -- an international wanted alert -- for Lewthwaite at Kenya's request. Lewthwaite "is wanted by Kenya on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony dating back to December 2011," Interpol said.
