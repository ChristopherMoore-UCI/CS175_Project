Products packaged after July 18 and fruit packaged outside of that one particular facility in Cutler is not affected by this recall and should be safe to eat. The initial recall covered specific lots of fruit packed from June 1 through July 12. This serious infection can give you temporary problems such as a high fever, abdominal pain and diarrhea, headaches, stiffness and nausea. The company expanded the recall "as a precautionary step" by five days, to fruit packaged through July 17, in large part because it has "yet to identify with scientific certainty the source" of the Listeria monocytogenes at the packaging facility. The fruit may be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that can cause listeriosis.
