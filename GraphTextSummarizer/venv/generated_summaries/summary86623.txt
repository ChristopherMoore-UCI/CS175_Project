The gun belonged to a JetBlue Airways pilot who was authorized to carry it under the TSA's Federal Flight Deck Officer program, which trains airline pilots in the use of handguns and authorizes them to use them in jet cockpits to deter hijackers. Pilots who join the TSA program do so voluntarily, and are not compensated by the government for their security services. The firearm "was properly secured in a fashion that rendered it incapable of being discharged," TSA spokesman Nick Kimball said. A JetBlue spokeswoman Jenny Dervin said two flights were delayed about an hour because of the mix-up and that another pilot was assigned to fly the plane to Pittsburgh to avoid further delay. The incident apparently occurred while the pilot was attempting to secure the gun during the fight's landing phase, which was in violation of TSA rules.
