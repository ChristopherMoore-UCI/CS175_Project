-- Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto'o were both kept under wraps by their former team-mates as Inter Milan held Champions League holders Barcelona to a dour Group F goalless draw at the San Siro. Miralem Pjanic scored the winner from close range in the 76th minute after Fiorentina goalkeeper Sebastien Frey had kept out Kim Kallstrom's cross. In Group E, both Liverpool and Lyon won their opening home matches 1-0 against Hungarian side Debrecen and Fiorentina of Italy respectively. Messi had another effort soon after, his header being comfortably saved by Cesar, before Inter had their first sight of goal when Maicon fired over from 20 yards out. Meanwhile, in the other group match, Dynamo Kiev scored three goals in the final 20 minutes as they came from behind to beat Russian debutants Rubin Kazan 3-1.
