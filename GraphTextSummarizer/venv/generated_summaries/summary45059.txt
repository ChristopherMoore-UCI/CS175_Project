Long-time Denver marijuana activist Miguel Lopez hopes Amendment 64 and Club 64 will serve as a model for other communities. "The voters of Colorado have said we want cannabis to be legalized and we want a bunch of like-minded adults to be able to get together and exercise their constitutional rights together and that's what Club 64 embodies," said club owner Rob Corry. " Opinion: President needs to fix broken drug policy In a carefully worded statement, the advocacy director of Yes on Amendment 64 said that while Club 64 poses no risk to the community, it does put at risk the advances their cause has made. The members-only Club 64 is the first of its kind to open in Colorado since November when voters approved Amendment 64, which legalized possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use. " Marijuana advocates hope to rise from 'prohibition' Even though the club doesn't sell marijuana, the advocate said it "thwart(s) the intent of Amendment 64," which requires a year-long waiting period before stores are allowed to open and sell marijuana.
