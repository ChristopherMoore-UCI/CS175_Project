Wednesday morning's aftershock sent patients at a hospital near Haiti's airport in Port-au-Prince into loud prayers for forgiveness and protection, a nurse said. Two warships also are landing supplies by sea, and Canada has reached an agreement with Jamaica to fly supplies into southern Haiti from there. The U.S. military, trying to open other aid routes into Haiti, says it has obtained landing rights at the Dominican Republic's air base at San Isidro, about 150 miles east of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. The Navy hospital ship USNS Comfort is due to arrive off Haiti at midmorning Wednesday, carrying nearly 550 doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel. At least 11,000 U.S. military service members are now in Haiti or on ships nearby, and the military said Wednesday that it plans to send an additional 4,000 sailors and Marines.
