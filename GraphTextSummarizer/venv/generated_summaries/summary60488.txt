One photo from June 2013 showed the sneakers Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was killed. Lloyd was with Hernandez at the club that Friday night. It also showed the shoes Hernandez associate Carlos Ortiz wore the same night. When Lloyd was talking closely with one of his friends, Hernandez looked angry, according to Nicholas. Hernandez was standing near the DJ at the time, about 15 feet away from Lloyd and his friend.
