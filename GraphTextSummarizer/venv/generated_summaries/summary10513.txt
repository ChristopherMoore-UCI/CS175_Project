Jorelys' father, Ricardo Galarza, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Thursday that news of Brunn's death partly made him "feel good but, on the other hand, it doesn't because my daughter will never be with me again. Brunn said that he then took Jorelys to the bathroom and beat her to death with the skate. In a Cherokee County courthouse on Tuesday, Brunn pleaded guilty to a charge of murder in the death of young Jorelys Rivera in Canton, about 40 miles north of Atlanta. Georgia Department of Corrections spokeswoman Kristen Stancil had said that Brunn was found unresponsive at 4:15 p.m. Thursday in his cell at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, and was pronounced dead at a hospital at 5:37 p.m. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, in a news release, said the autopsy indicated that Brunn died of "ligature hanging and the manner of death (was) suicide."
