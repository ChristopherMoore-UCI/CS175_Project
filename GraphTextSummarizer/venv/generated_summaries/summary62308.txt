"It's the first time I can remember that second practice has really gone well for me," Mercedes' Hamilton was quoted as saying by Formula One's website. -- Lewis Hamilton realistically can't win the title but the former world champion hopes to challenge powerhouse Sebastian Vettel at the Korean Grand Prix after posting the fastest practice times Friday. The only driver with half-a-chance of catching Vettel, Fernando Alonso, was a distant seventh in the second session. He trails Vettel by 60 points with a mere six races remaining and admitted this week he needed a comeback similar to Oracle Team USA's in the America's Cup sailing to overtake the German. Hamilton's time of one minute, 38.673 seconds in the second session in Yeongam was about one-tenth of a second quicker than Vettel, the triple reigning world champion who has captured the last two races in Korea.
