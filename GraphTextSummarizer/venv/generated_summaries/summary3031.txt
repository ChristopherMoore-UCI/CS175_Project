Schalke had a rare chance to take the lead when former Real Madrid striker Raul put Jose Jurado through on goal, but his shot was half blocked by Roman Weidenfeller before Marcel Schmelzer cleared the ball off the line. Schalke had a half chance just before the break but former AC Milan striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar headed over the bar from Jefferson Farfan's cross. Barrios then diverted Blaszczykowski's cross onto the post with Neuer beaten as Dortmund piled on the pressure in the second half. Dortmund should have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes as Götze and Jakub Blaszczykowski tested Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Efforts from Lukasz Piszczek, Lukas Schmitz and Sven Bender were repelled by an inspired Neuer. Then Götze squandered the game's best chance as he collected Piszczek's pass and rounded Neuer but could only hit the post with a shot on the turn.
