" Team principal Frank Williams, who was in charge of Williams when Ayrton Senna died, said he was looking forward to seeing Bruno compete at the highest level. -- Bruno Senna has signed for Formula One constructor Williams 18 years after his uncle, former three-time world champion Ayrton, died driving for the team. Bruno's uncle Ayrton is one of the greatest drivers the sport has seen, winning drivers' championship crowns in 1988, 1990 and 1991 before he died in a crash at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. The Brazilian will partner Pastor Maldonado when the 2012 F1 season gets underway in Australia on March 18, replacing veteran compatriot Rubens Barrichello. Ferrari's Alonso slams F1 testing rules "It will be very interesting to drive for a team that my uncle has driven for, particularly as quite a few of the people here actually worked with Ayrton," the 28-year-old told Williams' website.
