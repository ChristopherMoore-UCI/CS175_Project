Stephen Colbert will succeed David Letterman as host of "The Late Show," CBS announced Thursday, one week after Letterman told his audience that he would retire sometime in 2015. CBS said, "Colbert's premiere date as host of 'The Late Show' will be announced after Mr. Letterman determines a timetable for his final broadcasts in 2015. " In a statement, Letterman signaled his support for CBS' choice by saying that Colbert had "always been a real friend to me. " Comedy Central also praised Colbert on Thursday, saying, "We look forward to the next eight months of the ground-breaking 'Colbert Report' and wish Stephen the very best. Colbert has been mentioned as a possible successor to Letterman for years, and his name quickly became a consensus pick after Letterman's retirement announcement April 3.
