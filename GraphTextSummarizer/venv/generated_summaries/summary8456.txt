Now, as director of the Global Collaborating Center in Reproductive Health at Emory University in Atlanta, Brann's primary focus is on preventing low birth weight by improving women's health care. In 1983, he co-wrote the American Academy of Pediatrics' first official "Guidelines for Perinatal Care," which is still being used by doctors to ensure pregnant women and their infants receive quality care. The best outcome for a healthy pregnancy is to be wanted, planned and have access to prenatal care with appropriate nutrition and delivered by a skilled attendant ... followed by access to modern contraception for appropriate child spacing. It's just great to be involved in helping to improve a system of health care through which we never ask to come. Dr. Alfred Brann asks the first time we talk.
