In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. "Orion's flight test will provide us with important data that will help us test out systems and further refine the design so we can safely send humans far into the solar system to uncover new scientific discoveries on future missions," Geyer said. NASA hopes Orion will ring in a new era for crewed American space exploration, and American flags may someday fly on more space outposts than just the moon. Future missions Orion astronauts will enjoy access to unprecedented space travel technology. NASA hopes its Exploration Mission-1, a 25-day flight around the moon's dark side, will demonstrate Orion's reliability for deep space missions.
