The Chinese government has hailed Inner Mongolia as a "model autonomous region" with rapid economic growth -- spurred by the mining industry -- and ethnic harmony. The Beijing-based Global Times, a mass-circulating tabloid, ran an editorial Tuesday, calling some demands of "largely peaceful protesters" in Inner Mongolia "reasonable" while accusing Western media of exaggerating ethnic clashes in the region. They say the government's push in recent years to expand coal mining in areas traditionally used for grazing has threatened the very existence of Mongolian herders and their culture. He added that, in addition to Hohhot, the government has also deployed paramilitary troops into Tongliao, Chifeng and other cities, putting more areas in Inner Mongolia under de facto martial law. -- Chinese authorities Monday arrested dozens of demonstrators in Hohhot as protests spread to the provincial capital and other cities in Inner Mongolia despite tightened security and reports of martial law, activists told CNN.
