Khanal faces the challenge of preparing -- with the support of other parties -- a new republican constitution by a May 28 deadline and finalizing an agreement on the future of nearly 20,000 Maoist combatants. Nepal's biggest party, the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), decided to withdraw its own candidate earlier Thursday and back Khanal. Nepal's political crisis began when Dahal resigned as prime minister in May 2009 after the ceremonial president, who is the supreme commander of the army, reinstated the army chief Dahal had fired. He replaces Nepal, who was also of the same party but had the support of Nepali Congress, the second biggest party in parliament. The communist leader said that if parliament could not elect a prime minister again, people would throw shoes at the politicians -- a high insult in certain cultures.
