The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the New York City area's three major airports, also has an active and helpful account. Among the most active are Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, Chris Christie of New Jersey (who, in typically blunt fashion, tweeted "Don't Be Stupid, Get Out"), Andrew Cuomo of New York, Jack Markell of Delaware, Dan Malloy of Connecticut and Martin O'Malley of Maryland. So are local transit services, such as New Jersey Transit (which suspended all service Monday), and Greyhound, the bus line. Also, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg's office has been tweeting frequently about closures of the city's parks, tunnels, subways and related services. One of them, CNN's Rob Marciano, has been tweeting updates from the storm-lashed beaches of Asbury Park, New Jersey.
