In the United States, it generally involves jockeyed horses pulling skiers along by a rope -- catching hoops and tackling jumps along the course. There are obvious dangers to the sport, not least wrestling with reins and ropes in a melee of horses and drivers at the start. Moro, who has been skijoring for 31 years and has no qualms about nudging horses out of his in a bid for on-track supremacy, was crowned king on Sunday. "You have horses in front and behind and the danger is someone can stand on your ski." Amazingly, though, Moro has never had a major accident in his time in the sport and is pleased to point out there have been no deaths during his era. "I was running my horse through ice and snow when it broke through the ground and half a ton of horse came down on me," he recalled.
