Florida prosecutors will not charge George Zimmerman after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend last month, State Attorney Phil Archer said Wednesday. "On behalf of George Zimmerman, I am pleased that I was able to present credible evidence to reasonable prosecutors who took the time to listen and that justice prevailed," attorney Jayne Weintraub said in a written statement. Authorities had probable cause to arrest Zimmerman last month, Archer said. "As you know, we provided media with the 911 call from Ms. Scheibe, which occurred prior to deputies responding," she said. "Apparently, Ms. Scheibe may have misspoken about the facts of her interview as she had access to her phone and was provided with food.
