Observing wild animals perform unnatural tricks while dancing in tutus only teaches the public that the sole purpose of animals is our entertainment. Sadly, performing animals in circuses and traveling shows are too often subjected to inhumane conditions, especially in their training. Yet whatever provisions they may make, the reality is that circuses are particularly unsuited to meet the unique needs of elephants. Meanwhile, animals that are no longer useful to the circus or traveling shows due to age or temperament may be given away or sold to other less reputable organizations. These extremely intelligent animals live in large family groups when in the wild, and they form close social ties with other elephants.
