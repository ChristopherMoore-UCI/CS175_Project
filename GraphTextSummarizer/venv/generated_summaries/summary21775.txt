Officials from the North told the delegation from the South on Friday that it feels the military exercises and the humanitarian issue are connected, Kim said. Pyongyang has been particularly irked by joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States, and would like them to cease. Last week, the North threatened that if February's maneuvers went forward, it would back out of planned visits between members of Korean families separated from one another since the civil war in the 1950s. He reiterated Washington's stance that the United States will not accept a nuclear armed North Korea and criticized a lack of progress by Pyongyang on this issue. In September, North Korea canceled a previous round of family reunions with only a few days' notice, accusing Seoul of souring ties between the two countries.
