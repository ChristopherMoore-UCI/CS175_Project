The account mirrors allegations put forward by Amnesty International, which released a report Friday saying it has evidence pointing to a pattern of "extrajudicial executions" of Sunni detainees by government forces and Shiite militias in Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba, cities where Iraqi forces were either routed or have been locked in fierce battles with ISIS fighters and allied Sunni militants. " Bodies found in Mosul A similar scene appeared to play out at the anti-terrorism detention facility in Mosul, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Tal Afar, Amnesty International said, where some of the dozens of bloated, twisted bodies found in a ditch were believed to have been executed by Iraqi guards before they withdrew. Human Rights Watch details alleged ISIS killings Stories of executions and killings by both sides have swirled since ISIS fighters seized portions of northern Iraq in a lightning advance that stunned Iraqi security forces. Outside, fighters with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria fired mortars at the anti-terrorism detention facility in Tal Afar, where fierce battles raged between the al Qaeda splinter group and Iraqi security forces. The Amnesty International report comes the same day that Human Rights Watch said two mass graves thought to contain the bodies of Iraqi soldiers, police and civilians, killed by ISIS fighters and their militant allies, were found in Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit.
