-- Johnson & Johnson announced Friday it is voluntarily recalling a single lot of Aveeno Baby Calming Comfort Lotion after a test by the Food and Drug Administration found it contained more of a form of bacteria than specifications allow. "That test indicated that the lot exceeded the specifications for common bacteria, though extensive testing by an independent laboratory afterward did not show that specifications were exceeded," the company said in a news release. But Johnson & Johnson Vice President of Communications Bonnie Jacobs said the recall is being carried out at the retail level, and consumers who have bought the affected product can still use it. This action is not being undertaken on the basis of adverse events and the potential for adverse health effects is remote." "These are common bacteria often found on the skin and scalp of babies and adults, and found in commonly used household and cosmetic products, at very low levels," it said.
