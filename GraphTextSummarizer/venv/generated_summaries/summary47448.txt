But when the ROV and camera descended into the depths and as I watched the live feed turn from brilliantly clear shots to a murky green and eventually to black, I couldn't help but worry that this was the last time we would see this camera. Our filming schedule was pretty similar to our other CNN shoots: interviews, key sequences and unique shots that would allow us to paint the story with rich visuals. To ensure that we had something to show for our shoot, Tony kept hold of the camera cards in case I decided to copy the ROV and take a dip in the water. Using the ingenuity of the ROV crew we securely attached our underwater camera to the arms of the ROV. While waiting we filmed our first key sequence: the ROV being lowered into the water.
