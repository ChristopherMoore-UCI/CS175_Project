Combining heist movie suspense with regular high-speed chase action, "Fast and Furious" takes "Ocean's 11" downtown, swapping con men for street racers, suits for vests and hair gel for grease (Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and Tyrese Gibson are all chrome domes now). Rodriguez's Letty has been spotted riding in a looky-likey criminal outfit ("They're our evil twins!") led by a ruthless ex-British Special Forces soldier, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). If Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) help Hobbs take Shaw down, they can win immunity for Letty and for themselves. The device is the kind of thing that cannot be allowed to fall into the wrong hands (which Shaw's definitely are.) -- Drawing level with the "Star Wars" saga and pulling well ahead of "Shrek," "Ice Age" and "Spider-Man" in the sequel stakes, "The Fast and the Furious" could yet challenge Rocky Balboa, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger for longevity.
