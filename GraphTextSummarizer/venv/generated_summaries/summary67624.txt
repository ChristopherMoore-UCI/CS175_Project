A cluster of three islands lie about 20 kilometers to the east, easily reachable by public boat or speedboat: Nusa Lembongan, which is popular with expatriates, tiny Nusa Ceningan and the largest of them all, stunning Nusa Penida. West Bali National Park Northwest Bali is home to a national park with excellent snorkeling and diving at Menjangan Island, and is the last refuge of the endangered Bali starling. Amed Truth be told, Amed has long been on the map for tourists seeking to elude Bali's crazy south, but the series of looping bays along the coast of east Bali retains a charming washed-out feel -- like a spot that enjoyed a long-passed heyday and now has a rather slightly sleepy European feel. After driving through the winding scenic roads in north Bali, through forest-clad mountains, you'll reach the little out-of-the-way village of Munduk, where the air is so crisp you can forget about air-conditioning. Here you'll enjoy paddy views from your guesthouse or along a rejuvenating ramble through terraces with occasional red hibiscus or pink frangipani trees that make for pretty photo opportunities.
