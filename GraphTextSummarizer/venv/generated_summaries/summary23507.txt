But the new-found popularity of beads isn't just about giving old materials a new lease of life -- it's about breathing new life into traditional ideas. Kati Torda, owner of Sun Trade Beads, has seen her exports -- mostly to Europe -- increase from five-percent of her revenue eight years ago, to 50 percent last year. Tairee, a student at the University of Ghana, is proud to wear traditional beads. They were once the king's currency, according to E.B.T. Sikapa, an organizer for the first Ghana International Beads Festival. Masoom, another University of Ghana student, said he thought women looked good in beads.
