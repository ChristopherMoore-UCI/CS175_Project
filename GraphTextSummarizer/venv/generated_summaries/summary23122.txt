" Slevin suffers from post-traumatic stress from what he called physical and mental mistreatment by corrections officials in Dona Ana County, which shares a border with Mexico in the southern part of the state. Coyte told CNN he and Slevin hope their victory would "help bring a stop to the use of solitary confinement in America. Jailers separated Slevin from other inmates because of his history of mental illness, according to the lawsuit filed by Albuquerque civil rights attorney Matthew Coyte in December 2008. "The Board of County Commissioners deeply regrets the harm Mr. Slevin suffered during this period," the county said in a statement Thursday. Dona Ana County is committed to ensuring consistent and appropriate treatment of every detainee in its care.
