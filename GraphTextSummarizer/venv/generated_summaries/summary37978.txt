Those who do get to the U.S. border have another river to cross, the Rio Grande (or Rio Bravo, as it's known in Mexico) or a 21-foot wall. On a recent trip to Arizona, U.S. border patrol agents gave a CNN crew access to a tunnel being illegally used for this purpose. Last August, 72 migrants were killed by a Mexican drug cartel in a ranch in San Fernando, Tamaulipas, only 100 miles south of the U.S. border. Once in Mexico, migrants travel on freight trains or by bus to the U.S. border, although many never get there. U.S. Border Patrol Agent Ariel Medeles says crossing this way can be dangerous.
