Sports personality Jim Rome apologized for calling members of marching bands "dorks" after Band Nation schooled the professional provocateur on what it takes to be in a band. " Musicians and marching bands responded using the hashtag #MarchOnRome with a few examples of why being in a marching band is more than running around a field, prompting Rome to apologize. Also, marching band is not just a college thing. The U.S. Army has its own marching band consisting of active service members. The controversy has even prompted an online petition asking CBS Sports to air the Drum Corps International's World Championship Finals this fall.
