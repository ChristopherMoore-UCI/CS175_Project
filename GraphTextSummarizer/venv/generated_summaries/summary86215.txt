Rathgeb also had roles in popular television shows from the 1960s and 1970s such as "Hogan's Heroes," and "Star Trek." "Her real name is Victoria Vetri and she went by the stage name, Angela Dorian, and she was actually considered a pretty good actress and got a lot of television roles. Rathgeb is charged with trying to kill her husband, Bruce Rathgeb, according to a Shiara Davila-Morales, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. "It was Polanski who told her to use her real name and actually had a line in the movie where Mia Farrow says, 'I thought you were Victoria Vetri, the actress,' and it was sort of a joke because, of course she was Victoria Vetri." Author and Film Historian, Tom Lisanti profiled Rathgeb for his book, "Glamour Girls of Sixties Hollywood."
