The proclamation, issued Thursday, includes the following text: "WHEREAS each year on February 6, we honour the legacy of Robert (Bob) Nesta Marley, an influential musician, advocate for human rights and international ambassador of peace.

NOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Rob Ford, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim February 6, 2014 as 'Bob Marley Day' in the City of Toronto. -- Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has decreed February 6 as "Bob Marley Day." Bob Marley became one of the greatest ambassadors of peace the world has seen.
