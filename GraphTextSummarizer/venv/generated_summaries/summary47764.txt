In a statement posted Monday on an Islamist website, militants wrote that "Russia has been warned." Pointing to recent deadly bombings in Volgograd, the group said, "Mujahideen are guided in everything by Sharia," referring to Islamic law -- which, the statement said, allows for killing women and children if they cannot be separated from men in such attacks. That's part of a standard security plan, said Fran Townsend, CNN national security analyst and former U.S. counterterrorism adviser. But the international focus on that moment served as a reminder of the militants who have carried out deadly attacks recently in Russia, and who have threatened more. "The threat is real," said Roberto Carcelen, an Olympic cross-country skier, in an interview from Russia on CNN's "New Day. The United States has offered counterterrorism expertise, equipment and warships to help Russia through the Olympics.
