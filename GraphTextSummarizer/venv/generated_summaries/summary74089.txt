For the Patriots, playing in Lucas Oil Stadium will be akin to the Red Sox playing a World Series game in Yankee Stadium. (In only one anomalous year, 1968, did home teams win less than half the games, but that was because there were five ties that season; remove those five tied games and the home field advantage would have been 51%.) As in all sports, in the NFL the home team wins most of the time, 57% of games to be precise. -- For the past few days, the NFL punditry here has been remarkably divided on predictions for Super Bowl XLVI. When the Indianapolis Colts lost their quarterback, Peyton Manning, to an injury and posted a miserable 2-14 record this year, it meant that, technically, there would be no "home team" for Super Bowl XLVI.
