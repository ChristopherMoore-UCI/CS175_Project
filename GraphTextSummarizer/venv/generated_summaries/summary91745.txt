Swedish poster boy Zlatan Ibrahimovic has delivered again -- the Swedish Postal Service is to honor the Paris Saint-Germain forward with his own range of stamps. "I am very proud and happy to announce that next year we will publish a booklet of stamps picturing Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Silva hopes Ibrahimovic will head off competition from four-time winner and former Barca teammate Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo to lift the Ballon d'Or in Zurich on January 13. "As a football fan I love Ibrahimovic. Regardless of the outcome of the tie, which will conclude with the second leg in Stockholm on November 19, a range of Zlatan-inspired stamps will be released on March 27. I'm sure that he will be in the top three for the Ballon d'Or," Brazil captain Silva told Sky Italia.
