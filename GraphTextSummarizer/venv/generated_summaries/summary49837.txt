A further relaxation of FIFA rules came in July 2013 after the Canadian Soccer Federation lobbied FIFA to change rules to allow turbans to be worn on the football pitch. "After a two-year pilot, The IFAB agreed that there was no indication as to why the wearing of head covers should be prohibited..." FIFA banned the wearing of headscarves in 2007 on the grounds of safety, but the ruling caused controversy. On the same day it was relaxing its position on headscarves, IFAB also announced a tightening up of rules on undergarments bearing slogans. -- Football's world governing body, FIFA, has officially sanctioned the wearing of religious headscarves. However, following a request by Zhang Jilong from the Asian Football Federation in January 2012, FIFA unanimously approved headscarves for a trial period six months later.
