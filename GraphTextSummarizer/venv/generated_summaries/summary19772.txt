The abuses asserted by Naji were also suffered by other detainees at Guantanamo, said Tom Wilner, an attorney who has represented Guantanamo detainees in two cases that went before the U.S. Supreme Court. That defeated the Obama administration's plans announced a year earlier to try several Guantanamo detainees involved in the 9/11 terrorist attacks in U.S. federal court. Guantanamo detainees -- of which there have been nearly 800 -- were allegedly tortured at the site, drawing widespread international condemnation from human rights and civil liberties advocates who decried the interrogation techniques and the U.S. authority to detain the suspected terrorists without charges. But members of Congress continue to oppose the release of Guantanamo detainees -- even those considered low-level threats -- because of the risk that they could engage in terrorism against the United States. An international human rights legal group representing Naji and several other Guantanamo detainees contends that the abuses were common.
