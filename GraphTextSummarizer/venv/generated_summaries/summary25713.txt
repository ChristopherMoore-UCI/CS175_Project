The French Football Federation confirmed the decision on their official website, with a statement saying: "Laurent Blanc proposed to the federal council not to retain any of the 23 players officially selected for the World Cup in South Africa, for the friendly match against Norway in Oslo on Wednesday August 11. Blanc, who took over from Raymond Domenech following France's exit at the group stage of the competition, opted to exclude the whole squad for one match as a punishment for their role in the protest that came just two days before their final match against host nation South Africa. Among the players now not available to Blanc are Arsenal trio Bacary Sagna, Gael Clichy and Abou Diaby, Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery, Barcelona's Eric Abidal, Chelsea's Anelka and Florent Malouda and playmaker Yoann Gourcuff -- who Blanc coached when he the pair were at Bordeaux. France's tournament fell into disarray after Chelsea striker Nicolas Anelka was sent home following a row with Domenech. -- New France coach Laurent Blanc has chosen not to select any of the 23-man World Cup squad, that refused to take part in a training session during their disastrous tournament, for next month's friendly international against Norway.
