Madonna was sent tumbling Wednesday night when the show didn't go as planned and she was yanked down a small flight of stairs. Here's what happened: Madonna was belting out "Living for Love" at the Brit Awards in London. Of course, the socialsphere has gone nutso, mocking Madonna or the dancer, although some did send support. The plan was for the dancer to pull off the cape, but it was still tied around Madonna's neck. You've been the one chosen to snatch a cape dramatically off Madonna during a musical number.
