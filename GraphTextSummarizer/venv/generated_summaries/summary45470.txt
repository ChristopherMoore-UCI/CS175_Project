And the Ministry of Justice has launched a public-relations campaign to show it has changed since the days when prisoners were tortured there -- first under Saddam Hussein, and later by American troops. Murtada Sharif, the only Ministry of Justice official to speak to CNN on camera about the prison, admitted Abu Ghraib is synonymous in people's minds with the inhumane acts that took place there both before and after the fall of Saddam in 2003. The notorious Iraq prison once called Abu Ghraib has reopened under Iraqi government control. But human rights organizations in Iraq say abuse and torture remain routine in Iraq's detention facilities. In 2004, the prison was once again thrown into the international spotlight, this time because of abuse by U.S. troops.
