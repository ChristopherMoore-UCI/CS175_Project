The man "is believed to be a leading figure in the movement and provision of explosives for attacks against coalition and Afghan security forces throughout eastern Nangarhar," the statement said. Nangarhar, which has Jalalabad as its capital and borders Pakistan's restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, has seen several recent International Security Assistance Force operations targeting militants. U.S. forces take a leading role in ISAF operations in Nangarhar. A separate operation last week in Nangarhar's Hisarak district led to the arrest of an alleged Taliban insurgent accused of using his status as a member of the Afghan National Police to conduct an attack in May which killed two coalition service members in Helmand province, ISAF said. Afghan and coalition security forces arrested an alleged Taliban bomb-making expert in Nangarhar's Khugyani district earlier Tuesday, an ISAF statement said.
