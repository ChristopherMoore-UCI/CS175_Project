" The CDC is aware of the small cluster of cases in California but is not actively involved in an investigation, a spokesman told CNN. Most people who become infected with an enterovirus do not get sick or experience only mild symptoms, said Dr. Steven Oberste, chief of the Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch at the CDC. According to a CDC report, several outbreaks of paralysis caused by enterovirus 71 were seen in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. More common -- and more concerning to health officials -- is enterovirus 71, which was discovered by the same California lab in 1969, Oberste said. "We are evaluating cases as they are reported to us," Glaser said in an e-mail to CNN.
