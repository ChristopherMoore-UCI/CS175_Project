New startups My bet for the breakout trend at this year's SXSW is "ambient social networking." While the last crop of mobile apps involved "checking in" to venues to find friends, many smartphones are now able to continually discover your location and broadcast it. This new generation of apps broadcasts your location at all times to friends -- and in many cases to people you don't even know. Twitter and Foursquare caught on in part thanks to massive buzz at SXSW, while thousands of other new companies dreamed the "Southby" dream but went nowhere. So the real question is: How comfortable are early adopters with ambient social networking?
