Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday conceded defeat in his bid for re-election as French president, accepting the blame for the result. Election campaigning was suspended by most candidates, but as incumbent president, Sarkozy was praised for his handling of the crisis. "I'm ready to become a French person amongst French people, and more than ever I have the love for my country deeply ingrained in my heart," Sarkozy said. Earlier Sunday, longtime Sarkozy supporter David Harari said he stood by the president, even as opinion polls appeared to tip in Hollande's favor. Sarkozy labeled his rival a liar and a "little slanderer," while Hollande accused the president of shirking his responsibilities, cronyism and favoring the privileged over France's poor.
