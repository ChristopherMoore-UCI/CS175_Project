Hurricane Sandy rolled over Jamaica on Wednesday, bringing 80-mph wind and torrents of rain to the island, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. -- A dark day in Jamaica turned into a dark night as most of the island was without power and one person was killed as Hurricane Sandy passed through. The forecast map shows Sandy reaching eastern Cuba by early Thursday before heading to the Bahamas. In Massachusetts, the state's emergency management agency began issuing situational awareness news releases as some computer models show that Sandy could "potentially transition over the weekend into a powerful nor'easter." That includes Florida's east coast, where a tropical storm warning is in effect from Ocean Reef to Sebastian Inlet.
