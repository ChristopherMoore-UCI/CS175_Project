"Peabody Energy is a global leader in clean coal solutions and is advancing more than a dozen clean coal projects around the world, leading to our ultimate goal of near-zero emissions from coal." But Coal is Killing Kids said that Peabody Energy is "lobbying ferociously against new pollution standards for power plants proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, standards the agency says will prevent 120,000 cases of childhood asthma each year in the United States." "The site is in fact a hoax, making inaccurate claims about Peabody and coal." A group called Coal is Killing Kids issued a claim of responsibility for the hoax, calling itself "an environmental and public health group that aims to challenge Big Coal's expensive lobbying against sensible updates to the Clean Air Act." A press release supposedly from Peabody Energy said it was creating a new public health initiative "designed to combat the stigma of asthma among American children." Under the so-called "Coal Cares" initiative, the false statement said, the inhaler actuators would be given to children living within 200 miles of a coal plant, along with coupons good toward purchase of asthma medication.
