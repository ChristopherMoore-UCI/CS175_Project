When Barack Obama came out swinging this week, threatening to veto any deficit reduction measure without a balance of new taxes and spending cuts, there was joy among liberals. The president outlined his demand for the debt reduction supercommittee: no spending cuts for the middle class without commensurate tax increases on the wealthy. After all, the GOP presidential candidates, by and large, are still complaining that Congress agreed to raise the debt ceiling. And Republicans complained that they needed more spending cuts. The good news: Congress had sunk even lower.
