Obama said Secretary of State John Kerry spoke Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the attacks that killed three Americans when two Palestinians wielding knives, axes and a gun attacked the synagogue during morning prayers on Tuesday. But Obama also stressed that "a majority of Israelis and Palestinians overwhelmingly want peace" and urged leaders on both sides to work together to ease tensions that have flamed in recent weeks over access to the Temple Mount and al-Aqsa mosque that sparked a series of attacks on Israelis and recriminations by some against Palestinians. Netanyahu on Tuesday also responded to the attack, ordering the demolition of the homes of the two Palestinian assailants, both of whom were shot dead at the scene by Israeli police. President Barack Obama condemned on Tuesday the attack on a Jerusalem synagogue that killed four Israelis as a "horrific" terror attack and urged Israelis and Palestinians to work together to ease tensions. A member of the PLO executive committee would not outright condemn the attack, instead pointing to "the continuing escalation by the Israeli occupation and the targeting of Palestinian civilians" as provocation that led to the attacks, though she did note that she doesn't "think violence is justified or can produce any results."
