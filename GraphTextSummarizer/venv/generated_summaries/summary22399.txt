Cuomo said he only wants the company to live up to its own standards as touted on its website -- including that they are dedicated to child safety and responsive to complaints. -- Parents, beware of Tagged.com, says New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. ," Cuomo said at a news conference in New York City.
