"Please stop complaining about the new Twitter app," Haddad wrote on his Tapbot Twitter account last week. The Quick Bar, which critics dubbed Dick Bar after Twitter CEO Dick Costolo, added an ever-present ticker showing trending topics and ads. "This is already happening organically -- the number and market share of consumer client apps that are not owned or operated by Twitter has been shrinking." As that number seems to grow slightly, it's unclear whether Twitter's stance has changed. In March, during the Quick Bar fiasco, Twitter began discouraging makers of these types of apps from pursuing development. Independent developers of applications that tie into Twitter's network say they have experienced significant accelerations in downloads and revenue since Twitter 4.0 launched last week.
