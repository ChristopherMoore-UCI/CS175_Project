San Francisco Police Officer Chris Kohrs -- the "Hot Cop of Castro" to his fans and friends -- became a viral sensation after a stranger created a Facebook page in his honor, nicknaming him after Castro Street, where Kohrs was posted at the time. Kohrs' Facebook page creator Nathan Tatterson told CNN it all started with his friend's photo of Kohrs sitting on his motorcycle. It kind of went viral from there," the 36-year-old Kohrs said in a phone interview with CNN. And for the record: Kohrs enjoys dining out, watching movies, snowboarding, riding motorcycles, traveling and water skiing. "Other people in the neighborhood starting recognizing the 'Hot Cop of Castro' and started taking and posting their own photos," said Tatterson.
