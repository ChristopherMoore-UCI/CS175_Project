On their website, the couple describes their act: "Together Kyle and Amanda have created a swaggering, wing-walking pirate show that would make Captain Jack Sparrow gulp. The stunt team onboard -- married couple Kyle and Amanda Franklin -- "suffered severe burns following the crash," according to a statement on the air show's website. The statement on the air show's website, which includes a painting of the couple sword-fighting in a plane with a skull and crossbones, said the two-day event would continue Sunday "and will be dedicated to Kyle and Amanda." This flying circus of "Pirated Skies" will have audiences yelling 'Aaargh' as Amanda wing walks, playing the part of 'Scandalous Scarlett' and sword fights with Kyle, the menacing 'Captain Kyro.'" "Their love rose from the ashes of the plane wreckage and their abilities as an air show act are a testament to the ongoing legacy of a family fated to continue dancing on wings of airplanes," the site says.
