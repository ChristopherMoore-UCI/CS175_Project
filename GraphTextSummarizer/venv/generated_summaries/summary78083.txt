"I hope that we can now improve our standing in the FIFA rankings and get into the hundreds," said coach Thomas Rongen to the country's football federation. The American Samoa soccer team, ranked dead last among soccer teams around the world by FIFA, soccer's international governing body, made history this week when it won its first ever international game. And, Rongen said, the sport is a labor of love for the squad. One that set a record for the largest loss in international soccer history, when Australia trounced it 30-1 in 2001. "We are 204 at the moment and this win will have helped." Rongen, who until May coached the U.S. Under-20 team, was hired just three weeks ago.
