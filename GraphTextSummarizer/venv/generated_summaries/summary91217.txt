The club's share price may have recovered a little since last month's $61 million marquee signing of Juan Mata from Chelsea, but qualification for the lucrative European Champions League is looking further away than ever for beleaguered manager David Moyes. " While United's attack has been bolstered by the arrival of Mata and the return from injury of last season's top scorer Van Persie and England striker Wayne Rooney, Moyes' defensive options are looking thinner after Phil Jones was stretchered off before halftime and fellow center-back Jonny Evans suffered a calf injury. Former Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solkskjaer enjoyed his first win in charge of Cardiff, beating Norwich 2-1, but the Welsh club was still left second from bottom. Newcastle failed to join seventh-placed Manchester United on 40 points after losing 3-0 at home to northeast rivals Sunderland, who completed a derby double and continued a resurgence under manager Gus Poyet by moving up to 14th. Brazil midfielder Paulinho, returning after a month sidelined by injury, canceled out new signing Shane Long's opener for the home side.
