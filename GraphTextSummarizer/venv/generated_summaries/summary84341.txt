Before a sudden turn of events this month, this was the story of Juan Navarro, who spent nearly 37 years inside the tough San Pedro prison in the Lima neighborhood of San Juan de Lurigancho. Prisons in Peru -- and Latin America, in general -- are known for being overcrowded places where it is not uncommon for inmates to spend weeks, months or even years awaiting a simple hearing. To be precise, before being released this week, Navarro spent 36 years and eight months in prison. Navarro never had anyone who cared enough to visit him in prison, and any luck went up in smoke when his records burned. "The thing is that this man doesn't have family who could help with the paperwork, so his case remained up in the air," said Cristian Galvan, a psychologist who works at the place where Navarro will live.
