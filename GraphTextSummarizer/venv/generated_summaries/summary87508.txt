In a statement late Thursday, Garzon said, "This sentence, without judicial reason nor evidence to support it, eliminates all possibility to investigate corruption and related crimes by opening spaces of impunity, and seriously contributing -- in an effort to stop one specific judge -- to reduced independence for Spanish judges. Julio Villarrubia, a leader of Spain's main opposition Socialist Party, said the party "respects" the decision of the court but finds it "troubling that Judge Garzon, who has fought tirelessly against drug trafficking, terrorism and corruption," is now convicted. Human rights groups say both cases, especially the second one, amount to a vendetta against Garzon, who became known internationally for his investigation into human rights abuses under former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. " "The Supreme Court should put an end to this sorry episode for Spanish justice by acquitting judge Garzon of all the charges against him," Brody added. Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America.
