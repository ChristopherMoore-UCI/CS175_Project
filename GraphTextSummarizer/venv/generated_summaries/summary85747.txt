To get the public's attention, Los Angeles police are sending out community alerts with a description and composite sketches of the suspect, and the city has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Inside Los Angeles police headquarters, the Special Assault Section resembles a command center for an emergency operation. Detectives are busy combing through some 700 boxes of old and closed cases, visiting old locations and even re-interviewing victims to shake out any possible clues. Dubbed the "teardrop rapist," the man is one of Los Angeles' most prolific criminals. Since 1996, police believe the same man assaulted girls and women 35 times throughout a broad swath of the city center.
