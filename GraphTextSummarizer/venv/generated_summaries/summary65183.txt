If you haven't been under a rock the past 24 hours (and if you have been, you have other things to worry about), you know that a certain Cupertino-based fruit company has finally unveiled its entry into the smartwatch sweepstakes, and, as expected from the house that the late Steve Jobs built, the new Apple Watch is a bushel of insanely geektastic features wrapped up in a sleek and eminently gorgeous package. The question I'm interested in is whether Apple's long-awaited arrival in the buzzy wearables category finally means that people -- regular people, that is, not pixel-pushing pundits and Tesla-driving tech titans -- are ready to wear them. Apple's original iPhone, with its featureless oblong form factor and touchscreen-based UI, was derided as an expensive, keyboardless toy. Both of these ended up completely reinventing their categories and earning Apple billions. The Apple Watch, meanwhile, received a standing ovation when it was unveiled Tuesday as the "One More Thing" behind Apple's new supersized iPhone 6, and has been generating a near-universal stream of acclaim from the digerati ever since.
