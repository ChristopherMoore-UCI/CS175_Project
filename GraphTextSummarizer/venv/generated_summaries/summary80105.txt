Ding says they hope the experience will promote "life education" -- prompting people to ask questions about what they are doing with their lives and guiding them to face death in a personal way. " Life and death Ding and his partner Huang Wei-ping went to great lengths researching their game, investigating the cremation process that typically awaits 50% of Chinese people after death. The pair say realism is essential to provoke participants into thinking about life and death. Soul searching Huang says his interest in death emerged during a period of soul searching after a lucrative but spiritually unrewarding career as a trader. "The saddest part of the job wasn't seeing the patients passing away but how the families refused to face death -- the final days with their loved ones consisted of kind but shallow lies," says Ding.
