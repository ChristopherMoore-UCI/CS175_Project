Canadian leader Stephen Harper says he backs President Obama's "renewed commitment to Afghanistan. "Afghanistan has probably had -- my reading of Afghanistan history -- it's probably had an insurgency forever, of some kind. Harper spoke with Zakaria last week after a visit by President Obama, who made Canada his first foreign trip since taking office in January. Harper told CNN that he supports Obama's "renewed commitment to Afghanistan" but said he would not recommit any more Canadian troops until there is a clear plan for leaving Afghanistan. Obama has said Afghanistan is the central front to the U.S.-led war on terror.
