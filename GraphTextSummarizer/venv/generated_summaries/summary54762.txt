The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last Tuesday that 15  American aid workers who had high-risk exposure to Ebola in Sierra Leone have arrived back in the United States for monitoring. " Sierra Leone has the largest number of confirmed Ebola cases -- 11,751 so far, according to the World Health Organization. The president of Sierra Leone has an idea on how to curtail the spread of Ebola: Get everybody to stay inside. "The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone," he said. The National Institutes for Health said Thursday it will admit an American health care worker with Ebola to its Maryland hospital.
