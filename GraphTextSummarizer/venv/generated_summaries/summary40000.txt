One of those charged is Sam LaHood, director of Egypt operations for the International Republican Institute and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. -- A group of American and British pro-democracy activists accused of fomenting unrest in Egypt have left the country on a U.S. military plane, U.S. and Egyptian officials said Thursday. " "IRI views the decision as a positive development, but remains very concerned about the situation and our Egyptian employees along with the continuing investigations of Egyptian civil society groups and the impact it will have on Egypt's ability to move forward with the democratic transition that so many Egyptians have sought," it said in a written statement. They faced fraud charges before an Egyptian court, straining ties between Egypt and the United States, its leading ally. The workers were among a group of international workers for pro-democracy groups that had been under a travel ban that Egypt's government lifted Wednesday.
