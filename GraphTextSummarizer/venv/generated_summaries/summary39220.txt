And if sending a bunch of horses onto a frozen lake sounds like a recipe for disaster, Gaundezi points out: "Horses on snow are not new." Playing polo in the rarefied St Moritz air is more tiring for horses (and humans) than life at sea level. Its annual snow polo event began in 1985 and, since 1907, a series of horse races dubbed the "White Turf" have been staged each February, involving not just hockeys but "skijorers" who ride behind their horse, on skis. Gianni, making his St Moritz debut after 10 years playing snow polo, is convinced he is heading to the toughest tournament in the world. But they call St Moritz the Wimbledon of snow polo in the newspapers here.
