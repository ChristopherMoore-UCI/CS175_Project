It was traditionally called "I Will Be Married in One Year," but the psychotherapist has changed the course name in recent years to better represent her curriculum and those she wants to reach, including gays and lesbians who can't marry: "Find Your Dream Mate While Finding Yourself: The Twelve-Month Plan." Too many people are caught up in the fantasy of how love works and happens, she said. Though "love doesn't have a time limit on it," Page said giving people time constraints can be important, especially if what they need to do is some of the hard, looking-within kind of work. If people were told to spend five years on this process, they'd wait until year four to focus, she said. "I used to see an ice queen, and I'd run and impale myself on her cold, bitter heart," said van Rood, 35, who's engaged to be married next year. He said that putting a deadline on the search for love sounds like "a risky approach" and that allowing time for self-evaluation is most important, no matter the gender.
