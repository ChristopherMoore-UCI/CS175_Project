Realtor Connie Profaci said the location was suggested by neighbor and co-star Gianni Russo, who played Corleone's son-in-law in the film. Brando played fictional character Vito Corleone, the head of an organized crime family who transfers power to his reluctant son. "His family lived near the home and was familiar with the English Tudor enclave connecting Todt Hill and Emerson Hill," Profaci said. The film is based on a novel written by Mario Puzo and begins with a scene filmed at the iconic estate, where the aging Corleone accepts requests for favors during the wedding reception of his daughter Connie, played by Talia Shire. The film employed a star-studded cast, including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Diane Keaton.
