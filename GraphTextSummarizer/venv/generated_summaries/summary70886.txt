Pope John Paul II called Wadowice, the small Polish town in which he was born, "the place where it all began." It currently features a trove of John Paul II memorabilia, such as original school documents and childhood items. Just in case anyone's forgotten why they're visiting, a statue of John Paul II greets visitors at the entrance. John Paul II got to see the church's space age interior for himself when he dropped in to consecrate it during his second papal visit to Wadowice.
