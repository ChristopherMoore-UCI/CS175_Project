Gibson and Grigorieva, who split up months after Lucia was born, sat on opposite sides of a courtroom Wednesday for a daylong hearing Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Scott Gordon. They are scheduled to return to court on November 22 for a continuation of the hearing, Grigorieva lawyer Daniel Horowitz said. Prosecutors are considering whether to bring charges against Gibson in connection with a domestic violence investigation related to the custody dispute, a Los Angeles district attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said. While Judge Gordon refused to grant the gag order, which Grigorieva opposed, Horowitz said he was reluctant to discuss details of the hearing because it involved a child. A decision on charges against Gibson will not be made until sheriff's investigators conclude a probe of extortion allegations Gibson made Grigorieva, Gibbons said.
