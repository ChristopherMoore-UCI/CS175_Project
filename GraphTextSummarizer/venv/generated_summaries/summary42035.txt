The "vast majority" of fish caught off Japan show no sign of radioactive contamination at levels dangerous to humans, even at the tighter limits Japan imposed after the Fukushima Daiichi accident, Ken Buesseler, a marine radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, wrote in this week's edition of the journal Science. -- Radiation levels in fish caught near the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remain high long after the 2011 meltdowns there, suggesting contamination from the site might still be seeping into Pacific waters, a U.S. researcher reported Thursday. Record radiation found in fish near Fukushima plant Cesium accumulates in the muscle tissues of fish, which eventually process and excrete most of it. Nuclear plant operator admits downplaying risk And the plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, has set up a system to absorb cesium from reactor coolant water.
