In 2010, when HP abandoned its Cupertino campus, Jobs quietly arranged to buy the site, according to Walter Isaacson's biography, "Steve Jobs." The new campus was one of the last major initiatives for Jobs, who died last year. Due to be completed in 2015, Apple's new headquarters may be one of co-founder Steve Jobs' final, longest-lasting legacies. A June 7 City Council meeting was one of Jobs' last public appearances. "I want to leave a signature campus that expresses the values of the company for generations," Jobs told Isaacson.
