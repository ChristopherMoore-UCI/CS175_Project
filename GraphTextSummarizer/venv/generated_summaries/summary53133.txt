Because Queen Victoria was so enamored of Scotland and Scottish tradition, she adopted tartan in her own clothing, and made it quite formal, Warner said. There's even a museum dedicated entirely to tartan in Franklin, North Carolina. And nobody copied Queen Victoria's penchant for plaid better than the Americans, Warner said. But fashion designers and plaid enthusiasts have Queen Victoria to thank for its popularity, said Patricia Campbell Warner, a historian and University of Massachusetts Amherst professor emerita. Centuries ago, Scottish men used yards of tartan to wrap around their bodies, keeping them warm on the windy mountainsides.
