-- Indian activist Anna Hazare began a public hunger strike in the country's capital Friday, accompanied by thousands of cheering supporters. "I acknowledge that Shri (Mr.) Anna Hazare may be inspired by high ideals in his campaign to set up a strong and effective Lok Pal (citizen ombudsman)," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told parliament on Wednesday. However, Indian leaders say Hazare's demands undermine democracy, through his use of a protest tactic Gandhi used in very different circumstances. Once at the rain-lashed Ramlila Grounds, Hazare sat on a makeshift podium with a large Gandhi backdrop as crowds carrying umbrellas hailed his arrival. Speaking earlier outside the jailhouse, dressed in his usual plain cotton attire, Hazare had also made references to India's freedom movement, with passionate cries of "hail revolution and hail motherland."
