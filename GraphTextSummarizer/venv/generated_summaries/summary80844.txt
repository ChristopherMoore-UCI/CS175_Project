For the three years that followed they released other songs that also became anthems to Egypt's revolution, urging Egyptians to "hold their ground" in "Ethbat Makanak" and in another yearning for "The Square." "We have many fans that will get very angry if we didn't release these songs," says Eid, who claims the band speaks the mind of many Egyptians. According to the band the song reflects the daily frustration faced by Egyptians, such as stifling traffic, drug use and sexual harassment. -- Before releasing an album most bands would talk about record sales or concert dates. In doing so they realize they could face censorship and defamation campaigns, similar to those faced by television satirist Bassem Youssef who had his show cancelled last September after mocking supporters of Egypt's military.
