The series, produced by MTV, was a hip portrayal of contemporary Kenyan youth aimed at spreading HIV awareness. She straddles many worlds: Nyong'o was born in Mexico when her Kenyan parents were in political exile. This is not her first brush with an international movie: As an undergraduate, Nyong'o worked on the production crew of "The Constant Gardener," starring  Ralph Fiennes. She's also a TV star:  Before her big movie debut, Nyong'o was a regular on the Kenyan television series "Shuga." She had to go deep for her role:  Nyong'o gives an emotional, raw performance in "12 Years a Slave," a movie set in the pre-Civil War United States.
