NASA says the display is caused by a young and powerful pulsar, known by the rather prosaic name of PSR B1509-58. -- New photographs released by NASA have captured images of a vast stellar formation resembling a human hand reaching across space. NASA's Chandra Observatory captured this hand-shaped image of an X-ray nebula. The image, taken by NASA's space-based Chandra Observatory telescope, shows an X-ray nebula 150 light years across. "The pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star which is spewing energy out into the space around it to create complex and intriguing structures, including one that resembles a large cosmic hand," NASA says.
