" Loughner was enrolled at Aztec Middle College, a partnership between Tucson schools and Pima Community College that helps high school dropouts transition to community colleges, PCC President Sylvia Lee said. In June, Loughner was reported to be disruptive in math class. McGahee said Loughner sometimes shook, blurted things out in class and appeared to be under the influence of drugs at times. Pima Community College told Loughner that he needed a letter from a mental health professional certifying that he posed no danger to himself or others before he would be allowed to return. -- Jared Lee Loughner was frightening fellow students and acting "creepy" and "very hostile" in incidents throughout 2010, according to newly released records from the community college that ultimately suspended him.
