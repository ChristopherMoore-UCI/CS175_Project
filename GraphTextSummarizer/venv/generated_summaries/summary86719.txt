Violence wracked Yemen yet again Thursday -- this time in the form of dual car bomb attacks purportedly carried out by al Qaeda militants targeting fighters from the minority, albeit powerful, Houthi group. This included weeks of large anti-government protest in the capital, Sanaa, during which Houthi fighters attacked state TV headquarters and seized strategic military positions. Al Qaeda has stepped up its attacks on Houthi targets since then, killing hundreds of Houthis and innocent civilians in persistent attacks. But even with that resolved, a Houthi adversary -- al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a terror group whose members are Sunni Muslims -- remains. 20 children among 31 killed in car bombings Thursday's violence marked the latest of scores of clashes between Houthi and al Qaeda fighters.
