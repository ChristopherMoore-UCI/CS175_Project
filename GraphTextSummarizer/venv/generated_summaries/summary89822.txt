Even before the Western media started focusing on super typhoon Haiyan, I'd been following the news on the Internet. As communications resumed, the world understood the awful destruction that Haiyan had wrought in Samar, Leyte, Northern Cebu, and other parts of Central Philippines. We stayed home with canned goods, water, candles and matches, because it was a given that electricity and telephones would be cut off during typhoons. Friends in Cebu, Philippines, who had just been battered by the 7.1 magnitude earthquake last October 15, were giving me a blow-by-blow account as they hunkered down and waited for Haiyan. Why didn't the government plan better for Haiyan -- or Yolanda, as the super typhoon is called in the Philippines?
