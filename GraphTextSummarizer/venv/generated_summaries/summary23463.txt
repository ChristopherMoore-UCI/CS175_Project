After Coulson succeeded her as editor, Brooks edited The Sun newspaper, and she later became chief executive of the parent company, News International -- now known as News UK. -- The jury in the phone hacking trial of former newspaper editor and ex-Downing Street communications chief Andy Coulson has been discharged after it could not reach a verdict on the final charges in the case, a court official said Wednesday. All three were cleared of those charges, the Press Association reported, as was former News International head of security Mark Hanna. Former News of the World editor Coulson was convicted Tuesday of conspiracy to hack phones between 2000 and 2006. "I am satisfied that the jury will continue to try Mr. Coulson and Mr. Goodman on the evidence that they have heard in court and solely on that evidence," he said.
