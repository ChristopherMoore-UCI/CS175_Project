The low participation seemingly belies critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, who feared the agreement would unloose thousands of Mexican trucks on U.S. highways, displacing American trucks and endangering American lives. As for program participation, the FMCSA said it is working with the Mexican government to provide program information to other trucking companies. Unless the number of participating trucks increases significantly, the Department of Transportation's inspector general says, the department will not have the data needed to determine whether Mexican trucks present a danger on U.S. highways. Under the program, approved Mexican trucks are allowed to carry Mexican goods throughout the United States -- well beyond the commercial zone in border states where they previously had to off-load. -- A year after Mexican trucks were first permitted to conduct long-haul operations in the United States, so few trucks have signed up for the pilot program that government auditors fear they won't be able to complete a congressionally mandated study of the program's safety.
