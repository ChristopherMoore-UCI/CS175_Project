The information indicated Wong had a crack or cocaine habit and owned handguns, Zikuski said, and he did not provide additional information. Zikuski said Wong was wearing body armor, possibly indicating that he had prepared for a confrontation with police. State police received a tip in 1999 from a confidential informant who told them Wong was planning a bank robbery, Zikuski said. Before entering the building's front door, Wong had apparently used his father's car to barricade the building's door, Binghamton Mayor Matthew Ryan said. Zikuski said Wong, who was from Vietnam, was 41 and had changed his last name to Voong.
