It accuses Cher of making a racist comment while reviewing audition tapes for dancers. "Cher was personally involved in the coverup of a sexual assault against a female fan by one of her other male dancers while on Cher's Dressed to Kill tour," the suit said. While it is primarily a whistleblower lawsuit, the complaint also alleges racial discrimination by Cher against African American dancers. After watching a "minority female dancer" who "particularly impressed" the choreographer and tour manager, Cher allegedly remarked "we have too much color onstage" and requested a white, blonde dancer. Ballinger later told tour choreographer-dancer Kevin Wilson and dancer Suzanne Easter about the allegation.
