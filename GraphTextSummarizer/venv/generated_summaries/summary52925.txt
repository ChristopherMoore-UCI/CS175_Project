"It is important for Christians to understand that Friday's Muslim prayer initiative is part of a well-defined strategy to Islamize American society and replace the Bible with the Koran, the cross with the Islamic crescent and the church bells with the Athan [the Muslim call to prayer]," the Rev. Canon Julian Dobbs, leader of the Convocation of Anglicans in North America's Church and Islam Project, said in a written statement. -- Thousands of Muslims gathered Friday on Capitol Hill for a day of prayer that organizers said was intended to inspire American Muslims and non-Muslims alike. People traveled from all over the United States to attend the Capitol Hill event, organizer Abdul Malik said. "America is not perfect," Abdul Malik, an organizer of the event called Islam on Capitol Hill, told the crowd. There were also anti-Muslim protesters near the event.
