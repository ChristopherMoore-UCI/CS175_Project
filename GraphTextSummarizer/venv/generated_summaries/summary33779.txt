These included colors such as Al Fresco, a silver metallic with fresh green tint; Victoria Grey, a classic gray with an iridescent highlight of gold metal; Opulence, a refined red pearl with intense jewel tone; Glacier, an icy graphite gray with a slight violet blue tone; Sunshine, a bright high-sparkle intense yellow; and Elixir, a metallic mixture of silver and magenta. "Color is one of the first characteristics noticed in product design, and it is increasingly being used in everyday items, from cell phones to large appliances, based largely on automotive trends," said PPG's Jane E. Harrington in a release announcing the study's findings. The top paint color choice in 2012 for U.S. car buyers is white (21%), matching similar findings almost 10 years ago; black (19%) is a close second, followed by silver and gray (16% each). Worldwide, white ranks first (22%) and silver is second (20%), followed by black (19%), gray (12%), red (9%), blue (7%), green (2%) and other colors (1%), according to the study released Wednesday by automobile paint manufacturer PPG. "The palette being developed for the automotive segment continues to be influenced by culture, nature, fashion, interior design, color popularity and new pigment technology."
