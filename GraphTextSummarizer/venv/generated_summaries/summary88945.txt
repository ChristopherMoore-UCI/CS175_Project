The patent pre-defines a number of gestures, such as ones for facial recognition, a selection gesture and a pointing gesture (to identify a specific section of an onscreen image). This newer patent, however, focuses more on the gestures themselves and other ways they could be used to control onscreen images and video. A previously discovered patent indicates that Apple could be working on an integrated projector for iDevices that would incorporate physical gestures as a method to manipulate a projected image. There's no mention of Siri or combining voice control with physical gestures. The toolbar would provide pre-set options for beginners, but would also allow more advanced users to customize their own gestures.
