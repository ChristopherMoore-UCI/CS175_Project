Get a variety of shots Always make sure you have the following shots: wide shots to set the scene, medium to give context and to tell the basic story, and tight shots to give details that the viewer wouldn't normally see. Think about your subject and what kind of shots you need to best tell the story. Once you have a variety of shots of different scenes, you can start telling a cohesive visual story. Thoughtful shot composition can really make your footage stand out. The more you shoot, the more comfortable you will become with your camera so you can focus less on camera settings and more on getting those perfect shots.
