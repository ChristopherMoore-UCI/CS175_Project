Prince Charles is first in line, followed by William, Prince George and then eventually the new baby. The new child will knock future uncle Prince Harry down to fifth. As during her first pregnancy, she is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or acute morning sickness. Catherine is being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace and didn't accompany Prince William on a planned visit Monday to Oxford. The Invictus Games, inspired in part by the U.S. Warrior Games held in Colorado, are the brainchild of William's younger brother, Prince Harry.
