This, according to Apple VP of product marketing Michael Tchao, is done so that devices can maintain optimum charge. You should get at least 10 hours of battery life out of your iPad if it's the WiFi-only model, and 9 hours of life if it's LTE. Once the iPad says it has reached "100%," you are guaranteed at least 10 hours of battery life, which is what Apple promises of the tablet. "That circuitry is designed so you can keep your device plugged in as long as you would like," Tchao told AllThingsD. "It's a great feature that's always been in iOS." Apple did not immediately respond to our request for further comment. This has caused concern among iPad users hoping to get the most out of their device's battery life, and the normally tight-lipped Apple has responded in order to clarify the issue.
