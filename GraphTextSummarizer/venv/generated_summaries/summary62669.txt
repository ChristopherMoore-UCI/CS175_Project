Watch report on Facebook poll Â» Facebook allows third-party developers to create applications -- such as polls and quizzes -- which are then made available to Facebook users, who use the applications to create specific content. The social networking site Facebook on Monday pulled a third-party application that allows users to create polls after a site member built a poll asking if President Obama should be killed. Users may choose to make their content available to the general population of Facebook or limit it only to their friends. "As is usually the case, our vigilant users reported it to us first," Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN. " Schnitt said the application "was immediately suspended while the inappropriate content could be removed by the developer and until such time as the developer institutes better procedures to monitor their user-generated content."
