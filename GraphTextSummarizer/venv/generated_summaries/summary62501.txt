South Korea fires warning shots at North Korean patrol Obama wades into foreign policy challenges on Asia trip Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, the last two American citizens known to be held by North Korea, were released after James Clapper, U.S. director of national intelligence, went to Pyongyang, a senior administration official told CNN on Saturday. Clapper carried with him a letter from Obama addressed to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He said it's a "good news story" but argued there's still a "broader fundamental conflict" with North Korea over is nuclear capacity. Obama suggested that in addition to "small gestures like the ones that we saw with the release of these individuals," it will take "a broader understanding" by North Korea that countries in the region consider their top priority to be the prevention of a nuclearized Korean peninsula.
