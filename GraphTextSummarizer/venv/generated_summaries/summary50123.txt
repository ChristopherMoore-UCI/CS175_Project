But Ezekiel Gatkuoth, the representative of Southern Sudan to the United States, said war could break out between the two sides if the international community does not demand that Sudan withdraw its forces from Abyei so residents who have fled can return. -- Sudan and Southern Sudan have signed an agreement on border security amid tensions over the disputed Abyei border region, the African Union said Tuesday. Asked whether tensions in Abyei could lead to an extension of UNMIS' mandate in Sudan, Musa said: "The government is open to dialogue as realities unfold on the ground, but UNMIS' mandate ends on July 9." And on Monday, the government of Sudan requested that the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) leave the country by July 9, the date set for South Sudan's independence. "The Sudanese foreign minister has sent a letter to Ban Ki-moon that UNMIS' mandate in Sudan comes to an end at the end of the transitional period, on July 9," said Khalid Musa, spokesman for the Sudanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, referring to the U.N. secretary-general.
