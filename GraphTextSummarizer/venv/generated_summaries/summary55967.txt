In September 2007, British troops withdrew completely from Basra and southern Iraq was touted as the coalition forces' success story. The British were based in southern Iraq, primarily in Basra, Iraq's second largest city that sits close to the Persian Gulf. In the Baghdad North Gate War Cemetery rest thousands of British soldiers killed in a protracted military campaign during World War I, after which Britain established an occupying regime in Iraq. On Friday, as the British leave Iraq behind for a second time, they are left to ponder the fragility of Basra's situation -- and their own sacrifices. -- When British forces fully withdraw from Iraq on Friday, it will be the second time in a century that Britain will leave this nation with a legacy of war dead.
