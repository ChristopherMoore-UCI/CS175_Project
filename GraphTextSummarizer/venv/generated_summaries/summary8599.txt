Hussein was badly outnumbered when he was killed fighting Yazeed near the city of Karbala, in modern-day Iraq. In Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the marking of Ashura was banned for 30 years. The first public Ashura demonstrations in Karbala after his fall, in 2004, came under attack by Sunni militants. -- Iran could see widespread protests this weekend, as a day of mourning for the most prominent cleric to oppose the regime coincides with the major Shiite holy day of Ashura. Some of the most dramatic scenes take place in Karbala itself, as Shiites congregate to do symbolic penance for failing to come to Hussein's aid in his uprising against Yazeed.
