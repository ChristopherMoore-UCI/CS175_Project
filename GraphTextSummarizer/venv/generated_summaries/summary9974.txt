The whistle-blower worthy of an exclamation point in this groovy-looking, chuckle-baiting, fact-based movie from protean director Steven Soderbergh is Mark Whitacre (Matt Damon), a biochemist and well-placed executive at the agri-processing giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in Decatur, Illinois. A valued subset of Soderbergh's audience is sure to dig iconic hipster comic brothers Tom and Dick Smothers in small roles. Comedian Joel McHale from E!'s "The Soup" plays the fellow agent who stares with big round eyes while his partner squints at Whitacre's successive leakages of truth/lie/ truth/lie. Watch why Damon gained 30 pounds for the role Â» Soderbergh's amused study of the highest-ranking corporate whistleblower in U.S. history is adapted from "The Informant: A True Story," an amazing, deeply reported book by New York Times reporter Kurt Eichenwald. But somewhere between Eichenwald's journalistic attention to detail and the bubbly, dialogue-besotted script by "The Bourne Ultimatum's" Scott Z. Burns, Soderbergh has chosen to apply an attitude of arch whoopee, a greasy veneer of mirth over what is, no joke, a serious mess of malfeasance and mental instability.
