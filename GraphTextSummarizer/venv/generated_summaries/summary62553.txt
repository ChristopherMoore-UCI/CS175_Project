"Everything and everyone in Napa was affected by the quake," said CNN iReporter Malissa Koven. Upwards of 200 commercial and noncommercial structures have been marked by yellow tags, meaning "property owners can go into the building to clean up but have been advised not to occupy until further notice," said Rick Tooker, Napa community development director at a news conference Monday evening. The earthquake triggered six major fires that destroyed several mobile homes, Napa Division Fire Chief John Callanan said. And it could take up to a week to get the water system back to normal after dozens of reported water-main breaks, Napa Public Works Director Jack Rochelle said. Sunday's earthquake was centered 6 miles southwest of Napa and 9 miles southeast of Sonoma, according to the USGS.
