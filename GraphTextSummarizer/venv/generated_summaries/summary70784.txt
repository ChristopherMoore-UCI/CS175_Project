Her skin was covered with small white, blister-like lesions known as "Florida frostbite," the result of exposure to cold temperatures. They fear that more manatees will die during the spring, unable to recover from the trauma of Florida's deep freeze. The full impact of the cold weather on the manatee population is still unclear, according to Garrett, who works for Florida's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. While manatees are round and plump like seals and other marine mammals, their fat is not designed to insulate them from the cold, Garrett said. Lowry Park Zoo is one of the three facilities in the state that provide medical treatment and a place for manatees to recover from cold stress, as well as other injuries.
