Radar data from air traffic control can provide tracking data that will indicate the flight path, altitude and direction the A320-200 followed. -- Before the world reaches a conclusion as to the outcome of AirAsia Flight QZ8501, it's important to understand that the details are far too limited for drawing a parallel to Malaysia Flight 370. And let's not be misled by the reported request of Flight 8501 asking air traffic control for a higher altitude. With Malaysia 370, radar data was sketchy; satellite data has been the primary source in determining the track and thus the search area. Although the A320 is designed to continue flying without engine power, being able to control it at high altitude would be a challenge, especially in turbulent conditions.
