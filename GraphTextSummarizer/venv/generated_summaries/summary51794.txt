Our trip around the "Inside Politics" table was rich with 2014 insights, including a key test in Texas and questions about whether a GOP Senate majority would bring a new chapter in President Obama's relationship with the man he may face in many high-stakes negotiations. Modest gains for the GOP, and maybe the Democrats sweep back into power in 2016; larger gains and perhaps we see a GOP majority until after the post-2020 Census redistricting. Two big wins for Obama, but deep gains for the GOP Republicans complain about Obama with every breath, but you can make a case they will miss him. In the Senate, this year's biggest battleground, the change is less dramatic: 57 Democratic senators early in the Obama presidency, 53 now, or 55 if you count the two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Yes, the President has won two convincing Electoral College victories, and in the process exposed profound GOP demographic weaknesses when it comes to presidential politics.
