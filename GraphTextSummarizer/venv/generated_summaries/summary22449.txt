'Foley had to endure more' French journalist Nicolas Henin, who was taken hostage in June 2013 with French photographer Pierre Torres, told CNN that he also had been held with Foley in northern Syria before his release this year. But slowly details are emerging of the experiences endured by Foley following his abduction while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. It emerged this week that U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria this summer to rescue Foley and other hostages -- but their mission proved unsuccessful. -- American journalist James Foley was beheaded by his ISIS captors to send a message to the Western world. A source who says he was held last year with Foley told CNN's Bharati Naik that he, Foley and another journalist were held from March to August 2013 in a prison in Aleppo, Syria.
