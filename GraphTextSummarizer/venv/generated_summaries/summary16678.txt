Bobby Davis, 39, a former ball boy for the school's basketball team, told ESPN on Thursday evening that Fine molested him "hundreds of times" over the course of 16 years, starting from when he was in the fifth or sixth grade. Davis told university officials six years ago that he informed Syracuse, New York, police that he had been "subjected to inappropriate contact by an associate men's basketball coach" during the 1980s and 1990s, according to university Senior Vice President Kevin C. Quinn. But Davis' stepbrother, Mike Lang, 45, told ESPN on Thursday that Fine also molested him "15 to 20 times," kick-starting a new police investigation. The touching included rubbing his genitals and occurred at Fine's home, at university basketball facilities and during road trips, Davis said on ESPN's "Outside the Lines. Davis alleged that Fine started touching him inappropriately when he was in sixth grade or so, at about age 10 or 11.
