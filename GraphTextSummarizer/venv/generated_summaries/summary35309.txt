Stengel recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, during which he met with officials from U.S. regional coalition partners in the fight against ISIS. On the same day the United States announced the arrest of a 19-year old attempting to leave the country to join ISIS, a top State Department official said the American efforts to combat ISIS' powerful online message are working. ISIS has been effective over the past several months at bringing its message to young people around the world through a series of highly produced and graphically violent videos, and through online forums. The anti-ISIS messaging campaign is keeping disaffected youth from joining the extremist group, Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs Richard Stengel told CNN's Elise Labott on Monday. As part of his role at the State Department, Stengel overseas the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, which aims to counter propaganda from ISIS.
