In a Massachusetts' courtroom, the murder trial of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez in the death of Odin Lloyd may prove to be a textbook study of circumstantial evidence and its struggle to overcome reasonable doubt and celebrity status. Later video shows Hernandez, Ortiz and Wallace making a fuel stop where driver Hernandez purchases what will later prove to be a very important pack of bubble gum. Here is what Massachusetts' judges customarily tell the jury about circumstantial evidence at the end of a criminal case: "You have direct evidence where a witness testifies directly about the fact that is to be proved, based on what he claims to have seen or heard or felt with his own senses, and the only question is whether you believe the witness. ... Prosecutors are meticulously building a case using surveillance video and other evidence to link Hernandez to the killing. It's still early in the Hernandez trial, but with surveillance video, the evidence of dirt from the industrial park on the Hernandez car, the bullet-riddled body of Odin Lloyd, the alleged removal of the murder weapon from the Hernandez house in a trash bag by his already perjury-indicted fianc√©e, it appears that rain may be in the forecast when the trial concludes in the coming weeks.
