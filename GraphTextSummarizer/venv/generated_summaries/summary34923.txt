The Cincinnati Reds' Homer Bailey added to his squad's storybook season -- and to baseball pitchers' remarkable run this year -- by tossing a no-hitter on Friday night. That ties for the most in any year -- with 1990 and 1991 -- according to info posted on MLB.com, the league's official website. The lone blemishes that prevented him from earning a perfect game were a third-inning error and a walk in the seventh inning. Over a week ago, Cincinnati clinched a playoff berth and then the National League Central Division title. The Reds have the second-best record in the majors, just percentage points behind the Washington Nationals.
