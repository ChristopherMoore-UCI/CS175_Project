That means the monarch, who celebrated 60 years on the throne last year, will receive income of nearly 38 million pounds next year, according to the estate's annual report, released Thursday. The Crown Estate, a public body that manages property for the monarch, posted a record profit of 252.6 million British pounds ($387.2 million) for the last financial year -- up by 5.2% from last year. -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II can expect a sweet 5% raise next year, thanks in large part to record profits from real estate. Spending last year on royal properties included 700,000 pounds (just over $1 million) so far on the refurbishment of an apartment at Kensington Palace for William and his wife, Catherine, who are expecting their first child in July. The "Sovereign Grant" came into effect in April of last year, after the passage of new legislation that consolidated public funding for the monarch's official duties and royal palaces in return for the profits from the Crown Estate.
