Maria Elena Meneses, a professor who studies new technologies and information at Monterrey Tech, said the way the Ibero students' actions appeared to be triggering protests fueled by social media was "unprecedented" in Mexico. Many students in Mexico City on Wednesday said they were excited about the success of the protest, which police said more than 15,000 people attended. We have information and media that other groups do not have," said Paula Diaz, 23, a student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. The plaza where students say they are planning to meet this weekend has significant historical significance in Mexico. "It was about time that Mexico woke up, that it stopped watching television," said Leonardo Mata, a student at Mexico City's Metropolitan Autonomous University who joined thousands marching in the capital on Wednesday.
