In a statement on the TSA's Web site, Administrator Kip Hawley said, "We work very closely with law enforcement and intelligence communities about possible methods of attack and it appears that terrorists may have an interest to use these remote-control toys as a means to initiate these devices in a terrorist attack." Hawley added, "We want to let passengers know that if they see some different security screening related to remote control devices, they know why we're doing it." "Travelers may encounter additional screening when bringing remote control devices in carry-on baggage," the TSA said. Mohamed allegedly told authorities he made the videotape about remote bomb detonation to help people in Arab countries fight infidels. Instead, it was made in response to July's National Intelligence Estimate, which concluded the United States will face "a persistent and evolving terrorist threat" in the coming years, and also by generalized threats that noted the use of remote-control toys as detonators. In addition, anyone carrying such toys, including children, may have to go through secondary screening.
