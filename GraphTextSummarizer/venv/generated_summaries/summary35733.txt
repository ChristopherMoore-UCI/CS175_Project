Since then, Landrith -- a former Marine based at Camp Lejeune -- has spoken out on behalf of sexual assault victims, in particular men who were victimized by women. He didn't seek prosecution of his alleged rapist, but he wants other victims to feel free to talk about sexual assault and pursue justice without shame. The actual number is likely higher, experts say, as incidents of sexual violence are severely underreported in the United States -- particularly among male victims. The prior definition -- "the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will" -- hadn't been changed since 1927, and sexual assault awareness groups say it alienated victims that didn't fit the mold. For male sexual assault victims of any age, convincing others that they've been preyed upon is difficult as well.
