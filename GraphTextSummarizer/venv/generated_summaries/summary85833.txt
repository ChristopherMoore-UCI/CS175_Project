Talking between characters is done through a series of choices that allow the player to take different postures in the discussions. Where "Dragon Age: Origins" told the tale of a Grey Warden's trek to gather allies, stem the tide of the malevolent Blight (a wave of evil creatures bent on taking over) and do battle against an arch-demon, "Dragon Age II" (BioWare, Electronic Arts) showcases another wave of the story. The tactics system is carried over from "Origins," allowing you to set up character actions to occur at pre-determined thresholds or events. It does create a consistency of character along those core choices." Characters can be set up to drink a healing potion when their health gets low without any break in the battle or gamer involvement.
