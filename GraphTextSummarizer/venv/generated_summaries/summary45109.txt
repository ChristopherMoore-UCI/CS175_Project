Yet even if it might seem that way, it doesn't change the fact that -- when compared with crime rates for all adult males -- professional athletes are no more likely to kill someone, get arrested for a gun crime or be convicted of domestic violence. Are sports stars more prone to dangerous, criminal behavior -- including those involving guns -- than your everyday Joe? Will they more likely carry guns and use them? Gilbert Arenas, then a standout with the Washington Wizards, was charged with a felony gun violation after drawing guns in the locker room -- something he insisted was a joke. Because "celebrity culture drives the news cycle" and because star athletes are celebrities, he says, these kinds of stories are read and spread everywhere.
