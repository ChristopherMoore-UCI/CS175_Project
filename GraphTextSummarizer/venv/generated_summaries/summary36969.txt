Streisand said that while she did turn the legendary actor down, the pair remained friends and often talked on the phone "for hours and hours." Why Streisand signed up for 'Guilt Trip' Morgan told Streisand that "The Way We Were" remains his "single favorite movie of all time," and that he once even broached the subject of a sequel with Robert Redford. Alas, movie fans hoping for an on-screen reunion of Katie (Streisand) and Hubbell (Redford) will be disappointed to learn that a sequel is just not meant to be -- not unlike Katie and Hubbell. " "It's such a good story; these people," said Streisand, who noted that while she understands Redford's urge to avoid sequels, "this happens to be a great story. " Streisand told Morgan she had hoped to release a sequel on the film's 21st anniversary.
