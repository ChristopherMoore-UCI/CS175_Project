Over two days, we tackled such topics as malaria, AIDS, reproductive health, and schistosomiasis â€” health issues that China has largely brought under control but remain major health challenges in Africa. China has also provided medical training to African health professionals and is building capacity in other ways, such as providing scholarships to train health experts. To be sure, there is a long history of China and Africa collaboration on health. The roundtable brought together Chinese and African health ministry officials, academics, members of the private sector, and representatives of such international organizations as the World Health Organization, Global Fund, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, GAVI Alliance and United Nations entities. Participants at the meeting shared lessons learned in delivering health services to their people.
