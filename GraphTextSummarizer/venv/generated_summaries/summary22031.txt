Thirty-five prison guards were in the building in the city of Lahore when four to six gunmen entered, said Muhammad Rashid, a Lahore police official. In a separate attack Thursday, armed militants killed six coal miners and a doctor in southwestern Balochistan province five days after they kidnapped them, a senior government official said. -- Gunmen shot and killed nine prison guards in eastern Pakistan on Thursday after gaining entry to a building where they were staying, officials said. The guards, most of them from the volatile northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, were in Lahore for training, Rashid said. Ihsanullah Ihsan, a spokesman for the group, said the attack was meant to send a message that no area of the country is outside Taliban reach.
