Sony is not the only Japanese electronics giant struggling: On Friday, Panasonic Corp. is expected to announce nearly $10 billion in annual losses, according to estimates released by the company earlier this year. -- Sony Corp. lost a record $5.7 billion in the fiscal year ending in March, the company announced today -- lower than beleaguered electronics giant's previous estimates of finishing the year $6.4 billion in the red. Both companies have struggled with ailing television manufacturing divisions, which have lost to lower cost rivals like Samsung and LG, and are hampered by a rising yen which has cut repatriated profits from overseas sales. The company predicts a 30 billion yen ($376.5 million) net profit in the current fiscal year. Still, it was the fourth straight year the company finished the year with a loss.
