The "Gaza Dialogue and Tolerance Cup final" between Al Shate (a mixed team of Hamas and Fatah members that represents the 80,000 strong Al Shate refugee camp) played Al Salah Islamic Association (a team aligned with Hamas) in a tight match in front of raucous fans who flew blue and yellow flags and fired off flames from lit cans of hairspray in support of their side. "We as sports people want to remove sport from politics but politicians on both sides, Hamas and Fatah, play on this, they try to make politics come into sport," explained Ibraheem Abu Saleem, vice president of the Palestinian Football Association [PFA] and the man in charge of the game in Gaza. But since Hamas, a militant Islamist group, seized control of Gaza from Fatah in 2007, football has been brought to the brink of extinction. When Hamas hands back the clubs to their legal board of directors, sport will be running again in Gaza as in the West Bank." The Palestinian national football squad has no less than 15 players representing Gaza and over the past 50 years dozens of teams have flourished, each with its own affiliation to different political groups.
