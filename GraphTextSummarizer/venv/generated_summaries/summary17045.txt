"The Simpsons" has enticed dozens of guest stars over the past 22 years, from regulars like Kelsey Grammer as "Sideshow Bob" to shorter stints from the likes of Sting, Michael Jackson, Tom Hanks, Jay Leno, Kid Rock and many others. Twentieth Century Fox Television acknowledged to CNN earlier this week that they were working toward an agreement, while saying future shows couldn't be made "under its current financial model." Yet it's likely that there will be plenty for doughnuts and Duff beer for Homer, Marge, Bart and company as they prowl the bars, nuclear reactors and other happening locales around Springfield. The show's next new episode -- the "Treehouse of Horrors XXII," the latest in its annual Halloween-themed installments -- will air at 8 p.m. ET Sunday, October 30, according to Fox. The show began as an segment on Fox's "The Tracey Ullman Show," as the creation of Matt Groening, who still helps helm the program.
