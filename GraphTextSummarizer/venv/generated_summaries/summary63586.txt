Police say van der Sloot murdered Stephany Flores in his Lima hotel room in May 2010, then took money and bank cards from her wallet and fled to Chile, where he was arrested a few days later. But van der Sloot does faces possible extradition to the United States in a matter tied to Holloway's disappearance and her family. Van der Sloot -- who, with two others, was among the last people seen with the Alabama teenager -- was detained twice, but never charged, in Holloway's disappearance. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. Enrique Flores, brother of the victim, said that family members planned to be in court for van der Sloot's sentencing.
