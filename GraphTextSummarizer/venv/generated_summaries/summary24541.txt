-- After winning her 13th term to the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday, the last thing Rep. Rosa DeLauro expected from a whirlwind week was an armed break-in at her Capitol Hill home. "[Rep. DeLauro and her husband] thank the Metropolitan Police Department and Capitol Police for their response and are grateful no one was harmed," Lonardo said in a statement on Monday. According to police reports obtained by ABC 7 News, police identified the man as John Chaplin, 55, from Southeast D.C. The 71-year-old Democrat, who represents Connecticut's 3rd Congressional District, was not home at the time of the incident early Friday evening. It is unknown whether Chaplin targeted DeLauro's Capitol Hill home or if he acted randomly.
