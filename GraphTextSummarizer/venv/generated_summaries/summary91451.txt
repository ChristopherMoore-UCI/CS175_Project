The obvious answer is that she got older in an industry that fetishizes youth, especially female youth. Q&A: Helen Mirren Madame does everything she can to foil the newcomers from India, not because she's a racist (the film makes a point of her firing her xenophobic French chef) but because their restaurant, with its roaming livestock and blaring bhangra music, offends her refined Gallic sensibilities.

Oprah and Steven Spielberg talk 'Hundred Foot Journey' Mirren certainly starts off that way in "Chocolat" director Lasse Hallström's latest feel-good slice of food porn, "The Hundred-Foot Journey."
