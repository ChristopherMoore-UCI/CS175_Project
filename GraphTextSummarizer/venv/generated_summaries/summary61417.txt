In the context of Trafalgar Square with its military, valedictory and male historical statues, this elevation of everyday life to the position formerly occupied by monumental art allows us to reflect on the diversity, vulnerability and particularity of the individual in contemporary society. Since 2005 the Mayor of London's Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group has picked an artist or artists to fill the landmark space with a new piece. -- The famous "empty" fourth plinth in London's Trafalgar Square is to be occupied by volunteers for 100 consecutive days, 24 hours a day, the artist Antony Gormley has announced. Named after a famed 1805 British naval victory against the French, its centerpiece is a column commemorating Lord Horatio Nelson, who died during the conflict. " Ekow Eshun, chair of the Fourth Plinth Commissioning Group, said Gormley's idea was "outstanding." "(It's) a bold, arresting work that reflects on the multi-faceted nature of modern Britain.
