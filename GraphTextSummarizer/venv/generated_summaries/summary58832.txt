600 square meters of solar panels and three giant "wings" mean  "Soliloquy" can run on wind energy or solar power. An equivalent-sized superyacht burns anywhere between 250 and 600 liters of marine diesel per hour, depending on speed and fuel efficiency, and emits three times that in CO2 emissions, according to British yachting carbon offset company, Yacht Carbon Offset. "At the same time, however, I am also passionate about superyachts." Soliloquy is projected to cost approximately $60 to $65 million to build -- similar in cost to conventional superyachts of its size. "Soliloquy's" unique eco-luxury design allows the boat to run on two different sources of sustainable energy by incorporating 600 square meters of solar panels on the exterior of the boat and giant rigid "wings" that function like sails. Both the panels and solarsails -- developed by Australian company Solar Sailor -- on the vessel can fold up or completely stretch out depending on which energy source is in use, changing the yacht's shape.
