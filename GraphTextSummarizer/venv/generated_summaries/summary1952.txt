First dog Bo buttons, first lady Michelle buttons, Joe Biden buttons, "Hail to the Chief" buttons and, of course, Obama buttons litter the tables of the Presidential Inaugural Committee 2013 Official Store. A-listers sign up for inaugural celebrations Close is a well-known supporter of the Obama campaign and last September he put up for sale 10 tapestries based on different images of the president. Obama's smiling likeness beams through the glass storefront on a special-edition poster designed by photorealist Chuck Close. "Everyone wants a button to have a piece of the day," Marketing Merchandising Director Meaghan Burdick said at the store's sneak peek this week. Buttons are an Inaugural standby and they're always big sellers.
