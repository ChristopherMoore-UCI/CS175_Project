Jayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's. Yet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete, it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams. We saw pundits, columnists, journalists, radio talk show hosts, psychologists, body language experts, entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger: Was he really sorry for committing adultery, should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles. We all may want to focus on Tiger, but it's the tragedy of Jayson Williams that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star. Frankly, if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes, it's Jayson, not Tiger.
