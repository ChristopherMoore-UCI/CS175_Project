Brooks' father, Joseph Brooks, 73, committed suicide in May 2011, New York police said. A jury convicted 27-year-old Nicholas Brooks, son of "You Light Up My Life" composer Joseph Brooks, in New York Supreme Court in July for the murder of his girlfriend, Sylvie Cachay. "We have come a long way in our recognition and understanding of domestic violence, but there is much more we have to do to better protect individuals like Ms. Cachay," District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said in a statement Monday. "Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke," publicist Kate Godici said about Cachay in July when Brooks was convicted. The boyfriend convicted of strangling and drowning a famed swimsuit designer in a bathtub at a chic New York hotel was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, the maximum sentence for second-degree murder, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said Monday.
