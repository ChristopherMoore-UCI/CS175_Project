A pathologist determined that the five -- Raymond Gee, 46; Ruth Gee, 39; and three children -- had been beaten, Logan County Sheriff Steve Nichols told reporters. Nichols said authorities are looking for a gray-primer-painted pickup truck that was seen in the area Sunday night. Police officers stand patrol outside the Gee household late Monday evening. The sheriff has said authorities received a 911 call about a possible shooting at the home shortly before 4:30 p.m. Monday. A 3-year-old girl remained in critical but stable condition Thursday at a hospital, Nichols said.
