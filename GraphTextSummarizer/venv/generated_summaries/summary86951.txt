-- It'll be firecracker hot in the Southwest on the Fourth of July, but the Southeast and Ohio River Valley will be so drenched that floods are possible. The fire killed 19 members of an elite firefighting squad on Sunday when fierce, erratic winds whipped flames in different directions. "The most widespread showers and thunderstorms on Thursday will be from the central Gulf Coast northward into the Ohio River Valley," the National Weather Service said. Cities in California, Nevada and Arizona have already suffered through heat topping 120 degrees in the past few days. The extreme heat continues to wreak havoc for firefighters trying to stop Arizona's Yarnell Hill wildfire, which has scorched more than 8,400 acres, about 13 square miles of land.
