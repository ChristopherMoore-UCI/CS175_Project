CNN spoke with Horrigan by phone about the various ways people are using cell phones and the Internet today, including the 14 percent of people who use neither. I think as time marches on you'll see technology that's tailored more towards older Americans. So I'm someone who does like to have a bit of a break from the Internet from time to time or with cell phone availability. I think that will shrink over time as people become more dependent on the cell phone, which we do see as a rising trend. Horrigan: We recently produced a report called "The Mobile Difference," which places American adults into 10 different user types, depending on how they feel about information technology, what kind of information technology they have in their lives and how they use information technology in their lives.
