The incident allegedly took place Monday in a tribal village in a very remote part of West Bengal, in India's northeast, police spokesman Prasanta Chowdhury said. Violent crimes against women have been in the spotlight in India since a 23-year-old woman was raped and beaten by several men on a bus in December 2012. "I think this is absolutely inhuman and it is completely outrageous and preposterous to say the least," said Manish Tewari, India's information and broadcasting minister. Unless law takes strict action and creates a sense of fear in people, such sad incidents will continue to happen," said Kirti Azad, a leader of India's main opposition, the Bharatiya Janata Party. The shocking attack provoked outrage across India, leading to calls for improved safety and treatment of women.
