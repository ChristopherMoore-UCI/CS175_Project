But the settlement said the department denied the ACLU's accusations, and noted that "there has been significant fraud by midwives and other birth attendants certifying births as occurring in the United States when they have not occurred in the United States." Diez said U.S. authorities need to do more to address the problem. They share one thing in common: Both say they were delivered by midwives in south Texas, but pressured by U.S. Border Patrol agents to deny their U.S. citizenship. "Although midwifery has been a common practice for more than a century, particularly in rural and other traditionally underserved communities, the U.S. government has imposed unsurpassable hurdles on midwife-delivered Latinos to prove their citizenship and eligibility for U.S. passports -- even when their citizenship has already been established in the past." Their problems began, according to attorney Jaime Diez, when a group of midwives along the U.S.-Mexico border were found guilty of selling birth certificates to people who were not born in the United States. Border patrol agents are "obligated to ensure that documentation presented to establish citizenship is proper and correct and was issued to the person presenting the documents," spokesman Bill Brooks said in a statement.
