Coastal Living: Top 10 haunted lighthouses Photographer Steve Terrill of Portland recalls standing outside at dusk and seeing a translucent figure looking down on him from the attic. The spirit of a mourning mother haunts Heceta Head, a 115-year-old lightstation on the windswept Oregon Coast. Heceta Head sits on an isolated stretch of the windswept Oregon Coast. The Gray Lady, usually seen wearing a floor-length gray skirt, lurks in the attic of the lightkeeper's home, which is on the National Register of Historic Places and now operates as a bed-and-breakfast. The beacon, the strongest on the Oregon Coast, is visible 21 miles away at sea.
