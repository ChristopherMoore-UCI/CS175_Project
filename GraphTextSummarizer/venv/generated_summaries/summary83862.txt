-- A Muslim family removed from an airliner Thursday after passengers became concerned about their conversation say AirTran officials refused to rebook them, even after FBI investigators cleared them of wrongdoing. After the FBI interviewed family members, it released them, Irfan said. AirTran spokesman Tad Hutcheson said the incident began when some passengers reported hearing suspicious remarks by a woman and alerted flight attendants. Atif Irfan, his brother, their wives, a sister and three children were headed to Orlando to meet with family and attend a religious conference. AirTran Airways late Thursday said they acted properly and that the family was offered full refunds and can fly with AirTran again.
