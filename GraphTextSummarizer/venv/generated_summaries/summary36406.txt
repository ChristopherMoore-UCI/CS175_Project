Bannister, who lives just down the street from the Antonakos home, told CNN he and Melet Antonakos had become good friends. Melet Antonakos worked in medical equipment sales while Kimberly Antonakos served as a president of a parent/teacher group, according to The Greenville News. Also killed aboard the plane were the Antonakos family: Milton "Melet" Antonakos; his wife, Kimberly Antonakos; and their children Mills, Ana and Olivia, Bragg said. "Without a doubt, it's the most devastating tragedy I think we've had to experience since I've been here," said Scott Sanders, a 21-year Greenville resident. Melet was Antonakos' traditional family Greek name.
