The stage is set for high tensions between two of the macho men of world politics at a leader's summit next month, after Australian PM Tony Abbott vowed to "shirt-front" Vladimir Putin over the MH17 disaster. " Putin's upcoming presence on Australian soil has been a contentious topic in the wake of the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over an area of eastern Ukraine controlled by pro-Russia separatists. But on Sunday, Australian Treasurer Joe Hockey confirmed to public broadcaster ABC that Putin would attend, saying G20 member nations were in consensus that he should be there. I am going to be saying to Mr. Putin, Australians were murdered. Abbott used the term Monday when speaking to reporters about the Russian President's attendance at the G20 Leaders' Summit, to be held in Brisbane next month.
