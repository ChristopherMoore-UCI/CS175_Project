-- Congress returns to Washington on Monday after a monthlong summer break to jump right into debate and votes on a resolution giving President Barack Obama the authorization to strike Syria. The House and Senate are in session at 2 p.m. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid is expected to take the first procedural steps to overcome an anticipated filibuster over whether to officially take up the Syria resolution. â€¢ Obama goes to Capitol Hill to meet with Senate Democrats on Syria. Should opponents filibuster whether to take up the Syria resolution, the first critical vote in the Senate could come today, requiring 60 votes to break the filibuster and move on to debate. "Members should expect a robust debate and vote on an authorization of use of military force pertaining to Syria in the next two weeks," he wrote.
