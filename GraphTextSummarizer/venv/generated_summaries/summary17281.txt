She held off the challenge of precocious American teenager Mikaela Shiffrin by just nine hundredths of a second over two legs at Beaver Creek in Colorado. Svindal, a four-time World Cup champion in the Super-G, will also be defending his Olympic title in Sochi next February and on this early form will be favorite for gold again. The race on the famous Birds of Prey course had a dramatic ending as 18-year-old Shiffrin, second last to go on the second run, took the lead from Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein. Six of Svindal's 22 wins have come at Lake Louise with Super-G success previously in 2005, 2007, 2011 and 2012. The win has also left him top of the overall World Cup standings, his cause helped when American hope Ted Ligety skied out on the top part of the course.
