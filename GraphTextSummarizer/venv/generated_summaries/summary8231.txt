"If somebody had told me at some stage in my career that I'd have more Roland Garros titles than any other grand slam, I'd probably go get drunk," Sharapova later told reporters. " Sharapova is routinely listed as the world's richest female athlete with a thick dossier of high-profile sponsors and with Saturday's check of more than $2 million, she also moved into second place in career prize money on the WTA tour behind Serena Williams at upwards of $30 million. Stretched to deciders by Samantha Stosur, Garbine Muguruza -- Williams' conqueror -- and Eugenie Bouchard on her way to the French final, it looked like Sharapova would drop another opening set when Halep held an early 2-0 lead on a second consecutive sweltering day in the French capital. Even after losing the second set and hitting a flurry of double faults, Sharapova still had the edge. " While Halep cried in her chair after the match, there were tears of joy for Sharapova, who made the now familiar climb up to her box in celebration.
