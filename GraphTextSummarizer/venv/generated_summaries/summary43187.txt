Michelle Noehren, founder of CTWorkingMoms.com, is not uncomfortable when she sees women breastfeeding in public but believes we need to do more to support all women's choices. " "We as moms, myself included, need to be bold and comfortable with nursing in public," says Lee. Every time I hear about another case of a woman breastfeeding her baby in a restaurant, department store or on a plane who is asked to cover up, head to the bathroom or leave altogether, I wonder why in 2014 we remain so incredibly uncomfortable with breastfeeding in public. " Earlier this month, in connection with Breastfeeding Awareness Month, Lee joined 50 other nursing moms, members of a group called the "Badass Breastfeeders of Atlanta," for a "Big Latch On" event where they nursed together in public and were joined by their families and other bystanders. Let me just say right here that this is not a piece on the benefits of breastfeeding or a push to make the case that "breast is best" and encourage women to breastfeed.
