Jessica suffers from a rare and fatal disease called Niemann Pick Type C. A cholesterol imbalance destroys healthy cells in the liver, spleen and brain. " Anthony Leoni sums it up this way: "We know that there are other families that have challenges similar to us, sometimes even more dramatic than ours, and if we can serve a purpose or a role to help bring the awareness to public what it takes to take care of a family like ours, then we're willing to make that effort." Anthony and Lisa Leoni are afraid of budget cuts that pose a threat to daughter Jessica's care. We estimate 40 percent of California clients have over 300 hours a year." Anthony Leoni has this to say about impending cuts to Jessica's life-sustaining care. A steady stream of nurses, caregivers and therapists visit 12-year-old Jessica at home around the clock.
