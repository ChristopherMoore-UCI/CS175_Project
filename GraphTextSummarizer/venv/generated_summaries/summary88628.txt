"That ... led us to issue an amended death certificate that (established) cyanide toxicity as the cause of death, and the manner of death as homicide," Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Steve Cina said Monday. Urooj Khan won the prize in June on a scratch-off ticket. Talking briefly with CNN affiliate WBBM and the Tribune, Khan's widow described her husband as kind and exemplary. "We are investigating it as a murder, and we're working closely with the medical examiner's office," Chicago police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton said Monday. The check, which amounted after taxes to about $425,000, was issued July 19, according to CNN affiliate WGN, but Khan never got to spend it.
