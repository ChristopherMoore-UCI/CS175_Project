-- Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska Wednesday declared victory over fellow Republican Joe Miller in the nation's last Senate race, saying the result of her write-in candidacy was a "miracle. Palin endorsed Miller over Murkowski for the state's GOP Senate primary, and the national Tea Party group followed suit. However, 8,153 of Murkowski's votes have been contested by the Miller campaign. Murkowski was first appointed to her post by her father, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski, in 2002. As Alaska's Division of Elections tallied them, some ballots that contained misspellings or variations of "Lisa Murkowski" have been credited as votes for her.
