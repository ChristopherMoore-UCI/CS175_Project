A blood clot formed after the dissection, and a piece of it likely broke off and traveled into an artery in her brain, blocking blood supply and resulting in an ischemic stroke, explained Dr. Daniel Antoniello, the attending neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center who treated Osofsky-McGonigle. Generally speaking, tPA is only effective and only given within a 4.5-hour time window after stroke symptoms appear, said Antoniello. How well a person recovers from stroke is highly variable and highly individual, Antoniello said. Stroke victims don't call 911, delay crucial treatment "That dissolved the clot and restored blood flow," Antoniello said. Osofsky-McGonigle had aphasia, a common outcome of stroke in which parts of the brain related to language, including reading, writing and talking, are damaged.
