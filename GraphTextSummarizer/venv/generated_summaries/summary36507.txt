-- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez arrived in Havana early Wednesday for a new round of medical treatment, Cuban state media reported. Chavez will undergo several sessions of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, state media said. Members of Venezuela's opposition wished Chavez good health but criticized him Wednesday for a lack of transparency regarding his health and treatment. "I think that he should speak to the Venezuelan people with transparency about what the situation is, what the scope of this treatment is," said Henrique Capriles Radonski, who faced off against Chavez in October's presidential election and is now vying for governor in Venezuela's Miranda state.
