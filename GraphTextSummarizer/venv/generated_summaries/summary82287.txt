"Using ISIL as a political tool is meant as a strategy to turn out their base, but the inherent problem in pushing partisanship is losing persuadable voters," he said, predicting it would "backfire" But Walden, Israel's GOP counterpart, says talking security on the campaign trail is a legitimate issue and fair game. "We should not conflate an expression of concern about terrorism with it as a driver of vote choice," says Greenberg in a blog for the Huffington Post. "Voters typically look to the President and to the military for security, not to members of Congress," says Greenberg. Rep.
