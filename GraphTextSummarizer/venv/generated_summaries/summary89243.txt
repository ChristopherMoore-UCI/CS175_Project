The suspect was shot twice by other officers from Bellaire, Holloway said. The pursuit started after a driver refused to stop when a Bellaire police officer tried to pull over his vehicle, Houston police spokesman John Cannon said. Jimmie Norman, a 24-year veteran of the Bellaire, Texas, police, died at a hospital, said Chief of Police Byron Holloway. Norman, 53, was married and had two adult children, one of whom works with the police department, Holloway said. "We owe a great debt of thanks to Officer Norman and the thousands like him who ask for not much more than to be a good police officer and to come home safe," Bellaire Mayor Phil Nauert said in a written statement.
