Given the length, expense and unpopularity of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is conceivable that future presidents may not automatically receive the vaunted accolade of presidential greatness when they commit the nation to military action. Not everyone agrees with the policies of great presidents; transformation is often painful. Great presidents are opportunists: They acknowledge America's strong bias toward the status quo and recognize that large changes are possible only when the status quo has been severely compromised. Great presidents appreciate that their authority is as much emotional and moral as it is institutional. Responding to crises and initiating wars may not represent the best way to determine the greatness of American presidents for the rest of the 21st century.
