Caplan also points out that if Canavero can do this, he should first be helping paralyzed patients by fixing their spinal cords, before transplanting whole bodies. As crazy as this sounds, to put an entire head on a new body, a human body, Italian physician Dr. Sergio Canavero says we are approaching  HEAVEN (an acronym for head anastomosis venture; anastomosis is surgically connecting two parts). Batjer further explains that it's a great leap to go from brain survival of the surgery to restoring body function, which White did not look at. Doing so with an ultra-sharp blade will avoid the damage experienced by spinal cord injury patients, he says. Before ithe monkey died, it could not move because the spinal cord of the head and body were not connected.
