While Harper recognizes that raising young children can be intense and tiresome, she emphasizes it is vital to take the initiative to create memories -- not simply wait to capture certain moments. She says her latest book is like a natural segue, as "The Home Stage" includes many photos of children. "One is to convey that stage in life when you're anchored to the home with young children," Harper said. " Harper's mother was a big fan of the arts, and she would take young Harper and her sister to local art museums where they would copy paintings by hand, progressing from crayons to charcoal and, eventually, to pastels. Throughout "The Home Stage," Harper also manages to effectively create a balance between carefully planned compositions and naturally occurring moments.
