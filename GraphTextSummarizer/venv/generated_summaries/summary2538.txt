The president's comments have stirred fear that the government will implement sharia for the hundreds of thousands of southerners and other non-Muslims in northern Sudan, including many who fled fighting, disease and famine in the south. Sharia already is the law of the land in northern Sudan, but Sudanese authorities have relaxed its enforcement since 2005 when a peace treaty ended more than 20 years of civil war. The war pitted a northern government of Arab Muslims against blacks in Southern Sudan who practice Christianity and animist religions. Al-Bashir has declared that if Southern Sudan votes in favor of separation, sharia will become the main source of Sudan's Constitution, Islam the state religion and Arabic the official language. They speak a dozen different languages, and while a majority of people are Muslims, a significant number are Christians or practice traditional religions.
