FAA to pilots: Turn off those electronic devices Newer pilots for U.S. airlines today typically fly for regional carriers, which operate smaller jets domestically and feed bigger airlines at their hubs. Questions around pilot training are also at the center of the first major U.S. airline accident since the Colgan tragedy -- the one on Saturday involving an Asiana Boeing 777 that crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport. The rule also requires first officers to undergo new training and testing specific to the planes they fly. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) blamed pilot error and inadequate training for that accident. Pilots will need more cockpit training to become fully certified first officers for U.S. passenger and cargo airlines.
