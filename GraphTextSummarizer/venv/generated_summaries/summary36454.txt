The actor, who is also an advocate for women's rights, added: "The amount of gender violence that I experience is absolutely extraordinary, and a significant part of my day today will be spent filing police reports at home about gender violence that's directed at me on social media." Twitter, trolls and sports collided recently in another high-profile social media fight involving former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling. Ashley Judd is taking on Twitter trolls, who she says make social media an unsafe space with violent threats. "While we take threats of violence seriously and will suspend responsible accounts when appropriate, we strongly recommend contacting your local law enforcement if you're concerned about your physical safety," Twitter says. Just today, the company debuted a new feature it says will make the process of reporting abusive tweets to law enforcement more seamless. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo has admitted the company has a less than stellar track record for cracking down on abusive tweets.
