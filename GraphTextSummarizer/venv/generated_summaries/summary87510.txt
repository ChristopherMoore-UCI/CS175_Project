Perhaps the biggest hurdle for the defense is the fact that Caylee had been missing for 31 days before authorities were aware of it, and her mother failed to report it, Casarez said. -- Before the tabloid headlines, before the media crush, before Casey Anthony and her daughter Caylee became instantly recognizable, there were only two phone calls. " Authorities have said that the amount of decomposition would seem to indicate Caylee died shortly after she went missing. In addition, some have alleged that Anthony didn't behave like the worried mother of a missing child during the search for Caylee. Perry has allowed pictures of Anthony taken at nightclubs, both before and after Caylee went missing, to be presented at trial.
