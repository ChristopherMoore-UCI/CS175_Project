In the six restaurants that ran a pilot scheme, according to CEO Rajat Suri, customers at E la Carte tables spent 10% to 12% more than those at other tables. Eventually, E la Carte might offer restaurants the option to compile data about their customers' preferences as they use the device. E la Carte tablets allow customers to browse a full menu and communicate their orders directly to the kitchen. One company that is selling those tablets, E la Carte, announced on Tuesday that it has raised more than $1 million in funding from prominent investors like Y Combinator, Dave McClure and SV Angel. Restaurants that can afford menus that expensive aren't casual restaurants, like Applebee's, where a digital ordering system seems more appropriate.
