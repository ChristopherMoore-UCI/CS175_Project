Hungary continued to dominate in the water, with star player Ervin Zador scoring twice, but the temperature of the match rose steadily in a series of violent clashes. With the United Nations -- already divided over the Suez crisis and unwilling to risk an escalation of Cold War hostilities -- powerless to act, Hungary's Olympic team became an icon of their country's doomed struggle for freedom. Protesters were gunned down in the street, while thousands were imprisoned and executed, including Imre Nagy, the leader of the ill-fated revolt whose withdrawal of Hungary from the Warsaw Pact and declaration of neutrality had prompted Soviet intervention. "In the strained political situation we were in, it was a body-to-body encounter with our opponents," recalled Hungarian player Gyorgy Karpati. When Dezso Gyarmati caught a Soviet player on the chin with his fist -- by accident or design -- as he wound up to shoot Hungary in front, the crowd cheered both the goal and the outbreak of hostilities.
