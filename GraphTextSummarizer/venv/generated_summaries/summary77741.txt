Read more: Carnival cruise line in more troubled waters Late Friday afternoon, New South Wales police said they called off the search after finding no sign of the couple. Authorities believe the couple fell about 150 kilometers (93 miles) off Foster, New South Wales. Maritime officers reviewed surveillance video from the ship and determined that Paul Rossington and Kristen Schroder went overboard Wednesday night. "We believe that they were up mid-deck, which is halfway up the side of the ship, which is quite a way to fall," said Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings of the New South Wales Police Marine Area Command. The 30-year-old man and 27-year-old woman were reported missing when the Carnival Cruise ship Spirit docked in Sydney on Thursday morning, CNN affiliate Seven Network reported.
