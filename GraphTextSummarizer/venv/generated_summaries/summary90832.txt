Former Washington Mayor Marion Barry is dead, a Washington hospital spokeswoman said early Sunday. His recently released autobiography, "Mayor for Life: The Incredible Story of Marion Barry, Jr.," recalls a quote that underscored Barry's ability to spotlight inequalities in America. " President Barack Obama said in a statement that he and first lady Michelle Obama were "saddened" to hear of Barry's death. He was found not guilty of the DUI charge, and the state said a computer glitch erroneously reported that Barry's license had been suspended. Former Harvard professor and civil rights leader Cornell West said on CNN on Sunday that Barry "had his flaws" but  was a "great freedom fighter" for the poor and disenfranchised.
