-- Sherwood Schwartz, the prolific television writer and producer best known as the creator of the iconic sitcoms "Gilligan's Island" and "The Brady Bunch," died Tuesday morning in Los Angeles. But he first left his most indelible mark by creating and producing two ensemble sitcoms: "Gilligan's Island," which aired for 98 episodes on CBS starting in 1964, and "The Brady Bunch," which aired on ABC from 1969 to 1974. "Sherwood was a wonderful writer and producer, but more importantly he was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather and friend," said Florence Henderson, who starred as mom Carol on "The Brady Bunch. Schwartz was awarded a star on Hollywood's "Walk of Fame" in 2008, according to website IMDb. Ultimately, he was a wonderful teacher in life and again, in death, he taught us how to leave with dignity and courage."
