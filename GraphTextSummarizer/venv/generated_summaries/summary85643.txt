Some vacation spots are exclusively for the 18-and-older set, while others simply have fewer children present because most children are attending school. That doesn't mean toddlers, home-schooled children or children with varying school holidays won't be present. That's because the travel industry enters into a so-called shoulder season after Labor Day, when most travelers head back to school or work and airline seats and hotel rooms remain unfilled. Imagine a lovely trip to the Caribbean, your favorite mountain retreat or even Disneyland without hordes of children around. Even if you have children you adore, it sounds tempting, doesn't it?
