Rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed al Fayed, that British security services were behind the crash. Although Diana and Dodi Fayed died in Paris, a British coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to Britain. At the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayed's security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees, formerly known as Trevor Rees-Jones, was the front-seat passenger in the Mercedes that carried Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul. Lawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police.
