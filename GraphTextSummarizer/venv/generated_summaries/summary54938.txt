Like Satala, who has been a star of Fiji's world renowned seven-a-side team, Rokoduguni is also an expert of that version of rugby which relies more on speed and agility than the traditional 15-a-side game. But fast forward six years and Rokoduguni has had the last laugh because when he is not patrolling the front line with the army in dangerous trouble spots such as Afghanistan, he is charging to the try line at the home of rugby union Twickenham. "Watching him playing Premiership rugby, I thought one day I'll be doing the same thing but, I never realized it's going to be that soon," Rokoduguni said. Still a serving officer, risen to the rank of Lance Corporal, Rokoduguni signed a professional contract with leading English Premiership side Bath at the start of 2012-13 season. But if there is one thing that the Army has instilled in Rokoduguni it is discipline: "You have to dress up correctly, be punctual at all times, uniforms ironed."
