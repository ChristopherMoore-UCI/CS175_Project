I was the first person in the United States to be exonerated from death row because of DNA testing. At the time of my first trial, DNA testing was not a well-understood concept in criminal law. In 1992, I came across a book about DNA testing used to solve murders in England. On July 25, 1984, Dawn was raped and murdered in Baltimore County. I am living proof that America's system of capital punishment is broken beyond repair.
