"This is the collaboration of all the years of making different models and taking all that knowledge and putting it into one cohesive piece of glass," said Martindale. "Sometimes doctors want an aneurysm in them, sometimes they want diseased hearts," Martindale said as he spun molten glass. "The 'a-ha' moment was when he found out that he could turn a metal part that was made in the medical industry into glass and he could produce it for way cheaper than anyone else," Martindale said. The modest lobby opens up into a pristine production lab filled with skilled glassblowers, blue-flaming torches and dazzling glass models of the human heart, brain and vascular system. Farlow's Scientific Glassblowing makes the glass organs and vascular models used by medical-device manufacturers in preliminary testing to determine whether their products will work in real-life situations.
