"There are serious allegations that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been committed time and time again with total impunity, yet the Security Council has failed to refer the case of Syria to the International Criminal Court, where it clearly belongs. She added, "I deeply regret that, given the onset of so many other armed conflicts in this period of global destabilization, the fighting in Syria and its dreadful impact on millions of civilians has dropped off the international radar." " Russia, a longstanding ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, has repeatedly blocked U.N. sanction resolutions on Syria. It's a chilling figure: 191,369 men, women and children reported killed in Syria between March 2011 and the end of April 2014. "The killers, destroyers and torturers in Syria have been empowered and emboldened by the international paralysis," she said in a statement Friday.
