-- When the highly anticipated "BioShock: Infinite" hits stores on Tuesday, a naive 19-year-old with special powers and book smarts -- but little true grasp of the complexities of the world around her -- will meet a gaming public that's been awaiting her debut for years. "The biggest challenge of this entire game wasn't the skylines and it wasn't the open world," said writer Drew Holmes. When Elizabeth was again revealed to the world in videos displaying her personality and emotional range, she was an instant hit. "If Liz Squad, or Elizabeth herself, needed something from the development team, then she got what she needed." In the game's story line, the teen Elizabeth has the ability to change the world around her. "You don't see a lot of companion characters wearing dresses -- at least not of the non-miniskirt variety," Robertson said.
