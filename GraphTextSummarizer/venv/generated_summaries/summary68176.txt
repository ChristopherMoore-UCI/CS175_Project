Arsene Wenger's team had dropped to 10th after last weekend's defeat by Swansea, but climbed back up to sixth as the London side bounced back from the midweek Champions League loss to Olympiakos. "Little by little we are adjusting things, but if we have more confidence, with the quality we have we will win games," said the Spanish coach, who will now seek to repeat his 2010 Club World Cup success with Inter Milan -- after which he was promptly sacked having fallen out with players and officials at the Italian club.
