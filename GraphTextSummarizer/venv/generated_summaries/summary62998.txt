The six victims of Sunday's attack were identified by police as five men -- Sita Singh, 41; Ranjit Singh, 49; temple president Satwant Singh Kaleka, 65; Prakash Singh, 39, and Suveg Singh, 84 -- and one woman, 41-year-old Paramjit Kaur. "It's like I don't even know that person," Laura Page said of more recent photos of Page. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards also said family members of Wade Michael Page, 40, have not reported observing any warning signs. While the FBI has said Page never was the subject of an investigation, he was mentioned in a small number of federal law enforcement reference files in cases going back seven years, a law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. According to a man who described himself as Page's old Army buddy, the attacker talked about "racial holy war" when they served together in the 1990s.
