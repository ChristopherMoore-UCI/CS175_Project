Personally, I think free e-reader devices, if they worked with library e-book lending programs (like the one in Oakland, California) and open e-book formats (like .mobi and .pdf) -- could help increase access to books for youths, seniors and low-income communities. At that point, selling e-readers at any price might just become an obstacle to selling more e-books. -- E-books are revolutionizing the publishing industry and reader preferences, and Amazon might be in a unique position to hasten that change -- if they decide to start giving away their popular Kindle e-reader for free. Last year, nearly $1 billion in e-books were sold, according to Forrester. That's an awful lot of money to be made selling e-books.
