Prosecutor Jim Flaiz, upon learning Ohio school shooter T.J. Lane was going to make a statement in court Tuesday, told relatives of his victims to be prepared for something inflammatory. " After the sentencing, defense attorney Friedman said Lane's comment to the families was a "very difficult statement to hear." Lane's sister, Sadie Lane, pleaded for compassion and prayers for her family a well as for those of the victims. According to the Geauga County prosecutor, Common Pleas Judge David L. Fuhry was unaware that Lane had the lettered T-shirt. " "A school is a place where a student should feel safe," the judge said, adding Lane took advantage of unsuspecting students. After the shooting, an assistant football coach chased Lane out of Chardon High, and police arrested him nearby a short time later.
