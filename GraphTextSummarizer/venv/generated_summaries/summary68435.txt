"It's not a good way to send inappropriate photos," said Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel at the San Francisco Techcrunch Disrupt conference on Monday. Meet the kid-friendly version of Snapchat Spiegel pointed out that it is possible for a recipient to take take screenshots of snaps, and said it was even possible for determined hackers with time and money to access the messages and "betray your trust." More than 350 million of these messages, called "snaps," are traded every day on Snapchat, according to Spiegel. Instead of taking the usual route and adding in display ads, Spiegel said the company was leaning toward in-app transactions. Google's wearable computing system has already stirred up privacy concerns for its ability to surreptitiously capture photos, and the association could be just the kind of negative publicity Snapchat is trying so hard to avoid.
