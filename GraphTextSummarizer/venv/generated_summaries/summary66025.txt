Having lived with Va Bene for a couple of years, Eric Clapton finally felt the time was right for a refit. The first thing that strikes you on boarding Va Bene is the calm, informal atmosphere of what is clearly a much-loved family yacht rather than a glitzy monument to success. Eric Clapton enjoys spending time relaxing on his superyacht Va Bene. Indeed, it was during this holiday that Eric Clapton took time out to talk to SuperYacht World about his born-again Va Bene (see p74). Eric Clapton has a house on the island and Va Bene is based here during the winter season.
