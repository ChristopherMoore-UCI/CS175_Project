In 2007, FIFA launched the $8 million "Win in India" project to build a range of football grounds across the country. A FIFA spokesman told CNN: "FIFA is convinced of the huge potential of India in terms of football development. There are many pockets across [India] where football is equally or more popular than cricket, such as Goa, Kolkata, Kerala, Bangalore, parts of Delhi and the whole northeast of India. The national team is not the only area of untapped potential, according to many working in football in India; the domestic leagues and infrastructure could both be areas for development. "The AFC have really worked hard to professionalize football in India," he said.
