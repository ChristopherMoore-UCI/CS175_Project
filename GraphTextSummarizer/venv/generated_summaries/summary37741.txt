Like Thaksin, the new owners want manager Mark Hughes to deliver Champions League qualification by breaking into the top four of the Premier League. -- Manchester City have completed a sensational transfer deadline-day swoop for Brazilian forward Robinho in an estimated Â£32.5 million ($58 million) deal with Real Madrid, following the English Premier League club's takeover by an Abu Dhabi group on Monday. Earlier in the day, City agreed to a takeover by the United Arab Emirates business group, a deal that will end former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's brief ownership of the Premier League club. Tottenham accepted City's bid for Berbatov, but the Bulgarian international opted to join the Premier League champions. " Robinho confirmed the presence of his international team-mates Jo and Elano at City was a factor in his decision to sign, even though Chelsea appeared a more likely destination at the start of transfer deadline day.
