"It feels like you're walking through the gates of hell because there are mule skeletons sticking out of the ground," Dan Fredinburg, one of the Google team members who photographed all four peaks, says about his experience at Aconcagua. The Trekker — the backpack camera apparatus Google used to photograph its Grand Canyon collection, which debuted in February — had yet to be invented when Fredinburg and friends set their sights on some summits. The views include four famous peaks from across the globe: the snow-capped Everest Base Camp in Asia's Himalayas, dormant volcano Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, Mount Elbrus in Europe and Aconcagua in Pope Francis' home country of Argentina. breathtaking beauty of geological wonders becomes a demanding and time-consuming task, so Fredinburg and the other adventurers would meet at night to plot their itinerary, which usually began at first light. Fortunately for them, assembling all that data back in Mountain View was a far less rigorous task: Google engineers use their mapping software to link the photos to their shooting locations and string them together to create the panoramic paths users walk through.
