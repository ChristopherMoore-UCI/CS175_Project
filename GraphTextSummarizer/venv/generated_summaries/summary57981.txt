"Despite what Hollywood portrays about Special Forces being the tip of the spear," King said, "a good part of the mission is developmental projects like helping local schools and building wells." Jack M. Martin III, 26, died after a bomb exploded Tuesday near their Humvee on the island of Jolo, said Lt. Col. David King. About 600 U.S. military personnel serve in the Philippines at any one time, King said. The U.S. military is providing support and training to the Philippines in the battle against the terrorist group, which has ties to al Qaeda. It was Shaw's second deployment to the Philippines and the first for Martin, who served in Iraq, according to a news release from U.S. Army Special Forces Command.
