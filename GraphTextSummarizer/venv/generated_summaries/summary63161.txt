Steve Miller Band's first new studio album since 1993's "Wide River" hits stores on June 15, and sees Miller embracing the blues music he immersed himself in growing up in Dallas. It sounds just like the Steve Miller Band!" Reaction from fans has been gratifying as well, according to Miller. -- Steve Miller admits he has no idea why it took him 17 years to release a new studio album. Indeed, one of the guest artists on the album is renowned guitarist and 15-time Grammy nominee Joe Satriani, who trades solos with Miller on "Rock Me Baby" and Vaughan's "Sweet Soul Vibe." A young Miller even learned some chords from his father's friend, guitarist Les Paul.
