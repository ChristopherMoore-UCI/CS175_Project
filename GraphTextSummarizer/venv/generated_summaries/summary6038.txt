High school students protest in front of their school in the western Athens suburb of Peristeri. Later in the day, scores of artists are scheduled to gather in central Athens to stage a protest concert in response to the initial shooting of 15-year-old Alexandros Grigoropoulos. -- Thousands of youths demonstrated in central Athens Friday as anger flared in the Greek capital following the shooting of another teenager. The mysterious shooting has enflamed widespread student anger over the fatal police shooting of a 15-year-old boy December 6, which sparked Greece's worst riots in decades.
