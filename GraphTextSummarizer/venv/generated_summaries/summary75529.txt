Beyond her time in office as U.S. senator, and as secretary of state, and as counsel to Bill during his presidency, the namesake foundation she leads with her husband and daughter is having a profound impact in this country and internationally, facilitating education, health care and nutritional programs. Clinton's election potentially extends boomer influence in a manner that risks creating a generation gap that further increases political disaffection among young voters. Nobody is saying the former secretary of state, New York senator, U.S. and Arkansas first lady, and Yale-trained attorney is not qualified for the White House. Clinton has a breadth of experience that indicates she has every capability needed to be president of the United States. No one does this by turning 70 during their first year as president, which would be Clinton's status.
