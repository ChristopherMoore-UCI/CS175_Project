The declaration, purportedly from a group of organizations representing indigenous people and communities in the Amazon, said of about 80 Yanomami people who lived in the Irotatheri community, only three survivors had reportedly been found. "Having received its own testimony from confidential sources, Survival now believes there was no attack by miners on the Yanomami community of Irotatheri," said Stephen Corry, director of Survival International. A declaration on the Survival International website last month said members of a neighboring indigenous community had heard reports of a massacre from Irotatheri's residents. Last month allegations of the reported massacre trickled out of the area, where unauthorized Brazilian gold miners have long clashed with indigenous groups. On Monday, Corry disputed that claim, saying "many illegal gold miners are currently operating" in the area.
