Budapest now offers escape challenges for all tastes, most costing about $40 per group of two to six people. This is the subterranean world of escape games, a craze that's swept through Budapest. Though escape games are now appearing across Europe, Budapest claims to have pioneered this unlikely new entertainment. She's emerging from one of three separate challenge zones at Parapark, an escape game hidden beneath Gondozo, one of Budapest's so called "ruin bars" (4, Vajdahunyad Street, Budapest; +36 30 619 5447). Escape games seem to be sound investment in Budapest, where real estate is cheap and low-cost labor is abundant -- not to mention the huge visitor numbers the city attracts.
