Durst says in the documentary that he had traveled during the week of Berman's death to Trinidad, California, a small coastal city in northern California. "We are certainly interested in any information that may or may not come out of interviews with Mr. Durst," Police Chief Andy Mills said. A witness gave police a description of the man behind the wheel, which resulted in a sketch of a gray-haired man with glasses -- a drawing that journalist Matt Birkbeck says looks remarkably like Durst. The FBI is asking detectives across the country to dust off their cold case murder files and see whether millionaire heir Robert Durst could be connected to any other unsolved crimes. Investigators know Durst was in California the week Berman died.
