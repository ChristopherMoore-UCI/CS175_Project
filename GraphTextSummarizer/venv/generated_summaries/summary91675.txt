To the wonderful array of characters and names in the "Harry Potter" universe -- Ron Weasley, Dolores Umbridge, Bellatrix Lestrange, Cornelius Fudge and He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named -- add yet another getting a shot at the spotlight: Celestina Warbeck. In a note on Pottermore.com (sign-up required), author J.K. Rowling mentions that the "Singing Sorceress," as she is known, has made occasional off-stage appearances in the Potter books and in a "Daily Prophet" series done for the Potter fan club. In the profile, Rowling describes Warbeck as a Welsh prodigy whose mother "bombarded" Hogwarts with letters to promote her daughter with various performing arts groups.
