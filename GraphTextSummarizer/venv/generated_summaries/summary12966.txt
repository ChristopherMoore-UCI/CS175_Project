The Martin case drew nationwide protests when Sanford police decided against arresting Zimmerman, who told investigators he killed Martin in self-defense. The man tasked with leading the police department in Sanford, Florida, in the wake of the Trayvon Martin killing said communities should "take a good, hard look at who is selected," for neighborhood watch programs. He said he has plans to help the department that has been under the microscope since the February 26 killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. But, said Sanford's interim Police Chief Richard Myers, he still supports the programs. "One of my major goals is to try and strengthen the relationship that Sanford police have with all elements of the community, especially the African-American community," he said.
