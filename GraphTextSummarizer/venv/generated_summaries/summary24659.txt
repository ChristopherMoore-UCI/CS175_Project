The students recorded 9,000 accounts, of which 7,500 were "blatantly racist" events ranging from private jokes and conversations to violent incidents, Feagin said. One of the researchers, Joe Feagin, said that's why it comes as no surprise to him that a powerful politician such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would talk about Barack Obama's skin color and use the term "Negro dialect" in what he considered a private conversation. Speaking not of Reid but of his conclusions drawn from his research, Feagin said, "Most whites have sharply reduced the blatantly racist stuff they do in public, while they still do huge amounts in private. "I don't think Sen. Reid was expressing sentiments he would not have expressed publicly. He said Reid "felt safe making" the comment about Obama because he was in a private setting.
