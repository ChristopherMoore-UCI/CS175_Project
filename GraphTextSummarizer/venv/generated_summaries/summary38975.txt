While the Geminid meteor shower has been visible in the night sky for several days, and will continue to be so for a few more, the meteors took center stage Saturday night. Earlier in the week, NASA said the Geminids were expected to peak just before dawn Saturday "with a predicted peak rate of 100 to 120 meteors per hour." " Geminids -- so-named because they appear to come out of the Gemini constellation, explained the chat moderator -- are debris from an extinct comet called 3200 Phaethon, which was previously believed to be an asteroid, according to NASA. "I started to see them around 11 p.m.," Savannah of Norwich, Connecticut, wrote during NASA's live chat of the event. "Basically it is the rocky skeleton of a comet that lost its ice after too many close encounters with the sun," NASA said on its website.
