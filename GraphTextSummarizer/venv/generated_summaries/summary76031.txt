Political appointees, like Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, do not receive bonuses. -- Senior career executives of the U.S. agency responsible for processing key veterans benefits will not receive performance bonuses this year following congressional complaints that the government has been too slow to process disability claims. Josh Taylor, a spokesman for the Veterans Administration, said the Veterans Benefits Administration has eliminated bonuses to ensure executives responsible for a backlog of claims are not rewarded since performance goals were not achieved. "VA employees and managers who fail in their jobs shouldn't receive bonuses -- they should be disciplined or fired," Rep. Jeff Miller, a Florida Republican and chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. The VA announced an initiative last week aimed at expediting decisions for veterans who have waited one year or longer for compensation claims.
