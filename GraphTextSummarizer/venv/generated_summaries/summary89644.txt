A recent example of the confusion sown by politically overheated allegations of fraud can be found in the much-ballyhooed charges by John McCain of voter fraud in 2008, all of which proved to be false. Nobody condones voter fraud. An epidemic of voter fraud is an urban myth, like alligators living in the sewer. In 2010, there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud -- none. But phony voters never showed up to vote.
