Battles between al Qaeda fighters and Houthi militia across a wide swath of central Yemen are an almost daily occurrence. A previous al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula video released in June showed AbdulMutallab embracing al-Wuhayshi, who is now deputy to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. A new video released by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula confirms the group's senior leaders were closely involved in the plot to blow up a U.S. airliner over Detroit five years ago and that American-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was among them. They had become prominent supporters of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and formed a friendship with  al-Awlaki, who married their sister. During AbdulMutallab's brief trial (which ended abruptly when he changed his plea to guilty), it was disclosed that the Nigerian had told the FBI he had been introduced in Sana'a to an al Qaeda operative named Abu Tarak, who became his principal handler.
