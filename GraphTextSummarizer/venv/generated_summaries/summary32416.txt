There are eerie similarities between Rupp and Prefontaine: Both were born and reared in Oregon, trained at the University of Oregon and later ran for the Oregon Track Club. The record, though, was not the most pressing issue on Galen Rupp's mind when he stepped up to the starting line on a cool, crisp night last week at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. When 26-year-old Rupp took to the track for the 5,000 meters Thursday at Hayward Field, the same track where Prefontaine set the meet record in 1972, he already owned an American record in the 10,000 meter. Prefontaine died in a car accident hours after running his last race at Hayward Field. Unseen, though, was another opponent: Prefontaine, whose presence decades after his death on May 30, 1975, at the age of 24, has loomed large over long distance running in the United States.
