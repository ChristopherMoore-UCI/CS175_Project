"Given the passionate fan base 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' has built over the past decade and the show's ratings and creative momentum this season, the time is right to make this move," said Disney/ABC Television President Anne Sweeney. The late-night TV talk war grows more competitive in January when ABC moves "Jimmy Kimmel Live" to an 11:35 p.m. start, pushing the long-running "Nightline" back an hour. ABC cited "increased revenue potential for entertainment programming" as a motive for moving Kimmel from the midnight timeslot he's occupied since January 2003. ABC boasted that "Jimmy Kimmel Live" was the only late-night broadcast talk show to see growth in overall audience in the past year. The decision is "a strategic shift in its late-night strategy to better position the network for increased ratings and financial performance over the long term," according to an ABC statement released Tuesday.
