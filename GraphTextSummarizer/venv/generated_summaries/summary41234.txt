Freer said she decided to dedicate herself to helping people change their lives via healthier eating years ago, when she was working as an assistant to Prince Charles, according to the Daily Mail. "I tried to lose weight, and I was making awful music, and it was only until that I started to be myself that the music started to flow and people started to listen." The Grammy-winning singer has shed 14 pounds and is crediting author Amelia Freer with his new slimmer look. "I used to arrive home exhausted (not because of the job, it turns out, but because of my terrible diet), with no energy to cook, so I would have cheese on toast or a plate of pasta with a glass of wine, slumped in front of the TV," she said. "Amelia Freer has helped me lose over a stone in 2 weeks and has completely transformed my relationship with food."
