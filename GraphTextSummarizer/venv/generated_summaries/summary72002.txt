"You basically build up a tolerance to the heat and then can taste all the flavors that are underneath it, so that what was just basically flavorless blazing heat, after a while, you can actually taste the different flavors in different chilis in different foods," he said. "As soon as something is declared and proven to be the hottest chili pepper in the world, everybody wants to grow it," said Dave DeWitt, the author of more than 35 books on chilis, including "The Complete Chile Pepper Book." Hirschkop puts the ghost chili in one of his "Insanity" sauces as well as in a limited-edition hot sauce he sells in a wooden coffin tied shut with caution tape. Stevens says he began eating chilis in the early 1990s when he needed to lose weight. "I wanted something that I could snack on that was pretty low-calorie but definitely let me know that I had eaten something, and chilis kind of fit the bill."
