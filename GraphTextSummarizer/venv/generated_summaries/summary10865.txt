To make packaging more environmentally friendly, "the most obvious thing we can do is reduce the weight," said Simon Hoffmeyer Boas, CSR manager. Brigitte Skadhuge, director of applied research, told CNN that type of barley "helps beer to stay fresh for a longer time than traditional beer." In the Carlsberg laboratory, where the pH scale was developed, new types of barley are developed. The number of packages returning through the system is astonishing: 90% of cans designed for single use are recycled, and nearly 100% of refillable bottles find their way back to Carlsberg. Lighter products can lessen energy needed in the manufacturing process, and "within the last 20 years the average weight of a glass bottle has been reduced by approximately 30%," Hoffmeyer Boas said.
