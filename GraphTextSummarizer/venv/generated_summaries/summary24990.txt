"Hopefully we'll look back in 20, 30 years and remember that first Olympics when it started and then go, 'Gosh you wouldn't imagine an Olympics not full of women.' " While the IOC also admits more needs to be done, particularly in getting more women into leadership positions in sport, there is no doubt London 2012 was worth celebrating for most -- but not all. The London event was heralded as "the Women's Games" and for good reason -- for the first time, every country and every event allowed women to compete. Some events, like boxing, had fewer weight classes available to women, even though women's international boxing recognizes more than the three chosen for the London Olympic program. In a country where women can't vote until 2015, can't play sports in public schools, and can't even drive, the Middle East country had to find female athletes to represent it.
