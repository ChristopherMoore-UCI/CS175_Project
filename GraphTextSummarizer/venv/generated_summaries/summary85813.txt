"By connecting cruise passengers with the support services available through the National Sexual Assault Hotline and Online Hotline, this legislation provides a vital lifeline for victims on cruise ships. Among the provisions in the bill related to sexual assaults: Ships are required to carry rape kits and a supply of medications to prevent STDs, along with medical staff trained to deal with assaults. -- A bill that requires cruise ships to tighten security measures and report alleged crimes is awaiting President Obama's approval. The legislation also requires cruise ships to provide passengers with free, confidential access to 24-hour sexual assault hot lines. "Safety protections in this bill will significantly reduce passengers' risk of sexual assault and expand the rights of those sexually assaulted on board," said Scott Berkowitz, president and founder of the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network.
