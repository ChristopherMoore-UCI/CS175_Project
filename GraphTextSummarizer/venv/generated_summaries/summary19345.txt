The real action begins Thursday at 7.45am local time with Stuart Cink of the U.S. getting proceedings underway alongside South Africa's Tim Clark. -- It is a well known fact in golf -- nobody who wins the Par 3 contest at Augusta goes on to win the Masters in the same week. U.S. star Moore, whose best finish at Augusta came in 2005 in 13th, finished two shots clear at the top of the leaderboard. Defending champion Adam Scott goes out in the 16th group with Jason Dufner and English amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick. Elsewhere, several babies were seen on greens as crowds flocked to see Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Arnold Palmer in action.
