-- Sarah Murnaghan, a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl with cystic fibrosis whose family fought to have young children prioritized for adult organs, received new lungs Wednesday, her family told CNN. On the same day he granted the injunction in Sarah's case, Judge Michael Baylson also granted a similar injunction in the case of 11-year-old Javier Acosta, making him eligible for adult lung. Doctors previously have said they believe modified adult lungs could save Sarah's life. At that time, Sarah had been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months. Sarah received lungs donated by an adult, according to Simon, meaning the lungs needed to be modified.
