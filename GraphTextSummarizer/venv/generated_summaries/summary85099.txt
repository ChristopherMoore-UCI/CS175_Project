-- Monaco is famed for its glamorous Grand Prix, exclusive Casino's and mega-wealthy occupants. Foster is famed for buildings like London's famous skyscraper, the "Gherkin" and the restored Reichstag in Berlin, which houses the German parliament. Situated on reclaimed land, the development will extend the city's existing marina eastwards and accommodate all sorts of craft, from small children's sailing boats to 100-meter superyachts. Energy supplies will be augmented by solar thermal panels as well as photovoltaics, while all the interior spaces will be air-conditioned using a low-energy, sea-cooled refrigeration system, the designers said. Now, the elite province is going to have an exclusive yacht club designed by one of the world's greatest living architects: Norman Foster.
