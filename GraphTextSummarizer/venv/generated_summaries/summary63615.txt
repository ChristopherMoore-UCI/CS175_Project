"This morning, without our knowledge, students placed a derogatory sign with a verse from a song by Drake on our school as a senior prank," Principal Jeff Cheney said in a note to parents, referring to the rapper Drake. More than 70% of the student population at South Forsyth High School is white, while more than 10% is Hispanic, 12% is Asian and less than 5% is black, according to school statistics. "Hopefully the actions today have initiated a lot of dinner conversation about how senior pranks should be lighthearted and clever, not mean-spirited and destructive," Newsome added. Students also reportedly turned a hallway into a slip and slide and put a for-sale sign on Cheney's car.
