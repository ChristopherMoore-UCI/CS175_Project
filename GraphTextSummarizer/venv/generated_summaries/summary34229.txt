Zvonareva, runner-up at the last two grand slams after also losing to Serena Williams in the Wimbledon final, took just over an hour to dispatch of Czech 25th seed Petra Kvitova 6-2 6-4. World No. 3 Kim Clijsters remains on course to win a second consecutive grand slam singles title after overcoming a challenge from Agnieszka Radwanska to reach the semifinals of the Australian Open. Denmark's Wozniacki is attempting to claim her first major title, while Na -- who also reached the last four in Melbourne last year -- hopes to become the first woman from her country to reach a grand slam final. The Russian second seed was full of praise for her 20-year-old Czech opponent, who knocked out home favorite and world number five Sam Stosur on her way to her second grand slam quarterfinal, matching her feat at Wimbledon in 2010. But despite losing a 4-1 lead in the first set and going down a break of serve early in the second, the more experienced Clijsters closed out the match to make the semifinals in Australia for the first time since her brief period of retirement from the game in 2008.
