Still, Anglada-Escude says the existence of star systems packed with potentially habitable planets, and the diversity of planets that Kepler has found, suggest there are more exciting discoveries yet to come. Another Earth called a certainty Scientists said the findings suggest that stars with low mass such as Gliese 667C are the best targets for looking for planets that could host life. How they compare to other habitable planets The Gliese 667C trio represents candidates for life that are about as good as three announced in April by scientists working with NASA's Kepler satellite. The findings are only the latest in a recent string of identifications of planets that may host life. You may recall planet Kepler-22b, which was announced in December 2011 and also was hailed as a potential candidate for hosting life.
