Team owners locked out players in early July as the two sides tried to hammer out a new agreement. -- After a long lockout, the National Basketball Association will open its doors Thursday for teams to hold voluntary workouts. A previous lockout in the NBA lasted 204 days -- from July 1998 to January 1999 -- before a new collective bargaining agreement was reached by both sides. One of the main sticking points was a split in revenues that owners said was unfair. The move comes after last week's announcement that the players and owners had reached a tentative deal to end the league's months-long lockout.
