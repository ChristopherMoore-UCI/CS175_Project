A nurse and two babies were killed by the blast, Mexico City Health Secretary Armando Ahued told CNN affiliate FOROtv. Gas Express Nieto, the company that owned the truck, has operated in Mexico City since 2007 and has a contract to supply gas to hospitals run by the Mexico City government, the mayor said. Hospital workers had already started evacuating the building when the explosion happened minutes later, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told reporters. Journalists James Fredrick and Sheila A. Sanchez Fermin and CNN's Krupskaia Alis and Fidel Gutierrez contributed to this report from Mexico City. A gas truck driver and two assistants were arrested Friday in connection with a deadly gas explosion that leveled part of a maternity hospital in Mexico City, killing at least three people and injuring dozens, authorities said.
