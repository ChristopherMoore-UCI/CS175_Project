The FAA said Monday it has "progressively improved" hiring, training and certification of new controllers and has increased its ranks of senior controllers, known as "certified professional controllers. "The FAA continues to meet overall goals for hiring, training time to certification and number of certified controllers." The FAA told the inspector general's office it recognizes the "failure rate" of new controllers is unacceptably high at some facilities and is addressing the issue. Nearly one-third of the senior controllers at the nation's most critical facilities are eligible for retirement, according to a report by the FAA's office of inspector general. -- Despite a five-year hiring surge, the Federal Aviation Administration is at risk of not having enough senior air traffic controllers for its busiest and most critical facilities, where they are needed to run operations and train less-experienced controllers, according to the agency's independent inspector general.
