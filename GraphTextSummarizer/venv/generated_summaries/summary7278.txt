Amos on Monday met Marines who had returned to the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, California, from Afghanistan. Some Marines had been wearing the bracelets -- which list names of those killed in Afghanistan, Iraq or other zones -- despite their not being permitted by regulations. In a change of policy, U.S. Marines are now allowed to wear bracelets in memory of fallen comrades. They had five comrades killed during their seven-month deployment in Helmand Province, said center spokesman Capt. The captain said the policy decision on the bracelets signified "we get why you're wearing it and it's blessed." Guidance on "standardization and uniformity" will be distributed to Marines by the end of next week, the Corps said.
