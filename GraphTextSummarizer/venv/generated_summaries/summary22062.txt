Miracle survivor In 1996, 23-year-old Pardeep Saini survived a ten-hour-flight from New Delhi to London Heathrow in the wheel well of a British Airways Boeing 747. In Heathrow they evaded security and passport checks to board an Air India flight bound for New York. Forgetting, for the moment, his ability to slip through numerous security checks, he had to avoid getting crushed by the wheel apparatus as it folded up and down, as well as survive oxygen deprivation and temperatures of below -45 degrees Celsius (-49 degrees Fahrenheit) at altitudes up to 38,000 feet. Found wandering the tarmac at Heathrow, Saini said he and his brother had fled India after being accused of having links to Sikh militants. They eventually confessed and were put on a return flight to Dublin, having spent a free night in a hotel, again courtesy Air India.
