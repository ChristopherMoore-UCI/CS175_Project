After a year he assumed the role of specialist in the furniture department of South Kensington, where he would see everything from European to Chinese furniture in the high-volume saleroom over the next 10 years. Meanwhile he became an auctioneer, doing a number of off-site sales at country estates and traveling to France and Belgium to generate business in the middle market of furniture. Dolman was born in London in 1960 and attended Dulwich College from 1971-1978, before studying History of Art at Southampton University. As he attempted to develop new categories to win business, he was made Managing Director. At that time he was on the Management Committee, and South Kensington began to do great sales.
