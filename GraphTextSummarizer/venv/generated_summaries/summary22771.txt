The law enforcement agencies involved include the FBI, King County Search and Rescue, King County Guardian One Helicopter and Redmond and Bellevue police departments. "We have received consent from the mother to search the vehicle and also her home in Redmond," police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate told reporters Monday. -- The search continued Monday in suburban Seattle for a 2-year-old boy who police said went missing after being left alone in a car by his mother the previous day. The Bellevue (Washington) Police Department acknowledged Monday, in a statement, that "there are still many unanswered questions." "All possibilities of what might have happened to the child are being investigated," Bellevue police said in their statement Monday.
