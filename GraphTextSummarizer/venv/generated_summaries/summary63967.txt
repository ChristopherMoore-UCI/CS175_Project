But as horrific as they were, they were only three camp complexes in a system of more than 850 ghettos, concentration camps, forced-labor camps and extermination camps that the Nazis established during the 12 years Adolf Hitler was in power. In some, Nazi doctors carried out depraved experiments, while others were primarily transit camps -- places to hold Jews and other "undesirables" until they were sent to other camps. The infamous Lublin-Majdanek camp, which -- like Auschwitz -- had elements of both concentration camp and extermination camp, was one where records were destroyed. But the exact numbers of dead will probably never be known, nor will the total number of people held prisoner in Nazi camps. Many of them combined the most dehumanizing and degrading characteristics of prison and slave labor camps.
