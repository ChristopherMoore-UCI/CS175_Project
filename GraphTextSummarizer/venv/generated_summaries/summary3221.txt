-- Iceland's Meteorological Office on Sunday lowered the aviation threat level from the Bardarbunga volcano from the highest level, red, down to orange. But the country's Civil Protection Department said on its website Sunday that a subglacial eruption, thought to be under way Saturday, did not occur. On Saturday, the agency raised the alert level for Bardarbunga to red, which means an eruption is imminent or in progress. Volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail. Scientists have noticed an increase in seismic activity over the past seven years around the volcano, located in the northwestern region of the Vatnajokull glacier, one of Europe's largest glaciers, the Meteorological Office said.
