-- The departure of U.S. troops left many questions lingering in Iraq Sunday, analysts told CNN's "State of the Union." Cartwright said U.S. troops may return to Iraq to help train Iraqi forces. He told visiting Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki that the two nations would build "a comprehensive partnership" that includes trade relations, support for building up Iraq's democratic capacity and military-to-military ties aimed at helping Iraq rebuild its air force, which was destroyed in the war against Saddam Hussein's regime. But the independent public database Iraq Body Count has compiled reports of more than 150,000 between the invasion and October 2010, with four out of five dead being civilians. Paul Bremer, a former envoy to Iraq under President George W. Bush, said President Barack Obama had "placed a very big bet" by pulling out troops.
