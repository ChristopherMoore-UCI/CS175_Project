-- Where can you buy a large punk rock head complete with pink Mohawk haircut, Mary Poppins' coat and umbrella, and a pair of competition boxing gloves used by elite athletes? Although the Games closed Sunday with the Olympic flag being handed over to the 2016 host city of Rio de Janeiro, enthusiasm for the London Olympics appears to be as strong as during the last two weeks when competitors performed in front of packed stadia and to a global audience of millions. It remains to be seen whether these bids are completed, but another enthusiast has offered double the basketball price for a limited edition of a 2012 Olympic torch signed by Bradley Wiggins -- the British cyclist who added the time trial gold medal to his victory in this year's Tour de France. The London Olympics organizing committee, LOCOG, says the money raised so far has helped subsidize the costs of torches and torchbearers and also contributes towards hosting the giant sporting festival. With only a few hours left in one sale, more than Â£3,000 ($4,709) has been bid for the basketball used in the men's final won by the U.S. in a close-fought game with Spain.
