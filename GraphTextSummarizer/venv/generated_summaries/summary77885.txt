Abdel Hameed Shehadeh, arrested in Hawaii in October 2010 and charged with making false statements in a matter involving international terrorism, attended Revolution Muslim meetings and made his website a feeder for Revolution Muslim's, according to the official. Morton also had a web of international connections, according to officials. Morton was the co-founder in 2007 of Revolution Muslim, a radical group based in New York City that is supportive of al Qaeda's philosophy. "We may never know all of those who were inspired to engage in terrorism because of Revolution Muslim, but the string of recent terrorism cases with ties to Morton's organization demonstrates the threat it posed to our national security." Morton's group Revolution Muslim was a spinoff of the American wing of Al Muhajiroun.
