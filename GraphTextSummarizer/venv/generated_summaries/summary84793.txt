"I would like to apologize to my fans, teammates, coaches, marketing partners and the entire US Soccer and Seattle Reign FC communities for my involvement in a highly unfortunate incident this past weekend," Solo said in a post on her Facebook page Thursday. U.S. women's soccer star Hope Solo has issued an apology after she was accused of assaulting two of her relatives at a Seattle home last weekend. Police said Solo's nephew and sister had visible injuries. Solo said in her statement Thursday that she was "confident in the legal process and believe my name will be cleared." 'Intoxicated and upset' Police have said Solo assaulted her relatives early Saturday.
