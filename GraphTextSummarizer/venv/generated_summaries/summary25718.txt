"We also will create a quick-response unit that will be able to augment embassy security in case there are indications ... in a particular country ... and that ambassador wants reinforcement with more Marines," Col.

Marine security guards were not assigned to the post in Benghazi when it was attacked, and it is unclear whether Marine guards could have helped or even prevented the attack.
