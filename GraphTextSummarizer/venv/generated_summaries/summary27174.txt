The women's slalom event in Ofterschwang, Germany was won by Slovenia's Tina Maze, who has already secured the overall World Cup title and remains on course to win five crystal globes in a season. -- Austria's Marcel Hirscher secured the World Cup slalom title on Sunday and maintained his lead in the overall standings in testing conditions at the Kranjska Gora run in Slovenia. "It's so easy to make a mistake in slalom and its so important to stay calm, that's the reason why I don't think too much about these records", she told FIS Alpine website. He was in third going into the second run but received a slice of fortune when Frenchman Alexis Pinturault did not finish his second attempt. Maze's 22nd World Cup podium pulled her level with Austrian legend Hermann Maier, having already broken her points record in a season.
