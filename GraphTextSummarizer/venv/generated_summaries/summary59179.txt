"Birdman" won the big prize -- outstanding motion picture cast -- at the 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, but it was talk about heritage and diversity that captured the evening. On the TV side, the winners included "Orange Is the New Black" -- a series about a women's prison, created by a woman, featuring a cast that includes a transgender performer -- and black actresses Viola Davis and Uzo Aduba. Her siblings, including Rosanna Arquette and David Arquette, are actors. The film awards generally went as expected, with Arquette, J.K. Simmons ("Whiplash"), Julianne Moore ("Still Alice"), Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and "Birdman" taking home the trophies. And the movie winners included Patricia Arquette, who won for a performance in "Boyhood" that she filmed over 12 years -- and wasn't afraid to show it.
