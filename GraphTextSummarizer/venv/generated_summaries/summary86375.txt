Two-time major winner Daly will not be playing at Augusta after losing his PGA Tour card and slipping down to 641st in the world rankings, but was selling merchandise and signing autographs outside the front gates of Augusta while Woods was holding court inside. Golf's original bad boy John Daly has welcomed Tiger Woods back to the fray for this week's Masters tournament, insisting that the troubled world No. 1 "didn't kill anybody." The 43-year-old Daly, who has been married four times and has admitted his own problems with alcohol, gambling and his weight, said he was happy to see his fellow American ready to return to golf. On Monday, Woods gave his first open news conference since the scandal about his marital infidelities broke at the end of last November, fielding questions from the media for 40 minutes. That's what he's known for, is winning at golf, it's really none of our business what he does off the course.
