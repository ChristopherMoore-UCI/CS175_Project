-- AS Roma hired Luis Enrique hoping a little Barcelona magic might rub off on the Serie A club, but the experiment came to a forlorn end on Saturday when the coach confirmed he was quitting after less than a year in charge. Amid increasing rumors about the coach's future, Roma general director Franco Baldini insisted the club wanted Luis Enrique to stay but the Spaniard has confirmed he will step down after Sunday's final game of the season. On announcing the appointment, Roma's sporting director Walter Sabatini said: "Luis Enrique represents an idea of football that we would like to follow, which imposes itself today through Spain and Barcelona. Luis Enrique will become the 20th coaching change in Serie A this season. "I'm leaving because I feel very tired and drained," Luis Enrique said in a statement posted on the Roma website.
