viewers of ABC's "Castle" have gotten to know Richard Castle, a mystery writer paired up with Detective Kate Beckett, and they've solved one murder after another, all the while fans were hoping these two would finally get together. After TV Guide readers voted them the favorite TV couple (not to mention the show placing in the top five favorites for CNN.com readers), it's clear that audiences are invested in just where the writers plan to take Castle and Beckett. For the 100th we wanted the quintessential 'Castle' show -- something that was fun, something with great Castle-Beckett stuff in it. We play a lot of it from Castle's point of view, trying to get her back. Hopefully we're finding that tonal balance in "Castle."
