Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, of which Peshawar is the capital, is rife with Islamic extremists and has been the site of recent clashes between Pakistani security forces and militants. People at the camp were returning after receiving their rations -- packages containing basic supplies like rice, flour and soap, according to Noor Akbar Afridi, the head of the camp. The Jalozai camp is located about 35 kilometers (22 miles) outside of Peshawar and houses hundreds of thousands of people who have left the country's volatile tribal region. Authorities estimate the car contained 30-35 kilograms (66-77 lbs) of explosive material. Some of those injured and killed were with a World Food Program affiliate that distributes the food aid.
