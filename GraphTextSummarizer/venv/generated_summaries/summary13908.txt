A chance to compete on the basketball court and soccer field can open entirely new social and academic prospects for young women. My recent work documents the struggles that young women confront as they seek opportunities to play soccer and other sports in Midwestern communities that have seen an explosion in their Hispanic populations in recent decades. As Marlen Esparza and other Latinas gain acceptance in "nontraditional" sports, the path for young girls in small towns gets a bit easier. While the world of sport did come to recognize talent of Latino participants, many female athletes continued to be shortchanged for most of the 20th century. Their stories exemplify two key issues affecting our nation's future: first, the demographic transformation of small town America, and second, the role of sport as a vehicle to break down barriers between "new arrivals" and their neighbors.
