-- As Sandy Hook Elementary School students returned to class Thursday for the first time since last month's massacre, Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy set a two-month deadline for a commission to address the state's gun laws, mental health policies and public security issues. Newtown Public Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson has said that part of the Chalk Hill building had been transformed to resemble an elementary school and that security had also been increased, incorporating an upgraded system of new cameras and locks. On Thursday, Sandy Hook parents accompanied their children to an emotional first day back in school. "We can work together to make our state a model for the rest of the nation," said Malloy, who also called on Congress to enact stricter national gun control laws.
