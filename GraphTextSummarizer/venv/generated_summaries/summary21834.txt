In April, U.S. District Judge Edward Korman ordered the FDA to make emergency contraception, specifically the morning-after pill, available to females of any age without a prescription. "Studies show that emergency contraception is a safe and effective form of birth control that can prevent pregnancy if taken within five days of unprotected sex, and research also shows that teens are as likely as adults to use emergency contraception correctly,"  said Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally. "Age barriers to emergency contraception are not supported by science, and they should be eliminated. Emergency contraceptives are intended for use within 72 hours after sex but are most effective if taken within 24 hours.
