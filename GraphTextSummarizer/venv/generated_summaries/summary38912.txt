Francesca Hilton is her only child, the product of her second marriage to hotel magnate Conrad Hilton. She is still in the intensive care unit at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, but the prince's publicist, John Blanchette, said she could go home as soon as Thursday. Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said his wife of 24 years is in "critical" condition, but daughter Francesca Hilton said her condition is "guarded." Gabor, 93, suffered a broken hip in a fall at her Bel Air, California, home nine days ago. Eva is probably best remembered for her role as a socialite turned farmer's wife on the 1960s TV sitcom "Green Acres." The publicist for Hilton, however, gave a more optimistic report.
