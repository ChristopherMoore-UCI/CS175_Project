Allen traveled to Pritchett Trucking Inc. and shot a third co-worker, 44-year old David Griffis, in the stomach, officials said. According to the site, Marvin H. Pritchett founded Pritchett Trucking Inc. in 1980. Police say they believe Allen acted alone in these shootings, but they continue to investigate the "heinous crimes." A statement posted Saturday evening  on the company's website said Pritchett Trucking was shocked and mourning the loss of its founder and the employees. The Union County Sheriff's Office said Allen went to a Lake Butler farm owned by Pritchett, where he fatally shot Gonzalez-Delgado. Sheriff Jerry Whitehead told CNN affiliate WJXT that  the Lake Butler "community is in shock," after 72-year-old Hubert Allen Jr. allegedly went on a shooting spree, killing his longtime boss, Marvin Pritchett, 80, and a former co-worker Rolando Gonzalez-Delgado, 28.
