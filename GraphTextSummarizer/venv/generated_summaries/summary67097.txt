Meanwhile, students at Miramonte Elementary School will return to class later this week to a new staff, because administrators do not want any more "surprises" at the Los Angeles school that is at the center of two child abuse cases. -- The Los Angeles Unified School District board on Tuesday fired Miramonte Elementary School teacher Martin Bernard Springer just hours after he was formally charged with three felony counts of lewd acts upon a girl under age 14 "We know that the public understands that the vast majority of teachers are doing remarkable work every day to motivate and educate the children of Los Angeles." Springer pleaded not guilty late Tuesday afternoon in a Los Angeles County court to three felony counts of lewd acts on a child over three months in 2009. Springer, 49, of Alhambra, California, has 30 days to appeal his firing, school spokesman Tom Waldman said.
