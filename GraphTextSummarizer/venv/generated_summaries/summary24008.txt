Three students at the University of California Santa Barbara were being treated Thursday for meningococcal disease, a bacterial infection that causes bloodstream infections and meningitis, health officials said. Generally, college-aged youth, particularly those in their first year who live in residence halls, are at increased risk of meningococcal disease. "Santa Barbara County, UCSB, California Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control have already had preliminary discussions about the vaccine," the statement said. Two cases are confirmed to be the same strain, said department spokeswoman Susan Klein-Rothschild. All the cases were caused by meningococcal bacteria known as type B, the same strain found in seven cases of meningitis, an infection of the lining of the brain, at Princeton University since March.
