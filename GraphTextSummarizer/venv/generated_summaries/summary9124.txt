" Dalglish was previously Liverpool manager between 1985 and 1991, guiding the club to three league titles and two English FA Cup wins. Liverpool failed to qualify for any European competition this season, and could have faced a similar prospect in 2012-13 if Sunday's match against second division Cardiff City had ended in defeat. Manager Kenny Dalglish is determined to use Liverpool's first trophy win in six years as a catalyst for future success, following Sunday's dramatic penalty shootout win in the English League Cup final.
