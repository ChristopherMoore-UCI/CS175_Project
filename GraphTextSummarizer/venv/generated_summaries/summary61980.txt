-- Senior Airman Aaron Becker repairs medical equipment at a clinic for wounded soldiers at Andrews Air Force Base. The donation comes from the group Operation Homefront, which generates and allocates financial support and other assistance for military families. Becker and his wife rose to the top of the beneficiary list after officials pointed to his efforts maintaining the medical equipment used to treat wounded warriors coming home from battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq. The nomination paid off Monday as Becker and his wife, Mercy, were handed the keys to a late-model SUV, just in time to get ready for their baby, a girl expected in June. The couple lives in military housing near the base in the Maryland suburbs outside of Washington, where getting around without a car isn't all that easy.
