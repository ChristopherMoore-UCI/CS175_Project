I bet you could go into most high schools in the United States, and you'd find U.S. history textbooks that make no mention of the Chicano Movement, the birth of the United Farm Workers union, the Zoot Suit Riots and a long list of other seminal events experienced by Mexican-Americans in this country. We're talking about courses in Mexican-American history being taught to high school students of all colors and backgrounds in the Tucson Unified School District. Concerned that teachers are presenting material in a biased and inflammatory manner, a posse of elected officials, education bureaucrats and school board trustees -- made up of Democrats and Republicans -- are trying to shut down the district's Mexican-American studies program. And that was the message when state education officials went so far as to bar instructors who are determined to have heavy accents from teaching English language classes. And isn't the same thing true of Asian-Americans, Native Americans and African-Americans?
