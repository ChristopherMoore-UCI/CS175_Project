-- The Denver Broncos are in ongoing contract talks with free agent quarterback Peyton Manning, a member of the Broncos organization told CNN on Monday. The Denver Post, citing an unnamed NFL source, said Manning called former Broncos quarterback John Elway, who is now the team's executive vice president for football operations, to say he wants to play for the Broncos and wants to negotiate exclusively with the team. "If you look at [it] historically, the teams that won the Super Bowl are teams with a guy like Ben Roethlisberger and Drew Brees and Eli (Manning) and Aaron Rodgers and all those guys. All indications Monday were that the Broncos were the only ones negotiating with the star quarterback, deflating several other teams in the process. While the signing hasn't been made final, several Denver Broncos players expressed excitement Monday that Manning had picked their team to join.
