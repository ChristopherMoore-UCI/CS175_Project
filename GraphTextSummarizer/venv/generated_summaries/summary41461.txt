GOP tries to define Clinton for young voters I was in the room when then-first lady Clinton courageously spoke in China at the Fourth World Conference on Women and reminded the world that "women's rights are human rights." The issues that will dominate the 2016 election are issues that Clinton has been a leader on for years. We need President Hillary Clinton. I first met Clinton when I was serving in the Michigan State House of Representatives and she was serving as first lady of Arkansas and working as an attorney. As secretary of state, Clinton stood up for America and stood strong against our enemies.
