The government will also increase monitoring of offshore drilling compliance and has asked a new oil industry group to report on Britain's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills, Energy Secretary Chris Huhne said. -- Britain will step up its inspection of North Sea drilling rigs following the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the government announced Tuesday. For example, we already separate regulation of operations and safety. They include doubling the number of drilling rig inspections by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), which is responsible for licensing, exploration, and regulation of oil and gas developments on the U.K. Continental Shelf, he said. Huhne said Britain's stringent safety regulations came into force after the Piper Alpha disaster in July 1988, when a gas leak led to a major fire that engulfed the platform in the North Sea.
