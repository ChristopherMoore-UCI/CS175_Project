The United Kingdom's Metropolitan Police Service executed additional search warrants and arrested five people for their alleged role in the attacks, the FBI said in a statement Thursday. -- FBI agents have executed 40 search warrants throughout the United States as part of an investigation into recent coordinated cyber attacks targeting major companies, the agency said. The attacks were allegedly carried out by people who are active supporters of WikiLeaks, but are not affiliated with the website, a federal law enforcement source said. Facilitating or conducting such attacks is illegal and punishable by up to 10 years in prison, the FBI said. That's called a DDoS attack, short for distributed denial-of-service -- and it's hard for most websites to defend against.
