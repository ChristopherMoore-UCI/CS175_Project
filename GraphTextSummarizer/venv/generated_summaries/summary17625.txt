As "Hunger Games" characters Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, Lawrence and Hutcherson are asked to do some lip-locking on camera in both 2012's "The Hunger Games" and its November 22 follow-up, "Catching Fire." -- When it comes to on-screen chemistry, "Hunger Games" co-stars Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson are naturals. But then came an onslaught of films that permanently changed the tide, as Lawrence starred in one high-profile project after another: 2011's "The Beaver" and "X-Men: First Class," "The Hunger Games," and 2012's acclaimed "Silver Linings Playbook," which earned the young star an Oscar. When she won the best actress Oscar for "Silver Linings Playbook," nothing changed on set, Hutcherson told CNN. If you're not familiar with the book trilogy from Suzanne Collins that the movies are based on, know that part of the central plot revolves around Katniss and Peeta's relationship -- it's mostly a survival strategy as the two impoverished District 12 citizens are sent to fight to the death in the sadistic Hunger Games, but there's also an undercurrent of something more.
