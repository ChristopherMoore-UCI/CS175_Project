Such is the mood of euphoria fostered by the country's gold medal-winning performers, and London's successful staging of an Olympic Games that some had predicted would become the latest in a long tradition of Great British cockups, that a country more used to wallowing in sporting failure is waking up to the unfamiliar feeling of giving itself a collective pat on the back. " But it was a glorious Saturday night in the main stadium that would be Team GB's defining moment, as heptathlete Jessica Ennis, long jumper Greg Rutherford and 10,000-meter runner Mo Farah all won gold in quick succession. A little more than two weeks ago, London was a city pregnant with angst, the final preparations dogged by a security scandal that required 18,000 military personnel -- almost double the number of British troops currently deployed in Afghanistan -- to be drafted in to guard venues, fears of transport meltdown and lingering arguments over spiralling costs and an uncertain legacy.
