This year, Indiana has seen seven tree-stand falls, with Bowers' fall being the only one classified as a fatality, said conservation officer Lt. William Browne. Medical ethicist Arthur L. Caplan of New York University said Bowers' death is a reminder that young people need to deal with difficult end-of-life decisions just like older adults. State conservation officers urge hunters to always wear a safety harness when climbing up or down tree stands and to use a haul line to move equipment up and down. The Haggard-Sefton & Hirschy Funeral Home of Decatur said memorials could go to the couple's Baby Bowers Education Fund. -- It's a grim topic: What would you want if you were on life support after a life-altering accident?
