Officials at NASA are investigating what the debris was, NASA spokesman Joshua Buck said. -- Unexpected space debris came flying close to the International Space Station on Tuesday, prompting its six astronauts to take shelter inside two Soyuz capsules NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries said it was not immediately known how close the debris came, but that 820 feet was the closest it could have come, according to NASA's projections. Buck described the debris as an "unknown object of unknown size." By the time it was spotted, it was "too late to make an avoidance maneuver," so NASA ordered the six crew members to "shelter in place," Buck said.
