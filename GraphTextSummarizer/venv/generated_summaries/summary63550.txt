Exactly a year after the start of the protests against President Ben Ali which sparked uprisings across the Arab world, eL Seed took on his first large-scale mural to celebrate Tunisia's revolution. -- Fine Arabic calligraphy and street art may seem worlds apart, but for artist eL Seed, they're one and the same thing. "Before the revolution art in Tunisia was quite bourgeois, but if you put big pieces of art on walls it is for everyone," said eL Seed, now living in Montreal, Canada. eL Seed, a 31-year-old French Tunisian artist, has just used his distinctive style of Arabic street art, which he calls "calligraffiti," to decorate the tallest minaret in Tunisia with a verse from the Quran that tackles intolerance.
