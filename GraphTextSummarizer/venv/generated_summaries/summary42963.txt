-- Penguins didn't always come in black and white, paleontologists said Thursday, citing the discovery of a 36-million-year-old fossil of a bird that, in its day, waddled nearly 5 feet tall. Perhaps it was a response to the rise of new penguin predators, such as seals, said Clarke, according to National Geographic. A specimen found in Peru showed that at least some of the giant penguin's feathers were reddish brown and gray, said a University of Texas at Austin paleontologist who was the lead author of a paper appearing in Thursday's online edition of the journal Science. Modern penguins and the fossil differed in the formation of melanosomes. The National Geographic Society, which along with the National Science Foundation, provided funding for the research, said it's not exactly clear why modern penguins come in black and white.
