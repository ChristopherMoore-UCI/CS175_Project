An IBM supercomputer named Watson finished one round of the TV show "Jeopardy!" In reality, as Trebek explained, the bulk of Watson's computer power was stored in another building at an IBM lab in New York, where the show is being held for this special three-day competition. " Trebek summed up the computer's mixed performance this way: "So, what have we learned so far: Watson's very bright, very fast, but he had some weird little moments once in a while." Watson said, sounding like a digitized Matthew Broderick. On many other clues, however, Watson was spot-on.
