-- Barcelona striker Lionel Messi has hailed the performance of his teammates after the Spanish giants beat Manchester United 3-1 at Wembley on Saturday to lift their third Champions League trophy in six seasons. Messi produced a scintillating performance to enhance his reputation as being the world's greatest player, scoring Barcelona's second goal and tormenting the Manchester United defenders throughout the 90 minutes. Meanwhile, Brazilian international Dani Alves paid tribute to fellow-defender Eric Abidal, who made a remarkable recovery from a liver tumor operation to play against United -- with the Frenchman being handed the honor of lifting the trophy. "We want to keep winning trophies and we can keep going further and further. "Even before all of this we all said that our biggest victory, our most important trophy, was the recovery of Abi," Alves told UEFA's website.
