Hebert said Wade has resolved to teach young people about the dangers associated with social networking. Hebert said the case is a cautionary tale about the potentially deadly mix of young people and modern communications technology. -- A Florida judge sentenced Rachel Wade, the 20-year-old woman convicted of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing her romantic rival in a fight last year, to 27 years in prison Friday. "When you start looking at the tragic nature of this, the social networking, the instant messaging, the ability of people to hide behind the screen and make statements and create situations -- it just festered until it bubbled up and exploded into a situation... until two good girls, their worlds collided," he said. Wade went to trial in July, accused of second-degree murder in the stabbing death of 18-year-old Sarah Ludemann.
