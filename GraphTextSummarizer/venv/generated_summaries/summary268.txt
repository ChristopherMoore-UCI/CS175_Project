-- Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers held in Iran for more than a year, will be released Saturday, Iranian officials said Thursday. Tehran has said the three hikers were spies, and Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state news outlets. But Bak Sahraei, a representative for the Iranian mission to the United Nations, told CNN that Shourd was designated for release "very soon." " Upon release, Shourd would be leaving her fiance behind in prison. "We hope and pray that the reports are true and that this signals the end of all three of our children's long and difficult detention," Cindy Hickey, Nora Shourd and Laura Fattal said in a joint statement.
