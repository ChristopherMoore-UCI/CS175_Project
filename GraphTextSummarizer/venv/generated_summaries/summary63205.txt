Travis was driving his black 1998 Pontiac Trans Am when the vehicle drove off the north side of a two-lane highway just west of Tioga, where he resides, and struck several barricades in a construction zone, said Texas Highway Patrol Trooper Mark Tackett. -- Country music star Randy Travis, who pleaded no contest to public intoxication following the Super Bowl in February, was arrested again Tuesday after being found naked, smelling apparently of alcohol and lying on a remote stretch of roadway in northern Texas just before midnight, authorities said. Travis was arrested and taken to the Denton County jail, sheriff's spokeman Tom Reedy told CNN on Wednesday. Travis was released from Grayson County jail after an acquaintance posted his $21,500 bail in cash at 10:40 a.m. Wednesday, Wheeler said. Rickey Wheeler of the Grayson County Sheriff's Office said Wednesday.
