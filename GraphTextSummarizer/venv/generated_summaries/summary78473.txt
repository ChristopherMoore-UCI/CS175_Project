While Beijing police could not immediately be contacted for comment, another post on its account cited a China News article, which claimed almost 70% of road accidents in China are caused by women. If that wasn't news enough for China's female roadsters, it added women drivers "tend to get in a panic after an accident and usually draw a complete mental blank, giving opportunities for criminals. According to a post on the official Beijing Police department account on Weibo -- China's popular micro-blogging service -- female drivers "usually have inadequate driving skills and often lack a sense of direction." "I have to say that female drivers are worse drivers," claimed Simapingbang. "Women drivers, please change into flat shoes when you're driving," the caption warns.
