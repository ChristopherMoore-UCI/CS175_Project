Verdasco lost in the final to Rafael Nadal in Monte-Carlo two weeks ago before winning the Barcelona Open last week. He will now face either Jo-Wilfried Tsonga or David Ferrer in the semifinals - his third in as many weeks. Fernando Verdasco ended Novak Djokovic's hopes of winning the Rome Masters after an epic three-hour victory took the Spaniard into the last four. But in the decider Verdasco broke Djokovic's serve in the third game and held on through some long and dramatic rallies to claim it 6-4. Verdasco twice went up a break in a hard-fought opener but both times Djokovic pegged him back, once when he was serving for the set.
