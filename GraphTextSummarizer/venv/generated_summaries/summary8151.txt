And Web sellers are saying, "Step right in." As more people do at least some of their holiday shopping online every year, retailers are looking to take advantage of digital deal-seekers -- not just on the much-ballyhooed Cyber Monday, but on Black Friday and even Thanksgiving Day. The National Retail Federation says the average shopper plans to do about 36% of their holiday shopping online, up from 32.7% last year. And more than one-third say they're offering free shipping earlier this year than last year. "Based on the expectation that these positive spending trends will continue for the season, this year promises to be a Merry Christmas indeed for online retailers." They've assembled a list of online deals to watch for, as well as a list of online "duds" that might not be so attractive.
