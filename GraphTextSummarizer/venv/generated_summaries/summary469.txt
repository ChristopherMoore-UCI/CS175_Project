Imagine a high-end Flip with a Wi-Fi or 3G internet connection, 1080p video, a decent zoom lens, and a touchscreen with apps made just for Flip video and photo. Cisco could've bolstered an internet-enabled Flip with a unique social network made just for Flip users. Furthermore, Flip customers didn't particularly have anywhere they belonged to feel special. Instead, existing Flip camcorders require a wired connection to a PC in order to transfer the files and upload them to a website. When Steve Jobs introduced the camera-equipped iPod Nano in 2009, he made it clear that the Flip budget camcorder was Apple's primary target.
