Boyd would not confirm or deny whether Williams left behind a letter, saying that investigators would discuss "the note or a note" later. -- Actor Robin Williams was cremated and his ashes were scattered in San Francisco Bay, according to his death certificate. Williams was sober but struggling with depression, anxiety and the early stages of Parkinson's disease when he died, his widow said last week. The coroner's investigation "revealed he had been seeking treatment for depression," Boyd said. Williams was found dead in his Northern California home August 11 from what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging.
