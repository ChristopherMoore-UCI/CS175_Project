"Chinese authorities deem these commercial activities to be benign economic, development-related interactions," Park says, noting that under prior U.N. Security Council sanctions resolutions, U.N. member states aren't prohibited from engaging in economic development and humanitarian assistance activities with North Korea. "North Korea could use this and the upcoming U.S.-South Korea exercises as a pretext for some sort of provocation." "That wouldn't be surprising. -- It's hard to imagine a more powerful indictment of a government's behavior than the one just handed down by a U.N. panel tasked with investigating human rights in North Korea. China is widely seen as having more leverage over North Korea than any other country, not least because it is a vital source of resources. And of course China is home to hundreds of thousands of North Korean migrants (perhaps more) who earn a living in China while bringing currency and goods back to North Korea."
