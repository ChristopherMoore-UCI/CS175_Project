First half goals from in-form Roman Pavlyuchenko and the influential Luka Modric put them in charge at White Hart Lane, but Ayegbeni Yakubu's reply just after the break set up a tense second half. United manager Alex Ferguson opted to rest the England striker, preferring Michael Owen in attack alongside Dimitar Berbatov. Liverpool stay a point behind in sixth place after a 2-1 home win over Blackburn with talismen Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres scoring. After the match, Ferguson told Sky Sports he decided to drop his match-winner for the game because of the number of key matches coming up for the club -- including the Champions League second leg tie against AC Milan.
