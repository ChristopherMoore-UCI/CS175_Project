There is also a wonderful and supportive group called Lucky Fin Project that celebrates children with limb differences. She showed us pictures of hands belonging to children just like my son. It affects 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births," says Dr. Foong-Yen Lim, surgical director of the Cincinnati Fetal Center at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center.
