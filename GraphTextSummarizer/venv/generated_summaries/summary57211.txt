Between 2006 and 2012, Meyer also provided sworn, notarized certifications to the gallery that the pieces were authentic Johns works and said that he had been given each of them as a gift from Johns, according to the news release. The 22 pieces were sold by the Manhattan gallery for $6.5 million, of which $3.4 million went to Meyer, who was arrested Wednesday and is charged with one count of interstate transportation of stolen property and one count of wire fraud.
