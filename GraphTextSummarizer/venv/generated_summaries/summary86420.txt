Major movie studios like Fox Searchlight, the influential Sundance Film Festival and Oculus, Facebook's $2 billion bet on the future of virtual reality, are just some of the players working to make you believe you're fighting in the Battle of the Five Armies or shooting through space with the Guardians of the Galaxy. In virtual reality, which uses 360-degree computer simulations to create the illusion of reality, some think they've found the greatest leap yet in that direction. You may get a chance soon, thanks to the burgeoning world of virtual reality and a film industry keen on exploring it. Of New Frontier's 13 installations at next month's festival, nine will feature virtual reality. "The visceral impact of the format is simply too powerful to not to want to touch," said Shari Frilot, senior programmer at the Sundance Film Festival.
