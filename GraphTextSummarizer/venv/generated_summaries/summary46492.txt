World champion Lewis Hamilton emerged from his sick bed for a marathon stint in his Mercedes but it was Red Bull rival Daniel Ricciardo who set the fastest time on the second day of F1 pre-season testing in Barcelona Friday. The 30-year-old Briton was just over a third of a second slower than the one minute 24.574 seconds posted by Ricciardo, who set the time on a soft tire, generally reckoned to be about one second faster per lap than the medium. Ferrari -- so off the pace in Fernando Alonso's final season with the famous marquee in 2014 -- has also found encouragement from the two pre-season tests to date and Kimi Raikkonen was second fastest behind Ricciardo. While Mercedes appears set to continue its 2014 dominance into the new season, it was undoubtedly an improvement for Ricciardo and Red Bull, as the Australian attempted to simulate race conditions and totaled 143 laps over the two sessions, the most by a single driver on the second day. With the first race of the season less than a month away from March 13-15 in Australia, time is running out for team's struggling with their 2015 cars, not least CNN-sponsored McLaren-Honda, with former world champions  Alonso and Jenson Button in its driver lineup.
