Chrysler, GM, Honda and Mazda have all issued recalls in recent weeks, for problems ranging from faulty power steering to defective air bags. Such incidents are rare; the approximately 2,000 consumer complaints received by the NHTSA that were related to unintended acceleration in Toyotas over the past 10 years works out to about one in every 10,000 Toyotas sold over that period. Despite the tragedies, the Toyota crisis can yet be a catalyst for positive change that can benefit consumers. According to NHTSA, the average consumer response rate to vehicle recalls is only about 74 percent, meaning that a quarter of all affected vehicles never get the fix. But on an overall scale of recalled problems, it's relatively minor.
