"We saw a series of denial of service attacks coming both from Russia and from Georgia a year ago when the conflict took off." -- A blogger believed to be the target of the attack that brought down Twitter Thursday has told CNN the cyber assault was politically motivated and timed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the Russia-Georgia conflict. "I assume the above-mentioned could irritate those who are the authors of the given cyber attack and who will never accept the idea of the United, independent, democratic and prosperous Georgia," he said. Cluely said "denial-of-service" attacks were reported last year when Russia deployed troops to South Ossetia to repel Georgian forces. Twitter -- a micro-blogging site where users post 140-character messages to their followers -- went down for around two hours Thursday.
