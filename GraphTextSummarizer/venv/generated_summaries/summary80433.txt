Scenes involving a Nazi-era firing squad and gas chamber during the Saturday premiere had left members of the audience reeling -- with some so badly affected that they needed medical help. Oper Am Rhein said Thursday that it had been aware from the outset that director Burkhard Kosminski's modern production of Richard Wagner's "Tannhauser" was "absolutely likely to arouse controversy." Oper Am Rhein said it had tried to negotiate with Kosminski over his staging after the disastrous premiere but he refused to modify his concept "for artistic reasons. But, it said, the effects had gone beyond controversy, with "some scenes, especially the firing-squad sequence, which was staged with drastically realistic force" apparently proving an "intolerable burden for numerous members of the audience," both mentally and physically. The production was supposed to explore Wagner's anti-Semitism and the influence the composer would have on Nazi ideology, Der Spiegel said.
