So asking the top 1% of wealthy Americans to pay their fair share and pay at least as high a tax rate as their workers is not class warfare or an attack on "job creators" or socialism. The majority of job creation comes from our small businesses, none of which are raking in the salaries of the top 1% of wealthy Americans. I said it was economic, but political in the sense that you have a political party -- the GOP -- entrenched with the wealthy and Wall Street while doing nothing to protect middle-class America. Are Republicans really advocating that the greed of Wall Street be put before the needs of the American people? He knows times are tough and he continues to fight to restore some much-needed protections for exactly the people in that crowd at Wall Street.
