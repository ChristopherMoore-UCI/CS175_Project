But European Union sources tell CNN that ministers will probably revise that goal upward to 6.3% Monday, in accordance with a draft put forward by the European Commission late Friday. -- Eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels, Belgium, on Monday will discuss giving Spain an extra year to meet its deficit targets. One official close to Monday's discussions said they are likely to include the so-called Troika group of lenders, which includes the EU commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The aim of Monday's summit is to figure out how to implement those proposals, though EU insiders are doubtful the politicians will put numbers on the page yet. A month ago, the same eurozone finance ministers agreed to put aside 100 billion euros ($150 billion) to shore up the capital base of Spain's banks -- money that will come initially from the region's nonpermanent European Financial Stability Facility.
