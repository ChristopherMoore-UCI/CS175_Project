"Compliance has not been enforced so I'm not surprised people don't understand the risks," said Meg Watson, study author and epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. "The ultraviolet rays from indoor tanning are generally stronger than the summer sun at noon," said Dawn Holman, a behavioral scientist who works in the CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. In addition to requiring manufactures to meet safety standards, the FDA will also require tanning beds to feature warning labels prominently on the beds and brochures aimed at people under 18 that say multiple use increases the risk of cancer. Indoor tanning beds are currently classified as low-risk medical devices -- the same as bandages -- and not subject to review by the FDA. Using indoor tanning beds before age 35 increases risk of developing melanoma -- the most deadly form of skin cancer -- by 75%, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation.
