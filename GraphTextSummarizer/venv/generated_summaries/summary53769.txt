It is my deep desire to impress upon current and future players that NBA leadership will continue to strip away the layers of underlying and seemingly unchecked racism. -- I am extremely proud of NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. It is incumbent upon us as executive leaders and community leaders to continue to be outspoken to ensure the lessons of this moment do not become part of that same noisy news cycle. It sets a definitive tone not only for how we deal with racism in the NBA but also how we should be dealing with it in the country as a whole. My passion and love for a round orange ball has taken me to unimaginable heights, earning me a measure of success in the NBA.
