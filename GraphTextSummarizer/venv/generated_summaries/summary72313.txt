-- A group of people surrounded the car of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, one man yelling that he is hungry, as a woman climbed up onto it and sat on the vehicle's roof to speak to the president. On his official website, the firebrand president posted photos of other parts of his visit to Hormozgan province, with throngs of smiling people waving flags and reaching out to shake his hand as his entourage throws flower petals. But she pulls away from him, waving her hand, sits down on the bit of roof that covers the driver's section of the car and begins to speak to Ahamdinejad. In the video, the car travels through a street amid other traffic, surrounded by guards, as it comes to a stop and a group surrounds it. The video of the incident, as Ahmadinejad was being driven in a convertible through the southern coastal city of Bandar-Abbas, was posted Saturday on YouTube and has racked up more than 100,000 views.
