"If yellow light equals red light, we don't even need green lights any more. " Unlike in some cities, Beijing has not installed traffic lights with numerical countdowns before they change, making it difficult for drivers to slow down or stop in time. Other cities like Shenzhen do not plan to punish drivers who run yellow lights -- for now. Many drivers thumb down the tougher rules, especially the one that considers a yellow traffic light the same as a red light. Driving in China is dangerous in no small part because many drivers tend to ignore traffic rules.
