The 26-year-old Vegas, who was making just his fifth appearance on tour, made a 13-foot par putt on the second play-off hole to defeat Gary Woodland, after defending champion Bill Haas had been eliminated on the first play-off hole. -- Jhonattan Vegas has made history at the Bob Hope Classic, winning a three-man play-off on the Palmer course at La Quinta to become the first Venezuelan in history to claim a PGA Tour title. After missing a nine-foot putt that would have secured victory on the final hole of regulation play, Vegas then improbably became the first rookie to win the 52-year-old tournament with a spectacular up-and-down after knocking his 92nd tee shot into the water 160-yards from the hole. "Just to think about winning on the PGA Tour, that's one thing," Vegas told the official PGA Tour website. That meant he finished level with Vegas and Woodland, who both carded 69s, on a 27-under-par total of 233.
