More specifically, says guitarist Mick Jones, the band's original master tapes were falling apart. The boombox, says bassist Paul Simonon, symbolizes the way the four would share music and ideas. "When we would go out on tour, each member of the band had one of these boomboxes, so in a hotel room or backstage or on some street corner we could play music," he recalls. When you do music yourself, it's interesting -- it's like a two-way highway. It led us back to so many American artists -- blues, soul and rock and roll.
