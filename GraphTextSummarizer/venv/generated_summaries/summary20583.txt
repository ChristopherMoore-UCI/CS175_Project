Long live the "Peanuts" gang, Charles Schulz and good old Charlie Brown. I think we can all see a little bit of Lucy, Peppermint Patty, Pigpen, Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Linus ... in ourselves if we reflect on it. I even played Peppermint Patty in grade school when we did two Charlie Brown skits, and I loved it. From "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown" and Christmas specials to "Snoopy vs. the Red Baron," memories of Charlie Brown and the gang abound. The Charlie Brown Christmas special would be, to this day, my ultimate favorite.
