-- Queen Elizabeth II has become a YouTube hit after apparently losing her temper with Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi during a photocall for G-20 leaders. After the photo is taken, Berlusconi can be heard yelling: "Mr Obama," at the U.S. president in an attempt to get his attention. The noise appears to rile the queen who turns in Berlusconi's direction, shrugs her shoulders and says: "What is it? Just after this photo was taken, the Queen, center, appears to get annoyed with Silvio Berlusconi. Why does he have to shout?" A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman Friday rejected suggestions the queen was annoyed with Berlusconi.
