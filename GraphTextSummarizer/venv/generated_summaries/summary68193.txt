-- Violence flared overnight in Bangkok amid anti-government demonstrations intended to drive Thailand's Prime Minister out of office. Their numbers dropped from a peak of as many as 170,000 on Monday evening to about 60,000 on Tuesday evening, said Lt. Gen. Paradon Pattanathabut, Thailand's security chief. Dispute over elections Rights groups, the United Nations and the United States have called on Thai authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during the mass demonstrations. The protesters say they want Thailand's political system overhauled instead of new elections scheduled for next month. The protesters want to see changes to Thailand's political system enacted before elections take place, he said, and the demonstrations will continue until they achieve that goal.
