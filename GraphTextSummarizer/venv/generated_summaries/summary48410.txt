Sunnis in Iraq have felt marginalized by the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, a Shiite. Iraq has a large Shiite population in the capital and across southern Iraq. It killed at least 36 and wounded 72 others, police and Interior Ministry officials said. The deadliest attack was a suicide bombing targeting Shiite pilgrims just west of the southern city of Nasiriya. Kadhimiya is busy with many Shiite pilgrims who started their pilgrimage walking to Karbala, and security has been jacked up accordingly.
