-- As reports of swine flu continue to rise in the United States and around the world, the average American is probably asking, "How should I protect myself?" U.S. health officials stress the importance of frequent hand washing during outbreaks of illness. The public should pay attention to what is happening nearby and heed the guidance of local health officials regarding school, work and public events. Cases have been confirmed in the United States, as well as countries including Canada, New Zealand, Spain, United Kingdom, and Israel. "In areas with no disease yet, a lot of what we can do sounds simple and repetitive but helps," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director of the CDC's Science and Public Health Program. According to Skinner, health officials are still trying to figure out where exactly the virus originated, how transmissible it is and why it is mild in some cases and deadlier in others.
