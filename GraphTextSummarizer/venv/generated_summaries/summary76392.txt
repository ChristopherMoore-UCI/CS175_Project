Everyone seems to be buzzing about "Accidental Racist," the new musical collaboration between country singer Brad Paisley and rapper LL Cool J -- but this is not the first such tag team from those two genres.

LL Cool J's proud of 'Accidental Racist' Aldean took to Twitter to defend his choice of musical partners after the public railed against him. " "Negative connotations in media about redneck culture are making many people in rural areas flee from their native habits to adopt customs more indigenous to urban locales, giving rise to country rap with artists like Colt Ford," the writer stated. "Jason Aldean's country rap 'Dirt Road Anthem' was the best-selling song in country music last year for example. Rap and country have intersected before, though not as controversially as the current pairing: "Accidental Racist" has touched off a firestorm for its subject matter and complaints that the song just isn't that great.
