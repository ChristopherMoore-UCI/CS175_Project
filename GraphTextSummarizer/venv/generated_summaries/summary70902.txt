Obama: U.S. and Europe united over Ukraine crisis U.S. intel: Russia likely to enter eastern Ukraine Valsyuk served under Muzychko, who was commander in western Ukraine for the "Right Sector," a recently formed alliance of right-wing and nationalist political parties and militia forces. U.S. and NATO officials say the Russians could roll into Ukraine any time, without warning in a bid to annex Russian-speaking areas of eastern Ukraine or even push into Trans-Nistria, a disputed enclave in the former Soviet republic of Moldova. Despite fears Ukrainian government security forces could target other Right Sector leaders, Yarosh made the trip to Rivne to march alongside Muzychko's coffin. Ukraine's Interior Ministry said its special agents killed Muzychko Monday night here in the western city of Rivne as he resisted arrest.
