-- Two planes made emergency landings at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport at almost the same time Monday, the Dutch airport said. But a military police official described the issue as one of "technical difficulties." Delta would only say the plane, from Amsterdam to Mumbai, made the landing for "precautionary measures." The second emergency landing involved a Delta Air Lines plane. "The aircraft landed without incident, and passengers deplaned normally," the airline said in a statement. It was "nothing big," Robert Van Kappel of Schipol Military Police of the incident.
