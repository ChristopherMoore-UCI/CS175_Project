-- Caroline Wozniacki is known as one of the fittest players in tennis, but even the rejuvenated Dane is feeling anxious as she prepares to take part in the New York City Marathon in early November. " Wozniacki is competing in the marathon for charity, capping a rollercoaster 2014 in which the former world No. 1 suffered an array of injuries and a high-profile split with top golfer Rory McIlroy before making her first grand slam final in five years at the U.S. Open. "I dreamed one time that before I even got to the start line I was dead," Wozniacki laughs during an interview with CNN's Open Court. " Wozniacki eventually settled on Team for Kids, which according to the New York Road Runners' website, provides "free low-cost health and fitness programs to kids who would otherwise have little or no access to regular physical activity. Wozniacki has stepped up her training while maintaining a full tennis schedule -- prior to losing to Serena Williams in last month's final at Flushing Meadows she told reporters how she believed it had helped her on-court fitness.
