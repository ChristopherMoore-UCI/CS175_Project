They've long had a small police force, and they're not alone, thanks to a mostly forgotten provision in the behemoth 2002 Homeland Security Act that allows certain the Offices of Inspector General to equip themselves with agents who carry guns. While the USDA has long had gun carrying agents, many other agencies did not have those law enforcement powers prior to a 2002 law meant to correct for the poor law enforcement coordination prior to September 11. "When there are genuinely dangerous situations involving federal law, that's the job of the Department of Justice, not regulatory agencies like the FDA or the Department of Education," Stewart said. One of the changes was section 812 that turned these additional Inspector General offices into permanent law enforcement agencies. At 73 federal agencies and departments, independent sub-agencies called the Offices of the Inspector General, or OIGs, conduct oversight, perform audits and enforce laws.
