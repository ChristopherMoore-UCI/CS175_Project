-- Troubled actress Amanda Bynes is mentally competent to stand trial, California Judge James Bianco ruled during a court hearing in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "We appreciate everyone's heartfelt support, and we hope that she can get some privacy and the respect she deserves during this trying time," Lynn Bynes said in a statement to People magazine in October. Now that Bianco has determined Bynes to be mentally competent, a progress report has been scheduled for January 7. At the time, the "Easy A" star had a number of legal troubles, between the alleged DUI and three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment window in May. In September, Bynes was moved from UCLA Medical Center to a private facility for "specialized treatment" at the recommendation of "the skilled health care professionals of UCLA," Bynes' parents said in a statement.
