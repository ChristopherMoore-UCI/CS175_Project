The Chinese embassy in Paris on Sunday "strongly condemned" the attack, calling on French authorities to "bring the perpetrators to justice and ensure the safety of Chinese students in the country," the state-run Chinese news agency Xinhua reported. Users of the popular Chinese social media platform Weibo also expressed anger over the attack and concern about other Chinese students living overseas. -- A violent attack on a group of Chinese students in a small town in southwest France has prompted anger and condemnation in China. French media and Xinhua reported that the three local men had attacked the Chinese students because they believed the students had called police earlier in the evening to complain about noise they were making. Some Chinese social media users speculated that the high-level response to the attack by authorities in Paris and Beijing was because the students are the children of senior Chinese officials.
