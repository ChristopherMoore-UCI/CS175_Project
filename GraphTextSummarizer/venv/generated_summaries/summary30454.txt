North Korea previously announced its nuclear capability through its state-run broadcaster and newspapers, "but no expression can be stronger than including it in their constitution," Professor Choi Jong Kun of Yonsei University told CNN. North Korea ready to carry out nuclear test at any moment, Seoul says The statement looks all too familiar. Kim Jong-Il has "transferred the country into an undefeated country with strong political ideology, a nuclear power state, and invincible military power," according to the updated constitution posted on its portal website Naenara. The communist state carried out nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009. A defense publication, IHS Janes, also said it detected signs of activities ramping up at North Korea's nuclear test site, raising speculation Pyongyang may be preparing for a third nuclear test.
