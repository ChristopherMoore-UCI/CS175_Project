Patrick, a Democrat, nominated State Appeals Court Judge Barbara Lenk to fill the seat held by Judge Judith Cowin, who announced her retirement earlier this year. She has served on the state Superior Court and the state Appeals Court, where she is a senior associate justice. "Justice Lenk possesses a first-rate legal mind and is a seasoned jurist who has earned the respect of her colleagues both on the Appeals Court and throughout the legal community," said Appeals Court Chief Justice Phillip Rapoza in a statement. -- If confirmed, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's nominee for the state Supreme Judicial Court would be the first openly gay justice to serve on the state's highest court. " Lenk would be the only Supreme Judicial Court judge in a same-sex marriage, according to a governor's office spokeswoman.
