In keeping with this obligation, individual radio listeners may complain to the FCC that Limbaugh's radio station (and those syndicating his show) are not acting in the public interest or serving their respective communities of license by permitting such dehumanizing speech. Ironically, the misogyny Rush Limbaugh spewed for three days over Sandra Fluke was not much worse than his regular broadcast of sexist, racist and homophobic hate speech: -- Female Cabinet members are "Sex-retaries. Opinion: Democrats should reject Bill Maher's money The FCC takes such complaints into consideration when stations file for license renewal. " Opinion: It's un-American to silence Limbaugh That makes this a fitting time to inquire of his syndicator, Clear Channel Communications, whether it intends to continue supporting someone who addicts his audience to regular doses of hate speech. The National Organization for Women is "a bunch of whores to liberalism." -- [Said to an African-American female caller]: "Take that bone out of your nose and call me back." These are just a few samples from the arsenal of degrading language Limbaugh deploys on women, people of color, lesbians and gays, immigrants, the disabled, the elderly, Muslims, Jews, veterans, environmentalists and so forth.
