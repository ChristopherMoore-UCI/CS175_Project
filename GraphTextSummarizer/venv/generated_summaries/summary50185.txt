-- Former Rutgers University student Dharun Ravi apparently tried to make amends with his estranged roommate Tyler Clementi after allegedly using a webcam to spy on Clementi's sexual encounter with another man, according to text messages revealed in court Wednesday. They were sent September 22, 2010, the same night Clementi took his own life by leaping from the George Washington Bridge, which spans the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey. " Ravi, 20, now faces a 15-count indictment in Clementi's death that includes charges of bias intimidation, invasion of privacy, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering and hindering apprehension or prosecution. Ravi apparently sent the messages after he learned that Clementi had requested a room change. Prosecutors have said Ravi and another student placed the camera in the dormitory room without Clementi's knowledge to spy and humiliate him because he was gay.
