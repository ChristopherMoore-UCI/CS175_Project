-- British rugby league player Paul Wood has lost a testicle after a collision during the English sport's showpiece final at Manchester's Old Trafford stadium on Saturday. "Tony Smith (Warrington coach) did say in his pre-match team talk last night 'your balls are on the line here guys!' I didn't think he meant literally." Rugby League is similar to Rugby Union, although each team has 13 players rather than 15. Wood was playing for the Warrington Wolves against Leeds Rhinos in the Super League Grand Final. Despite Wood's determined effort, Warrington lost the match 26-18 to 2011 champions Leeds.
