The large and diverse selection of media available on newsstands means that customers know what they should be getting, and if they aren't satisfied with the service there's a host of Web sites and forums on which they can let everyone know. "Whereas before a lot of services were designed from the inside out, now, because consumers are so much more empowered, they are having to think about designing from the outside in," says Fran Samalionis, global practice leader for service design and innovation at IDEO. Under the project title "500 Wants You," the hitherto inward-looking manufacturer invited ordinary people to submit ideas for designs on its Web site. But Samalionis argues that it is by sending its cohorts into the field to observe customers in their natural environments that IDEO gains the real insights and results. Really, the magic dust in the process is in synthesizing all those perspectives into something that can help you generate amazing ideas."
