As is likely to be the case as the tools for capturing imagery grow smaller, cheaper and more mobile, law enforcement officials described the search for spectator photos and videos on a continuum with the accounts of eyewitnesses they seek to interview. The investigation is currently "secur[ing] all video" from surveillance cameras at Copley Square, Boston police commissioner Ed Davis said at a press conference today. Davis said the Copley Square crime scene, currently narrowed to 12 blocks, is the most complex ever encountered by Boston police. Juliette Kayyem, a former homeland-security adviser to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, praised law enforcement and Marathon attendees for rapidly clearing an area of thousands of people in order to preserve the crime scene. -- The investigation of Monday's deadly twin bombings in Boston will rely to an extraordinary extent on crowdsourced surveillance, provided by Marathon spectators' cellphone photos, Vine videos, and Instagram feeds.
