-- A review of forensic evidence in New York City rape cases has uncovered 26 incidents where critical evidence went undetected, prompting the city's medical examiner's office to look into more than 800 rape cases over 10 years, "reviewing and retesting everything." "The mishandling of rape cases is making double victims of women who have already suffered an indescribably horrific event," City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said. '"The only answer here is a top-down, complete review on how they train, the procedures they use and the oversight," said Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women of New York City. The results have only indicated false negatives, not false positives, according to Chief Medical Examiner spokeswoman Ellen Borakove. On Friday, the medical examiner's rape-case review prompted New York's City Council speaker to set an "emergency oversight hearing" for January 22.
