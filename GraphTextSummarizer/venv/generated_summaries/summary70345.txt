Earlier Friday, during a rally in Abidjan, Gbagbo's minister of youth, Ble Goude, called on young supporters of the incumbent "to organize committees to impede by any means the movements of U.N. forces around the country." -- Hundreds of people fled a pro-Alassane Ouattara neighborhood in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where forces loyal to incumbent President Laurent Gbabgbo have been fighting an armed Ouattara supporters for the past week. The conflict was set off in November after a run-off presidential election between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and challenger Alassane Ouattara -- an election in which both men claimed victory. Ouattara is holed up in the Golf hotel in Abidjan under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. Ggagbo's Army spokesman also said their forces fought armed supporters of Ouattara Thursday night in Yamoussoukro where two insurgents were killed and several wounded.
