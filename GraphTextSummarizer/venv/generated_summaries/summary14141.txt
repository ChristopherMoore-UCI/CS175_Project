Supporters applauded ABC for giving the role to a Latina actress, but critics said she was playing up the role of the stereotypical "hysterical loud Latina." Morales believes in order to break the stereotype cycle in Hollywood, a combination of things need to happen: Sought after talents like director Steven Spielberg need to tell the stories of the Hispanic community, and more Latinos need to be producers and directors, to help tell these stories the right way. And, as the Hispanic population continues to grow, more and more attention is being drawn to how Latinos are represented in television and film. While it may seem harmless to portray Latinos as sexy, these typecasts limit the roles for actors in Hollywood, said actor Esai Morales. Those, according to Morales, are the "four H's of Hollywood" that make up Hollywood's patronizing formula for Latino actors. Because of that, Reyes said, stereotypes like the Latin lover, the Latina bombshell, or the meek and lowly servant will take a long time to be eradicated from film and television.
