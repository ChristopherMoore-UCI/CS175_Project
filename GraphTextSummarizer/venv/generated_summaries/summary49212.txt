In the footsteps of Thesiger The aim of the expedition was to retrace the footsteps of one of the legends of desert exploration, British adventurer Wilfred Thesiger, who in the 1940s on two separate trips charted vast tracts of the Empty Quarter -- or Rub' al Khali as it is known in Arabic -- a sea of sand dunes and flat featureless plains that spans modern day Oman, Yemen and Saudi Arabia. " People of the desert Like Thesiger, the micro-adventurers -- as Humphreys and McCarron like to call themselves -- said the landscape was made up of people as much as it was by sand dunes and harsh rocky plains. A changed landscape Humphreys -- who could only follow part of Thesiger's journey in the Empty Quarter because they did not have visa access to Saudi Arabia - says the legendary explorer would not recognize the area today with its roads, oil installations and, at one point, even hamburger and kebab stands. "Before I went a lot of people were thinking "Oh you're going to the Middle East you'll definitely be killed by Islamic terrorists" but it was so much safer than even the United Kingdom." Ultimately, he said they left with a deep respect for the people of the region some of whom were descended from the type of people that may have traveled with Thesiger. Thesiger's books documented a vanishing way of life where survival depended on finding desert wells before camels died, avoiding the murderous raiding parties of other Bedu who had lost their herds and where water was sometimes so sparse that herders were known to drink camel vomit to survive.
