You don't have to be a First Amendment purist to intuit that political speech was, if anything, the most urgent subcategory covered by the First Amendment's "Congress shall pass no law" restrictions. If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech. Here's why: Free speech really does mean free speech, and the laws that the "Citizens" ruling overturned directly and heinously restricted the stuff. And for those many who claim to be First Amendment absolutists while also supporting McCain-Feingold -- I'm looking at you, some of my fellow journalists -- here's a question that the former begs of the latter: By a decision of the federal government, which was enforcing the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (known more broadly as McCain-Feingold), this piece of political speech was banned from television.
