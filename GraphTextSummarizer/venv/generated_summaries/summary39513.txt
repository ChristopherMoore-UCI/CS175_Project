As for Dugard and her family, Pierson released no details but said he echoed earlier comments, made by family spokeswoman Tina Dugard, that all family members are doing well under the circumstances. Phillip Garrido fathered two children with Dugard during her captivity, authorities have said. Garecht and Dugard were of similar age and appearance, both were abducted in daylight, and a sketch of a suspect resembled Garrido, Orrey said. Watch the Garridos at the hearing Â» However, El Dorado County District Attorney Vern Pierson told reporters after the hearing that Garrido, a registered sex offender, is also on a "parole hold," which carries no bond. But Pierson praised Garrido's current parole officer for helping to bring about his capture, breaking through his "elaborate, well-planned cover story that was 18 years in the making."
