McAfee founded his computer security software company, McAfee Associates, in 1987, initially running it from his home in California.

" Authorities in Belize want to talk to the 67-year-old Internet security founder about the November 11 killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. McAfee emerged in that capital to ask for asylum last week, after weeks of living in hiding.
