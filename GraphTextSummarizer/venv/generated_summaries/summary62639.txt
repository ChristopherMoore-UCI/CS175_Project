Mexico's Health Ministry reports that obesity and excess weight cost the country $5.5 billion in expenses associated with treating people with diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and heart disease. Buyers, including Mexican giant retailers like Soriana and Liverpool, are increasingly asking for "large" and "extra large" sizes, which have all but replaced production of "small" and "medium." Designer Adriana Moreno, who works at Arush, said they're simply adapting to Mexico's new reality: an explosion of overweight and obese people, mostly in the last three decades. The Mexican government launched a campaign last year urging people to exercise, drink more water, and eat fruits and vegetables. Back at the clothes factory, Adriana Moreno is faced with a challenge: pleasing people in spite of their size. The war on drugs has killed 30,000 people in the last four years, and violence is front-page news in major newspapers across Mexico.
