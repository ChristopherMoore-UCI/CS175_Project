In one of the most highly-anticipated games in the series' history, the Heat -- complete with their star trio of Dwayne Wade and new signings Chris Bosh and LeBron James -- could not live up to close season expectations against the 17-time NBA finals champions. Shaquille O'Neal -- James's former teammate in Ohio and part of Miami's NBA finals winning team along with Wade in 2006 -- scored nine points on his debut for the Celtics. The new-look Miami Heat insist it is too early to judge their NBA title credentials after losing their opening game of the season 88-80 to the Boston Celtics on Tuesday. Also in action in the Western Conference on Tuesday were defending champions the L.A. Lakers, who beat the Houston Rockets 112-110. But James -- who announced his decision to leave the Cleveland Cavaliers to join Miami in dramatic fashion on an hour-long television program on ESPN in July -- believes his new team can improve sufficiently before the end of the season in April next year.
