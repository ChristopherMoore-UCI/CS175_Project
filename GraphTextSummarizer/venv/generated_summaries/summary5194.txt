"The Obama piece worked for me because it offered new information (it appeared before his speech); while Senator Obama discussed Senator McCain, he also went into detail about his own plans. "Instead of seizing the moment and encouraging Iraqis to step up, the Bush administration and Senator McCain are refusing to embrace this transition -- despite their previous commitments to respect the will of Iraq's sovereign government," Obama wrote in his op-ed. " McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said Monday the Arizona senator's position will not change based on the "demands of the New York Times." "John McCain believes that victory in Iraq must be based on conditions on the ground, not arbitrary timetables," he said. Read Obama's essay Shipley, who was President Bill Clinton's senior speechwriter from 1995 to 1997, had advised the McCain campaign that "the article would have to articulate, in concrete terms, how Senator McCain defines victory in Iraq. It would be terrific to have an article from Senator McCain that mirrors Senator Obama's piece."
