-- An official with the Vatican criticized the decision to award the Nobel prize for medicine to British doctor Robert G. Edwards for his work on in vitro fertilization, Italy's official news agency ANSA reported Tuesday. "He worked systematically to realize his goal, discovered important principles for human fertilization, and succeeded in accomplishing fertilization of human egg cells in test tubes (or more precisely, cell culture dishes). He said Edwards' work had created a market for human eggs and created problems of embryos being frozen, the news agency said. Born in Manchester, England, in 1925, Edwards is based at Cambridge University in England. His contributions to developing in vitro fertilization (IVF) "represent a milestone in the development of modern medicine," the award committee said.
