" Paris Air Show set for take-off Airbus says the Concept Cabin is "inspired by nature" and will be 100% recyclable with "self-cleaning materials made from sustainable plant fibres which reduce waste and maintenance and will harvest passenger body heat to power cabin features." "Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment," said Charles Champion, Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering. With double-beds, power showers and lounge areas already experienced on Airbus A380 Superjumbos, perhaps passengers with the money will be getting into the zone onboard sooner than Airbus thinks. This will be the flying experience in 40 years time, according to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. Airbus envisages a "Vitalizing Zone" for relaxation complete with mood lighting, aromatherapy and acupressure treatments; a "Tech Zone" to stay connected; and in the center of the cabin, an "Interactive Zone," where a round of golf can be played via a virtual projection.
