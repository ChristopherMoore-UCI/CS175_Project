Users can also now launch apps, post to Facebook and send Tweets with their voice. With iOS 6, it looks like developers will have even more options to create great apps for users. My only concern with this sort of feature is that it has the potential to use up more bandwidth than users might expect. Users can quickly and easily share groups of photos to a select group of other users. Users can now "like" an app directly from the App Store on Facebook, and see what apps their friends like.
