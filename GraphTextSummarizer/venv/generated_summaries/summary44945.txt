"I proudly support the mission of the Screen Actors Guild Foundation and I'm grateful to be able to give back to my fellow performers," said Baldwin, a SAG Foundation ambassador. Baldwin is on the auction block from now until April 24 in a fundraiser for the Screen Actors Guild Foundation, a charity that helps actors. The SAG Foundation "provides vital assistance and educational programming to the professionals of SAG-AFTRA while serving the public at large through its signature children's literacy programs," its website said. The top bidder gets four prime seats to Baldwin's Broadway show "Orphans" and dinner with the star after the performance. "I'm also looking forward to having a great evening and lively dinner conversation with my four guests."
