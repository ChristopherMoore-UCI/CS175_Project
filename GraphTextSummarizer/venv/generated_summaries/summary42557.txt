A New York hardware clerk pleaded guilty Thursday to second degree murder and kidnapping in the second degree, after abducting, smothering and dismembering an 8-year-old Brooklyn boy in the Hasidic Jewish enclave of Borough Park. " Child's grisly murder shocks Jewish Brooklyn neighborhood Judge Neil Firetog said Levi Aron accepted a plea deal and will spend 40 years to life behind bars for the two counts, after the official sentencing on August 29, for the killing of Leiby Kletzky last summer. New York City's chief medical examiner said the Brooklyn boy died last summer after being drugged and then smothered. Both Aron and Leiby were members of the borough's close-knit Orthodox Jewish community, although police say it doesn't appear that they knew each other.
