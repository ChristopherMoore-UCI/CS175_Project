"And he passed." Asked about a report that Benitez's wife had claimed the soccer star did not receive immediate medical attention at the hospital, Ermen Benitez said he didn't want to speculate until he had the medical report. In a statement on its website, El Jaish described Benitez's death as "a great loss for the team" and said the Ecuadorian player had "high morals." Jose Chamorro, the player's agent, told an Ecuadorian television station that Benitez, 27, had suffered a heart attack and died Monday in a Qatari hospital where he was taken after complaining of abdominal pains. Benitez made his name at El Nacional, a club where his father played with great success throughout the 1980s. Ermen Benitez said his son never had any cardiac problems, and before he jointed Qatar's El Jaish club, he had a clean bill of health.
