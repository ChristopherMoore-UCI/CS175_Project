From late Tuesday through early Thursday, 2 feet to 3.5 feet of snow is forecast for the mountains east of Seattle, Guy said. Between 5 and 10 inches of snow could hit the Seattle-Tacoma area Wednesday, said Dustin Guy, a meteorologist at the weather service's Seattle office. The heavy snowfall will be followed by rain, which could produce ponding water and urban flooding, Guy said. CNN affiliate KING-TV reported that Seattle Public Schools opted to close all schools two hours early. If snowfall amounts top 7 inches, the winter weather event will rank among Seattle's 10 worst since the early 1940s, Guy said.
