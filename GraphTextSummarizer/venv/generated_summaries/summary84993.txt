"When we're on bikes, Dutch people are always in a hurry, even when they're not in a hurry," says Guy Collot d'Esury, another Amsterdam bike mechanic. Amsterdam authorities have begun removing bikes locked outside of extensive designated cycle parks on canals and at the central station. The good news is, according to Dutch cycling organization Fietersbond, Amsterdam and the Netherlands have one of the lowest rates of serious cycling accidents in the world. All around Amsterdam hapless bike-borne visitors can be seen wobbling into the paths of furious Dutch cyclists. But make sure someone else doesn't steal it "If it isn't locked to Earth, then expect it to go," says Samantha Shaffer, an economics major from Washington, D.C., whose year-long studies in Amsterdam have literally and figuratively included a crash course in Dutch cycling.
