The NRC and Canadian nuclear officials are investigating drums shipped from a Willow Creek, Wyoming, mining facility operated by Uranium One to an Ontario processing plant where workers opened them, including the one that ejected the powder. -- After three Canadian employees were exposed to yellowcake uranium last month when a lid blew off a pressurized 55-gallon drum, a uranium mining company has informed U.S. nuclear regulatory officials it has found additional drums possibly susceptible to the same problem, CNN has learned. NRC officials gave Uranium One until this week to identify whether any other drums had become pressurized during manufacture or shipment. The NRC said that Uranium One has suspended all shipping from its Willow Creek facility until it determines how the drums became pressurized. Other drums shipped to the Canadian facility containing yellowcake were found to be bulging from internal pressure, the NRC said.
