A spell at Benfica could help Adu adjust to the pressures of European football. The jury is still out on whether Freddy Adu -- like Lamptey Ghanaian-born -- will fall into the first category or the second, but the footballing world should soon be a little closer to finding out after the 18-year-old's move this week from the shallow waters of Real Salt Lake and the MLS to Benfica of Portugal. I think, today, he still is one of most young talented players in the world," says MLS deputy commissioner Ivan Gazidis. Adu is also following a well-worn path for non-European youngsters. Both subsequently moved onto greatness at Barcelona; U.S. soccer fans will be willing Adu to make a similar leap upwards from Benfica sooner rather than later.
