A feature of the first half was a number of last-ditch blocks by Inter defenders, the first by Maicon as Drogba was left with a clear sight of goal. Motta also headed wide from close range, but when Eto'o was given the same opportunity he showed his quality and might have added another but for a fine save by Turnbull after Drogba had left Chelsea with 10 men. -- A clinical second half strike from Samuel Eto'o sealed a famous Champions League victory for Inter Milan over Chelsea to cap a triumphant return to Stamford Bridge for their coach Jose Mourinho. Inter led the last 16 clash 2-1 from the first leg in the San Siro, but many were expecting English Premier League title challengers Chelsea to overturn the deficit. It was no more than Mourinho and his men deserved after having several excellent chances to put the tie beyond Chelsea's reach.
