Joyce says the initial plan was that if they could work a weekend producing syrup and make the same amount of money Travis was earning at his odd retirement jobs, they'd take that idea to the next level and pursue it full time. The sugar content is similar to that of maple syrup, but the intensity of the sweetness is not there, Travis adds, which is why they suggest use in meat glazes or even cocktails. The Millers have built their business by intriguing the average consumer, who often associates the flavor of syrup strictly with maple or "pancake syrup" poured from a character-shaped bottle. As the name suggests, hickory syrup is made from the bark of hickory trees -- shagbark hickory, to be exact. "And then syrup just started happening," Joyce says.
