"The weekly running costs just to pay the actors, the stagehands and all that stuff is $1.3 million," said NY Post Theater Critic Michael Riedel. Also added to the revamped show are an additional five flying sequences and expanded roles for Aunt May, Uncle Ben and love-interest Mary Jane Watson. If "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark" can rise above devastating reviews and headline-grabbing injuries, much of the credit will go to director Philip William McKinley. McKinley was hired four months ago to salvage the troubled show, which officially opens Tuesday evening. As stuntmen flew overhead before an afternoon matinee preview, McKinley says he took the job in large part because of the commitment of the show's team.
