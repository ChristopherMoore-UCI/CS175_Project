Students at a reform school recounted beatings and sexual assaults at the hands of school administrators and other employees who were supposed to be taking care of them. About 300 of the former reform school students sued former school administrators. Some of the accusers said the graves -- marked only by white steel crosses, rusted with the passage of time -- contained the bodies of boys who were beaten to death by school workers. The allegations against school workers were made by a group of men -- now in their 60s -- who call themselves "the white house boys" after a nondescript white concrete building on the school grounds where they say the beatings and torture were carried out, often with a thick leather strap. But a state investigation into the claims -- which date back to the 1950s and 1960s -- found insufficient evidence to prosecute any former workers at the Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida.
