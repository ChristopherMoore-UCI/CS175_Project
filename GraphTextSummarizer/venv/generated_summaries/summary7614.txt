Hours before the Senate votes on whether to arm Syrian rebels to fight ISIS, a thinly veiled smackdown broke out on Thursday between Sens. Rand Paul and John McCain about the issue. Why Rand Paul can't shake isolationist image Paul, who is considering a presidential run, did not mention McCain's name, but references to the long-time Arizona Senator were peppered throughout. Moments after Paul finished his speech, McCain took to the microphone and pushed back against that argument, insisting moderate fighters do exist in Syria. Paul railed against the notion that arming Syrian rebels is going to be an effective tactic to fight ISIS, lambasting what he called "barnacled enablers" for pushing a policy that he said will harm American interests in the long run. Paul has been embroiled in a bitter debate within his party over foreign policy, especially with McCain.
