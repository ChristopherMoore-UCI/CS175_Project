Michael Brewer was discharged from the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center, spokeswoman Lorraine Nelson said in a written statement. Brewer suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body in the October 12 incident, the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman, has said. Three teens -- Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, and Jesus Mendez, 16 -- are accused of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in what police said was a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a "bad decision." Valerie Brewer said last month that her son's treatment at times has been excruciatingly painful. Valerie Brewer said she was heartbroken when she learned her son's attackers may have included teens who they knew.
