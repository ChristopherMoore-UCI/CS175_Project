Millard South High School Assistant Principal Vicki Kaspar, 58, died at Creighton University Medical Center several hours after she was life-flighted away from the school with critical wounds. -- A Nebraska high school senior had been called out of class to speak with an assistant principal just hours before he returned to school and fatally shot her, Omaha police said Thursday. Darci Tierney said Butler, the son of an Omaha Police detective, was called out of class to speak with Kaspar shortly after the Wednesday morning session began, apparently to discuss a criminal trespass citation he received on New Year's Day for driving his vehicle on the school's track and football field. " Butler had only been a student at the Omaha school for a couple of months, previously living with his mother in Lincoln, Nebraska. An hour and 15 minutes later, a security guard escorted Butler out of the building, but he returned 3 1/2 hours later and signed in to speak with Kaspar.
