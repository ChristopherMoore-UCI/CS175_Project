I have had a lot of great wins on that court here and played a lot of great matches." -- New Olympic champion Andy Murray remained upbeat about his U.S. Open hopes despite suffering a surprise loss in the third round of the Cincinnati Masters on Thursday, going down 6-4 6-4 to 38th-ranked Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. London 2012 silver medal winner Roger Federer, however, easily beat young Australian Bernard Tomic 6-3 6-3 to advance to the quarterfinals, where he will play American Mardy Fish in a rematch of the 2010 title match. "His first serves didn't go over 90 miles per hour, so something obviously was wrong with his shoulder," said world No. 2 Djokovic, the beaten finalist in Cincinnati last year and also 2008 and 2009. Fish claimed his first victory over veteran Czech Radek Stepanek with a comfortable 6-3 6-3 win.
