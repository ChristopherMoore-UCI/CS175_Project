In 2005, Kamel and two other women founded a movement called "Shayfeen," or "We Are Watching You" to observe Egypt's first multi-party elections, and made a documentary about their efforts. A month later, Kamel announced she was to become Egypt's first female presidential candidate for elections expected to be held early next year. The slogan for Kamel's campaign -- Egypt is My Agenda -- stems from her experience during the 18 days of Egypt's revolution in January and February this year. " Young people -- much credited with bringing about Egypt's revolution -- are central to Kamel's philosophy. During a protest in Cairo's Tahrir Square a month after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak, Bothaina Kamel spotted a slogan supporting womens' right to be president of Egypt.
