Yukiya Amano, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, urged Iran on Thursday to be more cooperative with the agency and "provide timely access to all relevant information, documentation, sites, material and personnel." "Iran has not provided any explanations that enable the Agency to clarify the outstanding practical measures, nor has it proposed any new practical measures in the next step of the Framework for Cooperation, despite several requests from the Agency," Amano told the agency's board of governors in Vienna on Thursday. The agency has been trying to get access to Iran's Parchin military site for years. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that the U.S. would not accept just "any agreement with Iran. Kerry met Thursday with negotiators from Iran and EU to help further the ongoing negotiations with Iran, known as the P5+1 talks that have the U.S., U.K., France, China, Russia and Germany working with Iran to achieve an accord.
