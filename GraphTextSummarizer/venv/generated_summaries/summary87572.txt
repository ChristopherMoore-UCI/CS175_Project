On the other hand, if you're a corporation in New York, the Republican budget keeps tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas. If you are a middle-class commuter in my congressional district on Long Island and you're trying to drive from Melville on the Long Island Expressway to get to your job in New York City, this budget gives you more brake lights and potholes. With their latest budget, Republicans are stacking the deck for special interests -- and whether you're a student, parent, commuter or senior citizen, Republicans will force you to pick up the costs so that special interests get their tax breaks. Future generations of seniors get an even worse deal -- they would get a Medicare voucher or have to pay up to 56% more just to get the benefits Medicare offers today. -- Strong countries need a thriving middle class, but in America today, the people who have to work for a living are getting squeezed.
