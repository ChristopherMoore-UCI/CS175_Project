"Some will need service dogs, guide dogs, housing assistance, special equipment put through the house, drivers." Hien Tran, 33, was injured by an improvised explosive device five years ago in Iraq, and he spent 15 months at Walter Reed. "Mr. Conklin's helped me build my business," he said. "I go back to Mr. Conklin and say, 'Hey, this is what I want to do' ... and he gives me his input." Conklin, a former real estate agent from San Ramon, California, is a father figure for many of the "Sentinels" in his program. Conklin's eldest son, Kris, was treated at Walter Reed in 2003, after his Humvee was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade in Iraq. Conklin never served in the military, but his three sons are Army Rangers -- one is in Afghanistan -- and his brothers served in Vietnam.
