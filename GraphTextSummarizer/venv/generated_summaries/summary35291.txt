Joseph Maraachli, widely known in the media as Baby Joseph, was airlifted on Sunday evening to SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, a Catholic hospital in St. Louis, where he is being examined by Dr. Robert Wilmott, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, hospital spokesman Bob Davidson said. In a statement on the hospital's website, it says Baby Joseph's transfer on Sunday happened "despite the strongest possible medical advice to the contrary from medical experts." -- A 1-year-old suffering from a deteriorating neurological condition whose family had been in an ongoing debate with a Canadian hospital about his care has been transferred to a children's hospital in the United States. In January a Canadian Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the hospital, saying it could remove the child's breathing tube without a replacement, along with a do-not-resuscitate order and recommendations on palliative care. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, flew to Ontario Sunday night to help with the transfer.
