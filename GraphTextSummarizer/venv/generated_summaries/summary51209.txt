Lynch served two stints as the U.S. attorney in charge of New York's Eastern District, which includes most of New York City (Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island) as well as suburban Long Island. In addition to rounding up shady pols, violent cops and Wall Street cheats, Lynch took on the all-important issue of national security in the harrowing case of Najibullah Zazi, a terrorist who drove explosives from Colorado to New York City with the intent of setting them off in the subways. Any rival candidates the Republicans might put forward will have a hard time demonstrating prowess equal or superior to Lynch's in the crucial areas of prosecuting lawbreakers involved in organized crime, corporate theft, political corruption and threats to national security. Within hours of Lynch's nomination, the right-wing Breitbart website ran an erroneous story slamming Lynch for supposedly representing ex-President Bill Clinton during the long-ago inquiry into the Whitewater land deal -- but later had to post a correction for failing to recognize that Clinton's defender was, in fact, a different person named Loretta Lynch. We shall see if Lynch -- who has locked up enough terrorists, gangsters and political crooks to fill a few subway cars -- has the grit and gumption to master political combat inside the Beltway the way she has mastered legal battle in the courtroom.
