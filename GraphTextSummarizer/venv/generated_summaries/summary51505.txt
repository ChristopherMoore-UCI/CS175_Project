"Birdman" will go into the history books as 2014's best picture winner, but the 87th Academy Awards will also be remembered for a handful of stirring moments -- and a few awkward ones: Common and John Legend's song "Glory," written for the film "Selma," had the Oscar crowd visibly moved with its rousing message, accompanied by a full gospel chorus. Last year, Travolta was immortalized for calling Menzel "Adele Dazeem." The most notable came after the win for "Citizenfour," a documentary about NSA contractor Edward Snowden. And then there was the luckless John Travolta, who shared a microphone with Idina Menzel. "We wrote this song for a film that was based on events that were 50 years ago, but we say Selma is now, because the struggle for justice is right now," he said, invoking threats to the Voting Rights Act and the level of correctional control of African-American men.
