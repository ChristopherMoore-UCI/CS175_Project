Until then, Apple is stuck telling unhappy customers that they can visit Google Maps in the iPhone's Web browser or download other map apps like MapQuest or Bing. These aren't questions anyone is used to asking about Apple products, because Apple doesn't usually ship broken products. Apple CEO: "We are extremely sorry" for Maps frustration It's understandable why Apple felt it needed to switch away from Google. But it doesn't make sense to switch away from Google before Apple's own product is ready, and it's doubtful iPhone 5 sales would have been even slightly affected because the Google Maps app on Android is slightly better. Opinion: Maps app is not the only Apple misstep The timing of the move surprised even Google, which is scrambling to build its own maps app for the iPhone and iPad.
