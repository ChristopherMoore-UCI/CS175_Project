The lower house of parliament voted 211-89 in favor of Ashraf, a confidant of President Asif Ali Zardari who until recently served as minister of information and technology. In 2011, he was accused of scheming to receive kickbacks from private power companies during his time as minister of water and power. Ashraf, 61, a former minister and staunch loyalist of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, replaces Yousuf Raza Gilani, who was ousted by a Supreme Court ruling earlier in the week. -- Raja Pervez Ashraf ascended to prime minister of Pakistan on Friday after lawmakers approved his nomination in a majority vote in parliament. Minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin's candidacy was marred shortly after it was made public when a trial court issued an arrest warrant for him in connection with a drug scandal in 2010, when he served as health minister.
