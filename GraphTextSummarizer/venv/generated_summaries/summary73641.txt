Australian Daniel Ricciardo of Toro Rosso and German Adrian Sutil in the second Force India were next fastest Frenchman Romain Grosjean, Lotus teammate Finn Kimi Raikkonen and two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Ferrari initially filled out the top 10 before Di Resta's demotion. Hamilton, in fourth place in the championship, will be hoping his Mercedes can find more race pace to capitalize on their qualifying speed. Hamilton produced a lap of one minute 29.07 seconds, described as "phenomenal" by three-time defending champion Sebastien Vettel, who was third fastest for Red Bull. Vettel, leading the title race yet again, paid compliment to Hamilton in the post race press conference, but appeared to reference the controversial Mercedes tire test earlier this season which Red Bull were particularly outspoken about. But Hamilton's stellar performance left them plenty to cheer although with warmer conditions forecast for Sunday he may struggle to take full advantage if the lessons of previous races this season are any guide.
