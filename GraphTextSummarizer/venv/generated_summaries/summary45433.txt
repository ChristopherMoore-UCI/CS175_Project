The 77 year-old pontiff's criticism of the capitalist system has been so scathing of late that he has been forced to deny he is a closet Marxist after arguing today's "idolization of money" wasn't just morally wrong, it was devastating for society. "Inequality is essential for the spirit of envy," he said, "stimulating brain activity," and countering falling wages elsewhere. The two messages -- one cruel, the other caring -- if anything are evidence of today's increasingly polarized views on the importance of fortune and fate in today's post-austerity era. Using the first peace message of his pontificate to preach against the cult of high finance, Pope Francis railed against huge salaries and bonuses. Perhaps predictably, they come from the heart of a man who has experienced hardships first hand, as a son of poor immigrants in Argentina, who when elected to lead the Catholic Church chose the name of a saint who turned his back on a life of riches.
