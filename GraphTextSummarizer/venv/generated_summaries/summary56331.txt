It's been nearly two years since the overthrow of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and the new government has reinforced its military by contracting with a number of militia groups. Last year, protesters in Benghazi attacked a number of militia offices as part over the public anger that followed the attack on the U.S. Consulate that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead. Anger toward the militias, which are predominantly made up of former rebel fighters, has been building since Gadhafi's overthrow. It boiled over after some militias laid siege to government ministries in the capital city of Tripoli in April in an attempt to force the government to pass a law that would ban Gadhafi-era officials from holding office. Libya's government has acknowledged problems with trying to disarm arm and control a number of militias.
