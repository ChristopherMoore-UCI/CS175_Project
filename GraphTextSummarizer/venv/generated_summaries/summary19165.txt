-- "Guiding Light" will go dark in September after 72 years and 16,000 episodes, CBS announced Wednesday. The show, which the Guinness Book of World Records lists as the longest-running television drama, first aired on NBC radio in 1937 as a 15-minute serial, the spokeswoman said. It moved to television on the CBS network in 1952. The daytime soap opera's declining viewership led to the decision, according to a CBS spokeswoman. Gina Tognoni is one of many performers who have appeared on "Guiding Light" over the years.
