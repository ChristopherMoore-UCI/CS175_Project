Many have revised workplace policies to provide flexible schedules, paid family leave and paid sick days to help ensure women are not penalized in the pocket book for shouldering the lion's share of their family's caregiving responsibilities. It's been five years to the day since the President signed his first piece of legislation, the Lilly Ledbetter Act, which restored legal protections for women who are victims of pay discrimination. An executive order may not have the staying power of legislation, but it will move the needle for the approximately 25 million Americans working for federal contractors, many of whom are women. State of the Union: Bravado vs. political reality Congress can start by passing the Paycheck Fairness Act so that women can't get fired for asking their co-workers about their pay. But as welcome as this seemingly bipartisan display of support for women may be, it stood in stark contrast to what has happened in the real world.
