"All the guys that [were] hanging out there, taking up space, [are] now leaving because there's too many youth coming back." Dozens of New York City schools have adopted Bartendaz moves into their physical education programs through grass-roots networking, Yasin said. Through a partnership with Atlanta, Georgia, nonprofit Next Century Youth, the Bartendaz recently held a series of demonstrations in the Atlanta area, including Crossroads South, an alternative high school for students who have been expelled. Having built up respect from teachers and administrators at New York City schools, Yasin and his team were tasked with developing a program to get kids to stop cutting gym class. After his release in the early 1990s, Yasin cleaned up his act and became a motivational speaker -- talking to New York youths about substance abuse awareness, conflict resolution, gang prevention and leadership -- which evolved into his nonprofit, Giant Thinking. Bartendaz fan Justin Kemp, 18, found the group on YouTube about a year ago and took on its exercise techniques soon after.
