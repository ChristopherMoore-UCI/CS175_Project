The document, while sounding embracing of persons of different sexualities and children living in such relations, really restates the long-held position of the Church in many respects about homosexuality. In a deeply conservative Church that has for a long time viewed homosexuality as "an intrinsically disordered, contrary to natural law and cannot be approved under any circumstances," it will take more than a Synod statement to arrive at a turning point on the subject of homosexuality. In Uganda for instance, the Catholic Archbishop Kizito Lwanga is one of the leading proponents of the re-tabling of the country's expunged anti-homosexuality act, a controversial law that criminalized homosexuality provided for life imprisonment for same sex relations. But it will require much more than pronouncements to qualify as a critical departure from the Church's position on homosexuality. I suggest that this is not a turning point particularly for the African Catholic community, but rather the start of an openness in debate that will take a long time to change the Church's doctrinal teaching.
