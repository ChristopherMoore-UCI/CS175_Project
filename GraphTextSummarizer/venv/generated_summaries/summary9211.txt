U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy started the day in the joint lead with Bradley after their first round 67s, but fell away in blustery conditions to card a four-over 75 to finish in third place on level-par 142. Keegan Bradley rounded off a triumphant rookie season by claiming the PGA Tour's Grand Slam of Golf in Bermuda Wednesday. Bradley held off a charging Charl Schwartzel of South Africa to win the prestigious end-of-season title by a shot after carding a level-par 71 on the Port Royal Golf Course. The 25-year-old Bradley, who turned professional in 2008, has enjoyed a remarkable first season on the PGA Tour, claiming the Byron Nelson Classic before his triumph in the PGA Championship where he beat Jason Dufner in a playoff. He kept his nerve as Schwartzel drew level through the turn after picking up five straight birdies.
