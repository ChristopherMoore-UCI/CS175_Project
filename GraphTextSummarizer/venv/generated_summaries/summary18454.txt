" Wood revealed that officials will seek the views of ATP Tour players regarding the breakdown of the prize purse to make sure lower ranked players received greater compensation for their efforts. Tournament director Craig Tiley said he would meet leading players Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray in Shanghai this weekend to discuss the issue, which had prompted reports of a possible player boycott of the opening grand slam of the season. "We have led the world in prize money for these incredible athletes and we want to ensure that the Australian Open continues to make a major contribution to the financial well being of professional tennis players. The increase of $4.12 million will see players compete for their share of a record $31.1 million in January's tournament in Melbourne. "We are proud to announce this major increase in prize money," Tennis Australia chief executive Steve Wood told the official website of the grand slam event.
