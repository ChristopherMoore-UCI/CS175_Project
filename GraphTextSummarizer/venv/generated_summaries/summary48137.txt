Women also need contraceptive care for other medical reasons, such as preventing ovarian or uterine cancer and regulating painful periods. During this long-term study, we offered more than 9,000 women the reversible contraceptive method of their choice while at the same time improving their knowledge of contraceptive methods and eliminating the most common barriers women face: cost and access. There's a reason why the Affordable Care Act includes contraceptive care at no cost to the individual -- it's basic health care. Our study suggests that when we remove cost barriers and improve education and access, as would be the case with full implementation of the contraceptive rule, we have the potential to make an astounding impact on the public health of women in our country. We also know that cost is a factor in what contraception women use.
