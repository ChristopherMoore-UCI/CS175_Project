-- Britain's Prince William asked his girlfriend Kate Middleton to marry him, he said Tuesday, setting up the most anticipated royal wedding since Prince Charles and Diana, princess of Wales, got married nearly 30 years ago. " William biographer Davies, however, said he feels the opposite about Middleton, who he said lacks the "charisma" shown by William's mother. " "Prince William and Miss Middleton became engaged in October during a private holiday in Kenya," the statement said. William said there was "no pressure" for Middleton to emulate Diana. Prince William has also sought the permission of Miss Middleton's father.
