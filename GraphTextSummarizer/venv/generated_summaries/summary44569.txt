The big news in New York politics is not that Caroline Kennedy, a deeply private person, preferred to be in private life. Perhaps Kirsten Gillibrand is part of the Joshua Generation of women leaders, inspired by Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi and so many others who blazed the trail Gillibrand is now following. Listening to Gillibrand speak of how Hillary Clinton inspired her, I couldn't help but see parallels to Barack Obama. In short, Gillibrand is the kind of Democrat who can win in blood-red upstate New York. Paul Begala says Kirsten Gillibrand is a skillful politician and part of a new generation of rising women leaders.
