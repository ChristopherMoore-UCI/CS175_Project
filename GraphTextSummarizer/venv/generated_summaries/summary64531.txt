Cheap Android devices are available, but at an event in San Francisco announcing the release, Mozilla CTO Brendan Eich pointed out that most of those are running Gingerbread, an old version of the Android OS. Mozilla released a phone running its new Firefox OS in Spain on Monday, joining leading mobile operating systems Android and iOS, as well as smaller players Windows Phone and Blackberry. Firefox OS is rolling out in locations where significant portions of the population are still using feature phones. The company hopes developers will create custom interfaces for the devices that mimic what people love about Android or Windows Phone or even entirely new takes on the usual smartphone screens. New HTML 5 apps will be available in the Mozilla Marketplace after they're screened for security, though Mozilla won't be kicking apps out for content.
