Jim McAusian, general secretary of the British Pilots Association, used the incident to blast the CAA's record on pilot fatigue in a statement Thursday, accusing it of being "far too complacent about the levels of tiredness among British pilots and failing to acknowledge the scale of the underreported problem." "This is a personal belief," he said, "but I would rather have somebody take a nap during a cruise part of a flight so that pilot would be at peak performance during a high-traffic situation or a landing." Unauthorized cockpit napping among U.S. pilots isn't "that prevalent," Weiss says, "but that's not to say it doesn't happen." Curt Graeber, who was with Boeing for 19 years, headed a NASA/FAA study that recommended the FAA allow cockpit napping. Among U.S. pilots, cockpit napping violates FAA rules. In the U.S., flights longer than eight hours require a relief pilot on board to take over so pilots can take a break to sleep. Instead of allowing in-flight napping aboard U.S. airlines, the FAA has mandated that long-haul routes include relief pilots and special onboard sleeping quarters that must be available for the flight crew.
