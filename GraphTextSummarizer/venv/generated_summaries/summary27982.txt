AC Milan stayed just one point behind Serie A leaders Juventus with a convincing 3-0 win over Cagliari in the San Siro Sunday. Valencia substitute Aritz Aduriz salvaged a point for his side in a 2-2 draw at Racing Santander in La Liga Sunday. Star striker Mike Hanke gave the visitors the lead in the first half with Marco Reus and Igor de Camargo adding further goals after the break. But Milan's city rivals Inter saw their seven-match winning run ended with a 1-0 defeat at strugglers Lecce.
