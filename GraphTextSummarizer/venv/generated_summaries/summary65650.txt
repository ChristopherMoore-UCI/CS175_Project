" "As it was used by the conspirators in this case, the term 'jihad' meant defending Islam against its enemies through violence and armed aggression, including killing the enemies of Islam, if necessary, in order to expel non-believers from holy Muslim lands," the U.S. Justice Department said in a 2007 statement on the case. The camp "would be a place that Muslims could attend to receive various types of training, including military-style jihad training, in preparation for a community of Muslims to make 'hijrah' (to immigrate) to Afghanistan," the criminal complaint stated. "Once in Afghanistan, the men in the community would have gained enough familiarity with weapons at the Bly training camp to fight jihad in Afghanistan. "The court agreed that the American authorities had provided sufficient assurances over the conditions in which Aswat would be held in the U.S." In 2005, British authorities suspected Aswat of involvement in bombings on London Underground trains that killed 52 people. In a federal criminal complaint, prosecutors said Aswat participated in efforts to build the camp in Bly, Oregon, in 1999 and 2000.
