He was also later quoted by CNN as suggesting "true Islam" means being able to "beat your wife" and "murder your children if they've committed adultery or something like that, which they do practice in these other countries." All this suggests that Reverend Graham is either an ignorant man who knows next to nothing about a faith that he holds forth on as if an expert, or (even worse) he intentionally tries to mislead Christians into despising Islam and Muslims. Still, if Reverend Graham truly believes he has truth on his side, then he should be willing to engage in a public debate on the question of extremism in Islam. Reacting to Duke's decision on Facebook, he wrote: "As Christianity is being excluded from the public square and followers of Islam are raping, butchering, and beheading Christians, Jews, and anyone who doesn't submit to their Sharia Islamic law, Duke is promoting this in the name of religious pluralism." Of course, it is undeniable that some Muslims butcher others in the name of Islam. The younger Graham used the announcement as another opportunity to attack Islam. Regardless of whether it is either of these factors, having spent half my life in the deep and concerted study of Islam, I know for certain that Reverend Graham's claims are without merit.
