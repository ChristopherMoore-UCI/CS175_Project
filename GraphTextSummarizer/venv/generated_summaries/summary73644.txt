" Because many citizens in rural areas know so little about the political process, election workers said they also had to show people how to vote. "Since we have many experiences in election, we don't need experts on this issue," said Thein Soe, chairman of the election commission. The elections, he said, "were neither free nor fair, and failed to meet any of the internationally accepted standards associated with legitimate elections. "And since we have all ambassadors who are representing their countries, we don't think we need to invite any special group to observe the election since all the ambassadors are here and can watch it on election day," he added. A new law forced the NLD to choose between honoring Suu Kyi as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections.
