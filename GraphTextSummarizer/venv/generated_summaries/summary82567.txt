It was a lawsuit pitting two larger-than-life personalities against each other -- former pro wrestler-turned-Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura and ex-Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle. On Tuesday, Ventura was victorious as a federal jury in Minnesota awarded him more than $1.8 million, deciding that Kyle's 2012 best-selling autobiography, "American Sniper" defamed Ventura. In later interviews, Kyle said he was referring to Ventura. Ventura filed the suit before Kyle's death, according to the New York Times. At his deposition in 2012, Kyle continued to insist his book accurately described his clash with Ventura.
