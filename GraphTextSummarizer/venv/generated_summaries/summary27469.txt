Friday's incident in Detroit comes a day after federal authorities acknowledged that three U.S. Airways-operated jets at Reagan National Airport came closer than they should have because of an air traffic control "miscommunication." "At no point were the three aircraft on a head-to-head course," said Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. The incident occurred Tuesday afternoon when air traffic controllers were making adjustments for landing and departing aircraft because of bad weather. "Air traffic control was aware that they had a situation where separation was less than they would like," Cory said. A Delta flight from Phoenix was coming in to land Friday night at the Detroit Metro Airport as a small regional jet was trying to land, said Elizabeth Cory, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration.
