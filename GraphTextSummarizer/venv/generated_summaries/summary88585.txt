A few tornadoes were possible Monday across the eastern Florida Panhandle, the Florida peninsula and southern Georgia, forecasters said. Citing the threat of heavy rainfall and potential tornadoes, Florida Gov. Rick Scott on Monday declared a state of emergency "so we can coordinate the use of all state resources to make sure we can respond promptly if anything happens." A large swath of Florida was under a tornado watch until Monday afternoon. Debby remained offshore Monday but continued to pose a threat of tornadoes, heavy rain, additional flooding and high winds to much of Florida as it slogged slowly to the northeast. As of 1 p.m. Monday, Debby was centered about 50 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola in the Florida Panhandle, the National Hurricane Center said.
