We feel that a very stable and deliberate approach suites our technical strengths and provides a model for one vital element of the 'ecosystem' of robots that we expect to be deployed to disaster scenarios in the future," said JPL's Brett Kennedy, who is supervisor of the Robotic Vehicles and Manipulators Group. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is working on a different kind of robot for disaster response that's designed to move like an ape. When we imagine the robots of the future, they often look and move like humans, standing up on two legs and using a pair of arms to grab and move objects. Spotty communications are common in disaster scenarios (and on Mars). "These tasks include assembly and maintenance of orbital structures; exploration of low-gravity bodies like asteroids, comets, and moons; exploration of caves and cliffs on Mars or our moon; and even preconstruction of habitats wherever humans care to venture in the solar system."
