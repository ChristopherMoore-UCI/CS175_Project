There's been a second "Twilight Zone" movie mired in development for several years now too, with Leonardo DiCaprio attached as executive producer. Attempts to revive the series have largely struggled â€” there was a 1985 edition that ran for three seasons (two on CBS, one in syndication), and another in 2002 on UPN that lasted only one season. Networks have become less squeamish about edgy content, which has allowed producers to more realistically depict dark subject matter. Sci-fi and horror series are delivering big ratings (AMC's "The Walking Dead," NBC's "Revolution") and there's several other genre projects coming to the small screen (NBC's "Hannibal" and "Dracula"; CBS' "Under the Dome").
