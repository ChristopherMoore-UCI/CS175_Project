This is all reasonable advice, but body language and Canadian flags alone won't fool anyone. Yet according to Canadian flight booking website FlightNetwork.com, pretending to be Canadian by wearing that glorious red maple leaf still gets Americans better service when they're abroad, provided they're able to act the part, too. "Using quintessentially Canadian symbols, body language and facial expressions is a time-tested way to enhance the travel experience abroad," says Allison Eberle, vice president of operations for FlightNetwork.com. If a Canadian apologizes three times the maple fairy brings you a hockey puck signed by Rick Moranis? But do today's Americans still feel the need to jack the Canadian flag while traveling abroad?
