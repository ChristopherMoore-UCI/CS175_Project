One of Reuters' sources claims the company "constantly changes product specifications almost to the final moment," so — as usual — no one except Apple really knows whether we'll also see a bigger or a cheaper iPhone in September as well. The iPhone 5 was launched last September, and Apple is widely expected to unveil a new iPhone around that time this year. Apple is looking into launching iPhones with a 4.7-inch and a 5.7-inch screen, Reuters reports, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. The company is also considering launching a cheaper variant of the iPhone, that would cost around $99 and come in 5-6 colors. Long-known for its limited palette of products, Apple always focused on the premium segment of the market, claiming the form factors of its devices, as well as the prices, are just right.
