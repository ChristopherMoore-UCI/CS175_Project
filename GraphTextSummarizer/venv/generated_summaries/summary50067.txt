In addition to speeding up the searches, Guy-Rostan Nteme, the ANPN coordinator for the sniffer dogs unit, says the canines are providing law enforcement agents with valuable information that helps improve park protection. In January 2012, the Gabonese authorities invited Wagtail UK to run a feasibility study and gauge whether dogs could improve the detection rate of prohibited products in the country. Yet a recent surge in poaching, fueled by the growing demand for ivory products in Asia, has led to the decimation of many of the animals populating Gabon's national parks. Wilson says it was crucial to find high-energy dogs that could cope with intense heat; the recruits also needed to be non-aggressive looking, since they'd be mainly working in public spaces, and also feel comfortable being around people that might not be used to handling dogs. "We've not yet had a big find, for example, whole tusks hidden in shipping containers, but we're continually getting small quantities of worked ivory, dried shark fin and bushmeat," she adds.
