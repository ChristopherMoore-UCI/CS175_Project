A 67-year-old woman who reportedly received millions in life insurance money from at least five of her previous partners has been arrested on suspicion of poisoning her last husband with cyanide -- the latest high-profile case in Japan involving so-called "black widows. Kakehi is the latest "black widow" to make the headlines in Japan. However, authorities may be unable to prove she killed her other lovers because autopsies are generally rare in Japan. But an autopsy report on Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband to die, found cyanide in his stomach and blood. It triggered a police investigation into the case, which culminated in Kakehi's arrest in Kyoto on Wednesday.
