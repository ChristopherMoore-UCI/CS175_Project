And I think what is important for me today is underlining the luxury of the house, maybe less jeans, less street wear, but keeping the DNA of Pierre Balmain and pushing the embroideries and the craftsmanship because this is something that I think is part of me, and part of the house at the same time. Olivier Rousteing: Pierre Balmain has always been a big designer like Christian Dior or Monsieur Saint Laurent, and when I had this opportunity to take (on) the house I just felt so flattered ... His richly embroidered, luxurious designs have earned him legions of fans, and his so-called "Balmain Army" of supporters includes some of the most glamorous women in the world, from Naomi Campbell to Rosie Huntington-Whitely. I love women and I love wonder women -- those kind of women who have no boundaries and no (limits) and have this power to express themselves. And at the same time I wanted to bring back the archives because Pierre Balmain was known for the Jolie Madame silhouette, amazing tailoring and the most incredible embroideries, but I wanted to twist it with my edge, my generation.
