"It is reasonable to believe that Dr. Eroshevich provided Anna Nicole Smith prescription medications and controlled substances by transporting them from California to Nassau, Bahamas with her on her travels to visit Anna Nicole Smith," Doss said. "Dr. Thompson stated Dr. Eroshevich was obviously not familiar with a lot of medications she was prescribing for Anna Nicole Smith," Doss said in her affidavit. A nanny hired to care for Smith's infant daughter, who was born in the Bahamas in September 2006, told investigators she witnessed Stern and Dr. Eroshevich "crush pills, heat them to turn them into liquid and inject Smith," according to an affidavit from a state investigator. Thompson told Doss he later "admonished Dr. Eroshevich" about the drugs she was requesting for Smith. Howard K. Stern, Smith's lawyer and companion, appeared in Los Angeles County Superior Court, along with Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor to formally hear the charges.
