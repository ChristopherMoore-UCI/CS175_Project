Teachers, especially, were tired of No Child Left Behind and the emphasis on standardized test scores to judge students, schools and teachers. The underlying belief is that if we punish schools for low test scores and reward schools and teachers for high scores, then student achievement will improve. Arne Duncan sent a letter to American teachers in honor of Teacher Appreciation Week in which he heaped a lot of praise on teachers but at the same time made it clear that policies that are so destructive in our schools are not changing. More support is going to semi-private charter schools and flowing away from public schools. Teachers simply could not believe his praise, because at the same time Duncan says he appreciates teachers, he has supported the firing of entire staffs.
