-- Toyota's recent recall of millions of vehicles for sticking accelerator pedals may get drivers wondering: What should you do if a vehicle is accelerating uncontrollably? Toyota says it is shipping reinforcement parts to dealers, and that dealers will start repairs as soon as this weekend. But if the pedal is stuck in a depressed position, here is what the driver can do, according to Omar Panjshiri, a certified Toyota technician at the Chantilly Repair Center in Chantilly, Virginia: • Shift the transmission to neutral • Turn off the ignition switch • Vehicles in the recall are: Toyota's 2009-2010 RAV4, Corolla and Matrix; 2005-2010 Avalon; certain 2007-2010 Camrys; 2010 Highlander; 2007-2010 Tundra; and the 2008-2010 Sequoia. Accelerator pedals in the 2.3 million vehicles that Toyota recalled may, in rare circumstances, become stuck after the pedal mechanisms become worn, the automaker has said.
