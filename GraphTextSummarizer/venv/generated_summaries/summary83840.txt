Another close friend, former England Test cricketer Ronnie Irani, helped to get Gascoigne on a plane to the United States, as he confirmed in an interview on national radio. Then national manager Bobby Robson famously labeled him as "daft as as brush" because of his unpredictable and compulsive behavior, but had no complaints as Gascoigne proved central to England's 1990 World Cup success. Fading career After spells at Lazio in Serie A and Scotland's Glasgow Rangers, Gascoigne saw out his career with Middlesbrough, Everton, Burnley, a Chinese club Gansu Tianma and lowly Boston United. Lineker and Morgan were reported to have assisted to get Gascoigne admitted to the specialist clinic in Phoenix, Arizona to deal with his alcohol and related problems. Not for the first time, fears for Gascoigne's well being were raised by friends and supporters, including Gary Lineker, a teammate for both England and Tottenham Hotspur.
