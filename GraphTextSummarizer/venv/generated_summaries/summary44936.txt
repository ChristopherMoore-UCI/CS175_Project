The WHO estimates the Spanish flu resulted in upwards of 50 million deaths -- or more deaths than those during World War I. A virus as severe as Spanish flu has not been seen since. Although 10 times deadlier than other pandemics, Spanish flu was far less contagious than diseases such as measles or chicken pox, according to Harvard epidemiologists Christina Mills and Marc Lipsitch, who carried out a study in 2004. Hundreds of people became infected with the avian flu virus, or bird flu, which killed six people and infected hundreds. Swine flu is usually diagnosed only in pigs or people in regular contact with them. Spanish flu was the worst pandemic of the 20th century.
