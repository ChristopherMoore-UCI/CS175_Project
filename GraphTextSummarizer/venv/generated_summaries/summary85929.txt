On Monday FIFA did just that, meaning there is nothing stopping Klinsmann from handing Green his international debut against Mexico on April 2 and subsequently taking him to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The 18-year-old winger's displays since making his debut for Bayern's second team in 2013 have been enough to convince U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann to offer Green the chance to represent the country of his birth. But the Tampa-born starlet has already represented Germany at youth level, meaning football's global governing body FIFA had to clear Green to play for Klinsmann's team. Not only was Costa born in Lagarto, Brazil, he played for the country of his birth on two occasions in March 2013. But in September of that year the Spanish federation requested Costa be allowed to play for La Roja after he had been granted Spanish citizenship.
