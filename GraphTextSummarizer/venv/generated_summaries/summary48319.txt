The United States Marine Corps is 238 years old today, and last night, I helped them celebrate in San Francisco the same way I do every year. -- Editor's note: CNN's Mike Rowe regularly attends an annual San Francisco ball which celebrates the birth of the U.S. Marine Corps. He wrote this essay about the event last year. Like last year, and the year before that one, and the five years before that one, I'm transfixed by what I see. Maybe next year I'll come up with something more insightful.
