Obama defends record on immigration at Univision forum There will be a cost to excluding deferred status immigrants from health benefits, said Adolph Falcon, senior vice president of the National Alliance for Hispanic Health. Those who need, but cannot receive, subsidies to purchase health insurance, are likely to turn to the more expensive option of going to the emergency room for health care, she said. By not providing all resources to help this group get health insurance as youths, it creates unnecessary health risks for their future, he said. The HHS also stated that those with deferred status would not be eligible for health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. The Obama administration was clear that those who qualified for deferred action did not gain legal status in the United States, but would have "lawful presence," which would allow them to work legally and opened the door for other benefits, like driver's licenses.
