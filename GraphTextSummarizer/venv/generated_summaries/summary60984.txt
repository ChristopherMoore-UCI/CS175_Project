Jim Conrad, a former New Hampshire State Police trooper who worked on the case, said Kathy was found in the woods not far from a small gravel road near a popular swimming hole in Franklin, New Hampshire. Kathy's family asked private investigator Tom Shamshak to aid in the investigation and he agreed to volunteer his services. Anyone who has information that could lead to the arrest of the individuals responsible for Kathy Lynn Gloddy's murder is asked to call the New Hampshire State Police Crime Unit tip line at 603-271-3636. It is unclear where Kathy went next, but what is known is that later that evening her dog returned home acting frantic and anxious, family members said. Kathy Gloddy was found murdered a mile from where she was last seen.
