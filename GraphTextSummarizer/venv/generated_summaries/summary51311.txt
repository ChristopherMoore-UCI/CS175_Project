In other foreign policy matters, Clinton writes how she pushed for arming Syrian rebels and also highlights her differences with President Barack Obama on the high-stakes issue. Former officials told CNN earlier this week that Clinton was skeptical of early plans to trade Taliban prisoners, which the Obama administration ultimately did to win Bergdahl's release last week. Clinton's vote became a key topic in her marathon 2008 battle with Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination. Also in her book, set to hit bookshelves on Tuesday, Clinton dishes on the 2008 campaign against Obama, her feelings about Sarah Palin, and her role in planning her daughter's 2010 wedding. The issue, more than the economy, dominated the early parts of the campaign, with Obama criticizing Clinton over the vote.
