He has pleaded not guilty to charges including five counts of crimes against humanity and five counts of war crimes. Prosecutors allege he armed rebels and fueled a bloody civil war that led to widespread murder, rape and mutilation in Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone. Taylor has been on trial since 2007 at the special court for Sierra Leone in The Hague, Netherlands. -- An international tribunal will issue a verdict in the war crimes trial of former Liberian President Charles Taylor next month, the United Nations said. United Nations officials and the Sierra Leone government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities.
