When they asked Adrian's father, Kevin Waldrop, and his wife, Jalaine, if they knew that the car was missing from their garage, they were shocked, and Jalaine Waldrop ran into the boys' bedroom. Brandon Burr and Adrian Chiquito sneaked out of the house early Tuesday in Niles, Michigan, and into Burr's grandfather's car, WOOD reported. "The kids were gone, and the blankets were stuffed with pillows, and she just knew," Kevin Waldrop told WOOD. Brandon, 14, was at the wheel and was injured, Sheriff Joseph M. Underwood Jr. said. They had not heard the boys leave, they told WOOD.
