Following the Qantas CEO's comments, a Rolls-Royce spokesman referred back to his company's earlier news statement, which said: "Since Qantas QF32 suffered an engine failure and returned safely to Singapore Changi Airport, we have been working closely with our customer and the authorities. On Friday, Joyce said Qantas hopes to resume A380 flights within 48 hours, after completing engine safety checks. "Passengers left on a special Qantas flight at 10:30 a.m. local back to Sydney," said airline representative Ashley Edwards Knapp. Passengers on the detoured Qantas flight spent the night in Singapore, then flew to Australia on Friday. One of the four engines on the Qantas Airbus A380 shut down six minutes after takeoff Thursday from Singapore's Changi Airport, forcing it to return and make an emergency landing.
