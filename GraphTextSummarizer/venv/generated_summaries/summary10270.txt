So the 26-year-old sat down at his Long Branch, New Jersey, home on 7Â½ West End Court -- the same house where he would also write "Thunder Road" and "Backstreets" -- and he began scribbling lyrics on a sheet of ruled paper from a spiral notebook.

An AllMusic review described the tune as a "celebration of the rock & roll spirit, capturing the music's youthful abandon, delirious passion and extraordinary promise with cinematic exhilaration.

Springsteen explained the song's birth in a statement from Sotheby's.
