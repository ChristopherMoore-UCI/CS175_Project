Bill Cooke, the head of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, said by e-mail that the shooting stars would be visible after about 11 p.m. in each time zone in the United States, with the best viewing time from 3 a.m. until dawn. NASA and Ustream will have a webcast from Wednesday through Friday with one view of the meteor shower. The Quadrantids were first noted in 1825 and got their name from the constellation of Quadrans Muralis, which is no longer considered a constellation by astronomers, according to NASA. This year's show in the sky may not produce as many highlights for some viewers because of light from the moon, NASA said in a statement. Meteor watchers can expect to see 60 to 200 meteors an hour streak across the sky, NASA said.
