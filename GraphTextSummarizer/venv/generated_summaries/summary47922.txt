" Whitehouse said he was not convinced that advising someone of Miranda rights is a "sort of per-se inhibition on our ability to collect intelligence from an individual." Justice Department spokesman Miller defended the FBI's decision, touting the bureau's success in handling terrorist suspects since the 9/11 attacks. " Others in Congress defend decision Some, such as Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wisconsin, were mystified by the reaction to the decision to try AbdulMutallab in federal court. Committee Chairman Lieberman said, "This bill forces the law enforcement and intelligence community to recognize that preventing the next attack should be the first priority." Lieberman and Collins also have written a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder, urging the Obama administration to transfer AbdulMutallab to military custody and charge him as an enemy combatant. AbdulMutallab provided information that "has already proved useful in the fight against al Qaeda," Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero said, "To abandon due process in terrorism cases turns the rule of law on its head and flies in the face of the values that we are fighting to protect in the first place." As the congressional hearings demonstrated, the nation's leaders still have not come to grips with how to handle terrorism suspects.
