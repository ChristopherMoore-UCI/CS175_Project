The 27-year-old made the best possible start Thursday as he tied for the first-round lead with longtime friend Chris Kirk, who heads the FedEx standings from second-placed Horschel. World No. 1 Rory McIlroy -- who like Kirk, Horschel, Watson and Mahan can secure the bumper jackpot with victory Sunday no matter where any other player finishes -- was tied for 11th on 69 with Adam Scott, Sergio Garcia and Ryan Palmer. " Impending fatherhood is only adding to the excitement for Horschel, who partnered the comparatively calm Kirk in the final group to go out Thursday. " Horschel is one of five players who can claim the $10 million jackpot for topping the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup playoff series by winning the $1.44 million Tour Championship finale in Atlanta. Because of the tournament's restricted 29-man field -- there would usually be around 150 players for the first two rounds of a regular PGA Tour event before the halfway cut -- he will have time to get back to resume playing the next day.
