Shortly after Ridulph's disappearance, McCullough was accepted by the Air Force and legally changed his name from John Tessier to Jack Daniel McCullough. More than 50 years ago, Ridulph was abducted while playing with her friend, Cathy Sigman, near their homes in Illinois. The discovery led to McCullough's arrest and eventual charge, according to court documents. Wednesday's new charge is a holding charge that will allow Washington police to continue keep McCullough in custody until he returns to Illinois where he will be prosecuted. Jack Daniel McCullough, 71, was arrested last week at his home in Seattle.
