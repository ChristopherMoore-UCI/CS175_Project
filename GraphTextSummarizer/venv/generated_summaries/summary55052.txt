Authorities reversed their initial determination Thursday that the explosion was the result of an industrial accident involving cement and other materials, Santa Monica police said. Investigators began searching for Hirsch after finding evidence at the damaged synagogue, the Santa Monica police said in a statement. "Investigation has determined that items found in and around the mechanism are linked to an individual by the name of Ron Hirsch, identified as a transient," a police statement said. "Hirsch is known to frequent synagogues and Jewish community centers seeking charity from patrons. Further investigation by bomb technicians unearthed a large portion of the cement found at the scene and uncovered materials indicating the device appeared to have been deliberately constructed, police said.
