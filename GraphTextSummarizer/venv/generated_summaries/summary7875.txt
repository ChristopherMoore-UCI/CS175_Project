Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos dubbed it "the moment that probably re-elected Barack Obama." Obama to speak after forceful Clinton endorsement The 48-minute address -- nearly 3,200 words of prepared text and a thousand more of classic Clinton riffs -- checked off nearly every item on the Obama campaign's wish list: • Appeal to the persuadable who cite bipartisanship as a key quality: Clinton praised Eisenhower. • Re-frame Romney without alienating bipartisanship-worshipping swing voters: Heading into Wednesday, Clinton's presidential record and his assessment of Romney had played a starring role in campaign ads... for the Republican nominee. Clinton's toughest punches came wrapped in silk gloves; his most brutal critiques were paired with a side of smiles, jokes and ad libs -- the sort of delivery that allows an attack line to resonate far beyond the base. But I am telling you the claim that President Obama weakened welfare reform's work requirement is just not true.
