" Boko Haram, which has fought an anti-government campaign in northeastern Nigeria and parts of Cameroon, said previously that it was holding a German hostage. The Islamist group has attacked neighboring Cameroon, initially by crossing the border from Nigeria to steal food or kidnap foreign nationals. Boko Haram, which means "Western education is forbidden" in the local Hausa dialect, has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, and bombing government buildings. Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau said so in November, in a video message denying Nigeria's claims that it had struck a ceasefire deal with the group. Boko Haram kidnapped German citizen Robert Nitsch Eberhard in Nigeria in July, Biya said in a statement read Wednesday on state-run broadcaster CRTV.
