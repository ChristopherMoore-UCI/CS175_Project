The district attorney's office identified the men as Nicholas Lazarus, Christ Makhmaltchi, Gregory Vitale, Richard Vitale Jr. and Richard Vitale Sr. The incident began when some teenagers became angry when they were asked to show identification for a tobacco purchase, said Erdaogan Yavuz, the manager of the OK Gas Station in Wantagh, New York, told CNN. When Nassau County police arrived on site, the man attacked one of the officers, according to a spokesman for the 8th precinct in Levittown. "Then he grabbed the [gas station's] flag and hit me in the face with the flagpole, and that's when I grabbed the flag from him to defend myself," said Yavuz, who said he became a naturalized citizen of the United States in March. All five men were charged with assault but the case will not be prosecuted as a hate crime, said Chris Munzing, the deputy director of communications for Nassau County Police.
