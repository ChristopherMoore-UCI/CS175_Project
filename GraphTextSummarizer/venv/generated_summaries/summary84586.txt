This is Nida's second prison sentence; he served five years for auto title fraud before marrying Parks in 2009. "Real Housewives of Atlanta" star Phaedra Parks is calling it quits with husband Apollo Nida. In July, Nida told Atlanta radio station B100 he had doubts his marriage to Parks would continue. The couple's relationship has taken a bumpy turn of late because of Nida's legal issues and prison sentence. At the time of Nida's sentencing, Parks' publicist released a statement on her behalf.
