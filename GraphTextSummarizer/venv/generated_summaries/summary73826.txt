U.S. marshals were asked to join the search by Harris County authorities after Tata left the Houston area. Jessica Tata, who has dual citizenship in the U.S. and Nigeria, fled to Lagos shortly after the fatal fire at her Houston home in February. Tata was taken into custody Saturday in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, by Interpol and U.S. diplomatic security agents, officials said. "We now have the opportunity to move forward," Lee said, adding that she worked closely with the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria and spoke with the Nigerian ambassador to the U.S. to make sure Tata's return was a "top priority." At a news conference Monday, Lee said Tata turned herself in to authorities after a "monumental" effort between the U.S. and Nigerian governments, along with Tata's family in Lagos.
