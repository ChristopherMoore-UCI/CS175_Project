"Today's sentence successfully brings to a close our prosecution of three criminals who aimed to use their human smuggling network to help a person who they believed to be a terrorist infiltrate our homeland," said U.S. Attorney Ronald C. Machen Jr. "By convicting three Pakistani nationals who were operating out of Ecuador, we have demonstrated our ability to dismantle human smuggling operations throughout the world when they threaten our national security." According to court documents, the three men were living in Quito, Ecuador, when they were contacted by federal informants who claimed they wanted to sneak a member of the Taliban into the United States. Ul Haq told the federal informants it was not his concern what the purported member of the Taliban wanted to do in the United States, saying if they want to do " hard labor, sweep floors, wash dishes in a hotel, or blow up. -- A federal court sentenced a Pakistani citizen to more than four years for providing false documentation and attempting to smuggle a person he thought was a Taliban member into the United States. The three were arrested after accepting payment and procuring a fake Pakistani passport for the fictitious Taliban member, the court documents said.
