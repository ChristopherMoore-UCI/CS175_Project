In some corners of the Internet, Kim Kardashian is already Mrs. Kanye West. " West popped the question to Kardashian with an over-the-top proposal in October 2013, a few months after the couple welcomed their first child together, daughter North. The 33-year-old reality star isn't expected to marry West until May 24, but a May 4 report from Life & Style Weekly stirred speculation that the couple have already obtained a marriage license in California. News cite sources who say that Kardashian and West, 36, haven't yet made their impending union official. "We will be getting married ... in Paris," Kardashian told Jimmy Kimmel earlier this year.
