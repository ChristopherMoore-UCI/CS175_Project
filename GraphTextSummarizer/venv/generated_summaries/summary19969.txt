United, which has won all three home matches in this year's Champions League, lost in the round of 16 last season after being beaten at Old Trafford by Real Madrid. Karembeu, who won the Champions League on two occasions as a player with Real Madrid, says the runaway Greek Super League leader is relishing the opportunity of causing a big upset. Without a massive turnaround in domestic fortunes, the three-time European champion will not qualify for the continent's top club competition next season unless it wins this year's edition -- a task which looks improbable given recent performances. Embarrassed by great rival Liverpool on Sunday, light years behind in the race for the English Premier League title and on the cusp of European humiliation, it has been a year to forget for those so used to success. Olympiakos will arrive at Old Trafford in confident mood after winning the first leg 2-0, according to the visiting team's adviser Christian Karembeu.
