With more investment of time and money by Somalia, its neighbors and the wider international community in tracing the financial flows of piracy, identifying and prosecuting those who have financed and benefited hijackings, figureheads such as Afweyne may make the news for their imprisonment, rather than retirement. Somalia's former government issued him with a diplomatic passport, reportedly in a bid to dissuade him from carrying out further pirate activity, demonstrating the surprising political connections which he has enjoyed. The retirement of the pirate leader Mohamed Abdi Hassan, also known as "Afweyne," has generated much media coverage, but the real significance of his announcement is the indication it gives of how Somalia's pirates currently view their business model. For more than a decade, this environment has provided rich pickings for pirates launching small skiffs from Somalia's coast, hoping to hold up a ship with its cargo and crew until a ransom is paid by the ship's owner. And, perhaps, the example of pirates who have been prosecuted and imprisoned internationally and within Somalia.
