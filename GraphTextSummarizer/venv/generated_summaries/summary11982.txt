And while Hunt has focused on New York's Hart Island, many other regions of the country have similar sites. Hunt, who sustains the Hart Island Project largely through donations and sales of her documentary and artwork, says she's recently received a grant from the state's Council on the Arts to create a "posthumous Wiki" -- a user-generated database of stories, photos and information about those on Hart Island. Her years-long search for his grave had gone cold until 2009 when she, like Joseph, enlisted Hunt's help after finding her Hart Island website. Hunt, 53, has made it her life's work to document the undocumented at Hart Island, reportedly the nation's largest taxpayer-funded potter's field -- a term used for a place where the unclaimed dead are buried. Hunt suspected Joseph's child was buried on Hart Island despite the incomplete records.
