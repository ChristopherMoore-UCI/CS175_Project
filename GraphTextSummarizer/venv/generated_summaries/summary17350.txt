Nadal, riding a 12-match winning streak on hard courts, will face Roger Federer in Friday's marquee encounter. Djokovic hasn't won a title since April and lost in heartbreaking fashion to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of the Rogers Cup in Montreal last week. Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 U.S. Open winner, advanced to the semifinals with a three-set win over resurgent Russian Dmitry Tursunov. The world No. 2 was ousted by Tomas Berdych 6-3 6-4. Murray, meanwhile, might still be coming to terms with his epic victory at Wimbledon that ended Britain's 77-year men's singles drought, although Berdych improved to 6-4 against the Scot.
