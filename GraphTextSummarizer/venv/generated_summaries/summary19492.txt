Pedro Pinto's Euro 2012 predictions Danny Townsend, from firm Repucom who conducted the survey, says the Premier League has attracted more female fans to the game in recent years, but has a way to go to match its continental rivals. According to Townsend, England's poor performances on the pitch in recent years have translated to a drop in fervent fans off it. " Racism, rather than Ronadlo and Ribery, dominates Euro 2012 storylines Germany's burgeoning female football fan population contributes to their position at the top of Repucom's table, with 62% of its country's people supporting the national team and 44% of that figure made up of women. "Ultimately, it's a major goal for all clubs and organizations to engage more female fans. "However the potential for growing female interest is huge -- and, at the end of the day, it equates to more people playing the game and more people investing in the game.
