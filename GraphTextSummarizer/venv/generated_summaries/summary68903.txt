In a YouTube video posted from an undisclosed location over the weekend, Lopez called for new anti-government protests Tuesday and vowed to show his face in front of Venezuela's Justice Ministry and hand over a list of demands from the Venezuelan people to government officials. "The world must know that there is sufficient evidence that the groups that have caused violence in recent days are headed by Mr. Leopoldo LÃ³pez." Protests and violence in Venezuela "We are deeply concerned by rising tensions, by the violence surrounding this February 12 protest and by the issuing of a warrant for the arrest of the opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Saturday. Lopez's party, Popular Will, has accused the government of being responsible for violence during the protests.
