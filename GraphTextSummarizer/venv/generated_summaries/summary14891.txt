Santos was first elected in 2010 on a platform of continuing an offensive against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, leftist guerrillas at war with the government for decades. -- Capping a hotly contested contest, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos won re-election Sunday. With more than 99% of polling stations reporting, he had nearly 51% of the vote versus the 45% won by challenger Oscar Ivan Zuluaga, according to election officials. Santos celebrated in Bogota, predicting the start of a new Colombia. " "This is the end of more than 50 years of violence in this country, and the beginning of a new Colombia," Santos said.
