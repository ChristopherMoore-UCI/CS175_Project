Opinion: Don't overreact to rocket explosion So NASA has always relied on private industry, a need that is only increasing as the agency's budget becomes stretched even further and it turns to private enterprise to take on one of the program's crown jewels: manned space flights. While the private sector is not new to such accidents, like the SpaceX test mission that exploded in August, the Antares blast marks the first such NASA-contracted accident since the agency turned to the private sector to ferry space station cargo. NASA-contracted space travel is highly coveted because of the value of the associated contracts, which are in the billions of dollars, leading to a new incarnation of the space race and what many refer to as the privatization of space. Orbital Sciences is one of two private companies hired by NASA to run such missions, and the other is Elon Musk's SpaceX. The botched mission was to be Orbital Sciences' third of eight as part of a $1.9 billion contract with NASA. Tweets of condolences to Orbital Sciences from industry insiders flooded social media after the incident.
