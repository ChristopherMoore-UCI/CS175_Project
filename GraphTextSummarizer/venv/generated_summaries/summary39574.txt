With no such narrative artifice, no Love Story-ish terminal illness or other tragedy to stimulate audience tear ducts, and none of the mood miseries or big-name lures of "Blue Valentine," "Like Crazy" tells the truth, simply: Love is thrilling. Favorite returning TV shows in trouble Equal storytelling credit goes to fast-rising stars Yelchin ("Star Trek") and Jones ("Brideshead Revisited"), who immersed themselves in deep improvisatory work with their director to arrive at such a palpably real, universally identifiable manifestation of young love in all its ecstasy and agony.

And the magic of this glowing little award-winner by director/co-writer Drake Doremus ("Douchebag") is that we believe every skip and flutter of their beating hearts, even as those beats are challenged by forces beyond their control: When Anna returns to her family in London after graduation, visa problems keep her there. There's no accounting for chemistry, of course, not only in the success of love affairs and movie-star pairings but also in the way audiences respond to onscreen romance.
