Wechsler pointed CNN to MTV's website for more details, including that the birth happened at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey, at 3 a.m. Sunday. Within hours of the baby's arrival, the 24-year-old "Jersey Shore" star tweeted about her joy:  "I am SO IN LOVE with my son Lorenzo Dominic ! Lorenzo Dominic LaValle has entered the world weighing 6lbs, 5oz. Nicole, Jionni & Enzo are doing great!" Fans who want to know about the last months of Snooki's pregnancy can tune in to the next season of MTV's "Jersey Shore," which the channel said will debut in October. Snooki -- whose real name is Nicole Polizzi -- revealed in March that she was pregnant and engaged to the baby's father, Jionni LaValle.
