-- European Union leaders named Belgian Prime Minister Herman Van Rompuy as the first "president of Europe" Thursday, edging out former British Prime Minister Tony Blair for a still-vaguely defined job. Unlike Van Rompuy, who was chosen by leaders of the EU's member states, Ashton must be confirmed by the European Parliament. In his speech, Van Rompuy pledged to lead the EU through a process of "dialogue, unity and action. The Belgian is "well known as a consensus builder," said British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who added the selection was unanimous. Van Rompuy's new job was announced after a closed-door dinner for the EU's heads of state and government.
