-- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal is looking forward to facing his rival Roger Federer in the second of two charity exhibition matches, having raised $2.6 million on Tuesday night. The contest was dubbed the "Match for Africa" and raised funds for the Roger Federer Foundation ahead of Wednesday's rematch in the Spanish capital Madrid. Sixteen-time grand slam champion Federer said winning Tuesday's three-set event was not as important as the money it raised. Nadal suffered a 4-6 6-3 6-3 defeat to his second-ranked Swiss opponent in their opening clash in Zurich. "The focus is just solely on two players and one match," Federer said after the match.
