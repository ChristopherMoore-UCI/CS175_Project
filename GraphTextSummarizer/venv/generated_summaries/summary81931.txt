Relatives and human rights groups said they believe Chinese authorities targeted him because of his irreverent commentary on modern Chinese society, though the Chinese government denied his activism had anything to do with his detention. He became a rallying point among human rights activists overseas who condemned China's crackdown on political dissidents, lawyers, artists and religious groups. Observers in Beijing said it may not be coincidental that Ai's release on Wednesday took place on the eve of Premier Wen Jiabao's upcoming visit to Hungary, Britain and Germany, where Ai enjoys wide support among artists and politicians. " It was not a customary answer from the provocative conceptual artist, renowned as a harsh, uncompromising critic of Chinese government policies. "And he has reached an agreement with the authorities and that agreement is that he will not say anything about what happened during the 80 days that he was held incommunicado and also that he will desist from any advocacy of the rule of law, human rights or criticism of the government," said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Right Watch, Ai's release came without much fanfare.
