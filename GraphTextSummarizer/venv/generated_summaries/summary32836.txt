At the Bexley home, members of the public also abused boys, Beckett said, possibly with the knowledge of Salvation Army staff members. Allegations of widespread sexual assault carried out by Salvation Army officers and some of the boys under their supervision were also outlined. The current phase is focusing on the Salvation Army's response to abuse that took place in four of its boys homes in the states of Queensland and New South Wales in the 1960s and '70s. The public hearings, taking place in Sydney, are part of a wide-ranging investigation into how Australian institutions responded to cases of child sexual abuse. "The Salvation Army feels deep regret for every instance of child sexual abuse inflicted on children in our care," the organization says in a statement on its website.
