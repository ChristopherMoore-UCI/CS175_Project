He will face Tomas Berdych on Friday in a rematch of this year's Wimbledon final, with the Czech having earlier earned his first victory with a result that left American eighth seed Andy Roddick needing to win his final match in straight sets. On Thursday, second seed Roger Federer takes on No. 4 Robin Soderling in their third Group B match, then Britain's Andy Murray plays Spain's David Ferrer. -- World No. 1 Rafael Nadal prevented Novak Djokovic from reaching the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals and kept his own hopes alive by beating the Serbian in London on Friday night. Nadal is seeking to reach the final for the first time, having failed to win a match at the same venue last year. The 23-year-old Djokovic said he was disappointed he was not given more time to solve his eye problem.
