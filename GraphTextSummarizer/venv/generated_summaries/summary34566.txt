With the last trap dropped back into the water, Lessard and the crew of the Mystic I head back to the dock, where they will place the day's catch onto the scales to see how good the sea has been to them. From the wheelhouse, Captain Karl Lessard steers his boat into the darkness toward the fertile fishing grounds off the small Island of Marathon, Florida. This is a ritual that Lessard has done thousands of times. "My family is out here, and I plan on being out here and joining them someday," Lessard says, "although I would like it to be a long time from now." "In the Keys, people really started fishing for lobster in the 1930s," Lessard says.
