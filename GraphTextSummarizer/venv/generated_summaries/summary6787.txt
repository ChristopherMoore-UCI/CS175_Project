The three members of the Brigades' 15-member military council were killed in a bombing in Rafah in southern Gaza, according to Hamas. But the two sides failed to reach a compromise, with Israel calling for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas requesting, among other things, the lifting of Israel's economic blockade on Gaza. -- An Israeli airstrike on a house in Gaza overnight killed three high-ranking members of Hamas' military wing, the Qassam Brigades, the militant group said Thursday. The Israeli military said Thursday that more than 225 rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza since the truce collapsed this week. "If you try more, you will get double." Israel will not stop its efforts against Hamas "until we can ensure full safety and security" for people in Israel's south, the prime minister said.
