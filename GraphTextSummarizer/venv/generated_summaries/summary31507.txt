If the job of diplomats is to reach out to people, promote U.S. values, obtain and share information, and help advance our diplomatic agenda, then we have to build embassies that neither compromise our diplomats' safety nor their work. But as we wage a global battle for hearts and minds, embassies can send a powerful message to people everywhere about what America stands for. The bill also directs the State Department to ensure new embassies adhere to the highest standards of energy efficiency and sustainability. As the first impression many foreign people have of the United States, embassies can be another force in our arsenal to convey who we really are, to bring allies closer to us, and, yes, even to make us safer. Speeding up embassy construction and updating facilities to protect our diplomats against terrorist attacks was sorely needed.
