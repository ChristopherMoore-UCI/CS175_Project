The merchandising deal for the crystal-encrusted belt is also a first -- the trustees of the Michael Jackson estate authorizing the Jackson family to produce and sell memorabilia in the pop star's name. Blanket, Paris and Prince Jackson put their names on a designer belt produced as a tribute to their late father and to raise money for the Jackson family museum planned for Gary, Indiana. Grandparents Katherine and Joe Jackson sat next to each other on a sofa in the Jackson's Encino, California, home to add their autographs to the "artist proof" of the belt. Katherine Jackson dropped her challenge for control of her son's estate last October, but her husband still has a legal objection pending in probate court. "This is a truly one-of-a-kind opportunity," said Jerry Olivarez, the Jackson family friend who brought the deal together.
