"My reaction is that the school did not take the responsibility to keep my son safe," Robert Champion Sr. said. The probation comes as a Florida circuit court judge weighs whether to dismiss a civil lawsuit brought by the family of drum major Robert Champion Jr., 26. The hazing was part of a ritual known as crossing the bus, in which pledges attempt to run down the center aisle from the front door of the bus to the back while being punched, kicked and assaulted by senior members, band members have said. The regional accrediting agency has expressed concerns about academic policies, student rights, the control of finances and the institutional environment, according to FAMU. In September, FAMU responded to the lawsuit by filing court documents saying that the institution was not responsible for Champion's death.
