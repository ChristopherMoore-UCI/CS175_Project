If you've spent any time downloading music, apps or other stuff from iTunes, you know what Meyers is talking about: Those messages from Apple that pop up on your laptop, iPad or iPhone and say, "iTunes Terms and Conditions have changed. Handel explained it this way: When we buy something from iTunes, we are paying for the license to listen to music or watch a movie on our iPhone or other Apple device. "Yeah, just agree," wrote one user, macbookairman, on a MacRumors.com forum, echoing the sentiments of many Apple users on the site. But in the meantime, Handel said, Apple customers should scan those terms and conditions the next time they get that pop-up message. It's not clear whether Apple will ever incorporate user suggestions and shorten or revise its iTunes  terms.
