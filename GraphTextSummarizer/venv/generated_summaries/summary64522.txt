In July, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe eased several unilateral sanctions on North Korea after the two countries made progress in talks about Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North Korean regime during the Cold War. Among the Japanese sanctions lifted is a restriction asking its citizens not to travel to North Korea, which opens the door for more Japanese tourists to embark on commercial tours of the country. A North Korean "Special Investigative Committee" of about 30 government officials is expected to update the Japanese government in the next few weeks on the status of missing Japanese citizens. It is exceedingly rare for Western journalists to be allowed inside the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) -- commonly known as North Korea. The wrestlers are also scheduled to tour Pyongyang and interact with North Korean fans.
