The Buffett Rule, simply stated, requires the wealthiest Americans to pay taxes at rates not less than rates paid by middle-income Americans. Was it "only fair" because I had more personal contact with poor people or sick people or people without health insurance? So much has happened this year to focus our attention on what is fair: Obama's State of the Union address, the Trayvon Martin case, the rhetoric around the Supreme Court's review of the Affordable Care Act and Paul Ryan's proposed budget, with its cuts to services to middle- and low-income Americans. Fairness was about how I related to others, combined with how others related to me. In my early 30s, I worked for someone who said, "Fair is when I win."
