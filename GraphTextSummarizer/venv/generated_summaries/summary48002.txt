However, from participant observation studies and over 100 informal interviews with gang leaders, inmates and prison officials, we have developed an alternative perspective on prison gangs. Inmates have told us that it is common for them to call their leaders as "tatay" (father) or "kuya" (older brother), a Filipino cultural dynamic that orders the social standing of inmates. By default and not by design, gang leaders help maintain internal control and safeguard inmates as best they can. While NBP was originally built as a closed, American style high-security facility, over time, the walls have become porous, security has lapsed and deals have been made with inmate leaders to ensure prison order. But prison gangs are not all about maintaining order.
