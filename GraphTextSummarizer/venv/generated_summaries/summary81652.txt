Chuck Colson, a Watergate-era "hatchet man" for President Richard Nixon who became an influential evangelical leader after serving time in prison, died Saturday afternoon, according to his website. News of his death soon stirred tributes particularly from leaders in conservative circles and the evangelical community, with David Frum -- a former special assistant to President George W. Bush and a CNN contributor -- saying on Twitter that Colson made his "greatest impact when furthest from power." "Today the world lost a Christian statesman, a dedicated servant of prisoners and a powerful example of God's ability to transform a life," said Lamar Vest, president and CEO of the New York-based American Bible Society. And Pat Buchanan, a conservative leader who called Colson "a tremendously good friend of mine" during their time together in the Nixon administration, called him "a real example of redemption. A former U.S. Marine captain, Colson was considered a main player in the Nixon White House's dirty tricks during the rough-and-tumble politics of the Vietnam era in America.
