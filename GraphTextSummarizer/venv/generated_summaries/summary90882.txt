It's also interesting to note that more participants stayed on the Atkins diet for the entire year, compared with women on the other diets. And they found while Atkins can be an effective way to lose weight, few people are able to maintain meaningful long-term weight loss on this diet. Can they keep the weight off with Atkins? Gupta: First off, although any doctor will tell you it's good for most people to lose 10 pounds, 10 pounds is not a significant amount of weight to lose in one year. Also, other nutritionists we talked to who have worked on this same type of research said that the only real difference in diets was between Atkins and the Zone. A Stanford University study, released in May 2007 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, compares the effectiveness of four popular diets -- Atkins, LEARN (Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships, and Nutrition), Ornish, and Zone -- for women who are premenopausal and overweight or obese.
