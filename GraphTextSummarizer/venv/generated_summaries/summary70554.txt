Pirates frequently use small boats to attack commercial vessels with small arms and grenades, but he said the Absalon crew could not connect the men "directly with another pirate attack in the area." He said the skiff was found in Yemeni waters, and the Absalon crew was instructed to hand over the men to Yemen's coast guard. Lynge said the men "had been without propulsion on their small boat for several days without food or drinking water." After giving the men medical treatment aboard the Absalon, the ship's crew turned them over to Yemen's coast guard Friday morning, Tantholt said. Pirates have seized many ships in recent weeks in the waters of the Gulf of Aden, which separates Yemen from Somalia at the entrance to the Red Sea. The Royal Danish Navy said one of its warships, the HDMS Absalon, rescued the seven men Wednesday after they were found in a powerless skiff with rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s aboard, navy spokesman Jesper Lynge told CNN.
