The claimants say that air traffic control failed to take sufficient measures to establish contact or to launch a search for MH370 within a reasonable time after it had lost contact with the Boeing 777. Their father, Jin Jing Hang, 41, was on board the flight bound for Beijing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport. It lost contact with air traffic control over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. Malaysia, Australia and China are conducting a deep-sea search for the aircraft in the southern Indian Ocean, where authorities say they believe it ended up. Jee Kinson, 13, and Jee Kinnland, 11, named the airline, officials at Malaysia's civil aviation and immigration agencies, and the country's air force chief as responsible for the loss of the jet, which disappeared on March 8.
