Â» Thousands of people flocked to the jagged shoreline of Maine's Acadia National Park on Sunday as Hurricane Bill weakened offshore on its trajectory north and delivered dramatic waves to the New England seaboard. On a rock cliff about 20 feet above the sea, a wave struck about 11:50 a.m., pushing water onto the ankles of some of the people standing on "top of what we think would be a safe area," Acadia Chief Ranger Stuart West told CNN. A U.S. Coast Guard rescue boat reaches a man swept out to sea Sunday at Acadia National Park in Maine. West said that people ask why rangers didn't just close off the park's shoreline. "Of course, trying to locate a head in frothy, agitated water like it was is a very difficult operation," West said.
