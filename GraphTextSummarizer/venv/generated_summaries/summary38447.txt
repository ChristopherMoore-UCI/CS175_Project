" Ali Shahi is charged with mischief to property, mischief or interfering with the lawful enjoyment of property, other threats and endangering the safety of an aircraft, according to Constable Lillian Fitzpatrick of Peel Regional Police. Earlier that morning -- about 45 minutes into flight 772 from Toronto to Panama City -- the 25-year-old Canadian citizen made a "direct threat against the aircraft," according to Sunwing spokeswoman Janine Chapman. Ali Shahi was arrested Friday by at least a half-dozen heavily armed authorities who stormed aboard an airplane looking for him at Toronto's Pearson International Airport. Eventually, the plane touched down at Panama City's Tocumen International Airport at 9:41 p.m. local time, nearly 12 hours behind schedule. " Shahi said his son is a friendless, unemployed gambling addict who has suffered from depression and eating disorders for a decade.
