"This is the first time we had to close off air filtered by the facility to the outside," Energy Department spokesman Gregory Sahd told CNN. New Mexico Sens. Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich said in a statement Saturday that they remain in contact with Energy Department officials. -- An alarm late Friday night indicating higher than usual levels of airborne radiation led to a first-of-its-kind response at a nuclear disposal facility outside of Carlsbad, New Mexico, an Energy Department spokesman told CNN. Due to the late hour and the location of the incident, Sahd said there was little risk to employees. The radiation was first detected at 11:30 p.m., according to Sahd.
