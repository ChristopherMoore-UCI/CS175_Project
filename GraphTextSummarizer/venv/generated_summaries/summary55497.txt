Abhimanyu Mithun and Amit Mishra both added valuable runs to see India past Sri Lanka's total before Randiv removed both players to bring an end to the innings. And after half centuries from VVS Laxman and Suresh Raina had helped India to 436 all out, Sehwag took two wickets to reduce Sri Lanka to 45-2 at the close and heap pressure on their middle order. Virender Sehwag was the star with bat and ball as he offered India a glimmer of hope as they bid to win the third Test and level the series against Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka were unable to negotiate the final session without losing a wicket as both opening batsman fell to Sehwag. The batsman completed his 21st Test century soon after the start of play on Thursday morning after India resumed on 180-2 in reply to Sri Lanka's first innings total of 425.
