-- Thirty to 40 years ago, when arcade and console games were primitive and parents condemned them as a new threat to their children's schooling, it was probably hard to imagine one of America's leading museums embracing video games as an artform. While the question of "video games as art" sparks debate in some circles, game makers agree that raising the level of discussion to include the Smithsonian is a welcome event. He believes the exhibit may raise the level of games in the eyes of people who overlook how important video games are to our culture and society. But video games themselves are increasingly ambitious, interactive and artistically complex -- an evolution celebrated in a new show at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. The exhibition, "The Art of Video Games," explores 40 years of video games as cultural artifacts.
