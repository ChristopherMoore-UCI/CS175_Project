-- Members of the powerful Hezbollah movement and its allies brought down Lebanon's unity government Wednesday after resigning from Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Cabinet. Lebanon's government has been at an impasse over the U.N.-backed special tribunal's investigation of the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the current premier's father. " Obama stressed to Hariri the importance of the tribunal's work "as a means to help end the era of political assassinations with impunity in Lebanon." Hariri was meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House as the political crisis erupted in Lebanon. The failure to break the impasse between Hariri's government and Hezbollah has raised fears of a renewal of the sectarian bloodshed that plagued Lebanon in 2008.
