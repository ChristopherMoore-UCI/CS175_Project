The group, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, known as ISIS, said Thursday's suicide blast in southern Beirut was the "first small payment" in a bigger push against the Lebanon-based Shiite militia Hezbollah. -- A Sunni Islamist militant group claimed responsibility Saturday for a car bomb attack in Lebanon's capital two days earlier which killed four people and injured dozens. The al Qaeda-affiliated group has been pushing for a fundamentalist Islamic state carved out of northern Syria, while Hezbollah fighters have been supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's brutal push to crush a rebellion there. Political divisions and ideological tensions in Lebanon go back several decades, Khouri said, but they have been reinforced by the emergence of radical Islamist terrorist groups, linked to al Qaeda, following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. "We are seeing the greatest proxy war of modern times playing itself out in Lebanon and Syria and Iraq, that have now become really one battlefield in which two great ideological camps are fighting to the death like gladiators," he said.
