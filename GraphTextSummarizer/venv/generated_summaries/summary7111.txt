-- Journalists in Sri Lanka have come under a growing number of attacks and intimidation, with some fleeing the country or losing their lives, media analysts and rights groups say. Dietz said attacks against journalists are not new in the nation, whose government has been battling ethnic Tamil rebels-- known as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)-- since the 1980s. "As the [President] Rajapakse government ramps up the war against the Tamils, there's been growing criticism of the government and at times it's been partisan --partisan journalists -- but basically in the last year and a half we have most likely seen five or six senior journalists either thrown in jail, threatened or gone into exile because of disagreements with the government," said Bob Dietz, Asia program coordinator of the journalism watchdog group Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Blake said, "we have called on the government of Sri Lanka to investigate these attacks expeditiously." "It's difficult to speculate about what's behind all this, but I think what's important for the government to focus on now is what they can do to address this problem of impunity, whereby no one has been brought to justice for the many high profile killings -- not just of journalists but many other people -- for the many abductions that have occurred and other human rights abuses that have occurred." Rajakarunanayake told CNN there "is no government policy of impunity." "What we're seeing in the last year and a half is a change in tactics from the government of just putting pressure on Tamil journalists to putting the pressure on mainline Sinhalese or Muslim journalists who write for more legitimate papers or news outlets and are critical of the government," he said.
