Last week's Bridgestone Invitational winner Adam Scott is among three players just three shots off the lead, while world No.2 Lee Westwood is four off the pace after a 68 and world No.1 Luke Donald is six behind after carding a 71. -- Former world number one Tiger Woods missed the cut for only the third time in a major tournament as American duo Jason Dufner and Keegan Bradley lead the way after the second round of the U.S. PGA at Johns Creek, Atlanta. The pair hold a one-stroke lead over compatriots Jim Furyk, Scott Verplank and D.A. Points, along with Australian John Senden. The 35-year-old, who has won 14 majors, has previously failed to make the final two rounds at the 2006 U.S. Open and the 2009 British Open, and on this occasion it means he will not be able to compete in the PGA Tour playoffs for the FedExCup. Top overseas players Angel Cabrera, Justin Rose, Ernie Els, Geoff Ogilvy, Louis Oosthuizen, Vijay Singh, Jose Maria Olazabal, Graeme McDowell and British Open champion Darren Clarke are also all on their way home.
