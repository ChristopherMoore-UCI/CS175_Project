Egypt's "revolution," which ended the three-decade rule of Hosni Mubarak, was widely known as the Facebook or Twitter revolution because of the way activists used social media to spread their message, despite government countermeasures such as arresting dissidents, periodically blocking Internet access and restricting cellular networks. -- Draconian laws, brutal attacks against bloggers and politically motivated surveillance are among the biggest threats to Internet freedom emerging in the last two years, according to a new report from free speech advocates, Freedom House. "The findings clearly show that threats to Internet freedom are becoming more diverse," said Sanja Kelly, project director for Freedom on the Net at Freedom House. According to Freedom House, China has the world's largest population of Internet users, yet the authorities operate the most sophisticated system of censorship. They say the authorities have detained and intimidated hundreds of online political activists and online commentators, blocked and filtered sensitive political, religious or pornographic content from entering the Saudi Internet, and even recruited supporters online to campaign against calls for protests.
