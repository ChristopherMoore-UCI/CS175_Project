Chelsea extend title lead as Arsenal stumble After registering the only goal and point for English clubs in the last 16 of the Champions League in midweek, Chelsea returned to English Premier League action on Saturday facing west London rivals Fulham. Up stepped Robben to claim a hat-trick and round off a depressing week for Schalke manager Jens Keller. "I don't think anyone is reckoning that we will lose six of our last remaining 12 matches ..." Make that six of their last 11 as Bayern Munich walloped Schalke 5-1 at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Merseyside rivals Everton bounced back from back-to-back defeats with a 1-0 win against West Ham United at Goodison Park while Newcastle United's mini-revival continued with a 4-1 win against Hull City at the KC Stadium. Mario Mandzukic headed in a third in the 24th minute before Robben's second four minutes later ended any hopes of a Schalke fightback.
