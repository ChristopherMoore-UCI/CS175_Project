At the congress new MDC leadership will be elected to prepare for general elections in which Tsvangirai will lock horns with President Robert Mugabe. Odinga, a fierce critic of Mugabe, was Kenya's opposition leader before joining President Mwai Kibaki in a 2008 power-sharing deal following contested elections that sparked tribal violence in that country. Tsvangirai and Mugabe formed a fragile coalition government in 2009 after a disputed, violent election in 2008. A similar deal was later agreed to in Zimbabwe by Tsvangirai and his long-time rival Mugabe. Let it be free and let it be peaceful," said Morgan Tsvangirai, speaking in Bulawayo -- about 450km south-west of Harare -- to his Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party supporters ahead of a congress set for Friday.
