Contacted by CNN, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman said the agency is looking for the lost shipment. After spending hours on the phone with the postal service, Kent sent a letter to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on Thursday asking for help. Her attorney, Norman Kent of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, accepted the pot for her and shipped it as next-day delivery through the U.S. Postal Service on March 17. In the letter, he wrote that he hopes "the DEA recognizes it is not in the public interest to have marijuana missing in the U.S. mails," and adds the need to "make a record of this loss in order to procure a new prescription." It was off by one digit and the shipment was sent to the post office in Santa Monica, California, about 850 miles away from Eugene, Oregon.
