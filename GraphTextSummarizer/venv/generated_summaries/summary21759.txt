"She has to be on very strong antibiotics for the next few days and then they will decide what kind of operation to go ahead with," Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, told HLN's "The Joy Behar Show" Monday. Zsa Zsa Gabor's doctors took "one last shot" at saving the ailing actress' leg with powerful antibiotics her publicist said Monday afternoon. Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, according to Von Anhalt. If the newest treatment at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center does not heal a "very deep" lesion in her lower leg, it will be amputated below the knee, according to spokesman John Blanchette. Gabor, whose 94th birthday is next month, has not been told that amputation is a possibility, Von Anhalt said.
