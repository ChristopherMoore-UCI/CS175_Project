We tasted the hope in the delicious meals we shared with young chefs who had just graduated from Haiti's Ecole Hoteliere -- their ambition and optimism the same as any chef you'd meet in New York or New Orleans or Paris. To look at us, you might not think we have much in common; one of us is a veteran Marine from New Orleans, the other a tattooed New Yorker with Mexican roots. We saw the inspiration in the eyes of women farmers who were beginning to chart their own course for the first time, reaping the benefits from the System of Rice Intensification, a groundbreaking way to grow rice that improves the quality of harvests and yields more rice while using less water, fertilizer, and other expensive inputs. Oxfam hoped we could  learn about the inspiring work being done in Haiti and share our own experience with sustainable food systems. Oxfam invited us to Haiti to meet some of the Haitian farmers and chefs who are planting seeds of hope in a country that has faced more obstacles than any community should rightly be expected to overcome.
