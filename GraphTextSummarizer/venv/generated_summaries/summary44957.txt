A helicopter airlift of some of the crew members aboard the Britannia Seaways was halted because of strong winds, said John Sjurso, a spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center of Southern Norway. -- The crew of a Danish cargo ship that caught fire off the coast of Norway was trapped on board after a rescue attempt Saturday was halted because of bad weather, authorities said. Sjurso said late Saturday the ship is still running under its own power. The fire began Saturday in the steering room of the Britannia Seaways, which was in the North Sea en route from Oslo to Bergen, Sjurso said. Crew members were fighting the fire, but it was not immediately known what equipment they had at their disposal to battle the flames, Sjurso said.
