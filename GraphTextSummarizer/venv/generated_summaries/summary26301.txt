'Nobody would talk' Howard Robinson, the real estate developer who has represented Apple at Santa Monica city meetings, has carefully avoided mentioning Apple by name. Interviews with almost two dozen people familiar with Apple Store negotiations say the Cupertino, California, company sometimes employs uncommon legal tactics, refuses to name itself in public documents and hearings, and has sworn city government officials to secrecy. The Santa Monica store episode also illustrates Apple's unusually covert way of doing business. But according to a person familiar with the plans who is bound by a nondisclosure agreement, Apple has already begun work on such a store in Santa Monica. The appeal failed, and Apple is not expected to face any more procedural hurdles in Santa Monica that could slow the store's development.
