Instead, he invited Twitter co-founder Biz Stone for a mock apology to Colbert himself, and -- offering a tepid "I never want this to happen again"-- shut down the Twitter account, @colbertreport. This is why Colbert, in persona, sometimes cites the existence of a "black friend" and why Jon Stewart regularly discusses issues of race with his "Senior Black Correspondent." The whole show was devoted to it, but it was the cold opening that people will remember: Colbert imagined a dystopian post-Report world. But instead of repudiating the tweet, Colbert on Monday night made further jokes about how the incident almost silenced "my message of core conservative principles mixed with youth-friendly product placement." Many of Colbert's defenders have been asking why Park and her followers should get to decide what Colbert can and cannot say?
