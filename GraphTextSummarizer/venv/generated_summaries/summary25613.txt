Pierson "maintains a zero tolerance policy regarding incidents of misconduct and continues to evaluate the best human capital practices and policies for the workforce," said U.S. Secret Service spokesman George Ogilvie, by way of announcing changes. Secret Service agents in the Special Operations Division are now barred from drinking alcohol within 12 hours of duty and 24 hours before the President arrives on location for a trip, a U.S. Secret Service official with knowledge of the rule change told CNN on Tuesday. The U.S. Secret Service has made some staffing and rule changes in the wake of recent incidents involving agents and alcohol in Amsterdam and in the Florida Keys. "These are isolated incidents of misconduct and we're working every day to correct our behavior," Pierson told reporters on Tuesday after leaving a closed meeting with top senators on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Also, a Secret Service officer in Florida was involved in a traffic accident and alcohol use was suspected.
