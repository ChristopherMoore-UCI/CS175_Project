READ MORE: Japanese PM Shinzo Abe's election gamble puts policies on the line Gamble Ultimately, Abe's election gamble will pay off if he can convince the average salaryman or woman that his economic policies will benefit ordinary Japanese. Abe called for the snap election last month, following news that the country had unexpectedly slipped into recession, dealing a blow to his much-vaunted "Abenomics" -- the stimulus and economic reform package he introduced since taking power in 2012. Japanese began voting Sunday in parliamentary elections described by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as a referendum on his flagship economic policies. Strange timing An election wasn't required until late 2016, which has led to considerable speculation as to why Abe, with a sizable majority in the lower house -- 295 out of the 475 seats -- would risk ceding power so early. "The election will be held to ask the public whether we will (move) forward with Abenomics or end it," Abe said when announcing the closure of parliament in November.
