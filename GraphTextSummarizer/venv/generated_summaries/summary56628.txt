"If we're going to solve the grand challenges of Africa it has to start here in Africa with us identifying and underscoring what they are," says Erik Hersman, founder of Nairobi's iHub tech hub and CEO of BRCK, and one of the four photo contest judges. The competition is part of IBM's $100 million Project Lucy initiative, which will employ Watson and other cognitive computing technologies to advance development and create business opportunities in Africa over the next 10 years. "I feel like a lot of African photographers have observed how those in Europe and the U.S. have photographed in Africa, and many us still use that as a template of how Africa should be captured. "It had the most vibrant colors, and it really summed up Africa to me," admits Matheka. Matheka, a former architect and one of the continent's most respected photographers, says the competition has also shown him how photography has grown in Africa.
