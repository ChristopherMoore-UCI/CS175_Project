See photos of the hole the landslide left in La Jolla Â» At least 111 homes were evacuated, but Sanders said residents would be allowed to return to 75 of those houses by early Thursday morning. Holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift, which earlier ruptured a water line, and according to some media reports, began cracking Soledad Mountain Road in July. Pat Abbott, a retired geological sciences professor at San Diego State University, told the Union-Tribune that Mount Soledad is made up of weak layers of rock and that the culprit in the landslide is nature. Authorities told KGTV that most residents were at work and only seven people were in their homes when the landslide occurred. More than 2,400 customers were briefly left without electricity, but most residents had their power restored by Thursday, KGTV reported.
