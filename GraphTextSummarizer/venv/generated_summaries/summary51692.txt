"This year it (the tomato price) changed completely to half a dinar ($0.70) a kilo," explained vegetable grower Abdulla Abu Saleh. For Abu Saleh, such concerns lead him to question the wisdom of continuing to grow vegetables if he cannot sell them. Tribal leaders like Nimer Al Fawwaz speak of Syrian refugees now making up nearly one out of every four residents of nearby towns. "It is difficult to go on with the business," said Muslih Ajal Massaeed, a Jordanian Wool Distributor. With little in the way of manufacturing in the rural areas, the government has encouraged vegetable farming.
