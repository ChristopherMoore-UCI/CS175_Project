Official figures released Thursday by the UK's Department of Health have revealed that swine flu will cause one in eight workers to stay off work in September, potentially crippling many businesses still struggling in the wake of the recession. The office of the wife of former British prime minister Tony Blair refused to comment Thursday on UK media reports that she has swine flu. Blair was reported to have contracted the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu, on Tuesday, according to the British Press Association and various media reports. Cherie Blair, wife of former British premier Tony Blair, is reportedly suffering from swine flu. Cherie Blair, who is a human rights lawyer, had been due to pick up an honorary degree at the Liverpool Hope University in north-west England Thursday.
