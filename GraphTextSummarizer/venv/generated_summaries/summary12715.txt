That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Even so, more than a month into the new academic year, fewer Iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year. "Iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education," says Touqan, the education minister. Iraqi students at the Shmisani school in Amman gather around a teacher. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them.
