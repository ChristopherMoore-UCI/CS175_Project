"These past two months have been the hardest times for all of us at AirAsia and for the families of QZ8501 passengers," AirAsia Indonesia CEO Sunu Widyatmoko said. That's the message out of Indonesia, where national search and rescue chief Bambang Soelistyo announced that the main search-and-recovery operation surrounding doomed commercial airliner AirAsia Flight 8501 officially ended Tuesday. Unlike Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared a year ago and still hasn't been located, there has been less mystery and more closure over Flight QZ8501. As of Tuesday, authorities had identified the bodies of 94 who had been on the AirAsia plane, with six other bodies still in Surabaya's Bhayangkara Hospital. He was referring to the nightmare that the airline and, especially, the loved ones of the 162 people on board the Airbus A320-200 jet have been experiencing since its crew lost contact with air traffic controllers on December 28.
