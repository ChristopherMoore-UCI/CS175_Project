The Cabinet includes moderate left political figures Michel Sapin as labor minister and Laurent Fabius as foreign minister. The Socialist leader selected moderates to serve as ministers of labor, economy, foreign affairs, defense and other posts. Pierre Moscovici will be minister of economy and finance, and his fellow moderate, Socialist Jean-Yves Le Drian, will be defense minister. Hollande, the country's first Socialist president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995, won an election this month against incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy. Officials with strong left-leaning tendencies were chosen as ministers of education, industry and environment.
