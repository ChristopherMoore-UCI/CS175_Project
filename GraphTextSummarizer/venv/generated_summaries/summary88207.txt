No one has claimed responsibility, but immediate suspicion fell on the militant Islamic group Boko Haram, which has carried out similar church attacks in the past. An eyewitness told CNN that the attackers were carrying sophisticated firearms and shot randomly at the members of the congregation gathered for Bible study Monday night. Among the dead was the pastor of the Deeper Life church in Okene, Lt. Col. Gabriel Olorunyomi said. -- Gunmen attacked a church in the central Nigerian state of Kogi, killing at least 19 people, a military official said Tuesday. Religious attacks have been on the rise in Nigeria recently.
