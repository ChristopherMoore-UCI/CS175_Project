Roma became the first team in Serie A history to win its opening 10 games of the season after a 1-0 victory over bottom feeder Chievo, a result that also restored the Giallorossi's five-point advantage at the top of the table over Juventus and Napoli. Atletico keeps pace Days after pledging his international future to Spain instead of Brazil -- the country of his birth -- Diego Costa scored again as Atletico Madrid beat Granada 2-1 to keep the pressure on Barcelona in La Liga. "What really makes me happy is the effort made by the players," Atletico manager Diego Simeone told the club website. Despite Lionel Messi's month-long scoring slump in the league, Barcelona beat city rival Celta Vigo 3-0 away on Tuesday to temporarily move four points ahead. Costa moved ahead of Cristiano Ronaldo in the scoring charts on 12 goals when he converted a penalty in the first half and ex Barcelona front man David Villa also found the back of the net from the spot in the second half.
