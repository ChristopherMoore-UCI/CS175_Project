One video shows what appears to be a group of Syrian security forces standing over dead bodies, making jokes and discussing planting weapons on them. The other activist, who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity, is in the United States and helps Syrian activists post videos online. Syrian state television aired video of Ibrahim making a statement at the time. Throughout the uprising in Syria, the Syrian government has described protesters as "armed criminals" and "terrorists," at times saying photos prove that the "criminals" were armed when security forces shot them. The incident took place in Daraa, which was under siege by Syrian security forces.
