"After five years of Hamas rule in Gaza, its criminal justice system reeks of injustice, routinely violates detainees' rights, and grants impunity to abusive security services," Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director for Human Rights Watch, said in an online posting Wednesday. -- Security forces under Hamas rule have tortured Gaza prisoners during the group's five years of rule, a new report said Wednesday. According to the report, "his mother said that Hamas authorities had prohibited the family from burying him, and that police beat her when she tried to hold his body during the interment." "There is ample evidence that Hamas security services are torturing people in custody with impunity and denying prisoners their rights," Stork said.
