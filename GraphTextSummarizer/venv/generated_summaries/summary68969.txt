Two Red Cross officials and 14 delegates from South Korea crossed the armed border into North Korea on Friday morning to meet with counterparts, according to the Yonhap news agency. -- Representatives for North and South Korea agreed that October would be a good time to do another round of reunions for families separated by the Korean war, the South Korean Unification Ministry said Friday. After leaving his son and daughters when they were babies during the Korean War, he was able to hold the hands of his North Korean children last September. Yoon Ki-Dal, 88, of South Korea thought such a moment would never come. About 10,000 people applied to take part in a similar reunion last year, but fewer than 200 families were allowed to participate.
