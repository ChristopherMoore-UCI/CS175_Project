-- Substitute Didier Drogba missed a last minute penalty as Premier League champions Chelsea drew 1-1 at rivals Tottenham in a thrilling London derby on Sunday. Tottenham remain in fifth place after the draw, a further four points behind, with Bolton in sixth after defeating Blackburn 2-1 on Sunday despite the second-half dismissal of midfielder Mark Davies. The Gunners lead Manchester City on goal difference, with Manchester United and Chelsea just a point behind in third and fourth -- in the closest title race in recent seasons. The other match on Sunday saw second-from-bottom Wolverhampton improve their chances of avoiding the drop, as Stephen Hunt's goal gave them a 1-0 victory over West Midlands rivals Birmingham. Strike partner Jermain Defoe looked just offside when collecting a long ball, but play was allowed to continue and his ball into the box was well controlled in one touch by Russian Pavlyuchenko, before his second touch found the bottom corner of Peter Cech's net.
