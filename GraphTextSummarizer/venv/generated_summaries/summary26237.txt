We've also seen a number of prominent women -- including Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn and radio talk show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger -- who have questioned whether the 44-year-old white mother of five children should be vice president, considering she has five children, including a special needs child. When you watch TV and hear folks talk about Wal-Mart moms or small, rural towns, they are talking about white Americans. That was one of the arguments we heard during the Democratic primaries when Obama enjoyed overwhelming support from African-Americans -- to the tune of 90-plus percent -- while Sen. Hillary Clinton had major female support, largely white, in the range of 65 to 70 percent. Roland Martin says Americans need to rise above issues of race, age and gender when they vote. The best folks to challenge Americans on their hang-ups regarding age, race and gender aren't the AARP, NAACP or NOW.
