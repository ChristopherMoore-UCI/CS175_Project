A provision in the just-passed FAA reauthorization bill requires TSA chief John Pistole to approve airport requests to privatize their screeners unless he determines it would harm security. -- One year after the TSA administrator brought efforts to privatize airport screening to a virtual standstill, Congress has kick-started the program, opening the door for other airports to "opt out" of TSA screening. At a hearing Monday on the issue, Democrats lamented the provision in the FAA reauthorization, saying it signals a return to the days before the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, when private companies provided airport security. That is likely to open the doors to further privatization, since Pistole has said private screening and government screening is "comparable. Republicans depicted the current system as inefficient, and said the bloat extends to the TSA oversight of privatized airports.
