"Mr. Manieri was one of the last people ... that we know of to see Father Everitt," said Waveland Police Chief James Varnell. Judd said Manieri was booked in the Polk County Jail for Tuesday night and Waveland police could take Manieri into custody as soon as Wednesday. Manieri and the family arrived in Polk County, about an hour southwest of Orlando, early Tuesday and stopped at a Days Inn, Judd said. Sunday, Manieri and Everitt argued in the Waveland house, according to the confession, Judd said. Everitt was going to hire Manieri to do a construction project there, Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said.
