Judge Steve Dozier set bond at $25,000 for Boyd, who police said "is expected to surrender." Vanderbilt spokeswoman Beth Fortune said Friday that in light of the charge, Boyd has been suspended from the school's football team "pursuant to the athletic department conduct policy." "All of these allegations, including those brought today, are deeply troubling, and we take them very seriously," Fortune said in a statement. Police: Ex-Vanderbilt football players in custody facing rape charges Police said each of the four men was charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. The case revolving around an alleged rape inside a Vanderbilt University dorm ballooned Friday, when police announced indictments against three more young men, one of them a standout on the Commodores' football team. As of late Friday afternoon, authorities in California were still trying to locate Quinzio. "They are alleged to have tampered with certain electronic evidence in the case," police said, without giving specifics.
