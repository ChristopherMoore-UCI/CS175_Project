Their work will try to determine just how fast the ice is melting and what will be the effects on weather patterns, ocean currents and marine life. Scientists are using new radar technology to measure the thickness of sea ice without the need to dig holes. For "Extreme Science" Cousteau will see first-hand how they operate in brutal sub-zero temperatures, severe storms and high winds, collecting data on water and ice while living in a tent village on the ice. And while he's there between March 23 and April 4 he'll try to answer your questions about life at the top of the world and how the work there can impact everyone's lives. Cousteau, 31, reported last year for CNN International on the Gulf oil spill and has hosted green-themed specials.
