The attacks paired bomb blasts with shootings at various sites including police stations, the passport office, state security headquarters and the immigration office. Harsh police tactics led to an armed uprising and the arrest of Yusuf, who later died in police custody. The following year, Boko Haram re-emerged as a more radicalized, insurgent-style group, staging assassinations and attacks against not only government targets, but also churches and even a beer garden. In 2009, Nigerian police forces moved to crack down on Boko Haram. In December, Jonathan declared a state of emergency in four northern states after a series of Christmas Day attacks on churches blamed on Boko Haram.
