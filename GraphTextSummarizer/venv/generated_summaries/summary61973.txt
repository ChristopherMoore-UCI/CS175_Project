Wyngaard said the district has been in conversations with the Anti-Defamation League about future training programs for students and staff. Students in three Albany High School English classes received the assignment, which was due Wednesday. Earlier this year in New York City, a math homework assignment asked fourth grade students to tally the number of slaves on a ship, sparking outrage among parents and administrators. -- An upstate school system apologized Friday after students got a writing assignment in which they were instructed to prove their loyalty to Nazi Germany by arguing Jews are "evil" and the source of that government's problems. In the assignment, students were to pretend the educator was a member of the Nazi government.
