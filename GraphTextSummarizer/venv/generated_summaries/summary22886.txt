We call it the 'new normal,'" said Lynn Feinberg, senior policy adviser for AARP. The report estimated the overall economic value of family caregiving at $450 billion, based on 42.1 million caregivers 18 or older providing an average of 18.4 hours of care per week. "There is a greater awareness about these issues and the joys and struggles of family caregivers," Feinberg said. "Family caregivers can make that possible even from a distance." Options range from independent living communities to personal care homes to facilities for memory and dementia care, she said.
