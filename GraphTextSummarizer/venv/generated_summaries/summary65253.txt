An overwhelming majority of first-time voters, including the Amans, voted for Sen. Barack Obama over Sen. John McCain by a margin of 69 to 31 percent, CNN exit polls show. Gillian McGrath, a Temple University senior who is studying social work, hopes Obama will make good on his promise to implement funding for social services so that she can do her job -- if she finds one. "I expect Obama will restore the American dream and create economic security by creating new jobs in new fields like alternative energy, science and math, global warming and health care. Patel said Obama campaigned on issues that were important to him: working with allies on security issues, energy concerns, civil rights issues like closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and withdrawing troops from Iraq. Frias said that for minorities like her, Obama was a sympathetic voice who understood the pervasive effect of poverty, unemployment and lack of social services in their communities.
