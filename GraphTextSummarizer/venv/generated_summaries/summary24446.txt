-- U.S. raids in pursuit of two terrorists over the weekend threw a question surrounding President Obama into the spotlight: Does he have a guiding doctrine for foreign policy? Yes to special ops, no to conventional wars "The two raids over the weekend show that President Obama remains very comfortable deploying special operations forces in countries the United States is not at war with as a means to combat terrorist groups, just as he is comfortable with the use of CIA drones for the same purpose in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen," says CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen. " How Syria fits in Both Gerges and Brannen believe President Obama was reluctant to take military action against Syria, even though he pushed reluctant lawmakers and the American public to support his call for strikes. And, he says, Obama boxed himself in by having warned Syrian President Bashar al-Assad that use of chemical weapons would be a "red line." "Beyond al Qaeda, there is no Obama Doctrine," he says.
