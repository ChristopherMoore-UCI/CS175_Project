-- Jacqueline Mars, a co-owner of the candy empire of the same name, was involved in a car crash Friday near her home in Northern Virginia that killed an 86-year-old woman. Mars and her two brothers privately own the company started by their grandfather that makes such universal sweet-tooth staples as Snickers, Milky Way, and M&M's. Mars was driving alone in her 2004 Porsche SUV when "for unknown reasons the vehicle crossed the center line and struck an eastbound 2013 Chrysler minivan occupied by six people," according to the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office. The driver of the minivan was transported to a Falls Church hospital, where she was in listed in critical condition on Monday. Forbes says Jacqueline Mars has a net worth of $20.5 billion, making her the third richest woman in the country and the 15th wealthiest person in the United States.
