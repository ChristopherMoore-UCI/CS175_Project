This week, authorities say Hartman, 62, made it through a screening checkpoint at Mineta San Jose International Airport without a ticket and boarded a Southwest Airlines flight bound for LAX. " Hartman has been described by authorities as a serial stowaway, who has repeatedly tried to board flights to Hawaii at San Francisco International Airport without a ticket. "Airport Police officers did not observe Hartman attempting to purchase an airline ticket and she did not have a ticket or boarding pass in her possession when arrested," the airport said in a statement. She was seen earlier in the day arriving at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), where she spent about an hour "scouting out multiple passenger terminals before being arrested. Airport Police Chief Patrick Gannon said in the statement that flyers were distributed with Hartman's picture on it.
