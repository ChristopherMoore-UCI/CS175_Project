Uttar Pradesh, with 200 million people, is India's most populous state and ranks fourth across all states and union territories in rape crimes. While the total number of rape cases in India registered a 12 percent increase between 2010 and 2012, the conviction rate declined from 17.1 percent to 14.3 percent, resulting in fewer convictions in 2012. A 2014 report by Dasra, a Mumbai based philanthropic foundation says that almost 70 percent of women in India face some form of domestic violence. After the infamous December 2012 rape and death of a physiotherapy student in New Delhi, the rape of a photojournalist in Mumbai in August last year and the rapes of several foreign visitors to India, the specter of a crisis haunts India. In the past few weeks, the north of India has experienced especially brutal violence, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh.
