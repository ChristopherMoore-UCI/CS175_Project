Langer won his first Green Jacket in 1985 -- becoming only the second European player to win the tournament after Seve Ballesteros -- before going on to claim a second title in 1993. He was also an integral part of Europe Ryder Cup team during their resurgence during the 1980s and 1990s, making a total of ten appearances as a player and one as captain in 2004 when Europe won by their biggest margin in the competition's history. Last December, Langer was crowned Champions Tour Player of the Year after claiming five titles during the 2010 season. The operation to repair ligament damage sustained in a cycling accident will keep Langer out of action for up to eight weeks, bringing to an end an unbroken chain of 27 appearances at the Augusta National Golf Club. In 2007, Langer joined the PGA Champions Tour and has become one of it's most successful players winning a total of 14 titles.
