" CNN's Brian Byrnes, Javier Doberti, Patricia Janiot and Fernando del Rincon contributed to this report. There were no complications during the 3 1/2 -hour operation to remove Fernandez's thyroid gland, presidential spokesman Alfredo Scoccimarro said. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and has a high survival rate, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. More than 95% of adults with papillary thyroid carcinoma survive at least 10 years, according to a description on the library's website. During Fernandez's surgery, doctors also likely took tissue samples from her lymph nodes to examine whether the cancer has spread, Washington-based oncologist Dr. Elmer Huerta told CNN.
