The new rule covers acetaminophen, the popular pain medicine also known as Tylenol, and a class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs. "Acetaminophen and NSAIDs are commonly used drugs for both children and adults because they are effective in reducing fevers and relieving minor aches and pain, such as headaches and muscle aches," said Dr. Charles Ganley, director of nonprescription drugs in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. The agency says the use of blood thinning drugs or steroids while taking NSAIDs can also increase the risk of internal bleeding. --   Over-the-counter painkillers and fever reducers will now carry new labels warning consumers of the potential risks of liver damage and internal bleeding associated with the drugs, according to a final ruling Tuesday by the Food and Drug Administration. "This ruling will not only help protect consumers using OTC pain medication on a periodic basis," APF said, "But will be especially meaningful for people suffering from chronic pain who may face co-morbid conditions and are taking OTC pain medication along with their prescribed pain medication."
