Attention Hollywood cinematographers: Student council Vice President Bryan Urraca and senior class President Johan Cruz shot the video in a single take. It's the joyous Scot Pankey, a real-life theater teacher at A. Maceo Smith New Tech High School in Dallas. Which high school teacher would assign his students the Mark Ronson/Bruno Mars can't-stop-dancing-to-it hit "Uptown Funk"? "I heard the song before Christmas and fell in love with it," Pankey told the Dallas Morning News. Don't think fictional "Glee" choir director Will Schuester.
