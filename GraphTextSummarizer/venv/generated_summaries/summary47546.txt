-- New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an Independent, joins several leading Democrats, Republicans and other Independent political leaders in the launch of a new group that hopes to find non-partisan solutions to some of the nation's problems and to impact the next Congressional session. Led by columnist and CNN contributor John Avlon, Republican political consultant Mark McKinnon, Democratic consultant Kiki McLean, and veteran Democratic fundraiser Nancy Jacobson who conceived the idea, the No Labels group aims to look at politics through a new prism and wants to urge political leaders not to abandon their political labels but set them aside in order help find solutions. As families struggle to get by, they have seen little but partisan gridlock, political pandering and legislative influence-peddling," Bloomberg said as he outlined steps to tackle unemployment, spur job creation and push growth. Polls after the mid-term election show Americans want political leaders to reach across the political aisle to get things done. " Bloomberg grabbed national headlines and renewed talk he might mount an independent run for the presidency in 2012  with a high profile speech last week saying government needs to chart "a middle way" to help fix the economy and criticized the partisanship in today's government.
