There's nothing more exciting for Hollywood than movies about young people trying to upset the system. But although the real-life rescue thriller is nominated for Best Motion Picture, Affleck himself failed to get a nomination for Best Director -- seen as a slight by many critics and an omission that could affect the film's chances for the big award. "Zero Dark Thirty" Kathryn Bigelow was the first woman to win an Oscar for Best Director with "The Hurt Locker" in 2008, a film about a U.S. Bomb squad in the Iraq war. This 1939 film, which won one Oscar and was nominated for 10 others, is probably the one movie you've heard grandparents talk about when they complain that today's Hollywood isn't like what it used to be. When "All The President's Men" -- which won four Oscars and was nominated for four more -- came out in 1976, just about everyone had heard of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the Washington Post reporters responsible for uncovering the Watergate scandal and forcing the resignation of President Richard Nixon.
