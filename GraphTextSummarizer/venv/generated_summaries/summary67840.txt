Authorities will forward their information to prosecutors, Judd said, but are "not going to file any charges [against Jones] at this point, because we don't see any reason to arrest Mr. Jones," Judd said. Police said McCormick accompanied Phillips as he attempted to steal the SUV from a barn in an orange grove near Wahneta, Florida, before daylight Tuesday. Phillips was arrested late Tuesday in Polk County, near Lakeland, after a day on the run. Phillips, however, faces charges because police allege he was committing felony grand theft auto at the time of McCormick's death. It appears, at this point in the investigation, Mr. Jones was completely, legally justified in his actions.
