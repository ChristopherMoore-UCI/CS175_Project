The thumbs of two-time Formula 1 champion Fernando Alonso are now insured for 10 million euros ($13.3 million) as part of a new campaign by Spanish-based bank Santander. The Ferrari ace will be starring in a series of ads for Santander's new insurance campaign, which kicked off Monday near Madrid. He led a Ferrari 1-2 at the opening round of this year's championship in Bahrain, but has been less successful in the two latest races, lying third in the title race ahead of next weekend's Spanish Grand Prix. He moved to McLaren for the 2007 season, but an intense rivalry on and off the track with teammate Lewis Hamilton led to Alonso leaving the team after one season. Alonso's thumbs are both essential to F1 driving and "a sign of victory and that everything is under control and well-protected," the bank said in announcing the new deal.
