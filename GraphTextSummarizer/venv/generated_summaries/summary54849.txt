Bethany Storro was being interviewed by detectives, and whether she will be charged will be up to prosecutors, police said. -- A 28-year-old woman who said an unknown assailant threw a cup of caustic liquid in her face has admitted her injuries were self-inflicted, Vancouver, Washington, police said Thursday. "God is watching over me," Storro, of Vancouver, told CNN affiliate KATU in Portland, Oregon, at the time. "She is extremely upset," said police Commander Marla Schuman. In many ways it got bigger than she expected." Police would not speculate on Storro's motives, only saying the August 30 incident did not occur as she described and that there were discrepancies in her account, including wearing sunglasses in the evening.
