On the foggy, icy Oregon interstate, Kaleb Whitby plowed into the back of a jackknifed semi truck, flipping his pickup. Whitby was part of a 26-vehicle pileup Saturday on Interstate 84 outside Baker City, Oregon. Whitby told CNN's "New Day" that he was a man of faith. "When the second truck hit my back end, it spun my bed underneath the first trailer that I hit and continued to swing my nose around, and I guess put my nose underneath the second trailer. Before trying to wiggle out, Whitby decided to let the sound of traffic subside "to make sure things were OK."
