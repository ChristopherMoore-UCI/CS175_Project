Elsener said the strength of Switzerland's currency, the franc, had eaten into margins, forcing the company to be "more innovative than our competitors in the rest of the world." While the products may seem diverse, there are commonalities, Victorinox chief executive Carl Elsener told CNN's Richard Quest. Alongside socks, time pieces and fragrances are on offer. Elsener said this tactic extinguished the fear among Swiss companies that the franc would go to parity with the euro. He said "This was a big relief for most Swiss companies who depend on exportation."
