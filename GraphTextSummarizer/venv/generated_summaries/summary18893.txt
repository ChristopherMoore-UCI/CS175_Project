New York Hilton Midtown, the biggest hotel in New York City, with nearly 2,000 rooms, says it will eliminate room service starting this summer. "Travelers are evolving to the point where they understand hotels to be full service even if they don't offer room service." In 2012, room service revenue represented 1.2% of total hotel revenue, down from 1.3% the year before, according to an industry survey by PKF Hospitality Research. "Like most full-service hotels, New York Hilton Midtown has continued to see a decline in traditional room service requests over the last several years as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve," a New York Hilton Midtown representative said. Mark Woodworth, president of the hotel consulting firm PKF Hospitality Research, said this type of change is in line with what has been evolving for quite some time in the lodging industry.
