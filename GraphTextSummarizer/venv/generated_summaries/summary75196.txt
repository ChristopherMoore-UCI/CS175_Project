Devon Barrington Ward of Change Atlanta said the Jack City gang has no place in the Pittsburgh neighborhood. "I actually go back because I wanted to see who they were." Atlanta police said the incident occurred February 4. "The actions depicted in the video are appalling and unacceptable in our community, and we encourage anyone with information about this video to contact the FBI or Atlanta police," Yates said. State Rep. Simone Bell, who is openly gay, told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB she hopes this case will pave the way for hate-crime legislation in Georgia. A video circulated online shows three men punching and kicking White after he stepped out of the JVC Grocery and Deli in southwest Atlanta's Pittsburgh neighborhood.
