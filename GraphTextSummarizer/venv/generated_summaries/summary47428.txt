" Older suspect grew increasingly religious, analysis shows The manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev lasted all day Friday and left Boston streets deserted as police asked everyone to stay indoors. The days-long drama that gripped Boston -- and the world -- began when two homemade bombs made from pressure cookers exploded 12 seconds apart near the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon. Tsarnaev attended classes and dorm parties and went to the gym while the rest of Boston came to a tense standstill. A student at the school told The Boston Globe that she saw Tsarnaev at a party Wednesday night that was attended by some of his friends from intramural soccer. Officers spotted Tsarnaev poking through the tarp covering the boat, and a shootout erupted, Deveau said.
