The cub was found under a bush near West 69th Street and West Drive in the park, and appeared to show signs of trauma with an injury to its side and possible lacerations, police said. The person alerted a Central Park Conservancy worker who then called the police, according to Central Park Conservancy spokeswoman Elizabeth Kaledin. The only bears known to inhabit New York's Central Park are at its zoo -- so how did a dead bear cub end up under a bush? Neither police nor park officials had an answer for that late Monday, hours after a morning dog walker discovered the carcass of a 3-foot-tall bear cub. The carcass was taken to the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in Albany for a necropsy, according to police.
