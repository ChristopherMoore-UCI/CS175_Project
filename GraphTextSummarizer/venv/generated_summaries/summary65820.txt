Opponents of President Obama attack his use of language as elitist, professorial or passionless. In other words, Palin stands in good company. The great lady would lend her name to the confusion of language, as when she meant to say pinnacle but referred to another character as "the very pineapple of politeness." John Kennedy's Harvard dialect created a cottage industry of comic impressionists. I'm for more fun and more color in political speech, including the occasional swing and miss that turns into a home run.
