"Mother Teresa was a citizen of India," said Vishnu Prakash, spokesman for the country's external affairs ministry. But India, the land where she made her life's work, has made it clear that Mother Teresa, buried in the heart of Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta), will not be leaving her final resting place. " Mother Teresa, pictured in 1997, lived and worked in Kolkata from 1931 until her death. " Mother Teresa was born as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu to ethnic Albanian parents in Skopje, Macedonia, on August 26, 1910. Pope John Paul II beatified Mother Teresa in 2003 and she could be canonized by her centennial birthday next year -- a saint in the heavens whose resting place on Earth remains a devilish debate.
