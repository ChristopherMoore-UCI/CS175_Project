McGinty says other entries contain anticipation of abuse yet to come, including Castro's death threats. Ochberg says that Knight, in addition to serving as a de facto doctor to Berry, also "interceded when Castro sought to abuse Gina." Castro, Ochberg writes, "turned truth and commonsense on its head and fed that to his captives." " Castro "appeared to be evolving in an ever more dangerous direction," Ochberg writes, "capturing younger and younger women, telling his captives he was hunting for replacements." The entries show Berry at once seeking to "soothe her mother as she prayed for her own deliverance and the health of her little girl." Berry's daughter, fathered by Castro, was born on Christmas Day of 2006.
