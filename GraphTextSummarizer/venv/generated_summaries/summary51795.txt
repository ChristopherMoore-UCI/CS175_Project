-- Prince Albert of Monaco will tie the knot to former South African Olympic swimmer Charlene Wittstock next July, the palace announced Thursday. Neither child is in line for the throne under Monaco law, which says succession passes only to direct legitimate descendants. " Like his fiancee, Albert is also an Olympian, having competed in five Olympic Winter Games -- from Calgary in 1988 to Salt Lake City in 2002 -- in bobsledding. Albert has two children from previous relationships -- a 6-year-old son born to Nicole Coste, a flight attendant from Togo, and an 18-year-old daughter born to American Tamara Rotolo, a former waitress. Albert was formally invested as Monaco's ruler following the death of his father in 2005.
