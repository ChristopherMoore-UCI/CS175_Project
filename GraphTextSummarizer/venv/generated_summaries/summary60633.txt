Shahid Afridi, Pakistan's one-day captain, and the country's leading umpire Aleem Dar have also run separate campaigns for flood relief, raising millions of rupees. In recent weeks, the worst floods in the country's history have killed 1600 people and left 20 million without homes in the north-west and southern regions of Pakistan. Having beaten England by four wickets in the third Test at the Oval last week -- leaving Pakistan 2-1 behind in the series with one Test left to play -- the nation's top cricketers offered $54,400 in a bid to help their stricken countrymen. The contribution to the flood relief effort, which was announced by the Pakistan Cricket Board, is the latest in a number of fund-raising efforts aimed at helping those who have been affected by the disaster in recent weeks. This would be the first international cricket that has taken place in Pakistan since March 2009, following the terror attacks on the touring Sri Lanka side.
