The brief rounds of fighting near the Ta Kwai temple involved small arms weapons, said Col. Prawit Hukaew, a regional Thai army spokesman. Thailand calls the temples Ta Kwai and Ta Muen, while Cambodia calls them Ta Krabey and Ta Moan. Fighting along the turbulent border has raged since April 22 as the two sides accuse each other of trying to seize ancient temples. Fighting may be a result of Cambodian soldiers not being aware of the cease-fire set Thursday, the spokesman said. Cambodia's government spokesman could not be reached for comment.
