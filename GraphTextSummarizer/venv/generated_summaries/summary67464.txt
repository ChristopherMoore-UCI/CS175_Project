It has been 150 years since President Abraham Lincoln got up in front of thousands of people in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to dedicate the Soldiers' National Cemetery at a turning point in the Civil War. That, and people tend to remember the beginnings of speeches, Cornelius said. In some cities, people could buy commemorative event pamphlets that contained the speech, and key phrases were incorporated into Lincoln's 1864 election posters and memorials after his death. We still remember Kennedy's delivery of lines like, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." Lincoln was able to get straight to the point and deliver a punchy speech in part because he came after Edward Everett's marathon presentation about the war, explains James Cornelius, curator of the Lincoln Collection in the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. Maybe that's why people can't help but post the speech on social media, 150 years after the fact.
