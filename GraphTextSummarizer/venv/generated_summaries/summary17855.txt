Wong Fei Hung (Once Upon a Time in China) (Hark Tsui, 1991) Part Chinese history, part gripping kung fu movie, this eastern epic has Jet Li demonstrating his talents as the eponymous hero who stands up to invading foreign forces in 19th century China. Great game; terrible film. It spawned a spate of copycat films, while thousands of children signed up to after-school karate; everyone now knows how to defend themselves by waxing on or off and that the best fighting move is obviously The Crane. Once described as "the best kung fu football film of all time," this is one of the more ridiculous films of the genre. Armed with a limitless arsenal of martial arts moves, Li takes on masses of gun-toting, badly acting opponents.
