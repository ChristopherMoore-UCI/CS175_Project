If and when Love's memoir finally arrives through William Morrow at Harper Collins, she promises it will focus on her battles with drug addiction, her "tragic romance" with Kurt Cobain, her relationships with Billy Corgan and Trent Reznor, and her early years as a stripper. RS: Courtney Love wrote letters of apology over Springsteen diss When Love first discussed her memoir with Rolling Stone in June 2013, she had high hopes for the book, citing Patti Smith's "Just Kids" and Russell Brand's "My Booky Wook" as influences. For over a year, the Hole singer has been penning a memoir with Rolling Stone writer Anthony Bozza. Love also told Paper she hopes to reunite Hole's classic lineup of Eric Erlandson, Patty Schemel and Melissa Auf der Maur at some point in 2015. While Love originally told Rolling Stone the book would cover her life up until 2008, she's since subtracted a few years from the tome.
