The Supreme Court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government: The government cannot sue for defamation. Phi Kappa Psi would likely argue that the "small group" exception fits it perfectly: Even if the individual members were not identified by name, the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members, who have suffered by their association with the group. The next question is: Can UVA, Phi Kappa Psi or any of the other fraternities on campus sue for defamation? True statements cannot be defamatory. Defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group's individual members, for the most part.
