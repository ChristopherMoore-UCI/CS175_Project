Pope John Paul II was not always vocal or strident about the situation in Poland or how it should change, but his return to his homeland in 1979 as pope seemed to summon the confidence Polish people always knew they had. All comment on Poland's independence and prosperity and how Pope John Paul II seems still to be the guardian of their freedom. Sister Benedykta tells me Pope John Paul II made patriotism part and parcel of the fourth commandment, honor and love thy parents. A papal museum dedicated to the life of Pope John Paul II sits prominently on the square, packed with visitors from all over the world. His enthusiasm for his faith and his country radiates through this rural town in southern Poland.
