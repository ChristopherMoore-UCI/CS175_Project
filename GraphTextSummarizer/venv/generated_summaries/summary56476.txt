" Prison authorities told RIA Novosti that Tolokonnikova was blackmailing them for denying her request for special treatment, but her husband told Russian media this week that a guard had refused to give her water and grabbed her by the arms, refusing to let go. Doctors ordered that Nadezhda Tolokonnikova be placed in the medical ward of a penal colony in Mordovia, southeast of Moscow, where she is serving a two-year sentence, reported RIA Novosti, citing the Russian penitentiary service. Tolokonnikova and two other band members were imprisoned last year for "hooliganism" after Pussy Riot performed a "punk prayer" critical of then-Prime Minister, now President, Vladimir Putin at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. "I am going on hunger strike and refusing to participate in colony slave labor," she wrote. Her requests for parole and a prison transfer recently denied, a member of the punk rock collective Pussy Riot was hospitalized amid a hunger strike Friday, according to Russian state-run media.
