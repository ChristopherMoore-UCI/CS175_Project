With that, authorities said, Ryan Dougherty, sister Lee Grace Dougherty, 29; and half-brother Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26, began a crime spree that included a bank robbery in Georgia and the attempted murder of a Florida police officer. "I am proud to say today we won," said Sheriff Chris Nocco of Pasco County, Florida, where one incident occurred earlier this month. According to a timeline of events that officials provided, Ryan Dougherty was sentenced August 1 in Volusia County, Florida, to 10 years' probation and two years of community control monitoring for convictions on two counts of sending harmful information to a minor. "It was going to happen somewhere," Pueblo County Sheriff Kirk Taylor said. Last week, Ryan Edward Dougherty, 21, texted, "There's a time for all of us to die" after he was sentenced in Florida on a criminal charge, according to a Florida sheriff's office.
