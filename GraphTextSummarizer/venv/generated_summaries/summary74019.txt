They split up, leaving one officer on the road to direct arriving first responders while Nelson and a fellow officer ditched their gunbelts and their radios and clambered aboard a span of the bridge that had tumbled to the river, carrying a still-undetermined number of vehicles and people with it. But, unable to reach victims from there, he crossed to the north side of the site, where he helped other first responders carry people from the water. "I don't think anybody quite expected the scene we encountered," he said at a news conference featuring first responders. As Nelson and Hick were toiling, firefighter and diver Shanna Hanson arrived on the north side, where, with just a rope tied around her waist, she dove repeatedly into the water, searching vehicles for possible survivors. Ed Nelson, 55, and two fellow police officers were among the first to arrive at the south side of the Interstate 35W bridge that rose 60 feet above the Mississippi River.
