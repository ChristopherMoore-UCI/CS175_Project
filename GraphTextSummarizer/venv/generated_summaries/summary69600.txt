Agrimonde's authors suggest that by consuming 25% less in developed countries, developing regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, could increase consumption by 30%. "These fears are strongly related to the periods of food price volatility in 2007, 2008 and today," says Sandrine Paillard, deputy delegate in charge of foresight at INRA. "Of course, it does not mean that what can be 'spared' in the rich countries could directly be used to feed population in developing countries," explains Paillard. "The main challenge will be in the rapid scaling up of these experiences, through knowledge dissemination and strong public policies, especially in developing countries," says Paillard. "(They) are also sustained by players who have interests in keeping our agro-industrial farming systems unchanged, in focusing on the goal of increasing yields even at the expense of the preservation of the environment and natural resources."
