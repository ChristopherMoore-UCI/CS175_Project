In early 2000, shortly after Al Gore beat Bill Bradley by a too-close-for-comfort four points in the state's first-in-the-nation primaries, Ray Buckley, then a New Hampshire state legislator, swung through Washington to have breakfast with a friend in the Clinton administration. In 2008, when Hillary Clinton trailed Barack Obama by double digits in the lead up to the New Hampshire primary, she teared up at a Portsmouth coffee shop as she told a voter who asked how she was faring on the trail, "I just don't want to see us fall backwards. In 1992, just a few days after a tabloid broke a story about Bill Clinton's affair with an Arkansas state employee named Gennifer Flowers, a surprise second place finish in the New Hampshire primary kept Clinton's presidential prospects alive. He famously declared that January evening, "New Hampshire has made Bill Clinton the comeback kid," and went on to win the state in the general election as well. New Hampshire has always been friendly to the Clintons and they're not going to neglect the state as Hillary Clinton eyes another presidential run.
