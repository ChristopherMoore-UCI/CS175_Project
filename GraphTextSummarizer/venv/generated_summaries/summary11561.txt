The attack took place about four nautical miles off Bonny Island, said Lt. Col. Timothy Antigha of the military Joint Task Force (JTF) in the Niger Delta. The freed sailors were on their way to Bonny Island, where their ship is currently anchored off the coast of the southern Nigerian state of Rivers. -- Nigerian gunmen on Sunday released 12 sailors who ship was attacked two days earlier off the country's coast, a spokesman for the Nigerian military said. Pirates had boarded a German-flagged ship off the coast of Nigeria on Friday night and took the foreigners hostage, the country's military said. The kidnappers later abandoned the ship and it was retrieved by the Nigerian navy.
