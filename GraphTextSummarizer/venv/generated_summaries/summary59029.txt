-- A suicide bomber blew up a booby-trapped car, killing three soldiers and wounding four others at an army checkpoint in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, according to the National News Agency (NNA). He said: "Operations of the sort will not affect the crucial political decision taken to combat terrorism and all forms of security breach," according to NNA. "This [attack] proves that terrorism is, beyond any doubt, the enemy of all, without exception," it said, according to NNA. A group operating under the name Free Sunni Brigade in Baalbek claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter. Lebanese Prime Minister Tammam Salam condemned the attack on the Army post as "a repugnant terrorist act."
