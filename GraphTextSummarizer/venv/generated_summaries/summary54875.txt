Fire rages at the site of a tanker crash and overpass collapse on I-75 north of Detroit, Michigan, Wednesday. -- A collision involving two big-rigs and a car Wednesday caused an explosion that sent flames and clouds of smoke billowing and collapsed a highway overpass just north of Detroit, Michigan. One of the tankers was traveling on the Interstate 75 about 8:30 p.m. in Hazel Park, near the Nine-Mile overpass, when the collision caused an explosion, said Lt. Shannon Simms of the Michigan State Police. Hazel Park is about 10 miles north of downtown Detroit. "I just saw a huge ball of flame go up when I was at the red light, just went up in flame," said witness Mary Greib.
