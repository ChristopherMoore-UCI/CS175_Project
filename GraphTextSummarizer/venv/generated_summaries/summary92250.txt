It was a terrible sight," Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear told reporters, describing his visit to the tornado-ravaged town of West Liberty. In Henryville, Indiana, about 20 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, an EF-4 tornado -- with sustained winds of between 166 mph and 200 mph, putting it in the top 2% of tornadoes in terms of its strength -- struck a school complex. More than 400 National Guard troops were deployed in Kentucky, while 250 more were dispatched in Indiana, according to state officials. Meanwhile, state officials were preparing as forecasters predicted rain and snow would hit parts of Kentucky on Sunday night, Beshear said. By the time the powerful storm system faded, 39 were dead: 21 in Kentucky, 13 in Indiana, three in Ohio and one each in Alabama and Georgia.
