The TSA must promise to never go beyond the policies of the Amtrak Police Department, he said, and to be certain that Amtrak police are present whenever VIPR teams take any action on Amtrak property or trains. A great deal of credit for VIPR improvement should go to Amtrak's police chief, John O'Connor, who was so outraged about an incident in Savannah, Georgia, in February 2011 that he angrily threw VIPR teams off Amtrak property until they learned how not to make fools of themselves. But the funniest thing happened to VIPR teams, according to railroad officials. Perhaps the best solution is to have Amtrak and the railroads continue what they've been doing: training VIPR teams, keeping them under control and letting them know there will be trouble if they do anything dumb. For reasons that have never been publicly explained, a squad of VIPR agents showed up at a Savannah Amtrak station one day and literally took over without the knowledge or approval of the Amtrak Police Department.
