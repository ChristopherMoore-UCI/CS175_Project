We asked Sara Reddy — the fearless Honey Boo Boo exec producer who counts this task as one of her responsibilities — to take us into her strange world of TV transcription. Honey Boo Boo "She doesn't talk as fast as the older girls and her mom, and she also has this very deliberate delivery that she was just born with, and she sells every line that she says," says Reddy. Reddy was raised in Southern California, not the South. "Most people think of Southern accents as having this drawl that's really slow and deliberate, but with this family it's the opposite," says Reddy. The subtitles require 15 to 20 staff hours of labor per episode, estimates Reddy.
