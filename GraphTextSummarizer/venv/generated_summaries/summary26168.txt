While scholars debate the value of homework -- and pundits, politicians and educators call for increased educational choices, greater standardization and accountability for schools -- many parents and students feel overwhelmed. The pressure of longer school days and more homework don't help matters. In the same year, a school in Germany decided to actually do away with homework for students in grades five to nine. Oddly, when schools decide to ban homework, it is big news, but we know little about what happens afterward. Should children be in school nine hours only to come home to two hours of homework?
