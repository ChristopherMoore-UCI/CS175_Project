" The bidding process for football's 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar, came under great scrutiny due to allegations of corruption against top officials at ruling body FIFA. South Africa became the first nation from the continent to stage football's World Cup last year, while Cape Town finished third in the bidding for the 2004 Olympic Games. I didn't hear again from the ethical commission." Diack, a former athlete who held the French/West African long jump record from 1957-60 and is now an IOC member, said he is confident he will not be found guilty of wrongdoing when the IOC considers the case in December. "I think you could have a good bid from Africa in 2019, 2021," said IAAF chief Diack, who is from Senegal. Diack is also facing an International Olympic Committee inquiry over claims that he received illegal payments from now defunct Swiss company ISL, which had an exclusive marketing contract with the IAAF for the world championships.
