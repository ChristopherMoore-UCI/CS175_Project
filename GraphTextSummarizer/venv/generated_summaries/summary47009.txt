Camuti previously confessed to putting potassium cyanide in an iced coffee that he provided to Rakes, according to testimony by Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Banks at a hearing in Concord District Court on September 10. "The defendant lured the victim to a meeting at which they were to discuss a business deal," Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a press release. The two men met that afternoon in a McDonald's in Waltham, where officials say Camuti bought two iced coffees, laced one with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide and gave it to Rakes. The Massachusetts Medical Examiner's Office determined in October the cause of Rakes' death was acute cyanide poisoning, according to MaryBeth Long, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. In a phone call on July 16, Camuti asked Rakes to meet him about a potential investment property in Wilmington, officials said.
