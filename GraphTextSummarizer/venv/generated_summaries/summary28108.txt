Top IRS official beats back Republican barrage Republican investigators have said they've discovered that Lerner's hard drive was merely "scratched" and it might have been possible at one point to retrieve information, contradicting Koskinen's previous statements. -- Republican lawmakers want to know why the IRS didn't know that it might have been able to recover missing emails from a former official's computer -- communication at the center of new questions about the agency's targeting of conservative political groups. Koskinen spent much of his time before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday answering questions about two years worth of emails from Lerner and a half dozen other IRS officials that were presumed unrecoverable when her hard drive crashed.

IRS Commissioner John Koskinen appeared for a third time before lawmakers to testify about the agency's role in the targeting scandal, especially Republican interest in the emails that they say are important to their investigation.
