"Feinstein has been known throughout her Senate career as conciliator, someone who can bring together warring parties to find common ground on difficult issues," said Schnur. She's raising two critical issues which will define our debate about torture in the coming months: does it make us safer, and is it something we accept as consistent with our nation's moral code?" As Senate Democrats transition to the minority, some have suggested that Feinstein is at the twilight of her career. That long history of contradictions has given Feinstein more running room than other Democrats on issues like torture, said California Democratic Strategist Dan Newman, who recently helped manage Calif. Facing few political consequences in California where her Senate seat is firmly in her grasp, Feinstein, 81, was defiant as she took the Senate floor Tuesday to announce the release of a 525-page summary of the Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's treatment of detainees â€”the product of five years of line-by-line scrutiny of some six million internal government documents. Bill Carrick, Feinstein's longtime campaign consultant who began working with her in 1989, noted that her policy agenda is still lengthy, topped with complex issues like California's water woes.
