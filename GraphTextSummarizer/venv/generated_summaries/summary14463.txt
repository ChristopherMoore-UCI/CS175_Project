"So am I." Professor J. Michael Bailey provided his own account of the optional event in his human sexuality course, saying he wants students to learn about sexual diversity and information from "real people." Students who witnessed the incident had been told repeatedly by a guest speaker what was about to happen would be graphic, the professor said in a statement. I know a couple of my friends did get up and leave," student Diana Lorenzini told CNN affiliate WLS. Brianne Williams, another student, said "Dr. Michael Bailey is one of our finest professors here, and his class is about opening people's minds up." "I certainly have no regrets concerning Northwestern students, who have demonstrated that they are open-minded grown-ups rather than fragile children," the professor added. We had nobody leave at that point," Melvoin-Berg told CNN Chicago affiliate WLS, adding the demonstration was meant to be educational.
