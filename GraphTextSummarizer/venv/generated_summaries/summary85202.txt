-- The White House confirmed Monday that it has received a letter from 12 Nobel Peace Laureates calling on the U.S. to disclose torture methods allegedly used by American forces following the 9/11 terror attacks on the U.S. Bernadette Meehan, National Security Council Spokesperson, told CNN "The President believes that the former rendition, detention, and interrogation program was inconsistent with our values as a nation and that public scrutiny, debate, and transparency will help to inform the public's understanding of the program to ensure that such a program will never be used again." The letter, signed by Nobel Laureates including South Africa's Archbishop Bishop Desmond Tutu, and John Hume who helped secure peace in Northern Ireland, calls on the administration to fully disclose, "the extent and use of torture and rendition by American soldiers, operatives, and contractors, as well as the authorization of torture and rendition by American officials. The Laureates are also asking for the administration to push for the release of a Senate Intelligence report "that will allow the world to see ... the extent to which their government and its representatives authorized, ordered and inflicted torture on their fellow human beings." The letter notes that the Laureates have reason to feel strongly about torture, saying, "Many of us among the Nobel Peace Prize laureates have seen firsthand the effects of the use of torture in our own countries. "It is with this experience that we stand firmly with those Americans who are asking the US to bring its use of torture into the light of day, and for the United States to take the necessary steps to emerge from this dark period of its history, never to return."
