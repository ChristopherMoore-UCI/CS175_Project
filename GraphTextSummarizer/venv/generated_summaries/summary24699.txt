Visitors can dig for diamonds in the park's 37.5-acre plowed field, which was a diamond mining site before it became a state park in 1972. John Huddleston, the farmer who originally owned the property, is credited with starting a diamond mining rush when he first found diamonds in Murfreesboro in 1906. The three colors of diamonds found at the park are white, brown and yellow. 40 different types of rocks and minerals other than diamonds can also be found at the park. Most diamonds found in the park are too small to be cut and are kept simply as souvenirs.
