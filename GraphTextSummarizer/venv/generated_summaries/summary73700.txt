There is no doubt that climate change threatens to derail Africa's impressive recent growth and compromise the socio-economic gains made over the last decade. Severe droughts in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel between 2011 and 2012 saw crops fail and livestock die, leaving 13 million people in need of humanitarian assistance. No nation is immune to the impact of climate change but it is the world's poorest that will be hit the hardest. A fair and inclusive global agreement to combat climate change is a moral imperative. It is they that bear the greatest burden of climate change.
