Investigators were working to positively identify the body, which is believed to be that of Mark Lennon, Rockland County, New York, Sheriff Louis Falco said. "What we're going to do is bring in an accident reconstruction team." Lennon, who was to have been the best man in the wedding party, and bride Lindsey Stewart disappeared late Friday night when a 21-foot Stingray power boat they were passengers on struck the side of one of three barges lashed together at a construction site near the Tappan Zee Bridge, 25 miles north of Manhattan. Stewart and fiancÃ© Brian Bond, Lennon and three other friends boarded the power boat for what was to have been a short ride on the Hudson River from the village of Piermont in Rockland County to Tarrytown. But Craig and Celeste Kmiecik said they were boating in the area on Friday night, and it was dark. Her body was recovered Saturday, but the search for Lennon continued until Sunday morning when a jet skier called police to report finding a body in the river, Falco said.
