Martin and Zimmerman were obviously in the middle of it, but no one else saw all that happened. The same analysis also didn't reach conclusions as to whether Zimmerman used a racial epithet to describe Martin on his own 911 call, as some have alleged. Martin's family have said they believe Zimmerman, a white Hispanic, profiled the African-American teen. Tests, the results of which were made public Thursday, would show evidence of Zimmerman's hands on the firearm, but not Martin's. In a capias request, a request that someone be taken into custody, on March 13, police described what happened as "ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement, or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog (sic) in an effort to dispel each party's concern.
