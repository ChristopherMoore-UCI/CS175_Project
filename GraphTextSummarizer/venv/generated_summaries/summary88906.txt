Palestinians, running out of fuel, food and other supplies after Israel closed Gaza border crossings, poured into Egypt through blown-out and torn-down breaches in the border wall. The exodus followed Israel's closing of its Gaza border crossings Friday to punish Gaza's Hamas leadership after days of rocket attacks on southern Israel. Rice said on Tuesday that the Mideast Quartet -- composed of the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia -- is examining a plan by Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad for the Palestinian Authority to take a greater role in monitoring border crossings between Gaza and Israel. Border access between Gaza and Egypt has been greatly restricted since June 2007,  when Hamas took over the territory. -- Israel said Wednesday it expects Egypt to "solve the problem" after at least 50,000 people crossed the downed Gaza-Egyptian border to buy supplies.
