They found an avalanche marker that Thomas had left at the snow cave, and the rescuers dug and found that Bennett had died. Bennett's family was notified, and his body was flown off the mountain, the sheriff's office said. According to local reports, Bennett and a climbing partner trekked to the summit of the mountain, and on their way down, Bennett became sick and unresponsive.
