Referees (the head officials) and officials who qualify for postseason games would make more, the league said. Officials also have to watch game tape, file reports to the league office and take a weekly written test on the rules. According to Peter King of Sports Illustrated the league would like to add three crews of seven people in reserve with the option to use these referees to replace underperforming officials. PAY The money to pay officials comes from a pot of $18 million funded by the league. The NFL wants an increase in the average salary for officials, who are part-time employees, from $149,000 to $189,000 by 2018.
