There are hundreds of metres of ice within the caldera, so any eruption would lead to the production of ash, once it melts its way through the ice cap; melting ice interacts with the magma, turning to steam and exploding the magma into fragments of ash. This means that aircraft are now allowed to fly in areas containing low particle concentrations, and various efforts such as a collaboration of 26 European institutes called FUTUREVOLC, mean that models of ash concentration have been much improved since 2010. Bardarbunga has had huge eruptions in the past, bigger even than the 1783-84 Laki eruption that led to a long-lived fog over much of Europe, which contributed to extreme low winter temperatures and many deaths. The weather at the time also conspired against civil air authorities and travellers, with dry air and consistent northerly winds causing the ash to spread deep into Europe. However, the frequency of such large eruptions is low -- separated by hundreds of years on average.
