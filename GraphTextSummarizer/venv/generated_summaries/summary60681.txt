Amid recent rumors of ill health or even possible death, Cuban state media has released 21 photos of former leader Fidel Castro. Just last week, in a message reported to be from the former Cuban leader, Castro endorsed the fledgling talks to restore diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, but added he still "didn't trust" U.S. officials. The U.S. broke relations with Cuba in 1961, amid fears that Castro and his bearded revolutionaries harbored communist sympathies. " In December, Cuba and the United States exchanged prisoners and agreed to discuss normalizing relations that had been trapped in over five decades of Cold War animosity. In the letter published on the Granma website, Castro said that although he didn't "trust U.S. policies and have not exchanged a word with them, this does not mean however that I would oppose a peaceful solution to conflicts or threats of war.
