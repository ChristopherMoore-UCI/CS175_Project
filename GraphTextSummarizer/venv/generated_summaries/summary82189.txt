Redmond O'Neal was on a day pass away from the Pasadena, California, sober living facility where he is undergoing court-ordered drug rehab. "It was very nice, very beautifully set up," he said, sitting on a couch between his father, Ryan O'Neal, and sister, Tatum O'Neal. The foundation has a mission of funding research and clinical trials into alternative treatments for anal cancer -- which killed Fawcett -- and pediatric cancers. With his mother now a role model and inspiration for those battling cancer, does Redmond O'Neal think he may someday be a hero and example for others struggle with drug addiction? "Redmond is extremely well," Ryan O'Neal said.
