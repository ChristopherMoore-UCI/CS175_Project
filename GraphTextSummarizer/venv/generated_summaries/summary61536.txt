At the premiere Wednesday night in Hollywood, Walker's co-star and close friend Vin Diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening, saying "This movie is more than a movie." Producers said early on that they would not kill off Walker's character, Brian O'Connor, a former cop turned road racer. A week after Walker's death, about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in Los Angeles. "He was a person of humility, integrity, and compassion," military veteran Kyle Upham said in an email to CNN. Instead, the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes, with Walker's brothers, Cody and Caleb, serving as body doubles.
