Police detail Katt Williams' bizarre behavior "I've already discussed it with my kids," Williams said. -- Katt Williams announced the end of his stand-up comedy career Monday, a day after a bizarre incident in Seattle that landed him in jail. Officer Michael Virgilio wrote in the arrest report that the World Sports Bar manager told him Williams had returned to the bar Sunday after being involved in a dispute with a customer the night before. " Virgilio said he would request additional charges against Williams, including reckless endangerment, because the rock hit a window in the family's car, "directly next to an 8-year-old girl." "Had the glass shattered or the rock had penetrated the window, it could have struck and harmed the 8-year-old victim," he said. " Williams was in Seattle to perform over the weekend, but his allegedly aggressive behavior at a Seattle bar and an odd exchange with police ended with him in the King County, Washington, jail Sunday on charges of assault, harassment and obstruction.
