Ngugi, writer and publisher Eghosa Imasuen and New York Times journalist Helene Cooper have recorded audio versions of the stories. The initiative, announced by Ankara Press, an imprint of Nigerian publisher Cassava Republic, has a clear directive. According to project co-ordinator Emma Shercliff, "one of the most exciting things about the Valentine's Day Story project is the way it has been a collaborative effort, bringing together writers, publishers, translator and readers from across Africa, all of whom have shown an incredible amount of goodwill by donating their time and talents for free. Contributors include celebrated Kenyan writer Binyavanga Wainaina -- voted one of TIME's 100 "Most Influential People in the World" last year -- and award-winning Nigerian authors Toni Kan and Abubakar Adam Ibrahim. " The Valentine's Day anthology will be available for free digital download on the Ankara Press website on Saturday, February 14th.
