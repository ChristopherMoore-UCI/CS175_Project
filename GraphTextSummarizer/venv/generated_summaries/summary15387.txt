The appointment of Eriksson was announced live on national television on Sunday evening by Souleymane Alex Bamba, a member of Ivory Coast's Football Federation. -- Former England and Mexico coach Sven-Goran Eriksson has been appointed as coach of the Ivory Coast national team for the World Cup finals in South Africa. Ivory Coast have been handed a difficult draw in South Africa and face both Brazil and Portugal in the group stage of the competition. The Swede was recently director of football at lower league English side Notts County, but left that position when the club ran into financial difficulties. Eriksson led England to the quarterfinals of both the 2002 and 2006 World Cup finals but had a less successful spell with Mexico, and was sacked from that post in April last year.
