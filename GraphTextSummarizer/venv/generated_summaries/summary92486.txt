For those who struggle with poor body image, perfectionism or anxiety -- just a few of the many risk factors associated with disordered eating -- social media can be downright toxic. The good news is that social media give us all the ability to be content curators, media makers and rabble rousers. In two recent studies, researchers at Florida State University explored whether eating disorders are linked to social media use. Rather than consuming and internalizing media toxicity, we can use social media talk back to a culture that makes us feel like we're never good enough. But the studies do not suggest that social media platforms should be held responsible for causing eating disorders.
