Kristine Williams Williams, 36, was a resident of Gary and a mother of four, according to her mother-in-law, Deborah Berry. Vann had "some sort of connection" with Jones, Gary Police Chief Larry McKinley said, adding that authorities don't know yet what the connection is. Berry told CNN she had not heard from Williams since February but did not file a police report because Williams would often "disappear. Her real family wouldn't have much to do with her." Williams did not have a job, and according to Berry, she had two children from her marriage with Berry's son Siad, and two more children from different fathers. She wore a pair of size-3/4 twentyone black by RUE21 blue jeans and white Nike gym shoes size 6, said Lake County Coroner Merrilee Frey.
