-- Mexican President Felipe Calderon has a new Twitter account name -- FelipeCalderon. He had nearly 800,000 followers Wednesday morning and followed seven accounts, including one about the writings of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. A look at his account Wednesday morning showed that he had more than 111,000 followers and that he follows 54 people, including a noted Mexican writer who died last week. Anyone interested in more tweets about the Mexican government also can follow two existing accounts -- PresidenciaMX, which highlights the president's activities, and GobFed, which reports on the federal government's activities. There are at least two Twitter accounts for Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, though it could not be determined Wednesday whether either is official.
