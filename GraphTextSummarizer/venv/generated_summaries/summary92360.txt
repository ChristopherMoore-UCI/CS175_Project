Even back then, reporters covering the Massachusetts State House could anticipate carefully crafted statements by Romney on any social issue likely to come up when he shared the dais with Republican presidential primary rivals. His one major legacy as governor -- the health care reform bill for which Massachusetts Democrats now honor him -- was part of that same Romney political calculus. With Finneran as sentinel, Romney was spared from making any decisions on legislation that could haunt him in Republican primaries. Romney ran a similar campaign for governor in 2002, modeling the same moderate positions of the two liberal Republican governors who preceded him. In the last two years of his governorship, Romney was out of state campaigning for president more often than he was in his State House office.
