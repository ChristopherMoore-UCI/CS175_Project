"This civil rights action was brought in response to the violent acts of police abuse against Mr. Halevy and a violation of his civil rights," Siegel told CNN. -- New York City has agreed to pay $100,000 to a Brooklyn man whose beating by police officers was caught on surveillance video, the city law department said Tuesday. The police department's Internal Affairs Bureau Investigated the incident but eventually cleared both officers of wrongdoing, according to Halevy's lawyer, Norman Siegel. The community center surveillance video, obtained by CNN from the website CrownHeights.info, showed two officers beating Halevy with punches after he allegedly resisted arrest. In addition to the $100,000, the city will also pay Halevy's attorney's fees, which are still being negotiated, Siegel said.
