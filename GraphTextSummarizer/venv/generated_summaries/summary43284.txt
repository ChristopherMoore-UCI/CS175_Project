The youth organization SEGI is blamed for fomenting so-called low-level street violence, such as the burning of municipal buses and automated teller machines, in support of Basque independence. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. Police early Friday arrested 13 people suspected of trying to rebuild a youth wing of the outlawed Basque separatist group ETA, which was dismantled a year ago with dozens of arrests, the Interior Ministry said. Before Friday's raids, police had already arrested about 20 suspected ETA members or collaborators since ETA's declaration on September 5. Authorities say that some of those activists later go on to become fully-fledged ETA members who carry out shootings and car bombings.
