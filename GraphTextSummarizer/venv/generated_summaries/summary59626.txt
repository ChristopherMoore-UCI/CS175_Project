Qadri's campaign comes more than a year after anti-corruption demonstrator Anna Hazare roiled Indian politics with a hunger strike that called for the introduction of strong anti-graft measures. Corruption is widely considered a chronic problem in Pakistan's political system; President Zardari has served prison time on corruption charges. "We all must rally and come together for change and a better future and stronger Pakistan," he said. After eight years in Canada, Qadri returned last month to Pakistan, where he is waging a campaign against the political elite. Supporters say that Qadri aims to effect positive change.
