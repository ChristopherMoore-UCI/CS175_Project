The 63 were among 137 people police had rounded up by Wednesday -- two days after a mob of fired employees attacked L.K. Chaudhary, the chief executive of an Italian car parts manufacturing company. On Tuesday, India's labor minister, Oscar Fernandes, drew sharp criticism after he said Chaudhary's death should serve as a warning to management, according to CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN. Labor minister Oscar Fernandes was criticized for saying Chaudhary's death was warning to management. The meeting turned violent, and the mob attacked Chaudhary with iron rods, Pathak said.
