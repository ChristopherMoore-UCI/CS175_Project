After pushing for strikes against Syria, Obama unexpectedly announced on August 31 that he would ask Congress to authorize military action. "Congressional approval would help Obama a little, but a majority would still oppose airstrikes against military targets in Syria," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. Fifty-nine percent of people questioned say they don't think Congress should approve a proposed resolution authorizing military action against Syria for up to 90 days -- an initial 60-day window plus another 30 following congressional notification -- but prohibiting the use of ground troops. "If Congress authorizes military action, 55% of Americans would still oppose airstrikes." And if Congress rejects the resolution authorizing military action, large numbers in both parties oppose airstrikes.
