Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel has started the 2011 Formula One season as he finished the last, claiming pole position in qualifying ahead of Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. Vettel's Australian teammate Mark Webber finished third fastest in front of his home crowd, with Hamilton's fellow McLaren driver Jenson Button in fourth position at Albert Park. You only have those eight meters between you and the guy in second position, nothing more, nothing less. Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso will start from fifth on the grid for Ferrari and Vitaly Petrov of Renault will also be on the third row after a lap of one minute 25.247 earned him sixth position. Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher's qualifying woes from the 2010 campaign continued after he was eliminated at the end of the second round, which means the Mercedes driver will start from 11th position.
