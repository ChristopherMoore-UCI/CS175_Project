Another woman has come forward to accuse San Diego Mayor Bob Filner of sexual harassment. The city has changed the locks to the mayor's office, and mediation talks that could effectively end his tenure in office are continuing, City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said Tuesday. Another said he "put me in what I guess now is the famous headlock" and tried "to kiss me on the lips and I'd have to squirm to get away." Filner's former communication director, Irene McCormack Jackson, quit her job and sued the mayor in July, saying he subjected women to "crude and disgusting" comments and inappropriate touching. Out of rehab, locked out of the office Filner recently acknowledged inappropriate behavior, but has steadfastly resisted efforts to force him out of office. The talks come on the heels of Filner's intensive two-week behavioral therapy, which was apparently aimed at ending his allegedly backward ways of treating women in the workplace.
