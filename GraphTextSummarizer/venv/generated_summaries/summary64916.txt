Headley, a Chicago resident, faces six counts of conspiracy to bomb places in India, and to murder and maim people in India and Denmark; and of providing material support to foreign terrorist plots and providing material support to Lashkar-e-Taiba. The officials will meet in the Indian capital February 25, according to India's External Affairs Ministry. Saturday's blast comes a day after Indian and Pakistani officials agreed to meet in New Delhi later this month in a bid to resume their dialogue frozen by the 2008 Mumbai attacks. In that brazen series of attacks, gunmen took over three luxury hotels and a Jewish center and shot up several other places, including a restaurant, over three days. India suspended its fragile peace process with arch-rival Pakistan in the wake of the 2008 Mumbai attacks.
