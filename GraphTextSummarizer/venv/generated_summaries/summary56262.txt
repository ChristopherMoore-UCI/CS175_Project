"From the NICU to the Moon" is part of the organization's Safe Sleep Campaign, which hopes to connect parents and caregivers with safe sleeping tips in order for their babies' sweet dreams -- amid the steady beep-beep of NICU monitors -- to become a reality. "We wanted the photos to help educate parents about the need for babies to sleep alone, on their backs and in a crib," Wright said, adding that babies can be unintentionally harmed by blankets and stuffed animals in the crib, sharing an adult bed or sleeping on his or her stomach. More than that, the campaign is about looking to the next chapter after the NICU, Wright says, and a safe sleeping environment  is a big part of it. According to the CDC, approximately 4,000 infants between 1 month and 1 year of age die suddenly and unexpectedly each year -- and the leading cause of those deaths is accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed.
