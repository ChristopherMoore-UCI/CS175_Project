Neighbors and police have said that women were seen at Sowell's home from time to time and that he would offer them alcohol. In addition, Anthony Sowell, 50, is charged with "brutalizing" three women and raping two of them, Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason said. Sowell is now charged with 11 counts of aggravated murder with a "mass murder specification," meaning multiple people were killed in a similar fashion, Mason said. Sowell threatened his victims and warned them not to contact police, Mason said.
