-- A man accused of stalking television actress and singer Selena Gomez, 19, pleaded not guilty Thursday, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Thomas Brodnicki, 46, has been charged with one count of stalking the teen star, who is thought to be the girlfriend of Canadian pop singer Justin Bieber. Authorities say Brodnicki allegedly stalked Gomez this year, between July and October. He also now faces a court-issued protective order, requiring Brodnicki to keep away from Gomez for a period of three years. Brodnicki's attorney could not be immediately reached for comment.
