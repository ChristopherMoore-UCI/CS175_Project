^5-7 p.m. Negative pressure tests, in which crews reduce fluid pressure to test for leaks through the cement or well casing, show unexpected results. -- A timeline of events leading to the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, according to documents from congressional investigators and testimony from witnesses to the disaster: ^12:35 a.m. In a second, pressure on the rig's "kill line" -- a high-pressure pipe used to cut off the flow of oil -- falls to zero, while rising to 1,400 pounds per square inch in the drill line, indicating a buildup of natural gas. One draws 15 barrels of liquid out of the well instead of the expected five, raising more concerns about leaks. Drill pipe pressure unexpectedly increases.
