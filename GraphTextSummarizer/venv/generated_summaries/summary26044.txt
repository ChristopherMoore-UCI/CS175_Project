The House has passed the Republican budget plan submitted by Rep. Paul Ryan, but some budget experts believe that he federal government is so far in the red that it may not balance the budget again in our lifetime. House passes GOP budget "This just shows you how deep of a hole our country is in," Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican and chairman of the Budget Committee, said when asked about the 2035 budget balance date. To do that would take about $4 trillion in deficit cuts, he and others estimate. The Ryan budget, despite its cuts and aggressive fiscal moves, does not balance the budget for at least 23 years, according to the House Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office. "The public, I don't think, is going to be able to tolerate the level of cuts in Congressman Ryan's plan, even though the level of deficit reduction is only a little bit more than what we need.
