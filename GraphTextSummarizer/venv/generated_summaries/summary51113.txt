During his hospital stay, Graham watched television and remained in good spirits, spokesman A. Larry Ross said. Evangelist Billy Graham was at home Sunday after being discharged from an Asheville, North Carolina, hospital where he was treated for pneumonia, the hospital said. According to Ross, Graham has remained in good health overall. Graham's wife, Ruth Bell Graham, died in 2007. The founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has preached to millions of people over six decades, and has provided counsel to U.S. presidents, beginning with President Harry S. Truman.
