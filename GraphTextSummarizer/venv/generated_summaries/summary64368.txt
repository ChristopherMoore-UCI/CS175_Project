"He was a very nice young man," South Carolina State University President Thomas Elzey said, fighting back tears in a brief statement to reporters. -- A student was shot dead Friday afternoon at South Carolina State University, prompting a manhunt for several suspects that extended beyond the school's Orangeburg campus. Orangeburg County Coroner Samuetta Marshall identified the slain student as Brandon Robinson, 20, of Orangeburg. Police said Cody Cousins, 23, an engineering student, killed Andrew Bolt, 21, of West Bend, Wisconsin. Elzey said "we are pulling together as a community," announcing that counselors would be made available to grieving students.
