Chilton was having heart problems and died in an emergency room in New Orleans, Louisiana, said longtime friend and business associate John Fry. "Obviously, we are all stunned and deeply saddened at this news," Fry said. "While Big Star struggled with success commercially, their early '70s, power-pop sound is often cited as directly influencing bands like Cheap Trick, R.E.M. and the Replacements," Billboard magazine said in its biography of Chilton's group. -- Rock guitarist and singer Alex Chilton, known for his work with bands the Box Tops and Big Star, died Wednesday. Chilton started in music as a teen in the 1960s, as vocalist for the psychedelic soul group the Box Tops, Fry said. After that group disbanded in 1970, Chilton formed the Memphis rock group Big Star.
