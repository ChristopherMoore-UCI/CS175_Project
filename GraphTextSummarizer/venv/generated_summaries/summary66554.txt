"But student athletes whose performance creates such student jobs in the athletic department are paid nothing." "Student athletes perform longer, more rigorous hours -- nearer full time," Sackos' lawsuit reads. "The (d)efendants have jointly agreed, and conspired, to deprive student athletes of lawfully earned, modest wages and of equal treatment under law," wrote Philadelphia attorney Paul L. McDonald. A judge with the National Labor Relations Board agreed that they were employees after hearing testimony about the tight controls kept on student athletes and the emphasis on sport over academics. They are "subject to stricter, more exacting supervision" and "confer as many, if not more, tangible and intangible benefits on NCAA Division I Member Schools." Sackos' suit might also be helped by another legal victory for student athletes: the recent federal court verdict in favor of former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, who sued the NCAA over the use of his likeness and image.
