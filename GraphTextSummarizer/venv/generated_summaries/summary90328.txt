" This year's lead stunt for the Sheas is an effort to create a rivalry between the United States and China by bringing Chinese eaters to Coney Island for the July Fourth contest, just when Nathan's happens to be embarking on a major expansion in China. He was banned from the Nathan's event last year after a contract dispute and then arrested after trying to jump onto the Coney Island stage, generating even more publicity for the eating contest and for Nathan's Famous. In a move to increase the contest's fame, Nathan's is sponsoring separate male and female competitions, in effect setting the plate for Thomas, a Burger King manager who reigns supreme among female hot dog eaters, to finally capture her own championship belt. -- World hot dog eating record holders Joey "Jaws" Chestnut and Sonya "The Black Widow" Thomas engaged in a pre-meet stare down Friday as they weighed in for the annual Nathan's July Fourth hot dog eating contest. Norbitz, a young Nathan's employee in 1977, remembers creating the competition with Rosey in front of the Coney Island restaurant.
