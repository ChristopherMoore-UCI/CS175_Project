-- The growing outcry over how the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell deal with incidents of domestic violence has reached the nation's highest office. Outcry over the NFL's response to the Rice incident has been compounded by two more recent incidents of domestic violence allegedly involving NFL players. The incident involving Rice is one of several high-profile scandals involving NFL players that have spurred complaints that the National Football League is too lenient on players. Ray McDonald, a starting defensive end, was arrested on felony domestic violence charges last month. "I wouldn't be surprised if we have hearings." Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, recently told CNN that he would not "rule out" congressional action to force the NFL's hand on domestic abuse.
