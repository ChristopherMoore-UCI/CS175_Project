In the piece, Lewinsky said her new goal was to "get involved with efforts on behalf of victims of online humiliation and harassment and to start speaking on this topic in public forums. "I want to put my suffering to good use and give purpose to my past." Lewinsky, who as an intern in 1995 had an affair with President Bill Clinton, said she was "patient zero" of online harassment.

Monica Lewinsky told an audience in Philadelphia on Monday that her new mission in life was to end cyberbullying.
