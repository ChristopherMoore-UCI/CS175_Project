Qian was killed in Yueqing city on December 25, and photos of his corpse underneath the wheel of a large truck went viral in the Chinese blogosphere. With mainstream media's independent reporting on Qian's death coming a screeching halt, grassroots activists continue chasing the case, digging up new information on the land dispute and traveling to Yueqing to talk to villagers. But as shocking images from the scene in Yueqing city began to appear on a popular Chinese online forum last Sunday, some posts suggested he was murdered by local officials for advocating villagers' rights in a land dispute. "We thoroughly investigated the life and work as well as social connections of the suspect (driver), and eliminated the possibility of him intentionally killing (Qian)," said Shen Qiang, deputy police chief of Wenzhou. Blocked by police, the crowd began to head away from the town and toward the village of Zhaiqiao, the hometown of Qian, said the eyewitness.
