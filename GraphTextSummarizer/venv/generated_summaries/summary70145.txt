-- Mexico's frontal assault against drug cartels has been "largely ineffective" and in some instances counterproductive to reducing violence, a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee report concludes. Mexico's federal police force has made strides in both size and capacity over the past several years, but reforms in state and local police departments have lagged, the report states. By training police and equipping them to investigate drug-related killings, the military component of Mexico's current strategy can be scaled back, the report says. Even if Mexico resorts to using the military as a stop-gap measure to combat the violence, "increased civilian police capabilities will obviate the need to deploy military personnel for domestic security purposes," the report says. Mexico's Nieto calls for 'new debate' on the drug war Mexican President Felipe Calderon's term, which comes to an end in December, will be remembered for a surge in the number of troops deployed across Mexico to help combat drug cartels.
