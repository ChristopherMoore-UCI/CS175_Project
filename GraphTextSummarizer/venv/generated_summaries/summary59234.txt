The wounded man told law enforcement, who arrived within about 10 minutes, that he had been hearing gunshots for about 10 minutes in the "wooded, largely rural area," according to Lt. Steve Dittoe of the Snohomish County Sheriff's Office. -- A shooter who fired at vehicles and individuals Sunday from woods in northern Washington state remains at large, as law enforcement ordered residents to stay in their homes and others to stay away as they hunted for the suspect. By late Sunday afternoon, Dittoe said that "we believe we have the area contained" where the threat exists, though they have yet to track down the suspect. "Immediately the officers ... recognized that there was someone in the woods shooting at either vehicles or people," said Dittoe. Meanwhile, those who live in the immediate vicinity are being urged to not leave their homes, Dittoe said.
