Principal was a celebrity volunteer in June 2010 when a CNN telethon, hosted by Larry King and Ryan Seacrest, raised more than $1.81 million for Gulf Coast oil disaster relief. The "Dallas" actress is making an "extremely generous six-figure donations" to two organizations that lobby against increased offshore oil exploration and for tougher rules for oil companies, those groups said Tuesday. -- Victoria Principal fears the proposed expansion of offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and Arctic Ocean could lead to another disastrous oil spill like the one that devastated the U.S. Gulf coast last year. " Oceana and the NRDC said they would use Principal's newest donation in the campaign to prevent drilling off the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific Coasts, as well as the campaign to "require critical scientific assessments and demonstrated oil spill response capability in the Arctic before allowing additional leasing. " "Americans watched in horror and disbelief as millions of gallons of oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico during the BP disaster nearly two years ago," NRDC President Frances Beinecke said.
