"My guess is by 2030, there won't be any ice left on the mountain," says Richard Taylor, a geology professor at University College London. With the glaciers receding, those local people will suffer from lack of jobs," says Richard Atugonza, a student at Makerere University's Mountain Resource Center, who took part in Hardy's Rwenzori expedition. " Hardy recently led a two-week expedition to Rwenzori in conjunction with Uganda's Makerere University Mountain Resource Center, Green Cross International and the World Youth Parliament for Water. Historically, however, there have been three mountains that, until recently, could proudly boast some of the world's most majestic glaciers: Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Mount Kenya, and the Rwenzori Mountains bordering Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Rwenzori has been dubbed the "African Alps," the "Mountains of the Moon" and the "snowy source of the Nile" (the latter two descriptors were ascribed in 150 A.D. by noted astrologer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy).
