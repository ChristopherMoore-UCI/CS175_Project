While much of the world looks at Germany as an ascending economic power within a declining continent, thereby shifting the regional balance of power in its favor, Germans themselves (and certainly their current elected leader) are keenly aware of the limits of German power. They mistake strategy for passivity and a realistic assessment of Germany's wealth and power for stingy disciplinarianism. In 1989, East Germany accounted for roughly a fourth of the population of West Germany and no more than a fraction of its economic output. Nobody in Germany has forgotten the enormity of the task to bail out, reform and integrate East Germany after the fall of the Berlin Wall. In her assessment, no reform will happen in southern Europe without pressure from the markets.
