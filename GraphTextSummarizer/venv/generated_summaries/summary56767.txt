Both the proliferation of mobile phones and the rollout of faster internet networks -- like the fiber-optic cables launched in areas such as east Africa -- have helped the expansion of e-commerce activities in countries such as Nigeria, South Africa and Kenya. Shagaya, who has also worked for Google and RealNetworks, says the model has struck a chord with customers looking to make the most out of the benefits of online shopping -- DealDey plans to expand to  Abuja, Nigeria's capital, and claims to have over 50,000 members since its launch in March, adding about 1,000 people per day, Shagaya says. "Online shopping has already become a success story in Nigeria, especially amongst the youth of today," she says. In Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, internet penetration is at about 28%,according to ITU figures, boosted by the rapid growth in the country's telecoms sector. Yet, promoting e-commerce in a country with high internet costs, slow connectivity and a bad reputation for online scams does not come without its challenges.
