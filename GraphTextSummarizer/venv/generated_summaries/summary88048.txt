"Today, the Security Council made clear to President Saleh that his continued equivocation is weakening his country and imperiling a peaceful and democratic future for the people of Yemen. The 15-0 vote demands that Yemen allow peaceful demonstrations to take place and to end government crackdowns on civilians. Security Council members have said a political solution in Yemen should be based on a initiative put forward by the GCC, a political and economic union of Arab states. " "President Saleh has repeatedly pledged to sign the (Gulf Cooperation Council) initiative," Rice said. The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday in favor of a resolution to condemn violence in Yemen, where demonstrators, government forces and rival factions have been embroiled in months of unrest.
