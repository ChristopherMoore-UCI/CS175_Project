-- Labor unions must give nonmember workers "fresh notice" of unplanned increases in fees or assessments -- money that might be used for political purposes -- the Supreme Court ruled Thursday. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed with their more conservative colleagues that fair notice must be given for nonmembers to opt out of pure political lobbying by unions. At issue was whether nonunion employees may be constitutionally required to pay special fees to a union to help cover things like political spending on ballot measures. The high court in past cases has ruled nonunion public sector workers cannot be forced to pay for union activities not directly related to collective bargaining. State law allows unions to charge nonmembers annual dues -- called "fair share fees" -- to help support the collective bargaining efforts on behalf of all government workers, including the majority of workers who belong to the SEIU.
