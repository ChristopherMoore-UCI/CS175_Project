-- Chelsea coach Carlo Ancelotti has dismissed reports he is about to quit the English Premier League champions. But the Italian, who led former club AC Milan to two Champions League titles, insisted the scrutiny that comes with his job is something he enjoys. But at a press conference ahead of Chelsea's Champions League tie with Slovakian side MSK Zilina on Tuesday, Ancelotti said the rumors were "totally untrue". The departure of Wilkins, who played for the club for six years, coupled with a poor run of form has put pressure on Ancelotti, even though Chelsea remain top of the Premier League table. Chelsea have lost three of their last four matches and the club sacked Ancelotti's assistant Ray Wilkins earlier this month, sparking speculation over his position.
