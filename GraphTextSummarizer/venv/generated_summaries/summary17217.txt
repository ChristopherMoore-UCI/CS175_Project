It takes up a lot of time and you get people who support other teams having a go at you on a daily basis, sometimes United fans and all!" Scott said the readership of his blog, and also contributions to his Manchester United forum came from areas as widely spread as Europe, Africa and even as far as Asia and South America -- with a strong base at home in the United Kingdom.
