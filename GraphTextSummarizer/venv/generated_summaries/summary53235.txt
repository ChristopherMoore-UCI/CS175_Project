"We do bamboo bicycles, bamboo bicycle stands and bicycle baskets for now," says Danso and their biking portfolio includes road, city, and mountain bikes in both male and female versions.

Danso takes his rural youth teams through the entire manufacturing process -- from the harvesting of bamboo through to the final assembly of bespoke bicycles -- to ensure they're equipped with a diverse skill set. His wish is for Boomers to become a resource not only for bicycles, but also furniture, household items and even houses made of bamboo.
