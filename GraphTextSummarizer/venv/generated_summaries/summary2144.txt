Salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly and persons with HIV infection or are undergoing chemotherapy. -- Jennie-O Turkey Store is recalling nearly 55,000 pounds of frozen, raw turkey burgers that may be contaminated with Salmonella, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said Saturday. The most common symptoms of the illness caused by eating food contaminated with Salmonella are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever, according to the FSIS. An investigation of a Salmonella outbreak in 10 states found three people in Colorado, Ohio, and Wisconsin reported illness after eating the Jennie-O ground turkey, leading the FSIS to determine there is a link between the product and the outbreak, the agency said on its website.
