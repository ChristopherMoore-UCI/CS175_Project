While Mourinho's Real Madrid team were training at City's Etihad Stadium ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United, their temporary landlords were making their way to the testing fixture at Villa Park, knowing dropped points would end all hopes in the title race. -- Jose Mourinho may believe the English Premier League title race is already over but reigning champions Manchester City kept alive their slim hopes of retaining the crown with Monday's 1-0 win at Aston Villa. The victory cut the gap on arch rivals and championship leaders Manchester United to 12 points with 10 matches of the EPL season remaining, including a return clash between the top two at the beginning of April. Defeat left Villa deep in relegation trouble in 18th place with just 24 points in the bag. It was a disciplined display from Roberto Mancini's men, who owed their victory to a neatly-taken goal by Argentina international Carlos Tevez just before halftime.
