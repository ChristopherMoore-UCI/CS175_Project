One of the devices, operated by Curtin University and located some 20 kilometers off Perth, is designed to listen to whales and other marine life. Low frequency signals can travel thousands of kilometers through water under favorable circumstances, Duncan said. The research is continuing, Duncan said, and investigators may release additional information about their findings in the coming days. But the recent efforts involve pairing CTBTO data with other sources to see what can be gleaned, officials said. "One signal has been detected on several receivers that could be related to the crash," said Alec Duncan of Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology (CMST).
