-- Security forces in Bahrain stormed the main hospital, beating doctors, and attacked demonstrators in Manama's Pearl Roundabout on Wednesday, witnesses in the Bahraini capital said. In a statement Wednesday, Bahrain's government said that as police approached the roundabout, they were attacked by protesters -- whom they call "saboteurs" -- who threw Molotov cocktails at them. The crackdown comes a day after Bahrain's King Hamad imposed a three-month state of emergency and two days after Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates dispatched troops to the Persian Gulf island nation to "protect the safety of citizens," the Bahraini government said. Calls made to various hospitals turned up multiple accounts of witnesses being attacked, including medical staff and doctors, Jamjoom said. The Bahraini government expelled CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom from the country Wednesday without explanation.
