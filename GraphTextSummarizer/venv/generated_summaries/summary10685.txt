Authorities knew from research and contact with forensic psychologists that school shooters typically continue firing until confronted by law enforcement, Robinson said. Additionally, schools now have predesignated parent-student "reunification centers" to prevent parents from showing up at the scene and interfering with law enforcement, as was the case in Sandy Hook, Trump said. Some even suggested that elementary school students use items such as cans of soup to attack gunmen. In addition, school staff and students implemented a well-rehearsed lockdown practice. Columbine really revolutionized the way law enforcement responds to active shooters.
