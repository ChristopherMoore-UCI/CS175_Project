-- Egypt's Football Association faces punishment after FIFA decided to investigate an incident which saw Algeria's team bus pelted with stones before last Saturday's World Cup qualifier in Cairo. Egypt won that match 2-0 to force a play-off at the Khartoum Stadium in Sudan on Wednesday night, which Algeria won 1-0 to book a place at the World Cup finals in South Africa next year. The two north African neighbors have a history of intense competition -- rioting occurred after the two sides locked horns in 1989 in a final World Cup qualifier hosted by Italy. Algeria, known as "the Desert Foxes," have qualified for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 at the expense of reigning African champions Egypt. "According to the official reports received by FIFA on November 12, there were incidents affecting the Algerian team on its way from the airport to the hotel," FIFA said on its official Web site.
