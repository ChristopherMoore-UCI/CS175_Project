Under current policies, prescriptions are still need for the generic version for those under age 17. The Obama administration has been criticized by some women's rights groups for trying to stop contraception sales to underage females. Many developed countries require a prescription for oral contraceptives, including Canada and most of Europe, but other countries sell the pill without a prescription even formally or informally. The Justice Department appealed a ruling in April by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman, who directed the Food and Drug Administration to make the morning-after birth control pill available to females "of child-bearing age" without a prescription. Korman's ruling responded to a lawsuit launched by the Center for Reproductive Rights.
