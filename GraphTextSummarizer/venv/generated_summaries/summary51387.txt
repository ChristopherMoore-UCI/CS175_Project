" Report: Syrian army stretched amid uprising This scene, said to have been shot in Syria, surfaced in a video on YouTube, where images of anti-government ferment and violence have emerged consistently since unrest started in the nation in mid-March. Syrian state TV has aired the video, saying that the bodies are being dumped by anti-government protesters. CNN could not verify the authenticity of the video, but it illustrates the hostility of the nearly five-month-old conflict across Syria between regime forces and anti-government protesters. The bodies are those of Syrian secret police killed by Syrian fighters from Iraq who have joined the anti-government fight, said the activist, who gets information about the goings-on in Syria from an extensive network of informants. The posting on the video says the bodies are anti-government forces being dumped by thugs loyal to President Bashar al-Assad.
