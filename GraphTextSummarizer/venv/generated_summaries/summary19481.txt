Spitzer, who resigned in 2008 after revelations he spent thousands of dollars on prostitutes, launched a petition campaign Monday to become New York City comptroller. And now add former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer to the list, as he embarks on a similar journey. "I think it is a land of forgiveness, of people in their natural goodness (who) understand the fact that...we sin, we pay a price and hopefully continue," added Spitzer, who served two terms as New York State attorney general before winning election as governor in 2006. Former Rep. Anthony Weiner is trying to travel the same road to political redemption. " Spitzer, who since stepping down has been a commentator for various news outlets including CNN, disagrees with the Weiner comparison, and said he's not on a quest for redemption, but instead stressed that he's motivated by what he said are personal pleas from New Yorkers urging him to get back into public service.
