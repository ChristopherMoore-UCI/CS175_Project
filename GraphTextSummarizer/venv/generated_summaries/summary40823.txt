Morozov: We need to understand what exactly is being reduced as we transition from individual criticism to crowd criticism to -- soon, I'm sure -- algorithmic criticism. Second, now that technology companies play such an important role in public life -- mostly because they run the digital infrastructure through which much of this life happens -- what are the costs and benefits of enlisting them in important social and political projects? The British historian David Edgerton has a wonderful book called "The Shock of the Old," where he shows that our accounts of technology suffer from the innovator's bias: We do not spend nearly enough time looking at how technologies are actually used or maintained. This might be trivially true, but the problem with terms like "the Internet" is that they blind us both to perverse effects of connectivity -- connectivity does not equal democratization, just like social capital does not equal a robust civil society -- and the fact that digital technologies have very different effects in different contexts. Morozov: I've been warning about the utility of social media -- and digital infrastructure more generally -- for surveillance purposes for a very long time.
