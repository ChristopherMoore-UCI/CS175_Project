The AFI Awards, now on its 14th edition, highlights 10 films and 10 TV series that have been "deemed culturally and artistically representative of the year's most significant achievements in the art of the moving image," a statement explains. In the past, the AFI Awards have highlighted some of the biggest awards season contenders, such as 2012 Best Picture winner "Argo" and 2011 Best Picture nominees "Hugo," "The Help" and "Moneyball," among others. "Acknowledging their collective contributions to America's rich cultural legacy is both AFI's national mandate -- and our honor."
