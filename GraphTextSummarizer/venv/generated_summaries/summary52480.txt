The first group of islands in the Bahamas chain, Bimini -- with the small islands of North Bimini and South Bimini at its core -- is only about 50 miles from Miami, but the slow-and-easy lifestyle on the historic atoll feels like a world away. North Bimini is only seven miles long and less than a mile wide, so walking and biking along the main road -- "The King's Highway" -- is the best way to experience Bimini. There is only one airport serving Bimini -- South Bimini Airport (BIM). I've traveled to Bimini many times over the years and even though swimming, eating, reading, talking and drinking consumed most of my days, exploring Bimini's enchanting underwater world was also at the top of my to-do list. "They walk the street, sit on the side of the road, meet local people, listen to music and experience good food -- and that includes fresh-baked Bimini bread."
