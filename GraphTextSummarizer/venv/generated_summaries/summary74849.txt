Schedule it in This inspiration is not based on a close personal friendship between Mr. Clements and I. The most powerful and effective leaders are those who lead based on the same core values that they use in their personal lives. Mr. Clements was the executive director of Colorado's prison system -- where I've worked for 25 years. As significant as this impact was, the inspiration that I gained from him comes from the way that he lived his life as a husband, father, brother, son and friend. When I found out that I was accepted to the Fit Nation team, I e-mailed my entry video to my immediate supervisor, the director, and Mr. Clements so they would know what I would be doing this year and why. What I didn't anticipate was the genuine enthusiasm and encouragement I would receive from Mr. Clements.
