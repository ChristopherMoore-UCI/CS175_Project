Carey said her husband, Nick Cannon, was going through some health problems around the same time her friend Whitney Houston died. Carey's twins with Cannon, Monroe and Moroccan, celebrated their first birthday in April. "Life was a winding road, and I learned many things little ones shouldn't know." "This (BMI Icon) award is so amazing because ... this is really about songwriting and there have been many times that people have told me throughout my career that: 'This song has changed my life,' 'This song helped me get through the death of a family member,' " Carey said. " While Carey didn't go into detail about the experiences that inspired that song, she did describe what led to the creation of "Triumphant."
