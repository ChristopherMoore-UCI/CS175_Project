Spring 2013 Fashion Week: Behind-the-scenes Instagrams Kriticos, who lives in New Jersey and is an aspiring accessories designer, met her best friend in New York City for the extravaganza. Vogue, the Council of Fashion Designers of America, NYC & Company (New York City's official tourism organization) and the City of New York decided to team up to "restore consumer confidence" and "boost the industry's economy during the recession" with a one-night celebration of style, but more importantly, commerce. It was clear that something needed to happen to get people comfortable with shopping again and to remind them that their purchases were helping to support the economy and the lives of those around them that worked in fashion," said Susan Portnoy, vice president of media relations at Cond√© Nast. "It's not only about the inspiration from all around and being in stores and seeing the new line and getting excited for Fashion Week, it's everyone coming together for a good cause," she said. "We always see a little boost in sales due to the increased foot traffic that results from the excitement of the evening," said Fiona Zeman, who handles public relations and marketing for Ted Baker.
