Children are easy prey for organized crime because they lack opportunities, said Jos√© Luis Cisneros, a sociologist at the Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City. "The authorities justify that it is a drug-trafficking crime and it is treated as a regular case." Experts note that arrested children are not the only young people affected by organized crime. In the past year, there have been numerous headlines of children being arrested in Mexico. At least 30,000 children in Mexico are involved in some sort of organized crime, according to a nationwide alliance of civic and social organizations. In January of last year, a 15-year-old boy was captured in Jiutepec, just outside of Mexico City.
