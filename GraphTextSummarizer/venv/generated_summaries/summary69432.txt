It was conducted by a team of scientists led by Dr. Bryan Fry from the University of Melbourne in Australia. "The combination of this specialized bite and venom seem to minimize the dragon's contact with its prey, and this allows it to take large animals," Fry said in a statement released by the University of Melbourne. Komodo dragons are native to the islands of Indonesia. They can weigh more than 220 pounds (100 kilograms) and grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) in length. Researchers say the Komodo dragon has venom that keeps blood from clotting around its prey's wounds.
