-- Federal police have arrested a man they believe is responsible for coordinating the kidnappings of more than 70 migrants later found dead in northern Mexico last year, authorities said Friday. Violence is common in Tamaulipas, where authorities are battling rival drug cartels. The growing reach of the cartels has increased the risk for migrants crossing through Mexico to get to the United States, Mexico's National Commission for Human Rights has said. Huerta is accused of running with the Zetas and reportedly told authorities that he had directed the kidnappings of passengers on at least six buses near San Fernando, a town in Tamaulipas. Huerta told authorities he was responsible for the August abductions of more than 70 undocumented immigrants, later found dead in the northern border state of Tamaulipas, authorities said after his arrest.
