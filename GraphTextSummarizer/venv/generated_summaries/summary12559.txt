In bed with my wife, I'm feeling romantic, but then Jack (18 months) cries out. We told Jack that on his fifth birthday he'd have to sleep in his own bed, because that's what big boys do, and he agreed. Last night in bed, he said, "Hey, why do I have to sleep in the middle?" 7:30 p.m. Jack (15 months and a day) is in his crib, crying, crying, crying. Tomorrow is Jack's fourth birthday.
