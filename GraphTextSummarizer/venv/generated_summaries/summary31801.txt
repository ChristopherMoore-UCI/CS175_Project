And yet, in politics, the first rule is that elected officials should always remember to take care of their base -- elements of which, for the GOP, frown on attempts by Republican politicians to engage in "Hispandering" by reaching out to Hispanic voters and softening their tone on immigration. Or they could roll the dice and count on the assumption that -- despite what the polls say -- not all Hispanics support Obama's executive action because they oppose illegal immigration as much as other Americans. And third, according to polls, nearly 90% of Hispanic voters support Obama's executive action and about 80% of Hispanic voters say the GOP should not interfere with it, which sets up the possibility that Hispanics will punish Republicans if they continue to try to dismantle the policy. Hispanics are closer to this issue than other Americans because more of them have first-hand contact with illegal immigrants. They should stop attacking immigrants because they're frustrated by the government's response to illegal immigration.
