"Following a thorough review of the decision, we believe the court failed to give due deference to the fact that the Department (of Correction) has and continues to provide adequate medical treatment to address inmate Kosilek's gender identity disorder," said Diane Wiffin, public affairs director for the Massachusetts Department of Correction, in a statement Wednesday. "Prisoners have a right to necessary medical care, and this is indisputably medical care, as the very strong district court decision established. It wasn't until 1999, when Kosilek first filed suit after repeatedly asking the prison for treatment for her disorder, that the court recognized her medical needs, according to Frances Cohen, one of Kosilek's lawyers. That year, Kosilek began to receive psychotherapy and hormone treatments. In 2002, the court found that the Department of Correction had refused to provide Kosilek with the proper medical treatment she needed, as had been prescribed by the department's doctors.
