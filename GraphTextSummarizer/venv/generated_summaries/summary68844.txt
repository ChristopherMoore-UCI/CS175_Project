We've failed," Holder said, referring to Congress' refusal to pass stricter background checks of gun purchasers after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, last year. As instances of mass gun violence continue to spark conversations about gun control, Holder said Tuesday that politicians in Washington failed to pass meaningful gun safety legislation. -- Attorney General Eric Holder is most afraid of a terrorist attack on the United States from a so-called "lone wolf," such as the attackers involved in the Washington Navy Yard and Los Angeles International Airport shootings. Holder said he didn't support clemency for Snowden, the national security contractor who leaked the classified information about surveillance programs. Holder said Snowden could have addressed his concerns with government surveillance in other ways, such as through the court system.
