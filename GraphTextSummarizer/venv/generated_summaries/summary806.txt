The preservation seems to have taken the piece to Miami, where "Slave Labour" has turned up in the catalog of Fine Art Auctions in Miami. "This morning I had a sneaky look under said tarpaulin to find it had been removed," wrote blogger AntK on Harringay Online. But on the frequently asked questions page of his website, he poses the question: "What do you think about the auction houses selling street art?" He quotes artist Henri Matisse for his answer: "I was very embarrassed when my canvases began to fetch high prices, I saw myself condemned to a future of painting nothing but masterpieces." "Banksy gave that piece of art to our community," local council member Alan Strickland is quoted as saying by the BBC. By Saturday evening, the answer could be "someone else," at least in the case of "Slave Labour," a work of renowned artist Banksy.
