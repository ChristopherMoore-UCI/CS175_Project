Peace Corps volunteer guilty of abusing children Also last year, a Connecticut man pleaded guilty to traveling to South Africa to engage in illicit sexual conduct with children while he was a Peace Corps volunteer there. In congressional testimony in March 2011, he said, "While the Peace Corps cannot eliminate every risk volunteers face during their service, I am committed to making sure that we do everything we can to protect volunteers and provide effective support to them and their families when a tragedy occurs. And last year, an ABC News investigation reported that more than 1,000 young Peace Corps volunteers had been sexually assaulted during the prior decade. " Williams has worked with Congress to codify reforms and increase support to volunteers in the field, including hiring a victim advocate; enhancing safety and security, as well as support and response for volunteers; and improving training for volunteers and staff, the organization said.
