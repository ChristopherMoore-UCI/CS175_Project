Thompson said the plan involves intercepting food samples at the border and sending them to laboratories to examine them for possible salmonella or E. coli. The inquiry, which initially focused solely on tomatoes, has expanded to include cilantro, jalape√±o peppers, Serrano peppers, scallions and bulb onions, said Tommy Thompson, former secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, who said he has been informed of the plan. "You don't even take into consideration the thousands of people that have been sick, and how much it's cost in drugs, loss of time and mental anguish for people who are sick," Nielsen said. Since April, more than 900 people have contracted the same strain of salmonella, but its source is unclear. The rare form of bacteria also has cut about $450 million of tomato growers' income, said Thompson.
