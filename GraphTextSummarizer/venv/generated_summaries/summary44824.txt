-- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is expected to begin radiation treatment Sunday in Cuba, where he underwent cancer surgery late last month. The pope, who is on a six-day tour of Mexico and Cuba, is expected to visit Santiago de Cuba and Havana next week. Chavez has not specified the type of cancer he is battling, and the government has released few specifics, fueling widespread speculation about his health and political future. "I've decided, based on the recommendations of my medical and political teams, to begin ... radiation therapy as a complement to the surgery I had four weeks ago," the president said during comments broadcast by the Venezuelan state-run news channel VTV. His treatment is expected to last about a month, he said in a message on state media before departing.
