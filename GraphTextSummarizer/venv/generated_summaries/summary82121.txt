Michael Rankin, assistant special agent in charge at the FBI's Denver, Colorado, field office and leader of the operation to capture Harper, said he wanted to use a ruse to get close to Harper. At the end of the dirt road the FBI has officers working the command and control element, a team of crisis negotiators and investigators who will confirm Harper's identity, and a tactical unit aiming to make the arrest. Edward Eugene Harper is believed to have lived a nomadic lifestyle since fleeing Mississippi. FBI sources say they are concerned about another "Ruby Ridge incident." In the end, the arrest of Harper is nothing like Ruby Ridge.
