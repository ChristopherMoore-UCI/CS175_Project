The incidents come six months after the Federal Aviation Administration and other officials grounded the Dreamliner worldwide due to troubles with its battery system. Among the Dreamliner's innovative designs is a battery system that uses new, lightweight lithium-ion batteries. "The 787 is a great airplane and we know it will continue to receive heightened attention when reliability events occur in service," Boeing spokesperson Yvonne Leach said Sunday. The entire global fleet of 50 Dreamliners was grounded in January after two battery overheating incidents triggered concerns among safety officials. Earlier this week, a Denver-bound United Airlines Dreamliner was diverted back to Houston after a problem with its brake indicator.
