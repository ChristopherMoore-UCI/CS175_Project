Through our principal project, People for Children, we combat child exploitation that results from human trafficking -- modern-day slavery. Why do you think it's important to honor the work that these individuals are doing? Martin: Kudos to CNN for honoring the work that human beings are doing around the world, because [these Heroes] are "little gods," as I call them. Martin: Heroes represent the best of ourselves, respecting that we are human beings. Maybe someone your organization has helped that you're particularly proud of? Martin: I have many, but rescuing three girls from the impoverished streets of India in 2002 ... was a rude awakening into the reality of human trafficking. Martin: It nourishes your soul and enhances the meaning of life.
