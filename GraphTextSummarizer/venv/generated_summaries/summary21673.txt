Log Cabin Republicans President Patrick Sammon says "momentum is on our side." "Clearly, the tide is turning," said Scott Tucker, communications director for the Log Cabin Republicans. Although the group's president, Patrick Sammon, acknowledges that few politicians in either party support "marriage equality," as the group dubs the same-sex marriage issue, "it's clear momentum is on our side." Sammon and other Log Cabin Republicans pointed to a poll indicating that the party is starting to move closer to their positions. Despite his opposition to same-sex marriage, the Log Cabin Republicans said they endorsed Sen. John McCain, the GOP's presumptive Republican presidential nominee, on Tuesday because he embraces an approach to politics they want their party to return to. A CBS News/New York Times poll released Monday found that 49 percent of the delegates to the Republican convention support allowing same-sex marriages or civil unions. Twenty-four percent supported same-sex marriages, while 27 percent backed civil unions.
