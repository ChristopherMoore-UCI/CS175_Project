"As a result of this accident we will conduct a thorough review of this discipline and adopt any appropriate changes to future X Games," ESPN said in a statement, adding that Moore was "a four-time X Games medalist who fell short on his rotation on a move he has landed several times previously." ESPN says the safety of fans is also a priority. " Moore's injury was one of several at this year's Winter X Games. "We've worked closely with athletes, risk management specialists, sport organizers and event managers to ensure the safest possible conditions for athletes and spectators alike. The combination of quirky, hair-raising events that make up the X Games were once pushed to the distant margins of televised sports. ESPN says it is expanding the Summer X Games to Munich, Germany; Barcelona, Spain; Foz do Iguacu, Brazil; and Los Angeles.
