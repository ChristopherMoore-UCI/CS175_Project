But we are seeing movement in the right direction and I feel really good about where we are and think we're going to take the Senate and we're going to take it on election night," Collins said, predicting the GOP will win the 6 seats it needs to control the Senate, even if races in Louisiana and Georgia are close enough to require run-offs in the weeks ahead. That training allowed campaigns to avoid the types of gaffes and missteps that derailed several GOP candidates in 2012. Collins said the credit for the party's expected success belongs to a disciplined crop of GOP challengers and good stewardship from political handlers in Washington who provided special debate and speech training for their candidates. Asked what would happen if Democrats defied his predication and retained control of the Senate, Collins quipped, "I'll be in an unmarked grave in Kentucky," which, of course, is home to Sen. Mitch McConnell, the man who would become Majority Leader of the Senate if the GOP wins. "We are going to win the Senate, I feel very good about that," NRSC executive director Rob Collins said.
