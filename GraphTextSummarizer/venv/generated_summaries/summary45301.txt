"The Israel Security Agency established less than a day after the kidnapping ... that Hamas was believed to be behind the June 12 abduction, the ISA said in a statement Thursday "Hamas activists from Hebron,"  Marwan Kawasmeh, 29, and Amar Abu-Isa, 32,  were behind the abductions, the intelligence agency said. As the search for the two suspects continues, the IDF and ISA said Thursday several other suspects are also being questioned "for their personal involvement of the attack." After the release of the suspects' identities, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded with a comment directed at Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Both men have been arrested by Israeli security forces before, according to an ISA news release. The military said Hamas leaders and operatives were among the suspects.
