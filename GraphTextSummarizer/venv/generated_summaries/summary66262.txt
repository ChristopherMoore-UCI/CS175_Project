See the rest of UK fraud at VICE.COM We also spent time with a Nigerian underworld figure calling himself Mr. Gold, the purveyor of a strangely ingenious scheme called "wash, wash." One young fraudster explained that he first started scamming online to finance his wrestling action figure collection, though when he discovered how easy it was to obtain purloined credit card numbers, he graduated to more expensive items like sneakers, stereo equipment and large grocery orders (which, he claims, are then given to local single mothers). Gold convinces other criminals -- including, he claims, members of the Irish Republican Army -- that he has obtained large amounts of cash that once belonged to Osama bin Laden. Well, Tony Sales argues that he is now a reformed fraudster, and hopes that this documentary will demonstrate to the British government that they should employ him to help combat fraud. According to Britain's National Fraud Authority, fraud costs British taxpayers an estimated Â£30 billion ($47 million) every year; globally, the figure is a staggering $3 trillion, an amount larger than the GDPs of the United Kingdom, France, and Canada.
