While everyone agrees the relationship between Tombstone city officials and Forest Service rangers has improved in recent weeks, their differences simmer just below the surface. Tombstone is trying to repair a 26-mile pipeline that has brought mountain spring water into the city since 1881. The agency is working with the city to come up with a plan to keep water flowing to Tombstone, but it isn't standing down. Sections of pipeline simply vanished, and Tombstone's reservoir ran dry by August. It was early Friday afternoon, the first day of the Tombstone Shovel Brigade, and the rangers were out in force, hiking to the spot where dozens of volunteers worked with picks and shovels to move and bury Tombstone's makeshift water line.
