U.S. national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann is insistent the sport of soccer can match the superstar-making ability of traditional American powerhouses like the NFL and the NBA. Prior to signing a contract with U.S. soccer, Klinsmann coached his native Germany -- guiding the country during its hosting of the 2006 World Cup -- before enduring a testing period in charge of his former club Bayern Munich. "Beginning in the Fall of 2016, U.S. Soccer will add an Under-12 age group to the Development Academy program," said U.S. Soccer statement. Soccer enjoyed an upsurge in popularity in the U.S. off the back of the team's showing in Brazil, which saw Klinsmann's team finish second in its group and suffer an agonizing extra-time defeat to Belgium in the round of 16. "Soccer is a real alternative now to other sports to make it all the way to the top," the German, who led the USMNT to the second round of the 2014 World Cup, told CNN.
