-- Italian champions Inter Milan have handed a new three-year contract to veteran defender Marco Materazzi. However, last season he was restricted to just 15 outings under new manager Jose Mourinho. The 26-year-old, who resurrected his career last season after moving from Barcelona, has finalized a deal that was agreed earlier in the summer and also saw Argentine striker Diego Milito move to the San Siro on Tuesday. Inter confirmed that midfielder Francesco Bolzoni, defender Leonardo Bonucci and striker Riccardo Meggiorini will join the Grifoni on a permanent basis in an overall package including the five players worth a reported $42 million. Marco Materazzi now seems set to end his playing career with Inter Milan.
