Daniel James Murray was arrested Friday night in the parking lot of the Riverside Resort Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nevada, said Secret Service spokesman Malcolm Wiley. Murray recently withdrew $85,000 from a bank in St. George, Utah, in two separate visits and told a teller, "We are on a mission to kill the president of the United States," according to a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Utah. According to the complaint, Murray opened an account at Zions First National Bank on May 19 with an $85,000 check. A bank manager was summoned and Murray was allowed to withdraw the money without proper identification. On May 27, he returned to the bank and tried to withdraw $12,000, but lacked proper identification.
