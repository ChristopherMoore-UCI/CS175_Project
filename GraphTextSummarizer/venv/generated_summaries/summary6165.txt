"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" star Kim Richards entered rehab last week to seek treatment for alcohol abuse and "other problems," a source tells PEOPLE. Viewers have watched Richards' increasingly bizarre behavior and slurring of her words this season, which had been attributed at least in part to her taking anti-anxiety and antidepressant medications, along with an anti-seizure medication which can be used to treat alcoholism. Castmate Taylor Armstrong threw her support to Richards this week, telling Andy Cohen Monday night on his Bravo talk show "Watch What Happens Live:" "I adore Kim and I stand behind her. Everyone was really worried about her," says the source, who adds that Richards is not living with Ken, the boyfriend who was introduced as her love interest this season. During a recent episode of the Bravo show, Richards says she's planning to move in with Ken, and cameras show her packing up her belongings.
