Both have a history in law enforcement: Johnson worked briefly in the field long ago, while Walt is a legendary lawman among crime fiction readers. I get a lot of veterans and a lot of law enforcement people that give me challenge coins and say, "if you could pass that on to Walt, I would really appreciate it." This time out, Walt and his close friend Henry Standing Bear are drawn into a murder investigation after they see a young Crow woman fall to her death on the Northern Cheyenne reservation. A lot of readers come to crime fiction with the same expectations they have for literary fiction. In reality, Johnson dreamed up Walt Longmire years ago in his first novel, 2004's "The Cold Dish."
