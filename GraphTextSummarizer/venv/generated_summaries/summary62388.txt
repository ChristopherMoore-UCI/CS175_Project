How ill-fated cruise liner was raised from Italian seabed Schettino faces charges of manslaughter, causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board. Once the general alarm was sounded, he and other crew members started preparing lifeboats so those on board could abandon ship, he said. Everything seemed normal at first on the bridge, she told the court, but then she heard Schettino giving orders, and then "speaking angrily, yelling, to another officer" and telling him to obey the order. Tievoli said he met the island's deputy mayor climbing onto the ship to save passengers, which could undermine Schettino's argument that he could not get back on board after "falling" into the lifeboat. The retired captain said he had been surprised to get a call from Tievoli and then Schettino that evening because it was winter, so there were few people on Giglio to see the "salute," or close passage to the shore.
