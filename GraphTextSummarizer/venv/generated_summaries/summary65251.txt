Her daughter, 7 at the time of Hatchell's disappearance, lived with Watson. John Darby, who heads the Philadelphia police department's special victims unit, said the "long-term missing" unit began looking into Hatchell's disappearance in fall 2005. Hatchell was a U.S. Army veteran who struggled with drug addiction. He has not hired a lawyer, police said Hatchell is described as an African-American female standing 5'4" tall and weighing 135 pounds.
