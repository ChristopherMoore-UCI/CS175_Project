-- Real Madrid made a stumbling start to their La Liga title defense, as they were held 1-1 by Valencia Sunday in the Santiago Bernabeu. In the other game Sunday, Athletic Bilbao slumped to a 5-3 home defeat to Real Betis. Gonzalo Higuain put Jose Mourinho's men ahead Real ahead after nine minutes, but Brazilian midfielder Jonas Goncalves equalized just before the interval with a neat header. "I don't think we played a great game, but we did enough to win," Mourinho told the official Real Madrid website. He scored a double in four minutes, both fine individual efforts, before Pedro Rodriguez added a fourth on the stroke of halftime.
