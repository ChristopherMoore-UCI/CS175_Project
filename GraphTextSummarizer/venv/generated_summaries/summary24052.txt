-- The Consumer Product Safety Commission and Dollar Tree Stores are recalling 682,000 battery-operated Halloween lanterns that can overheat, the agency announced Thursday. The lanterns were sold from August to October at Dollar Tree, Dollar Bill$, Occasions, Deal$ and Dollar Tree Deal$ stores nationwide. "This recall involves plastic Halloween-themed lanterns designed to resemble a pumpkin, ghost and skull," a statement from the CPSC says. "Consumers should take the recalled lanterns away from children immediately, remove and properly discard the batteries and return the lanterns to the store where purchased for a full refund," the CPSC said. The bulb in the lanterns can overheat, posing fire and burn hazards to consumers, according to the agency.
