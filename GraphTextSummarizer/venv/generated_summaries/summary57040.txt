Ford announced Thursday it was shifting production away from its longtime hallmark of pickups and SUVs in favor of smaller cars. SUVs like these are having a tough time selling with gas prices at all-time highs. According to AAA, gas prices reached another all-time high Friday, with the national average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline at $3.87. "Small cars are gone within a week; SUVs are sitting here since last summer. "If gas prices stay where they are at or continue to rise, the body-on frame SUV is an endangered species and the pickup truck as a personal car is an endangered species," Brown says.
