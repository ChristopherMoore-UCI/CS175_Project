North Korea also announced last week it will cut all ties with the South and threatened to strike with military force. -- North Korea test-fired a short-range missile off its western coast in the middle of last week, according to Yonhap News Agency. Tensions have been high between the two Koreas since two attacks last year killed 50 South Koreans. In July 2009, North Korea fired a series of short-range missiles off its east coast, a move criticized by the international community. It is not the first time Pyongyang has threatened to attack Seoul.
