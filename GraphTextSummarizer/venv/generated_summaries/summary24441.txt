Defending English Premier League champions Manchester City had to come from behind twice to snatch a 2-2 draw at improved Liverpool Sunday. Arsenal, third last season, lost star striker Robin van Persie to rivals Manchester United in the close season and have lacked a cutting edge in their opening two fixtures. Both sides had chances to claim three points in a frantic finish with substitute Andy Carroll's header cleared off the line by City's new signing Jack Rodwell. "It's never a disaster to win a point at Stoke," Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger claimed after the match, urging patience as his new signing s Olivier Giroud and Lukas Podolski bed in. Liverpool responded almost immediately as a long-range free kick from Luis Suarez eluded City goalkeeper Joe Hart to put them 2-1 ahead.
