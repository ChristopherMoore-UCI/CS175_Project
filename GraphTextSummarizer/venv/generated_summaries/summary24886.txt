Bombings destroy dancer's foot, but not her spirit Folkert and Bost, both 42, are avid ultra-marathon runners, competing in events with distances of up to 50 miles. She said organizers stopped her as word spread of an explosion and people began frantically running away from the scene. He suffered non-life-threatening puncture wounds to the leg and returned last week to Los Angeles, where he is recovering, Bost said. Folkert, who is expected to fully recover, and Bost are hoping to locate the two men who treated him at the scene and the others who helped them reunite, Bost said. "It was the extreme generosity of people of Boston who offered to help that deserve the praise in the aftermath of what happened," she said.
