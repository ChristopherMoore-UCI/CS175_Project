At a campaign rally in the predominantly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir in southeastern Turkey, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan tried Wednesday to draw parallels between the oppression and persecution Turkey's largest ethnic minority has faced and the pressure he himself faced under Turkey's former secularist leaders. But not far from the rally, in the Kurdish neighborhood of Baglar, almost all of the shops were closed in silent protest against Erdogan. In his speech on Wednesday, Erdogan emphasized "brotherhood" with the Kurdish people. For nearly 30 years, southeastern Turkey has been the primary battleground for a guerilla war between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish state that has claimed more than 30,000 mostly Kurdish lives. "We went through the same suffering as you," Erdogan told a crowd of thousands of people who gathered amid rain and tight security in they city's main square.
