That legislation established authority for government inspection of food processing facilities and authorized standards for food quality, labeling and food additives. The result will be a fundamental shift in the FDA's approach to food safety from reacting to foodborne illness outbreaks to preventing contamination in the first place, agency Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill's provision would increase net government spending on food safety by $1.4 billion over five years. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a telephone briefing on the bill Monday that the legislation will give the FDA power for the first tiime to require proven, science-based policies that will reduce contamination of food grown and produced both in the United States and abroad. The agency will also be required to improve its ability to track food as it moves around the supply chain, making it easier to trace an outbreak back to its source.
