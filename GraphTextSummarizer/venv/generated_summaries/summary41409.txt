Presently, most Cubans are paid in the Cuban peso, or CUP, while the vast majority of goods on the island are available only with the hard currency convertible peso, or CUC. Neither peso is accepted as currency outside of Cuba, where, according to government statistics, most Cubans make about $20 a month from their official salaries. Convertible pesos are pegged to the U.S. dollar, while the Cuban pesos are worth only about 4 cents each. The dual-currency system is unpopular with many Cubans, who complain that the Cuban pesos they received their salaries in are not accepted in stores that carry sought-after imported goods. But its adoption is vital to restoring value to the Cuban peso," the announcement in Granma read.
