The result put Chelsea two points ahead of London rivals Tottenham, having played one more match, while Blackburn remained on 28 points in 11th behind Blackpool and Newcastle on goal difference. Arsenal stayed within two points of City after beating bottom club West Ham 3-0 in the late match, while defending champions Chelsea moved above Tottenham into fourth with a 2-0 win over Blackburn. Serbian defender Branislav Ivanovic ended a frustrating wait for the first goal with a low shot in the 57th minute, and his header from a corner 19 minutes later allowed French striker Nicolas Anelka to score his 12th career goal against Blackburn. Wigan moved a point above third-bottom Wolves following a 1-1 draw with Fulham, who earned a point when former England striker Andy Johnson came off the bench to score in the 86th minute. West Ham had lost only once in seven previous matches, but with several key players missing rarely looked like testing an Arsenal team who took the lead in the 13th minute through Van Persie after Samir Nasri dummied a low cross by Theo Walcott.
