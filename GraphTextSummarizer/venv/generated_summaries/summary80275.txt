People in the United States with smartphones that have screens 4.5-inches and larger use 44% more data than those tapping away on smaller phones, according to a recent report from the NDP group. The wider-screened devices were used to gobble up an average 7.2 gigabytes a month in data, while smaller phones had closer to 5 gigabytes. More usage means more app usage and potentially inflated wireless bills for people who don't have unlimited data plans. Larger smartphones are becoming more common, with some newer models creeping toward small tablet sizes. For now, bigger screened devices are still in the minority of phones sold, but if bigger screens do translate to more time spent on phones, it could be a smart business move for hardware manufacturers and wireless carriers to push the costlier devices.
