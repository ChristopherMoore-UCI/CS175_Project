A group called Christmas for Downtown Reading raised $1,000 from business and community donations toward purchasing a replacement tree, but a last minute change of heart means the original tree that was denigrated far and wide on the Web will stay in place. "It looks sad," City Council President Francis Acosta told CNN affiliate WFMZ last week. He told WFMZ that letting the old tree stay put would free up municipal workers to prepare the city for a coming snowstorm. But Acosta granted the tree a last-minute reprieve, according to WFMZ, saying he now wants to leave the tree that has gained so much notoriety in place as a draw for visitors to the downtown area. The 50-foot Christmas tree decorating downtown Reading, Pennsylvania, was supposed to spread holiday cheer, but instead it made some residents unhappy.
