I have no patience for people who want to kill deer because they don't like the way deer fences look. And high densities of deer directly promote high densities of ticks because deer are suitable hosts for the same ticks that spread very nasty diseases like Lyme and babesiosis to humans. People had missed deer so much that lawns sprouted statues of deer "families"â€”proud buck, doe, spotted bambino. "People against the plan to shoot deer feel that killing deer is killing nature," she said, "but actually, the deer are killing nature." If you want to bring deer densities down, you have to kill them.
