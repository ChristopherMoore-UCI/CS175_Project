Exit polls had Mujica defeating former president Luis Alberto Lacalle by a margin of 4 to 8 percentage points. In his victory speech Sunday, Mujica called for unity and asked his followers not to offend those who voted for other candidates during the first and second rounds of voting. Current Uruguayan President Tabare Vazquez confirmed the projection to reporters Sunday evening, and Lacalle conceded in a speech. Mujica belongs to the same Broad Front Party as Vazquez, who is popular. In a victory speech, Mujica said his administration will continue the policies of Vazquez.
