As parenting coach Barb once said to us, "We are all perfect parents -- until we have kids." And I came across an extensive campaign, dating back to 1999 -- years before we became parents -- drawing attention to the lack of scientific evidence about the safety of BPA, the plastic used in many baby bottles, including the Avent bottles we used. A year later, the BPA issue got in the headlines once again, and there was suddenly a mass exodus of parents from Avent bottles and the like. We read lots of sleep books and even hired a sleep consultant, but each stage of development brought a fresh batch of sleep problems. And many parents emphasized the importance of having a backup in case the favored object goes missing.
