"Looking at the story in the history books, it's wave after wave of Roman senators going after Spartacus who are defeated until [Roman general Marcus Crassus] comes in," DeKnight says. Eventually, the role of Spartacus was turned over to newcomer Liam McIntyre, who led the show's recent second season. I can't wait for everybody to see it." Update: DeKnight says he has a new show in development at Starz that could be the successor to Spartacus. After stabbing, slashing and pummeling countless enemies, Spartacus will slay his final Roman next year. DeKnight says he's been 90 percent certain for months that the upcoming third season -- subtitled "War of the Damned" -- would be the last for "Spartacus."
