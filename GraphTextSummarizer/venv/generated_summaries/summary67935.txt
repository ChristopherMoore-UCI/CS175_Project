Marussia's drivers -- experienced German Timo Glock and French rookie Charles Pic -- did take part in last week's test event, also in Barcelona, but were only able to run the 2011 car. New regulations introduced by motorsport's governing body, the FIA, require each car to pass 18 observed crash tests before it can be driven in preseason testing.

Webber vows to challenge champion teammate Vettel "Despite the fact that the MR01 has passed all 17 of the preceding tests, the regulations require the car to have completed all of the tests before running commences.
