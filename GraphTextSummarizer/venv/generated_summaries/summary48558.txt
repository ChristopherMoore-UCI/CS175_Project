The North Carolina native's August victory at the Wyndham Championship in his home state was his first PGA Tour triumph, but he said his previous success did not make his duel with Reavie any easier. -- American Webb Simpson capitalized on a last-hole collapse from compatriot Chez Reavie to win the Deutsche Bank Championship on Monday. World number one Luke Donald saw his chances of success take a hit with a double bogey at the 12th, and the Briton eventually finished tied for second place with American Brandt Snedeker and Jason Day of Australia on 13-under. Simpson, 26, then sunk a 30-foot putt to draw level with Reavie on 15-under-par, before carding two birdies in the playoff to clinch his second tournament victory in three weeks. " Reavie was disappointed to see his hopes of a second Tour win slip away, although he was pleased with the form he had displayed in the tournament.
