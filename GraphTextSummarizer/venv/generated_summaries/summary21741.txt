They have been popular on the American talk show circuit since their rescue in October and have been honored by Chilean President Sebastian Pinera and on the "CNN Heroes" show. "The amazing story of these miners captured the attention of the world for demonstrating the true power and resilience of the human spirit," Disney President and CEO Bob Iger said in a statement. -- Following in the footsteps of many other celebrities, the miners who spent more than two months trapped underground in a Chilean mine are "going to Disney World." Disney is picking up the tab for the miners, their rescuers and their immediate families during a six-night stay -- January 27 to February 2. The group will serve as honorary Grand Marshals of a Main Street U.S.A. parade.
