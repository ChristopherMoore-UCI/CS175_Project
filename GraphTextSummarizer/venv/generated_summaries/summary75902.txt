Yibrehu added that sales of Tej wine are increasing internationally as social media and international wine competitions raise awareness of alternative African wines. Matome Mbatha, market manager at Wines of South Africa, said that wine is becoming increasingly popular on the continent but the industry is still in its infancy outside South Africa. He added: "The process of production and sustainability of wine in African nations, other than South Africa, still has a long way to go in order to be competitive in the global market. We are still to see another African country produce wine at the level and quality of South Africa." South Africa may be the dominant force in Africa's wine economy, but as the continent's middle class emerges and disposable incomes increase, entrepreneurs in some unlikely destinations are making inroads in the fine wine industry.
