The American, who beat Sharapova in the French Open final, could face a rematch of last year's title match with fourth-ranked Pole Agnieszka Radwanska in the semis. The 31-year-old will first take on Luxembourg's 77th-ranked Mandy Minella, who lost in the first round last year. Murray, last year's runner-up, is seeded to play France's world No. 7 Nadal has been seeded a lowly fifth despite his successful comeback from long-term knee injury, which culminated in a record eighth French Open title this month. Radwanska is drawn to meet China's former French Open champion Li Na in the last eight.
