She said she had been approached to host "SNL" three times "many, many years ago," but declined because she associated the show with New York, and as a California girl, "I'm so not New York." White got her start in show business in 1949 on a local television show. -- Comedian Betty White -- currently enjoying a career resurgence at age 88 -- said Wednesday that she credits her longevity in the entertainment industry to "sheer blind luck." "I'm the luckiest old broad that ever drew a breath," White told CNN's "Larry King Live." And to add to her current hot streak, White recently signed on to be a series regular on a new TV Land cable channel sitcom titled "Hot in Cleveland" opposite Jane Leeves, Wendie Malick and Valerie Bertinelli. White has also continued her work for animal health and well-being, including a 46-year partnership with the Los Angeles Zoo, calling it one of her two loves in life -- alongside show business of course. White admitted to King that she was nervous about the May 8 show and said she finds herself questioning, "What are they doing with me?"
