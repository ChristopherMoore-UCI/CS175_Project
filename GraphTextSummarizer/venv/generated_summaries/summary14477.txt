On Monday, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) and United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) announced their decision to allow some children ages 11 or younger to receive additional priority for lung transplants, including lungs from older donors, according to a statement from UNOS. The new policy change to allow some child recipients to receive lungs from adult donors "is meant to provide an appropriate balance for a specific group of candidates," a UNOS statement said Monday. -- A year ago, Sarah Murnaghan, an 11-year-old Pennsylvania girl, was fighting for her life while her family waged a campaign to change a national policy on lung transplants for child recipients. "Sarah receiving adult lungs means she is now breathing on her own," her family said last year, "after three years of being tethered to machines. Sarah's parents fought to change the policy regarding lung transplants because their daughter suffered from a lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis.
