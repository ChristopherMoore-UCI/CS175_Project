Authorities immediately recognized Hilton as the passenger, the arrest report said, but police did not want to release the vehicle to her following Waits' arrest because of the continuing investigation and also because of the strong odor of marijuana emanating from the SUV. Police pulled alongside a Cadillac Escalade in which Hilton was a passenger about 11:30 p.m. and smelled "a strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle," according to the arrest report. Hilton was released from jail Saturday morning after authorities determined she was not a flight risk, Lt. Wayne Holman told CNN. The police lieutenant who wrote the report, identified as D. Flynn, said he approached the vehicle and told Hilton she needed to get out, as police were going to search it for drugs. -- Prosecutors in Clark County, Nevada, filed a felony charge against Paris Hilton on Monday stemming from her arrest over the weekend on suspicion of cocaine possession.
