I was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on CNN's "Finding Jesus," which premiered Sunday evening. It is apparently fulfilled in Jesus' silence during his trial (e.g. John 19:9-10), but in all four Gospels, Jesus is vocal on the cross, and in the end he cries out with a loud voice (e.g. Mark 15:34 and 37), so the drama makes good sense there. I was really thrilled to be involved, and I loved working with the production team behind "Finding Jesus." This has long intrigued those who have studied crucifixion because there is some anatomical plausibility here -- nails through the wrists would support the body better than nails through the palms of the hands.
