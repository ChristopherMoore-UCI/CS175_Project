Antigua Pasteleria del Pozo, 8 Calle Pozo, Madrid; +34 915 22 38 94 Blikle (Warsaw) Reportedly a favorite of General Charles de Gaulle and Pope Paul II, Blikle, which opened in 1869, is still a family business. Five years later Stohrer opened this pastry shop on Rue Montorgueil in Paris, and it's been serving royalty ever since -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II stopped in during her 2004 state visit to France. Maison Bertaux, 28, Greek St., Soho, London; +44 20 7437 6007 Cafe Tortoni (Buenos Aires) OK, we said oldest "European" pastry shops, but anyone hunting for a bit of France in Buenos Aires should check out Cafe Tortoni. Ruszwurm Cukraszda, Szentharomsg utca 7, Budapest; +36 1 375 5284 Confeitaria Nacional (Lisbon) An ornate pastry shop with cream-colored walls trimmed in gold and overlooked by a mirrored ceiling, the Confeitaria Nacional opened in 1829 in a stately corner building on the Praca da Figueira square. Anyone visiting the 13th-century Matthias Church in Budapest could do worse than following their tour with a sugary pick-me-up at nearby Ruszwurm Cukraszda.
