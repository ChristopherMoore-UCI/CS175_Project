So Americans must choose between the two and conservatives must make that choice clear: higher taxes, higher spending and more government services, or opportunity and upward mobility with lower taxes and less government interference. One relies on low taxes and limited government interference, the other on high taxes and government redistribution of resources. If $16 trillion of national debt and the huge deficits each year aren't spending problems, then what is? The recent elections seem to indicate that a majority of the American people want lower taxes for themselves but approve of the president's increased spending programs. He campaigned ad nauseam about the need for a balanced approach to deficit reduction, but the latest fiscal cliff deal is almost entirely tax hikes and even includes more stimulus spending.
