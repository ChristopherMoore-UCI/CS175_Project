The blaze has made 32 homes uninhabitable and damaged five, but is no longer a major threat to other structures, Reno Fire Chief Michael Hernandez said Sunday. The Caughlin Fire in Reno burned 1,935 acres before firefighters contained the blaze, said Sierra Fire Protection District Chief Mike Brown, the incident commander. Investigators believe -- though have not confirmed -- that high winds caused electrical arcing on a power line, which sparked the fire, Hernandez said. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but Hernandez said his department has ruled out that the blaze started at a homeless encampment or that teenagers seen in the area were responsible. -- Firefighters in Nevada have fully contained a wildfire that engulfed dozens of homes and burned nearly 2,000 acres, an incident commander said Monday.
