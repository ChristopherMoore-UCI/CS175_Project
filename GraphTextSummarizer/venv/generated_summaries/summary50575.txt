There are certainly some people who have been brainwashed by Russian TV channels (Ukrainian stations have been cut off in Crimea) and do believe in lies that in Russia Crimea will be given all kinds of advantages and privileges. Will Russian troops try to invade eastern regions of Ukraine where Russian provocateurs have been trying to cause trouble, too? It is unsafe to be pro-Ukrainian in Crimea right now, as the region is controlled by Russian military and hired thugs. -- Some people believed that one of the most democratic ways out of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was to let people of Crimea decide their fates for themselves through a referendum. Are you in Ukraine, Crimea or Russia?
