Colorado shooter Karl Pierson had written plans to attack at least five areas of Arapahoe High School on his arm, as well as the Latin phrase for "The Die Has Been Cast," the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday. According to police accounts, Friday's shooting began at 12:33 p.m. when Pierson, 18, walked into Arapahoe High School armed with a pump-action shotgun, a machete and a backpack containing three Molotov cocktails, a bandolier of ammunition across his chest. They also offered prayers "for the entire Arapahoe High School community, as we know your lives are forever changed by this horrific event. We cannot begin to understand why Karl did what he did," Barbara and Mark Pierson said. He shot 17-year-old Claire Esther Davis once in the head amid shots fired randomly into school hallways.
