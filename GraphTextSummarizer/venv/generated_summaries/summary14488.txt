Harris, who has been living in Watts at least since its 1960s riots, said the savings account program teaches youths discipline and the importance of savings -- as well as letting them know she and her group are there to support their college dreams. Twice a year, she tries to instill the importance of saving money for college by offering any youth $5 -- if and only if the youngsters place that money in a savings account. She feels strongly about the programs she runs because of the inspiration she personally received: it was her own mentor who opened up Harris's savings account for her decades ago. Harris operates her micro-giving program through Kinecta Federal Credit Union and Nix Financial. While some may doubt whether such a notion could succeed, Harris can count 40 youngsters who took up her offer over the past three years -- and are now going to junior college.
