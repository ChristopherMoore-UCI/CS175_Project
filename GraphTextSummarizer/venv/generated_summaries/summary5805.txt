Watch Valdespino-Torres take a walk around the girls' old haunts Â» "Going out" sometimes meant reading for grade-schooler Sonia Sotomayor. A fixture on the debate team and in student government, Sotomayor was even a part of change inside Cardinal Spellman -- helping to write a unified constitution when male and female classes merged in 1971. In the summer, Sotomayor and Valdespino-Torres would sit on the stone steps of Blessed Sacrament -- Sotomayor's Catholic grade school. In the lunchroom Sotomayor would "hold court," various friends from her school years told CNN, sharing opinions on policies and social problems. Sotomayor also spent time with her cousins, who lived in now-dilapidated apartments marred by broken windows.
