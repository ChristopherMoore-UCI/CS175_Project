One of the problems of the Internet is that we didn't install what I like to call strong user authentication or strong file authentication. Forty years ago today, the Internet may have uttered its first word. I basically supervised the creation of the Internet at the first node, both in the first connection and the very first message. We had just by then connected the first two host computers to the Internet. The first one was on September 2, 1969, when UCLA connected its host computer to the first packet switcher, the first router if you will, ever on the Internet.
