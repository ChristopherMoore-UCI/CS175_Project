The Sultanate's 2013 budget was built on oil projections of $85 a barrel, with energy making up 80% of total revenues. That may be today's narrative in a climate of so much uncertainty, but policymakers and energy planners in the region say it is way too early to call an end to the long term trend of rising emerging market demand. But when asked if there could be a further push on the upside for crude as a result of what is transpiring regionally, he said: "That could be true, and that would be beneficial for us because we still depend largely on oil prices for our budget revenues." It is now producing about 935,000 barrels a day, according to energy officials who spoke to me on background. It is clear emerging markets are beginning a slowdown which will likely cut demand for crude oil over the next year.
