The result left Marquez on his own at the top of the championship standings, while Lorenzo dropped to third behind race winner Dani Pedrosa. However, the threat to Lorenzo's status as world champion is coming from an unexpected source -- Honda's rookie MotoGP rider Marc Marquez. -- When Yamaha announced that Valentino Rossi would return to the champion motorcycling team this season, many wondered if he would be able to repair his previously fractious relationship with teammate Jorge Lorenzo. The 20-year-old has won his last two battles with Lorenzo, becoming the youngest winner of a top-level race in Austin, Texas last month and then on Sunday edging his fellow Spaniard into third place after an audacious final-corner overtake which saw the two bikes make contact. "Unfortunately, I didn't have enough pace at the beginning because we did not find the right balance," said Rossi, who is also fourth overall -- 18 points behind Marquez ahead of the next race at Le Mans.
