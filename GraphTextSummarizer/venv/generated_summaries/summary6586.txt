As locals and security forces began confronting militants, analysts monitoring the violence trends in Benghazi have been concerned about an escalation in violence and shift in tactics used by these groups. One group many have accused of being responsible for attacks on the security forces is Ansar al-Sharia, the same group the United States believes attacked its consulate in Benghazi last year, killing U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. A security official told the state news agency LANA that a suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into the Barsis checkpoint -- about 50  kilometers (30 miles) east of Benghazi -- killing and wounding security forces and civilians who were in the area. Ansar al-Sharia has denied involvement in the attack on the consulate and other acts of violence targeting security forces. "This cowardly act is an attempt to obstruct the strenuous efforts made by members of the national army, with the Thunderbolt (special) forces at the forefront, to establish security and preserve the life of citizens in Benghazi," the government said in its statement.
