-- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher is "flawed," according to ex-Formula One star Stirling Moss, who claimed the German will not be in the hunt for motor racing's biggest prize in 2011. Moss, 81, wrote off Schumacher's chances of winning an eighth world title, and stated the former Ferrari racer's previous triumphs devalued the achievement of becoming world champion. Schumacher has expressed his determination to improve next season, and said the whole Mercedes team is focused on winning in 2011. "The fact he is carrying on next year is interesting, although quite frankly, I wouldn't be worried if I was up against him, The fact he was a seven-time world champion ruins what being a world champion is all about. Schumacher returned to F1 this year with the new Mercedes team, having retired in late 2006, but the 41-year-old struggled to make an impact as he finished the season in a disappointing ninth place.
