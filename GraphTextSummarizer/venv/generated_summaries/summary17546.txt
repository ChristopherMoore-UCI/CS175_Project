A decade later, his legal team gave evidence to the district attorney of Thibodeaux's innocence and an investigation -- which wound up involving hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of DNA testing, forensic evidence and interviews -- got under way. Primarily on that basis, Thibodeaux was convicted and sentenced to death in October 1997, it said. Asked what might have led Thibodeaux to confess, Scheck said, "That is something that we're studying and is part of the lessons to be learned here. He said Thibodeaux was the 300th person exonerated through DNA testing. Connick "joined the Innocence Project and Thibodeaux's other counsel in agreeing to overturn Thibodeaux's conviction and death sentence after his confession to police was determined to be false," the district attorney said in a statement.
