Accused serial stabber Elias Abuelazam never took a bite, Genesee County Sheriff Robert Pickell said Thursday. But if convicted of attempted poisoning, Franklin could face up to 15 more years behind bars, Pickell said. Five of the attacks were fatal, Genesee County prosecutor David Leyton has said. Pickell said Franklin apparently targeted Abuelazam after the two "had some words with each other. Pickell said Franklin had nearly completed all of his time for a simple assault charge and was a trustee: a nonviolent prisoner who qualified for jobs that could help reduce his sentence.
