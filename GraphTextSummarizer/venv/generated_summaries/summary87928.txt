-- As the Ukrainian military warns of plans to assault this rebel-controlled city, separatist militants are thinning on the streets and their leaders are canceling public appearances. In a dim labyrinth beneath a government building, dozens of women and children sleep on mattresses they carried below ground to take shelter from the violence. They say they believe separatists who have told them the Ukrainian army are American-backed fascists, set on attacking ethnic Russians. Government security officials said Monday they were preparing for a "massive assault" on Donetsk, state media reported. "They are unworthy, because they are fascists, the government, why do they have to shoot innocent people?"
