Late last week, Rolling Stone chatted separately with E Street Band guitarists Steven Van Zandt and Nils Lofgren about the new E Street Band and how they're carrying on after the loss of Clarence Clemons. It was quite interesting to have that reinforced and have it be totally integrated in the work -- not doing either extreme as a sort of specialty, gimmicky show, but actually having those roots so firmly planted in the material -- and to be reminded how wide and varied the identity of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band actually is at this point. Rolling Stone: It was a pretty bold move to debut the new band and new show at the Apollo, considering it was being broadcast live. Rolling Stone: You guys almost always do rehearsal shows before launching a big tour. I think probably what happened is that we were putting our own show together, which inevitably heads towards rehearsal shows.
