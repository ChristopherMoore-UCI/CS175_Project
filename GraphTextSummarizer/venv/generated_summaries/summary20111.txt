Not only is Lance Armstrong posting to Twitter from the race, but a Chalkbot -- a robot that writes in water-soluble paint -- is scribing messages onto the road, offering inspiration to the competitors and to cancer survivors. Kent said many of the messages drawn by the Chalkbot are from cancer survivors or their friends and family. The Chalkbot ad campaign ties in with Livestrong, nickname of the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which is devoted to cancer research and was founded by U.S. cyclist Armstrong, a cancer survivor. The Chalkbot takes input from text messages and Twitter posts sent by the public. Nike's Web site shows messages written by a Chalkbot on the Tour de France course.
