-- Several commercial fishing areas that were closed because of the BP oil spill had an "emergency reopening" Saturday, Louisiana officials said. Those areas closed to commercial fishing now match the areas closed to recreational fishing, the agency said. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reopened 5,144 square miles of Gulf waters on Tuesday for commercial and recreational fishers to catch finfish, saying that since July 3 its data have shown no oil in the area. Commercial fishing reopened for finfish and shrimp in portions of state waters in Lafourche, Terrebonne, Plaquemines and Jefferson parishes, the department said in a statement. Some of the environmental damage to the Gulf of Mexico since the April 20 rig explosion and subsequent spill appears to have abated in recent weeks.
