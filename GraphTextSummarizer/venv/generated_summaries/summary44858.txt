Google launched the Android Market web store in February, and just last week it officially enabled in-app billing, allowing developers to charge customers for items purchased within an application. In addition, a several developers have made six-figure revenues from Android apps, with a couple scoring million-dollar paydays. Those who wish to go outside the walled garden of Apple's iOS (but don't necessarily want to jailbreak their phones) can do so fairly easily on an Android device -- or they can use alternative app stores, like Amazon's. Of the 69.5 million Americans who owned smartphones as of the end of February, 33 percent used Android devices, according to a report from ComScore. Developers also expressed concern over the fragmentation of the app ecosystem on Android, saying they generally preferred a "unified, single-store experience like Apple's App store."
