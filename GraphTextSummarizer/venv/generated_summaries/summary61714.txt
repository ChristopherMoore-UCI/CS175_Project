Despite our considerable success in managing HIV infection and improving the length and quality of life for people living with HIV, there is no well-documented case of anyone being truly cured of HIV disease. HIV vaccine development has been frustrating and challenging for a number of reasons, including the fact that the virus mutates rapidly, hides from the immune system, and targets and destroys the immune system cells that are successful in fighting and clearing most other viruses from the body. With HIV we will have to do better than nature if we are to develop a vaccine; HIV is unlike the situation with other viral diseases such as measles and influenza, where we have been able to mimic natural infection and induce protective responses with vaccines.

My complete talk will be available as a webcast at the conference Web site, but let me give you the quick bottom line: I am cautiously optimistic that we will be able to cure some patients under certain circumstances, and I am also cautiously optimistic that we will develop a vaccine that will protect some people against HIV infection, or slow the progression of disease in some patients who do get infected.
