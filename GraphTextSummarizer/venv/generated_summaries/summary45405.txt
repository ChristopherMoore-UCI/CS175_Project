The FBI has joined the search for Jimenez, now the subject of an international manhunt, and a federal warrant charging Jimenez with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution was issued Friday in U.S. District in Chicago, said FBI Special Agent Ross Rice. Jimenez also told "a close associate" that he was leaving Illinois and "if questioned by law enforcement, the associate should tell law enforcement he went to Mexico," Wentz said in the affidavit, filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago. The 30-year-old suburban Chicago husband being sought in the stabbing death of his new bride told an associate he was heading to Mexico, where his parents live, according to an FBI affidavit released Friday. On Sunday, Jimenez told his sister by phone that he and Estrella Carrera, 26, "had a bad fight, and he left her bleeding," FBI Special Agent R. Brian Wentz said in an affidavit. Jimenez and Carrera were married May 11 at Chicago City Hall, according to authorities.
