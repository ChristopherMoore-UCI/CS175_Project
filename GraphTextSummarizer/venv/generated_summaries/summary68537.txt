In today's China, the demand for sports has gone beyond Olympic gold medals and national pride. There is nothing wrong with the obsession towards winning, after all, that's what elite competitive sports is all about but there are other emerging trends that might change the face of sports in China. -- Since China took part in the Olympic Games in 1984 after a three-decade absence, competitive sports have served one purpose -- to build national pride. Compared to the 200 marathons held each year in Japan, China still has a long way to go but there is a new enthusiasm for sport at the grassroots level. To serve this calling, many kids who were identified as potential elite athletes were enrolled into the government supported "sports schools."
