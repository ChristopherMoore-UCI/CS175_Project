School officials have gotten some criticism for sending a letter to parents asking students to bring canned goods to attack would-be intruders. It's part of active shooter response training offered by the ALICE Training Institute, a company founded by a former police officer and former elementary school principal. That's one scenario Valley, Alabama, officials are considering as part of their training to respond to school shootings. "We realize at first this may seem odd; however, it is a practice that would catch an intruder off-guard," the letter reads, according to CNN affiliate WRBL. That's when canned goods and other classroom items come into play.
