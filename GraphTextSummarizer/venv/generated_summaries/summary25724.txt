"With respect to Sen. Rubio, Univision covered the issue in the same objective and impartial manner in which we cover all important news," Isaac Lee, president of Univision news, said in a written statement. Five Republican presidential candidates are boycotting a proposed Univision debate because of what they say were unethical reporting practices by the Spanish-language network in how it handled a story concerning Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. "Univision did not offer to soften or ignore the report about an anti-drug raid that involved the family of Sen. Rubio. " Rubio, the former Florida House speaker, is a freshman senator and a star among Republicans, who talk about him as a possible running mate on the GOP ticket next year. The candidates who have agreed to boycott the debate are former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, businessman and former Godfather's Pizza CEO Herman Cain, and Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota.
