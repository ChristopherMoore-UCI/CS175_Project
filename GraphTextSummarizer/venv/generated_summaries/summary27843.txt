And with more than a year to go before the first Iowa caucus meetings, potential candidates are already putting their teams together for the long slog and signing on for pre-primary cattlecalls. So far, nearly every  2016 hopeful has accepted the invitations to speak, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. On Jan. 24, Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King will co-host the inaugural "Iowa Freedom Summit" with the advocacy group Citizens United. There will be even more 2016 speculation later this month when a handful of possible candidates attend a gathering in Iowa. The RNC went on to adopt changes to the primary calendar at the party's Winter meeting in 2014, where they shrunk the official primary season by pushing the first contest back to February 2016 and holding the party convention in early June.
