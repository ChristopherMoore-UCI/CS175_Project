While authorities have found her bike, authorities continue to search for her body, Dunklin County Prosecuting Attorney Stephen Sokoloff said. In addition to murder, Sokoloff said in a statement Saturday that Morgan is charged with armed criminal action and tampering with physical evidence. According to a probable cause affidavit dated Saturday, police interviewed Morgan on Friday at the police department in Kennett, a larger community about 10 miles northeast of Senath. Sokoloff added -- and the Dunklin County court clerk's office confirmed -- that Morgan does not yet have an attorney. It says Morgan told police he put the girl's body into the same trash bag, and then drove to Missouri's Highway 164 and got rid of the body by throwing it over a railing into a floodway ditch.
