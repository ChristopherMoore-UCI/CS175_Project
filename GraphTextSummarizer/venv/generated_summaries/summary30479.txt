"Almighty and eternal God ..." begins the Jesuit vows: In other words, members of religious orders make a promise to God to live simply. This is a key characteristic of Jesuit prayer: asking the person to use their imagination and let God work through that. Since then, that question been answered several times by Pope Francis, who in gatherings with his brother Jesuits has spoken of "We Jesuits." Often you will hear Pope Francis say something similar to what he said in a homily recently to a parish in Rome when he asked parishioners to close their eyes and imagine themselves in a Gospel scene, in this case at the Jordan River at the Baptism of Jesus. With the "G8," the Pope is replicating the familiar Jesuit model of governance.
