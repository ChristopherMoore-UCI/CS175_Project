-- An American sailor fatally shot two female sailors before shooting himself Monday inside a U.S. military barracks in Bahrain, the Navy said. Bahrain, a U.S. ally, is an island nation in the Persian Gulf, wedged between Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The alleged shooter, a male, survived the self-inflicted gunshot and was in critical condition at a military hospital in Bahrain, the Navy said. The motive for the shootings is unclear, but the Navy said the incident was not terror-related and it involved only U.S. military personnel. A Navy spokesman in Bahrain refused to provide any other details about the incident.
