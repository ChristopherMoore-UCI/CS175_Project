Brad Pitt, Shia LaBeouf nearly fought with Scott Eastwood "I went through like an existential crisis, which turned into an exploration, really," LaBeouf told DeGeneres. That's how the 28-year-old actor, who'll next star alongside Brad Pitt in October 17's "Fury," described his recent behavior on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show Friday. (The charges were later settled with the agreement being that LaBeouf would continue seeking treatment for alcohol addiction.) In June, he was charged with disorderly conduct, harassment and criminal trespass after being accused of drunken and disruptive behavior in a Broadway venue.
