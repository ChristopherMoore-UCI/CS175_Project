Delta CEO opposed to allowing small knives on aircraft "If the purpose is to increase security checkpoint flow, there are much more effective steps we can take together to streamline the security checkpoints with risk-based screening mechanisms," he wrote in a letter to Pistole. In addition, the additional responsibility of assessing which knives meet the new requirements could be a distraction for already overburdened screeners at TSA checkpoints, potentially leading to increased wait times and decreased security." In a letter to TSA Administrator John Pistole, the Massachusetts Democrat expressed concern about the new policy and asked it be reversed. The rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage. -- Echoing an airline chief and flight attendants, U.S. Rep. Ed Markey came out Saturday against the Transportation Security Administration's move to allow small pocketknives on airplanes, calling it unnecessary, counterproductive and potentially dangerous.
