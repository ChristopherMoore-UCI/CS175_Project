During earlier court proceedings, mental health experts said Hinckley had done little to make friends in Williamsburg and expressed concern about him isolating himself. -- A lawyer for John Hinckley Jr. is demanding Secret Service surveillance records from a trip the presidential assailant took last March to see his mother. But St. Elizabeths told Friedman last August, that a key part of its outpatient plan for Hinckley had fallen through when a care facility said it would not provide group therapy sessions in Williamsburg. Barry Levine complained at a court hearing on Thursday that the Secret Service provided an inaccurate report of one of Hinckley's periodic trips to Williamsburg, Virginia. He compared government prosecutors in the case to Captain Ahab in the novel "Moby Dick" and said they are engaged in a "maniacal pursuit of Mr. Hinckley."
