"It means fewer hospital admissions, it means fewer emergency room visits, it means fewer doctor visits," said Janice Nolen, assistant vice president of the American Lung Association. Areas with a high level of nitrogen dioxide have decreased an average of about 40%, said Bryan Duncan, an atmospheric scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Nolen, who produces an annual report called State of the Air, pointed out that these pollutants are a separate concern from greenhouse gases, which are blamed for climate change, and were not measured in this report. Nitrogen dioxide is a yellow-brown gas that can cause respiratory problems like coughing, asthma, and trouble breathing. " The Supreme Court in April upheld an EPA rule intended to further reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide that blow across state lines.
