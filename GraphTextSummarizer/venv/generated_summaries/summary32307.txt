Paraguay's President on Saturday named a new interior minister and national police chief following clashes between police and peasants that left at least 17 dead. Peasants in eastern Paraguay opened fire Friday on police trying to evict them from private property, initiating the deadly confrontation, local authorities and state-run media said. Police said the peasants had been camping on land owned by Blas Riquelme, a businessman and politician active in the South American nation's Colorado Party. Rodriguez lamented the loss of life, but said the peasant leaders did not order the attack on police. The president named Ruben Candida Amarilla as the new interior minister, and Arnaldo Sanabria Moran as interim police commander.
