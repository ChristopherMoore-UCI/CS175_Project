"I always knew I could play this well, that l'd get far in these tournaments, but it's different playing like that in practice from bringing it onto the match court at big occasions with pressure," said Watson, who lost in the first round last year and in 2010. She cruised to a 6-1 6-4 win over American Jamie Lee Hampton to move past the second-round stage of a grand slam event for the first time and set up a clash with Polish third seed Agnieszka Radwanska. -- U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur suffered another early Wimbledon exit as she crashed out to unseeded Dutch player Arantxa Rus on Wednesday. Top seed Maria Sharapova, who beat Errani in the Paris final, will resume her second-round match against Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova on Thursday. But French Open finalist Sara Errani made it through to the second round without having to hit a ball on Wednesday.
