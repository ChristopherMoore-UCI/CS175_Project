Haylee Donathan, her mother, Candace Watson, and Robbi Potter were discovered after hiding for the past week at The Morning Star Ranch, a retreat in Valley Center, near San Diego, said Peter Elliott, United States Marshal for the Northern District of Ohio. Potter and Watson were still using the same vehicle, a 1980s blue Chevrolet pickup truck they drove from Ohio, Elliott said. Elliott also praised intense national news coverage from programs such as HLN's "Nancy Grace" and "Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell," as well as local media and Clear Channel, which put up missing child billboards across the country. When she is returned to Ohio, Haylee will be placed in the custody of her grandmother, Elliott said. Late Tuesday, Haylee was in the custody of a children's protective services agency in the San Diego County area, Elliott said.
