Politics: Romney gaining buzz among women on Facebook The genius of the American electorate is in how voters ultimately sort out what is necessary to make a decision, and what is not, discarding the detritus of evening news sound bites, and rhetoric regurgitated on late night panels during the country's endless process of choosing a president. Still, after a half century of observing American voters, I find it uncanny how they always gravitate to what's the most important to them. Having once ghost-written words for men who ran for president (Eisenhower, Nixon, and Ford), I admired the craftsmanship: "His name is Mitt Romney, and you really should get to know him." That was the last time this happened in American political history. If Mitt Romney loses, he will still know that no other candidate's wife ever worked so hard to explain her husband to the American people.
