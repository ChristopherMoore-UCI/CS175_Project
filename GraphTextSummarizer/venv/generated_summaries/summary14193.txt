More than 3 million young adults have gained insurance coverage after family coverage was extended through age 26. Although many have made bold claims about how this law will impact coverage by private and public insurance, we simply won't know until we see the data from our major household surveys of insurance coverage, available in the fall of 2014. And 71 million Americans with private insurance, as well as 25 million enrollees in Medicare, have gained coverage for at least one free preventive service. But the fact that the slowdown has persisted even as the economy has improved, and the fact that costs have grown more slowly even within the Medicare program whose enrollees are largely protected from economic shocks, suggests that the ACA is playing some role in this historic slowdown. The next key time to check success will be the fall of 2014, when the government releases its initial figures on the changes in insurance coverage.
