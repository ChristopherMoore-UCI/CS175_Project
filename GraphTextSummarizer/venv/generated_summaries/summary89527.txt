A 21-month investigation into allegations that the Federal Air Marshal Service has a hostile work environment -- rife with discrimination and retaliation -- has concluded that no "widespread" problem exists, according to an internal government e-mail obtained by CNN. While investigators have remained silent about their work, air marshals contacted by CNN say they provided evidence of a wide range of misconduct, including a supervisor who ran a private security business while at work, supervisors who perjured themselves in sworn testimony against subordinates, and instances of favoritism, racism, sexism and discrimination. But several air marshals said they are eager to read the report, and say they will dispute any conclusion that discrimination and retaliation are not widespread. The survey asked air marshals if favoritism ever played a role in promotions, job evaluations and mission assignments; whether air marshals have ever been discriminated against or harassed on the job; and whether they feel they can report misconduct without fear of retaliation. A Federal Air Marshal Service spokeswoman declined to comment on the pending report and government e-mail Tuesday.
