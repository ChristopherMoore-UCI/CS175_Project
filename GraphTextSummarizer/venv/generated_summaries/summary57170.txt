"My deepest gratitude goes to all of those who have contributed to the positive outcome with great dedication, constancy and professionalism." Mariani, 54, was seized by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a sub-Saharan offshoot of the terrorism network, in the Algerian Sahara in February 2011, Italian news agency ANSA reported. She is expected to return to Italy on Wednesday, Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reported. An Italian woman kidnapped in southern Algeria over a year ago has been freed, Italian Foreign Minister Giulio Terzi said Tuesday. Another Italian, non-governmental organization worker Rossella Urru, was kidnapped last October by the same group and remains in their hands, the Italian foreign ministry said. The Italian government has not given details of how Mariani's freedom was secured.
