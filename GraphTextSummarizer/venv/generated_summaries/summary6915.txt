Indeed, faithless electors are not fanciful creatures from mythology: Nine of the past 16 presidential elections have witnessed faithless votes (including two of the past three). Attempts to curtail faithless votes reflect a very real concern lawmakers and party officials have about the prospect of faithless voting. Efforts to prevent elector faithlessness, like the Uniform Faithful Presidential Electors Act, would provide greater assurance in the presidential selection process, a process where many citizens already have great concerns. Consequently, just two Republican defections or abstentions would have denied the ticket of a majority of electoral votes and thrown the contest into the House of Representatives. While unlikely, this begs the question: Why do presidential electors still have independence in our current presidential selection process?
