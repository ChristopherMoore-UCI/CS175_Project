The diminutive dinosaur likely hunted insects, small mammals and other prey, perhaps even baby dinosaurs, said Nick Longrich, a paleontology research associate in the University of Calgary's Department of Biological Sciences. "It's basically a predator of small things," Longrich said. Longrich co-wrote a paper on the dinosaur with University of Alberta paleontologist Philip Currie. -- Canadian researchers say they have discovered the smallest known North American dinosaur, a carnivore that roamed areas of the continent 75 million years ago and weighed less than most modern-day house cats. Albertonykus borealis, a 2.5-foot-long insectivore, had been previously thought to be the smallest North American dinosaur.
