It was December 21, 2007, three days before Isabel's first Christmas. My mom became Isabel's surrogate parent for almost eight months because I needed to focus on my husband. I remember one night in the ICU, the nurses got a rocker for me from the NICU and made me sit with Isabel in Ben's room. We worried about the relationship between Ben and Isabel. Isabel doesn't see Ben as a quadriplegic.
