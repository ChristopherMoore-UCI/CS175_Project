Von Brunn has been charged with the murder of museum security guard Stephen Johns. Museum shooting suspect James von Brunn remains in a Washington hospital. In court documents filed Wednesday, an investigator says the pornography was found on a desktop computer during a search of an Annapolis, Maryland, apartment where 88-year old James von Brunn had been living for the past two years. Officials allege von Brunn used a .22 caliber rifle, which was found at the scene, to shoot Johns in the chest. The FBI also searched a red Hyundai that law enforcement officials say von Brunn left double-parked in front of the museum right before the shooting.
