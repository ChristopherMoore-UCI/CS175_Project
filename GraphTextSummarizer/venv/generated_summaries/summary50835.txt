"We saw that the dad was actually picking kids up and throwing them into the water, and people were just frantically scrambling to get off the boat," Care Corradin told CNN affiliate WJZ. -- Six people were hospitalized after a boat exploded at a Maryland marina, an official with the Anne Arundel County Fire Department said Monday. Brian Albert of the Maryland Natural Resources Police, which is leading the accident investigation, said two of the children were transported to the Johns Hopkins burn center. Six children, all of whom are 13 or younger, were injured, Lt. Jack Bell said. Bell said the boat got gas at the marina, and the 32-foot vessel, with nine people aboard, stalled when it left the dock just after noon.
