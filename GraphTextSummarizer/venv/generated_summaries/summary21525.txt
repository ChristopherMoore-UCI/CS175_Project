Mourinho -- who is the first coach to ever lead four different teams to the Champions League semifinals -- told ITV Sport: "Anything can happen in a semifinal, but we have two other matches to come against Barcelona before then and must concentrate on those games first." Jose Mourinho's side held a comfortable lead from the first leg at the Bernabeu but, despite that advantage, the Real Madrid coach still decided to play his strongest side at White Hart Lane. The result means that Barcelona and Real Madrid will now clash four times in just 18 days in what will be a monumental series of 'El Clasico' encounters. -- An error from Brazilian goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes saw Real Madrid win 1-0 at Tottenham on Wednesday to reach the semifinals of the Champions League 5-0 on aggregate. And the visitors had to hold on in the first 45 minutes as Tottenham had two good penalty appeals turned down, while Gareth Bale had the ball in the Madrid net, but his goal was ruled out for offside.
