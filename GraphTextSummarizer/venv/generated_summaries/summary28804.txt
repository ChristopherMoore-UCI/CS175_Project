-- Country singer Trace Adkins suffered "a setback in his battle with alcoholism" and has entered a rehab facility for help, his representative told CNN on Thursday. Adkins was a finalist on NBC's "Celebrity Apprentice" in 2008, but lost out to Piers Morgan. His autobiography -- "A Personal Stand: Observations and Opinions from a Freethinking Roughneck," published in 2007 -- details a long list of close calls with death and battles with personal demons. He is the father of five daughters, but told CNN's Piers Morgan in 2011 that he would never win a father of the year award because of the demands of his career keeping him from his family. He won the "All-star Celebrity Apprentice" last May, raising $1.7 million for his charity, the American Red Cross.
