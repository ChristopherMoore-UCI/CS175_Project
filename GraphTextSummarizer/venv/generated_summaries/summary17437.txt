-- Dengue fever has killed 25 people and affected more than 6,000 over the past two months in Lahore, Pakistan, a health department spokesman said Monday. In total, 6,400 cases of dengue fever have been documented, said Ikhlaq Ahmed, spokesman for the health department of Punjab province. The 25 who died are all from Lahore, in eastern Pakistan. Of those, 6,000 are in Lahore, a city of more than 6 million people known as Pakistan's cultural capital. "We prefer to stay at home rather than going shopping," because of the threat of disease, said Zainab Khan, a 25-year-old professional from Lahore.
