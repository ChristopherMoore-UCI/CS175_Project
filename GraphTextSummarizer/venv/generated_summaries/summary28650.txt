The Pan American Games, which take place from July 10 to July 26, involve nearly 7,000 athletes from Latin America, South America, the Caribbean and North America. Two days before the Ottawa attack, another Canadian soldier in Quebec was run over and killed by man whom the Royal Canadian Mounted Police described as "radicalized." Saunders said the tunnel found about 82 feet west of a fence that separated a densely wooded area from tennis courts at Rexall Centre, a tennis and entertainment complex on the grounds of York University. In October, a soldier was shot and killed as he stood guard at Canada's National War Memorial in Ottawa. The mysterious tunnel measured more than 6 feet in height, nearly 3 feet in width and about 33 feet in length, Toronto Police Deputy Chief Mark Saunders told reporters Tuesday. "That tells me that this was nailed inside the tunnel on the wall," Saunders deadpanned as the room erupted with laughter.
