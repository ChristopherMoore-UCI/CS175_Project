As to exactly what she'll do, and with whom, she didn't say much Thursday, dodging a question about whether she will be joined by her Destiny's Child bandmates or her husband, critically acclaimed rapper Jay-Z. While Alicia Keys and Jennifer Hudson (the latter singing with the choir from Sandy Hook Elementary, the Connecticut school where 20 children were killed in December) also will perform, Knowles will command the stage once the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens break for halftime. Calling herself a perfectionist who will typically "practice until my feet bleed," she conceded worrying about potential problems during "a live television show" taking place outside on a chilly Washington day. It was the same tune she sang just over a week ago at the inauguration of President Barack Obama Yes, Beyoncé can sing -- all by herself, thank you very much. But on that momentous occasion, Beyoncé admitted on Thursday, she had some help.
