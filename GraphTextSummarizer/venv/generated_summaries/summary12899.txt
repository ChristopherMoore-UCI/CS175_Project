But eliminating the restrictions on transgender service membersâ€”and embracing them as equal and respected members of our nation's armed forcesâ€”does not require the repeal of any law. Since the ban can be lifted without waiting for Congress, there is no reason for delay: The Obama administration should immediately announce a moratorium on firing transgender service members, and begin implementing a policy of inclusion. The commission, which I co-chair, conducted an analysis of foreign military forces, as well as U.S. military experiences of previously excluded populations. President Obama has made it clear that when Congress will not help him solve the nation's problems, he can and will take executive action to get meaningful work done. If, after joining the military, service members are discovered to be transgender, they are fired.
