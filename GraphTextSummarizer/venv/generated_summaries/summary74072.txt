-- A pillar of black smoke billowed over downtown Lynchburg, Virginia, after a train carrying crude oil jumped its tracks and caught fire Wednesday afternoon, city officials said. Between 12 and 14 cars from a CSX freight train were involved in the derailment, which occurred along the James River and left oil burning along the river's surface, city government spokeswoman JoAnn Martin said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was monitoring the air at the request of state officials, EPA spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. CSX said three of the cars caught fire after the derailment, the cause of which wasn't known Wednesday. In March, environmentalists warned against having trains hauling oil from North Dakota's Bakken shale pass through downtown Lynchburg en route to a storage depot in Yorktown.
