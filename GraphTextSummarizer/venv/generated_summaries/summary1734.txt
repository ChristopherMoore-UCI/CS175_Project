-- Eman al-Obeidy, the woman who claims forces loyal to Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi raped her, spoke Tuesday with her mother, who has come to her defense, for the first time since her ordeal began. Nobody is standing by me here in Tripoli." Asked by Cooper if she were still trying to leave the capital, al-Obeidy said, "How can I possibly get out of Tripoli when Tripoli is under siege? CNN's "AC360" spoke with al-Obeidy Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. There are only two ways to get to my family, by way of Tunisia or through the eastern zone and they're both under siege. Al-Obeidy burst into the Rixos Hotel in Tripoli on March 26 while international journalists staying there were having breakfast.
