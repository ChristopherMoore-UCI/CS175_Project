"Encouraging users to share that they are organ donors is another simple and non-controversial move Facebook can make to add value to the service beyond the traditional status updates and photo sharing," wrote Brittany Darwell, lead writer at the blog Inside Facebook, in an e-mail to CNN. "We could save thousands more lives a year if we had another 20, 30, 40 million more people registered," said David Fleming, president and CEO of Donate Life America, which is partnering with Facebook in this effort. The Facebook page also includes links to Donate Life America for people to become official donors. He described widespread acceptance of organ donation as "a shift in society that will probably take a while to fully take hold" until more Facebook users start sharing their experiences. Organdonor.gov also recommends that people who want to be donors inform family members, tell their doctors and include this wish in their wills.
