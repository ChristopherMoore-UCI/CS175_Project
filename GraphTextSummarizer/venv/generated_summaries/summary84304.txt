By leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state, local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners, I know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all. All of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast-to-coast. In addition to preservation, HUD is also working to create new affordable housing. To keep this momentum going, we've asked Congress to increase HOME funding by 16% to keep building affordable homes, prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation. We're also doing the same with public housing.
