"Visuals have become so much more important since televoting was introduced in 1998," said Sam Broderick, a writer for ESC Nation, one of the most popular Eurovision fan websites. In 1997, fan website House of Eurovision founded the "Barbara Dex Awards," an annual prize for the worst dressed artist. Germany's 1958 entry Margot Hielscher performed wearing a sash saying "Miss Jukebox," and brandishing vinyl records at the audience. -- One of the perennial criticisms of Eurovision is that, for a song contest, the compositions are seldom very memorable. Attention-grabbing outfits have always been part of Eurovision's DNA.
