"The moment we got the emergency call from the fishermen at 7 a.m. we immediately intervened and started coordinating the rescue operations," said coast guard spokesman Filippo Marini Abrahalli Amare, 23, was one of the lucky few who were eventually rescued. Because of its location as the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a common destination for African refugees seeking to enter European Union countries, and shipwrecks off its shores are common. There's been criticism more was not done to help, that the Italian Coast guard was too slow to respond, that they spent precious time filming footage of the rescue instead of saving more lives. Survivors mourn victims of Italy shipwreck 13 days at sea "We left our country because of hardship, so that we could live in peace and help our families," said Abrahalli Amare, 23.
