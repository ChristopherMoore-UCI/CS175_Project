Try and schedule uninterrupted blocks of time for relaxed, freewheeling creative thought. Let abstract ideas and vague impressions flow where they will. Rewards and punishments for meeting or missing deadlines, if needed at all, should be vague and mild so they don't contribute added pressure. Insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness. Insightful thought is at its best when your powers of inhibition are weaker, because reduced focus opens up your awareness to remote associations that wouldn't come to you when you're feeling sharp.
