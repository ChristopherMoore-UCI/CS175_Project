YouTube has hosted a small number of "event" live streams, but this is the first time it is getting into territory pioneered by such players as uStream, Qik and Justin.tv. YouTube isn't saying just how many live casters it will enable from day one but that it intends "to provide thousands of partners with the capability to live stream from their channels in the months ahead." YouTube Friday began hosting live streams. But it will also help minimize the chances of "Chatroulette moments" for a service which, despite the vast volume of material it accepts and hosts, still studiously tries to keep NSFW material off its site. It's clear from the new YouTube Live page that there is more than enough to get the ball rolling with quantity and variety.
