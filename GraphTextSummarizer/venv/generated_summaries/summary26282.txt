" Rewards for Justice said Umar was believed to be in Pakistan, continuing to train al Qaeda terrorists and other extremists. Midhat Mursi al-Sayid Umar was among four "heroes" killed last week, an al Qaeda statement says. Umar, who is also known as Sheikh Abu Khabab al-Masri, was on the U.S. State Department's list of 37 wanted terrorists, and the U.S. had offered $5 million for information leading to his death or arrest. Umar, a 55-year-old Egyptian, ran a chemical-and-explosives training camp for terrorists in Derunta, Afghanistan, before the fall of the Taliban, U.S. officials said. "Although Abu Khabab is gone, he left behind him a generation who will seek revenge and punishment with God's help," the al Qaeda statement said.
