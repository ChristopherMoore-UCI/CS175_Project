-- As expected, Katie Couric is leaving CBS Evening News, her representative, Matthew Hiltzik, told CNN on Tuesday. Couric, 54, took over the CBS news show in 2006. "I have a lot of areas of interest and I want to be able to fulfill all of that." Couric told People she is considering a show format that will allow her to "engage in in more multidimensional storytelling." "The bottom line is that I love doing all kinds of different stories," Couric told People. After weeks of speculation, Couric broke the news in an exclusive interview with People magazine.
