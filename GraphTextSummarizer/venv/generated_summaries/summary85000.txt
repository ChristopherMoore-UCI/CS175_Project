But the fear I felt about the possibility of airstrikes was put into perspective when I met 7-year-old Abdel in a Syrian refugee camp on the Lebanese border with Syria. The sadness and fear I saw there were years beyond his age, reflecting the extreme violence and horror he has witnessed -- sights and sounds of war that most of the world will only see in the movies. Gupta: At refugee camp, nothing makes sense For the seven days I was there, most of the kids in the camp followed us in a gaggle, circling us at times, giggling and practicing their English -- "hello" and "thank you." When I got on the plane last week, it seemed that U.S. or allied airstrikes on Syria were imminent, and honestly, it was pretty scary. -- I never imagined I would find myself in Lebanon, on the outskirts of the brutal civil war in Syria.
