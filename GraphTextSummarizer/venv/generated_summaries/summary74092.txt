O'Brien's 21-year-old son Joseph -- who won the York race last year on Declaration of War -- had to drop considerable weight to continue his regular ride on Australia. " Australia was sired by Galileo, who also won the Epsom Derby, Irish Derby and Irish Champion Stakes, while his mother is a two-time European Horse of the Year. Champion Australian sprinter Black Caviar then took over from Frankel at the top last year before retiring undefeated in 25 races. Australia, a three-year-old trained by champion Aidan O'Brien, romped to his fifth win in seven starts on Wednesday to add another notable victory to his resume. "Joseph said that leaving the paddock in the Derby he felt like he was a two- or three-year-old, but today leaving he felt like a five-year-old," he said.
