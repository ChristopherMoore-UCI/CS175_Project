As things stand now, supporters need at least seven votes from Republicans, the party most closely aligned with NRA views on gun rights. -- The nation's powerful gun lobby has faced headwinds from vocal lawmakers, a galvanized presidential administration and an American electorate that polls show favors tougher gun laws following December's school massacre in Connecticut. "If you have 100 missiles coming at you and you knock out 99, I would say you were successful," Richard Feldman, president of the gun rights group, the Independent Firearm Owners Association, said of efforts by gun rights groups. The Manchin-Toomey amendment will be one of perhaps dozens to be debated on the broader package of gun laws pushed by President Barack Obama following the shooting deaths of 20 first-graders and six educators at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Though smaller gun rights groups, such as the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, support the measure, the NRA reiterated its threat to hold those who back the compromise politically accountable.
