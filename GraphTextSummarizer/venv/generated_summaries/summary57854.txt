One child was in critical condition and the three others were in serious condition, New York Fire Department Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta said. The building, which has 20 apartments, was evacuated, as were apartment buildings on both sides, Scoppetta said. New York police said the blast was at the rear of the structure. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the five-floor building after the explosion. Although the blast was still under investigation, Scoppetta said the cause appeared to be a gas leak.
