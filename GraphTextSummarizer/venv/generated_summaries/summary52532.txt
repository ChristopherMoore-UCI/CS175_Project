"I don't think Iran wants nuclear weapons to launch a first strike against Israel. After the birth of the nation of Israel in 1948, it and Iran enjoyed a "honeymoon" that lasted until just before the 1979 Islamic revolution, David Menashri, professor emeritus of Tel Aviv University, told CNN last year. In the escalating conflict, the United States has always said, in the words of Obama last year, that it has "Israel's back." "The United States has no stake in concluding an agreement with Iran that leaves Israel angry, aggrieved and vulnerable. In the years after the Iran-Iraq war, however, Israel began to regard Iran and its support of global terror as a chief threat. " Washington said the changes called for in the agreement will make Iran less of a threat to Israel.
