Second, Congress should make fighting for or supporting ISIS an affirmative renunciation of American citizenship. Third, we should do everything possible to make ISIS understand there are serious ramifications for threatening to attack the United States and for killing American civilians. It is my hope that this legislation will attract bipartisan support, and will bring Washington together with one united voice in support of keeping Americans safe from ISIS acts of terror. We should concentrate on a coordinated and overwhelming air campaign to destroy the capability of ISIS to carry out terrorist attacks on the United States. Obama to Congress: No vote needed on ISIS strategy America is blessed to have good friends and allies who understand the threat of ISIS, and we welcome their support.
