In a statement this week, the CDC said quarantine inspectors meet arriving aircraft and ships reporting ill passengers or crew to assist them in getting appropriate medical treatment. CDC officials removed the man and his daughter while other passengers remained on board. Burchett and other passengers were critical of the response. "If the flight crew of a commercial aircraft arriving in the U.S. becomes aware of an ill person on board which may include a person with Ebola symptoms, the captain is required required by law ... to report the illness to the nearest U.S. Quarantine Station, who will arrange the appropriate medical response at the flight's destination airport," the statement said. The passengers were released at 1:50 p.m. and permitted to go through customs, said Erica Dumas, a Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesperson.
