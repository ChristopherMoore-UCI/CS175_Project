A transitional government, appointed after the coup leader agreed to a deal with West African nations to hand over power, is supposed to be working toward the restoration of democracy. The West African nation was plunged into chaos by a military coup in March that ousted former President Amadou Toumani Toure. The protesters, women and children among them, gathered in the city center in the northern town of Gao on Tuesday morning. Ag Badara said the situation in Gao was tense Tuesday. The country was in the past hailed in the West as a beacon of stability and model of African democracy.
