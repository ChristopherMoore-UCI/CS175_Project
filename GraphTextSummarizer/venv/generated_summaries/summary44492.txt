"If these groups have cells in Xinjiang, if it can be confirmed that ISIS members were recruited from China, if we are already becoming a ground for recruitment for these people then China has a stake in keeping ISIS away from its borders," said Xie. While China, along with Russia, has blocked U.N. Security Council action on Syria during the three-year civil war, both Chen and Xie said that China would likely support a generic resolution that condemns terrorist atrocities and authorizes an international force to target ISIS. With a long-held ethos of non-interference in other countries' affairs, risk-averse China is perhaps an unlikely ally in President Barack Obama's pledge to "degrade" and "destroy" ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Criticism The United States has been critical of China's reluctance to get involved in international security issues given its expanding global interests. "I think China in principle will quietly support this idea to curb ISIS," says Chen Dingding, an assistant professor of government at the University of Macau.
