The particles from forest fires, he said, actually inhibit rainfall contributing to regional drying and warming, which creates a weather cycle conducive to fires. " Anatomy of a bush fire: How Australia's explosive forest fires work A nation built on fire Fire has been part of the Australian landscape since the dawn of time and its people have used fire as a farming tool for more than 40,000 years. Known as fire-stick farming, this mosaic of fire management systems not only flushed out game such as kangaroos and possums, it created new growth which in turn attracted more game. According to David Bowman, professor of forest ecology at the University of Tasmania, who has studied bushfires for more than 30 years, bushfire behavior is showing signs of change. One thing that is being noticed by scientists is that black carbon from forest fires is landing on ice sheets and accelerating ice melt.
