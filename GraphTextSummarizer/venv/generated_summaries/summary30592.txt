Others being treated include a county road worker and two sheriff's deputies, Fresno County Sheriff Margaret Mims said. The pair of deputies who provided aid also went for treatment for ringing ears and sunburn-like conditions, she said. The exact cause of Friday's blast is under investigation, Mims said, but it happened at the spot where a county worker was operating a front loader. After the blast, Mims said, two sheriff's deputies who were at the firing range ran toward the fire to move the injured. The most serious injuries were suffered by a group of inmates who were assigned to maintenance and cleaning work at the sheriff's firing range.
