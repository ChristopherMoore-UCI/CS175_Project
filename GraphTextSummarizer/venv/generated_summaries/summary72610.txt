Boal, who has worked with cephalopods for more than 20 years, believes that Paul's first pick may have just been pure luck and that he has been picking the German flag since his Euro 2008 days because the sea creature has learned to do so. Yet when kept in captivity, as Paul has been, they must often be trained to accept prepared food, Henley said. " Then what about the red and yellow in the German and Spanish flags that Paul has been consistently attracted to? LaCasse said that at the New England Aquarium, which has a giant Pacific octopus, marine biologists usually give the animals Plexiglas boxes with different latches, lids and arrangements to see if they are able to retrieve their food. Henley, the Smithsonian Zoo animal keeper, said that fans will have to wait until Sunday to see whether the octopus will be able to prove to the world his powers.
