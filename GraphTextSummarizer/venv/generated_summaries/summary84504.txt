Consumers who can't get enough of these pop culture icons have plenty of artistic options to choose from this year, both online and at art and craft shows. But unlike your local art fair show, Etsy is a growing business where its sellers made a combined $314.3 million last year in gross merchandise sales and more than $146 million so far, this year. They are part of the hottest craft trends for 2011, according to organizations like craftster.org, that track the $29.2 billion dollar craft and hobby industry in the U.S. An increase in handmade technology accessories and vintage patterns for clothes are popular, too, as art and craft enthusiasts find new ways to develop their creative talents. "People want their devices to have a look and feel that reflects their personality." Rich and Brenna Neeley of Orange County, California, are among the artists on Etsy.com that cater to this niche of craft items. As fashion designers experiment with advanced techniques, material combinations, and modern finishes, they're drawing more and more inspiration from vintage patterns and designs, said Roselli.
