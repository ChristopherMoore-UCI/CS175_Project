" In Atlanta, Fulton County Elections Director Richard Barron said the rapper's request for an absentee ballot came in Friday, October 24. The department sent out the absentee ballot via U.S. Postal Service on Monday, October 27, Barron said. He was unable to confirm whether Lil Jon received the absentee ballot, because the department does not track the status of mailed ballots. Lil Jon, who is registered to vote under his real name, Jonathan Smith, emphatically announced Tuesday in an all-caps message on social media that he was on a 6 a.m. flight from Los Angeles to Atlanta. The office of Georgia's secretary of state confirmed Tuesday that its website has been experiencing intermittent problems on Election Day.
