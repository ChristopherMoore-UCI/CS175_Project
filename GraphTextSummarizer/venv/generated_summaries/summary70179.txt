To put it simply, the GOP might soon see it as in its own interest to boost turnout among young voters and voters of color, instead of writing them off or, as still happens too often, blocking them from voting at all. It would be great for the country if both parties in earnest developed new policy ideas that address the hopes and dreams of millennial voters and voters of color. I'd love to see young and nonwhite voters tell candidates from both parties that they are not to be taken for granted, and I'd love for each party to try to outdo the other not just in raising money but in raising turnout across the board. Meanwhile, GOP leaders such as Sen. Rand Paul have been engaging millennial voters on campuses and elsewhere with an unapologetic libertarianism that resonates with some young people. As President Barack Obama lamented in his post-election press conference Wednesday, two-thirds of voters chose not to vote, making it perhaps the lowest midterm turnout since the 1940s.
