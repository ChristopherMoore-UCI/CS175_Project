Action must come in the form of bipartisan comprehensive reform passed through Congress." RELATED: Potential Bush bid sways none in GOP field Those comments could put Bush uncomfortably at odds with similar moves -- though smaller in scope -- by both his father, George H.W.

It's a win-win," Bush said.
