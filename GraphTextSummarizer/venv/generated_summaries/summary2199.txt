" Campbell is on a trip through Asia that comes after the death last month of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and his replacement at the country's helm by his son Kim Jong Un. On Thursday, South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-Hwan said his country is "open to dialogue" with the new North Korean leadership, despite harsh recent comments from Pyongyang. Kim said he did not know how much influence Kim Jong Un had in his own country, underlining once again how little is known about the new North Korean leader. -- Representatives of South Korea, Japan and the United States will meet "in the near future" to discuss North Korea, a U.S. State Department official told reporters Friday in Tokyo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The United States currently has about 28,500 military personnel stationed in South Korea, which North Korea claims is the main impediment to reunification of the Korean people.
