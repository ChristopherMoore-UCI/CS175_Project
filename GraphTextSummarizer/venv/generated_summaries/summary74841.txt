In 2011, the then minister of foreign affairs Diana Ablonczy spelled it out in a press release: "Consular officials CANNOT (her capitals): ask your mother-in-law to leave your house, purchase tickets for a musical or entertainment event, settle disputes between you and your partner (and), pickup your dog at the airport. They include the man who asked consular staff in Rome to translate a phrase for his new tattoo, and a woman who complained about the poor quality of football boots "made in China. In a policy brief, "Consular Conundrum," published in March 2013, author Alex Oliver lays out the case for a charge, nothing that "expectations of what our diplomats can or should do for distressed travelers overseas are climbing, and in some cases becoming more unrealistic." and "Could DFAT feed my dogs while I'm away?" In the past, Canadian officials have also found the need to remind travelers of what they can and cannot do. The answer seems obvious," writes K. Shanmugam, the country's minster for foreign affairs, with an almost audible sigh.
