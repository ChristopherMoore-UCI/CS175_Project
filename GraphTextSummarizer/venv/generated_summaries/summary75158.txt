" In recent years, the NFL has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field, adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to more independently evaluate injured players. "Despite overwhelming medical evidence ... the NFL not only failed to take effective action in an attempt to protect players from suffering, but failed to inform players of the true risks associated with concussions," the statements said. "It stands in contrast to the league's actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions." Lewis, 32, played for the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns, ending his career in 2009. " Part of the problem, said former Atlanta Falcons linebacker Coy Wire, is a sports culture that encourages behavior largely out of step with the now recognized risks associated with head trauma. It's also unclear whether players' claims can be considered outside their current collective bargaining agreements, and whether the allegations are subject to a statute of limitations, most notable for players like Kuykendall, 53, who played for the Atlanta Falcons during the 1970s.
