By early Monday, the National Weather Service lifted the last of widespread tornado watches in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Iowa and Illinois after threats of another furious outbreak of tornadoes never materialized. The Woodward storm was one of dozens of tornadoes believed to have been spawned by a furious storm system that wreaked havoc across large swaths of 10 states in the Midwest and Plains over the weekend. The man, whose name has not been released, died at a hospital in Amarillo, Texas, about 160 miles away, Woodward emergency manager Matt Lehenbauer said. Two other victims, Derrin Juul and a 10-year-old girl presumed to be Juul's daughter, died when powerful winds rolled their car several times, Woodward Mayor Roscoe Hill said. "It's remarkable that we didn't have more loss of life in Woodward," she said late Sunday afternoon.
