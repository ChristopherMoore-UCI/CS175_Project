The unit researches old war records and combs battle sites and aircraft crash sites in some of the most remote locations around the world. Lt. Col. Lisa Franklin is a forensic odontologist -- a dentist who compares dental remains to dental records to make an identification. Another identification technique is comparing mitochondrial DNA found in bones -- not the same type that can be extracted through saliva or blood -- to DNA extracted from a maternal lineage. I am proud of that," says Lt. Col. Raul Gonzalez, who works at JPAC managing 18 teams who search for remains. If they find enough evidence that remains are present a recovery team is sent back to the site to dig for remains.
