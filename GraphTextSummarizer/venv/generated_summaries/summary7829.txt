Child protection officials said they found a "pervasive pattern" of sexual abuse on the ranch through forced marriages between underage girls and older men. Texas authorities initiated the seizure of the 1,600-acre ranch where prosecutors say polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs and others sexually abused children, officials said Thursday. Authorities provided the residents with copies of court orders directing the state to take possession of the forfeited ranch, state officials said. The children were returned to the complex after the Texas Supreme Court ruled the state had no right to remove them and lacked evidence to show they were in imminent danger of abuse. Critics of the sect say girls are forced into "spiritual" marriages with older men and sexually abused.
