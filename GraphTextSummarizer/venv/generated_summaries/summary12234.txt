" The crackdown killed more than 60 suspected al Qaeda militants in Yemen from April 19 to April 21, Yemeni officials have said. U.S. Special Operations troops have played a role in the offensive, in part by flying Yemeni forces to a remote, mountainous spot in southern Yemen. Al Qaeda gunmen killed at least two people Monday, including a French employee of the European Union's mission to Yemen, in one of the latest acts of violence in the country's capital after the government's crackdown on the terror group, two high-level Yemeni government officials said. Three Yemeni Interior Ministry officials said two French nationals died and another French national was injured. Operations have included attacks by Yemeni commandos and suspected U.S. drone strikes, according to a Yemeni official.
