"He was in the Dodge Intrepid that we told the media to look out for," said Gwinnett County police Cpl. -- Just as police were starting a manhunt in the killing of four people, the suspect drove back to the crime scene in suburban Atlanta, Georgia. Gwinnett County is northeast of Atlanta. Two women and one man died at the residence near the Gwinnett County Fairgrounds, Spellman said. The fifth victim, a 4-year-old child, underwent surgery late Thursday, and another person escaped unharmed, Spellman said.
