Two of the three victims were critically wounded at Monroeville Mall in Pennsylvania, authorities said. The third was in stable condition with injuries that were not life-threatening, Monroeville police Chief Kenneth "Doug" Cole said. A man who shot three people at a Pittsburgh-area mall Saturday has been arrested, police said Sunday. "We don't know why the mall is having the problem it's having." "Back in the '90s, we had shootings down there ... associated with gangs and drug activities," Cole said. A series of fights at the mall forced it to close temporarily in December, CNN affiliate KDKA said.
