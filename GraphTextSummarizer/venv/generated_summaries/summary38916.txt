Although football helmet safety has improved since the days of leather helmets, today's voluntary football helmet safety standards don't take our modern understanding of concussion risks into account. Research indicates that multiple concussions may lead to dementia and lasting brain damage, and more concussions happen in football than in other sport. We now know that multiple concussions can lead to lasting brain damage and should be treated as a serious matter." The good news is that concussions are being treated as a serious matter, more and more. It requires that coaches be trained about concussions and brain injuries, and that students who suffer concussions must stay on the sidelines for at least a week, and until a medical professional approves his or her return to play. The standard for reconditioning used football helmets also does not specify how often these old helmets must be recertified.
