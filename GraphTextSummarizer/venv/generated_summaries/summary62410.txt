The festivities included election sites where children could vote in a mock presidential vote. -- Costa Rica's first female candidate held a two-to-one lead in the country's presidential election, as the second-place candidate, Otton Solis of the Citizen's Action Party, conceded defeat. The legacy of outgoing President Oscar Arias -- a Nobel laureate who leaves office a popular, if polarizing leader -- has in many ways shaped the presidential race. In addition to president, Costa Ricans also cast ballots Sunday for two vice presidents, 53 congressmen and 495 councilmen. Polls showed Chinchilla garnering 47.3 percent of the vote, with 24.9 percent of election sites reporting.
