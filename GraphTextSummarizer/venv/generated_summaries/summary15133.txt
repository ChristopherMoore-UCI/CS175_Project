Perched atop the mausoleums is a veritable sea of solar panels, connected by cables that channel the electricity into a small transformer station at the top of cemetery hill, which connects to tall electrical towers nearby. She approves of the solar panels, and said that's partly because another brother installs solar panels in Valencia. There are more solar panels planned for the cemetery, and Serret said a dozen other cities in Spain and Mexico have expressed interest in following their lead and are considering installing solar panels in their own cemeteries. But the cemetery has many advantages over the other locations in town for solar panels, Bellette said. -- We traveled by metro to the Barcelona suburb of Santa Coloma de Gramenet, where the phrase over my dead body takes on a new meaning; it's the first town in Spain that has placed solar panels in its municipal cemetery and has been attracting global attention and causing local discussion.
