Atlanta Movie Tours boasts of many connections in the Georgia film industry, but when it came to pinpointing the top-secret "Hunger Games" locations, "a lot of what we did involved good old-fashioned detective work," Burns said. Enter Atlanta Movie Tours, which has seen success with two tours based on "The Walking Dead." "Film and television tourism in Georgia has exploded in the past five years, and we would like to think we have had a hand in that," founder Carrie Sagel Burns said. In Atlanta, the gorgeous Swan House -- part of the Atlanta History Center -- stood in for President Snow's mansion in the "Hunger Games" franchise, and the Goat Farm Arts Center was a location for many important scenes as Katniss' home of District 12. Georgia -- along with New Mexico and Louisiana -- has seen a moviemaking boom in recent years, so those looking to see where their favorite scenes were shot no longer need to fly to Hollywood or New York. The sequels in the popular "Hunger Games" movie saga were all filmed in Atlanta, including the No. 1 movie of 2014, "Mockingjay Part 1."
