-- An EMT worker who was involved in a controversial incident in which a pregnant woman died last year was shot and killed Sunday, New York police said. No arrests had been made as of Sunday afternoon, and NYPD homicide Detective Richard Tireli said that "the investigation is ongoing. Rennix's coworkers said Green and a fellow EMT were in the cafe when Rennix collapsed but  the two EMTs reportedly told the co-workers to call 911 and left the cafe without aiding the stricken woman. " Meanwhile Brooklyn authorities said Sunday their investigation into Rennix's death was continuing. Following the incident, the fire department suspended the two EMTs  without pay for but were reinstated shortly thereafter, EMT spokesman  Robert Ungar said Sunday.
