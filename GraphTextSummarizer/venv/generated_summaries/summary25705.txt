Toddlers (1 to 2 years old) -- 11 to 14 hours per day • Preschoolers (3 to 5 years old) -- 11 to 14 hours per day • School age (6 to 13 years old) -- 9 to 11 hours per day • Teens (14 to 17 years old) -- 8 to 10 hours per day • Younger adults (18 to 25 years old) -- 7 to 9 hours per day • Adults (26 to  64 years old) -- 7 to 9 hours per day • Older adults (65 and older) -- 7 to 8 hours per day Sleep deprivation is such a rampant problem that last year the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called insufficient sleep a public health epidemic. It also suggests waking up and going to bed at the same time every day, using bright lights to help wake up, avoiding naps and avoiding heavy meals, alcohol and cigarettes at night. The other group went through sleep hygiene education intervention, which changes daily behaviors and other factors believed to be causing sleep problems. Australian researchers reviewed 26 previously published studies and found that napping beyond age 2 is linked to poor quality sleep at night.
