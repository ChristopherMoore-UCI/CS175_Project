At first, it looks like a typical classroom scene, with students attentively listening as human resources teacher Idalia Hernandez Ramos presents the day's lesson. Hernandez then repeated the words used against her -- b*tch and whore -- in front of the shocked group of students. -- After a student made obscene comments about her on Twitter, a high school teacher in northern Mexico taught a lesson with an online post of her own: a video showing her confronting the girl in class. She then points to several other students recording the incident on cell phone cameras and tablets and demands an apology. The eight-minute video gives a glimpse of a lesson that students at the science and technology high school in Mexico's Tamaulipas state aren't likely to forget.
