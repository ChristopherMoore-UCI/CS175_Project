However, security forces barred opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi from the gravesite of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old woman shot in election protests on June 20, witnesses and news reports said. -- Security forces in Iran on Thursday confronted thousands of protesting Iranians across the city, first at a cemetery and later at a prayer venue and near a government building, witnesses and news reports said. A witness said riot police and Basij militia were at the scene, but the confrontations with people in the crowd involved the militia. It was not clear if Moussavi was in the vehicle, but people were sitting atop and around the car as if to protect it. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said using force to "break up a group of people who were trying to exercise an important ritual in Islam, the mourning after 40 days," was "particularly disturbing." "We stand by the Iranian people who are exercising their universal right to self-expression and demonstrating peacefully," Kelly said.
