A security official with the U.S. Embassy in Yemen was shot dead on his way to work Thursday, Yemeni officials said. "We are deeply saddened by the killing," said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. "Motorcycle attacks are currently al Qaeda's main tactic," a senior Interior Ministry official said, adding that such attacks "are easier for terrorists to coordinate and plan for." The shooting took place along Siteen, a main street in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, which is generally considered one of the safest, officials said. Interior Minister Abdulkader Qahtan is overseeing that investigation, said a Yemeni government official not authorized to speak to the media.
