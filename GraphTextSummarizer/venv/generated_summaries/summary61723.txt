"This cannot be explained by saying this is historical conservation, It is not that, it is about money," said Ece Demirel, an activist with the Urban Movement Forum, an organization that tracks development projects across Turkey. Erdogan's policy on Syria, which many in Turkey blame for a twin car blast that killed at least 52, as well as a new law that would prohibit vendors from selling liquor from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., are part of the sit-in at Taksim Gezi Park. Police deployed tear gas earlier Thursday at Taksim Gezi Park. "This is an uprising, a protest against the increasing bans," said Michelle Demishevich, an activist and member of Turkey's Green Party. Public outcry over the proposed project, as well as two police interventions against the demonstrators with tear gas, has drawn more people to the park.
