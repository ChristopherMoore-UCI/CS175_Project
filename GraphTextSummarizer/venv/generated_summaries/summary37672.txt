Hearne City Attorney Bryan Russ Jr. said Officer Stephen Stem told Golden to drop her weapon at least three times. A man believed to be a relative of Golden's made the 911 call asking for help from police, Robertson County District Attorney Coty Siegert said. Stem fired three times, and Golden was hit at least twice, he said. Community members told CNN affiliate KBTX that Golden, known affectionately as "Ms. Sully," was a sweet woman. The Hearne Police Department placed Stem on administrative leave pending the inquiry.
