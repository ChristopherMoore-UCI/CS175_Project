Goals in either half by Argentina's Javier Pastore and Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimovic earned Carlo Ancelotti's men their second successive league win and lifts them to third in Ligue 1 behind leaders Olympic Marseille and second-placed Lyon. Conte, who led Juventus to the Serie A title last season, was suspended by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on August 10 for failing to report alleged corruption in two Serie B matches when he was previously in charge of then second flight Siena in 2010-11. Rene Girard's side are currently lying 14th, while Reims second win of the season sees them rise to eighth. The 43-year-old, who appealed, but failed to overturn the FIGC ban, will now not take charge of the Turin club's upcoming Champions League campaign which kicks off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on September 19. "This suspension covers all types of matches, including domestic, international, friendly and official fixtures," a statement on the FIFA website said.
