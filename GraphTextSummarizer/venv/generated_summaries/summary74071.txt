The win also moves them to within two points of Milan, who face Fiorentina on Sunday evening. Meanwhile in Serie A, Inter Milan kept up the pressure on leaders AC Milan on Saturday night with a 2-0 win over Chievo at the San Siro. Two penalties from Kaka -- one in each half -- and a 70th minute strike from Cristiano Ronaldo -- his 28th league goal of the campaign -- ensured Jose Mourinho's team remain within striking distance of the Spanish champions who visit the Bernabeu next weekend. Second-half goals from Esteban Cambiasso in the 66th minute and Maicon six minutes from time saw Inter take all three points to move ahead of Napoli who play Bologna on Sunday. Barcelona did have to wait long for their second as Thiago Alcantara gave them the lead in the 64th minute, and Messi wrapped things up with his second goal, capitalizing on some sloppy defending in injury time.
