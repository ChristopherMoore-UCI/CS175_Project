This was a celebratory gathering, a lot of good news, and we knew that we were being included in this effort that Netflix is making to change the way television is brought to people. " "Arrested" is the latest in Netflix's recent foray into producing original content, and marks a new way for people to enjoy television. After numerous false starts and scheduling conflicts, series creator Mitch Hurwitz was finally able to work in time for his entire clan to continue the saga of the least redeemable family in Orange County. Since its final episode aired in February 2006, a little thing called Netflix ushered in a new way of watching television. In fact, these original series are even eligible for Primetime Emmy awards thanks to a recent rule change allowing broadband programming to be nominated alongside any broadcast, cable or premium network show.
