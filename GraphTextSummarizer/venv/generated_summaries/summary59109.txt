As a CNN crew filmed the embassy from across the street, another crew from American public television -- led by Egyptian television producer Dina Amer -- approached the building. Other CNN journalists tried to reach in to help, but were pushed back by a wall of angry men. Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, a producer working for CNN, rushed to help escort Amer through the angry crowd. But suddenly the two reporters were pinned against the railing of an overpass by young men who were accusing Amer of being an Israeli spy. Other Egyptian journalists told CNN they were also attacked Saturday while trying to report near the Israeli embassy.
