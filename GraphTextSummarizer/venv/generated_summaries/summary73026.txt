"The people of West Virginia have lost a true champion, the United States Senate has lost a venerable institution, and America has lost a voice of principle and reason with the passing of Robert C. Byrd. West Virginia law says that if a Senate vacancy is created within two and a half years of the end of a term, the appointed successor will automatically serve out the remainder of the term. Senator Byrd dedicated every single day of his Senate service to strengthening the institution, state and republic that he loved so dearly. Under West Virginia law, the state's popular two-term Democratic governor, Joe Manchin, has the power to appoint Byrd's successor. -- Colleagues of Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia mourned his death as family and friends planned his funeral.
