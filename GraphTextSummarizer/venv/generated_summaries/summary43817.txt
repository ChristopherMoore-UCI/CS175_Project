Cases of missing girls Ilene Misheloff, left, and Michaela Garecht now linked to Garrido investigation. " Her comments came as authorities looked into whether Michaela's abduction and other unsolved kidnappings in the region are in any way related to Phillip Garrido, who was arrested last week for the kidnapping and rape of an 11-year-old girl just three years after Michaela was taken. That girl, Jaycee Lee Dugard -- now 29 -- was found alive last week, living in a tent and shelter compound in Garrido's back yard in Antioch, California -- 30 miles from where Michaela was kidnapped. Contra Costa County sheriff's Lt. Steve Simpkins said police in Antioch and neighboring Pittsburg were searching Garrido's property "for evidence relating to open cases." Murch says the kidnappings of her daughter and that of Dugard have several similarities. Police in several other San Francisco Bay Area agencies are also investigating possible ties between Garrido and other missing persons' cases.
