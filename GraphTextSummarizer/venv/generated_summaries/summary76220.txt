From the moment I entered the world, I was handed a collection of circumstances that most first world people would label as "disadvantages." Racism, economic hardship, and familial struggles were my everyday reality from the beginning. In Malcolm Gladwell's new book, David and Goliath: Underdogs, Misfits, and the Art of Battling Giants, he argues that being the underdog and experiencing disadvantages breeds "desirable difficulties." Maybe you or someone close to you also has underdog status. So much of how we understand ourselves is shaped by our losses and hardships, even more so than our victories.
