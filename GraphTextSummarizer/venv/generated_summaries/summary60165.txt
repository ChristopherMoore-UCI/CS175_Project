Discussing Florida's "stand your ground" law -- which allows people to use deadly force in situations in which they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury -- Corey said, "our laws are very clear that it has to be a forcible felony and that a reasonable person would have to believe that deadly force is necessary as opposed to just physical force, fighting back and that sort of thing. Corey "lives up to every prosecutor's mantra to be 'tough on crime,'" wrote Michael Hallett and Daniel Pontzer, criminology professors at the University of North Florida, in a study published this year. Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed Corey to take over after state attorney Norm Wolfinger stepped aside amid complaints over his handling of the case. Since then, Corey, 57, has made waves for the number of cases she brings to trial. Corey's record shows she chooses cases based not only on possibility for success at trial, but also "wherever charges seem warranted," the study says.
