By the mid-19th century, steamboats became a popular mode of transportation in America, Schulte said. Steam engines function similarly to a tea kettle on a stove, says Matthew Schulte, executive director of the Steamship Historical Society of America. With steamboats, "You can see, smell and hear what's happening, and then understand why they work just from going on one," Schulte said. "The rivers, lakes and oceans could serve as a network of transportation long before trails, railroads and highways could accommodate the masses," said Schulte. The Minnehaha was also used by people wanting a tour of the lake, and it remained a popular means of transportation for both groups until the late 1920s, when steamboats began to fade away.
