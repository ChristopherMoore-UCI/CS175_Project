In New York, Sudan's U.N. ambassador said the South Sudan troops were "forced to withdraw. "The Republic of South Sudan calls on Sudan to immediately desist from air bombardments and ground incursions into the territory of the Republic of South Sudan," he told reporters in Juba, the South Sudan capital. -- South Sudan announced Friday it was withdrawing its troops from a contested oil-rich area it seized last week in a move that escalated tensions and fears of a return to war with Sudan. When they separated, South Sudan acquired three quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. China, which has invested heavily in Sudan's oil industry, has argued for calm and respect for each other's sovereignty, while Princeton Lyman, the U.S. special envoy for Sudan and South Sudan, visited both countries recently to meet government officials.
