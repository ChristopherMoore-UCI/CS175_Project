The primary motive behind the January 30 attack is suspected to be dowry-related, as alleged by the parents of the dead woman,  Jharkhand state police superintendent N.K. Mishra said. Her family has said in their complaint she was harassed for money and other things." The three suspects poured kerosene on Annu Devi, 22, and the baby girl at their village home in the state's Dumka district and set them on fire, Mishra said. Police across India registered 8,233 murders of women as dowry deaths in 2012, according to national crime data. A court has sent the three suspects to jail to await trial, Mishra told CNN.
