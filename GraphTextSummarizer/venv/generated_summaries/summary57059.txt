"It's pretty hard to be more qualified for this job than Loretta Lynch," Obama said at the White House, where he was joined by Lynch and outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder. " New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement that Lynch "has time and time again demonstrated her commitment to ensuring there is one set of rules for everyone and to defending the principle of equal justice for all. Lynch served on the trial team that prosecuted and won convictions in 1999 against New York City police officers for violating the civil rights of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant whom police officers beat and sodomized while he was in their custody. In a statement, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton called Lynch "a remarkable prosecutor with a clear sense of justice without fear or favor. Lynch is a popular prosecutor who is in her second stint as U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, appointed by President Obama in 2010 and also serving in the same post from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton.
