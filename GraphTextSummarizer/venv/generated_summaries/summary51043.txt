"They might produce euphoria, they might temporarily make it easier... but in the long run there are significant problems both in terms of thinking, mood problems, maybe even functionality." Kotwicki, who also is the medical director at the Skyland Trail mental health treatment facility in Atlanta, says drugs like Adderall can produce jitters, headaches, stomach problems or even eventually lead to psychosis, a mental disorder that includes the loss of contact with reality. But for students like Gabay, use of study drugs is so common they don't see it as a problem. Taking drugs without a prescription or buying the controlled substances is illegal and students who use the drugs could face prosecution. Alan DeSantis, a professor and researcher at the University of Kentucky, has tracked study drug use there. It's something Gabay has seen happen over and over since he started taking study drugs.
