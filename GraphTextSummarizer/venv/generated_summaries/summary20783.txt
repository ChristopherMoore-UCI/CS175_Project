-- Even as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the ultimate goal for the U.S. was to see Libya's president cede power, a senior administration official says the U.N.-mandated no-fly zone and military action to support it would not necessarily last until Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi steps down. "I think there is also a very real danger that if Gadhafi is successful on the ground, that you will also face a number of other considerable risks as well," Undersecretary Nicholas Burns said Thursday. President Barack Obama met Friday with security officials and leaders of Congress, including Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. The official said it is unlikely Gadhafi could orchestra a "sophisticated plot" such as the Pan Am Flight 103 or Berlin disco bombings, but there is always the possibility of smaller-scale attacks. " A top State Department official raised the concern that Gadhafi could return to underwriting terror plots.
