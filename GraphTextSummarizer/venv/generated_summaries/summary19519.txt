The Mexico City District Attorney's Office alleges that Sandra Avila Beltran, who faces charges of drug trafficking, money laundering and conspiracy, got a Botox injection on January 10 at the Santa Martha Acatitla prison in the Mexican capital. Mexican officials have launched an investigation into allegations that a reputed Mexican drug cartel "queen" received a beauty treatment while in prison. Prosecutors said they are investigating medical personnel at the prison who might have provided access to a doctor who applied the Botox injection to Avila, also known as "The Queen of the Pacific." Avila, who according to Mexican media reports is 50 years old, was allegedly tied to the Sinaloa Cartel, one of the most powerful Mexican criminal organizations. Mexico City District Attorney Miguel Angel Mancera said the investigation into the prison incident was prompted by a tip from prison personnel. Mancera also said prison employees who have not yet been identified "falsified" an access request form saying the doctor was going to perform an electrocardiogram, but instead applied the injection.
