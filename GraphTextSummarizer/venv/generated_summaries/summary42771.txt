The event, led by former White House clean energy adviser Van Jones, highlighted growing liberal frustration with a public policy agenda increasingly dominated by deficit reduction efforts and difficulty in implementing more traditional economic stimulus measures as well as revenue increases. -- As anti-Wall Street protests continued across the country, several hundred people gathered Thursday in the nation's capital in a scheduled anti-war demonstration that also adopted new overtones in decrying economic disparities. A day earlier, several hundred union and progressive activists sought to capitalize on the growing "Occupy Wall Street" protests with a Capitol Hill rally demanding new public spending on job creation and an end to federal budget cuts. There, in front of a two-story banner in front of the building that reads "JOBS: Brought to you by American free enterprise," the demonstrators chanted, "Where are the jobs?" Speaking at a news conference earlier Thursday, President Barack Obama said demonstrators -- in Washington, as well as those in New York and other cities nationwide -- "are giving voice to a more broad-based frustration about how our financial system works. " Thursday's demonstration is not the first in Washington about economic matters.
