Among others, Kate takes style cues from the royals of Monaco and shares a penchant for fedoras, as did Princess Grace of Monaco, classic trench coats a la Princess Caroline of Monaco and sporty equestrian style as seen on Princess Charlotte Casiraghi of Monaco. The best dressed celebrity brides Kate often lands on best-dressed lists for her princess-worthy fashion and, inevitably, her style is compared to Prince William's mother, Princess Diana. It has been nearly 30 years since Princess Diana walked down the aisle at St. Paul's Cathedral and the world is anxious for another royal wedding of the same fairy tale proportions. Will she opt for a relatively unknown name, as did Princess Diana when she asked David and Elizabeth Emanuel to design her dress? At the wedding, the always-elegant Kate wore a bright blue dress topped with a fitted black blazer and, in keeping with British tradition, an oversize hat -- hers accented with a feather.
