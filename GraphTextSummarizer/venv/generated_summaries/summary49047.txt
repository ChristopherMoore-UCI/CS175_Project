And not only is Schiller trashing the service (in a brief message to Apple enthusiast Clayton Braasch), he has also deleted his Instagram account (@schiller) entirely (much like some thousands of other users.) If a favored iOS app launching on Android is enough to earn a rebuke from a top Apple executive, that may serve as a warning to other app makers who are currently on iOS alone. The $1 billion photo-sharing app Instagram -- once named "app of the year" by Apple -- has now "jumped the shark," according to Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller. "It 'jumped the shark' when it went to Android," was all the Apple executive wrote to Braasch Thursday. You wouldn't be hard pressed to see further evidence that the "nuclear war" Steve Jobs vowed to wage against Android is being continued by his successors at Apple.
