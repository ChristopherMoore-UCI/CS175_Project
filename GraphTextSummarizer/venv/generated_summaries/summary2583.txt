The Afghan soldiers are mostly from the north or northeast of Afghanistan and to many locals they are strangers almost as foreign as the Americans. And tonight these soldiers plan an air assault into an area called Qadem Khel, where the Taliban is basically the law. Barlow, with eight weeks left in his tour, accepts it's likely American forces won't return to Qadam Khel soon. -- The day begins with a count of the necessities for a joint operation with Afghan troops -- among them 85 halal MREs (Meals Ready To Eat). The helicopters arrive and, with the assistance of night vision for the Americans and some careful footwork by their Afghan colleagues, they climb aboard.
