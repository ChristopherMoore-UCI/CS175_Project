That interest, parlayed into a 2011 Animal Planet reality show, "Heidi Fleiss: Prostitutes to Parrots," apparently helped spare Fleiss from handcuffs after authorities said they found nearly 400 marijuana plants growing at her residence in Pahrump, Nevada. A deputy did not arrest Fleiss because she had exotic birds valued at more than $200,000, Nye County Sheriff Anthony De Meo told CNN on Tuesday. Once known as the "Hollywood Madam," Heidi Fleiss in recent years has become known as a fan of exotic birds. She told detectives she was growing the plants to sell to a cooperative in Las Vegas, about 55 miles to the east, authorities said. A total of 392 suspected marijuana plants were counted, authorities said.
