The country's "energiewende" -- translated as energy transformation -- is part of the government's plan to move away from nuclear power and fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, following Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011. With the bulk of wind turbines located in the east of the country, regional electricity grids face the threat of overloading, while the reliability of regular wind and solar power in northern Europe is also a concern. Limburg told CNN the rapid transition to renewables is economically "insane," arguing that wind farms will cost at least 13 times more than traditional coal plants. Offshore wind energy is important for North Germany as already a lot of jobs have been created. According to the Institute for Energy Research, this year German electricity rates will increase by over 10% due to a surcharge for using more renewable energy and a further 30 to 50% price increase is expected in the next ten years.
