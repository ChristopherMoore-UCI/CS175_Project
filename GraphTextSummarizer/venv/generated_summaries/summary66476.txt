Tuesday's English League Cup match between Liverpool and second division Middlesbrough was a marathon encounter which finally came to a conclusion at 10:42pm local time -- almost three hours after it had kicked off. "I was obviously pleased to get through and that experience, even though it was a long night for everyone, was great for our young players," said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, whose starting 11 included the 17-year-old Jordan Rossister. The success both teams enjoyed from 12 yards made for a surreal spectacle, with Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli letting a wry smile slip when he converted for the second time in the shootout. We have played a Champions League team at Anfield and we've met them face to face. Level at 1-1 after 90 minutes at Liverpool's Anfield stadium and locked together at 2-2 after two hours of play, the two teams began a record-breaking penalty shootout.
