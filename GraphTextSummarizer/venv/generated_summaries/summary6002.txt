The Washington Post originally reported that the spy agency considered selling demonic bin Laden figurines to scare Afghan children and their parents from supporting bin Laden and al Qaeda. One head is the recognizable face of the al Qaeda leader with his long black beard and white turban. The doll, code named "Devil Eyes," is one of three prototypes designed by Donald Levine, the creator of G.I. Joe, back in 2005 as part of a proposed CIA plan to take down the al Qaeda leader. If you've ever felt the urge to buy an Osama bin Laden action figure and have $2,500 to spare, Nov. 20 could be your lucky day. The CIA rejected the plan after it reviewed the three prototypes, Dean Boyd, CIA spokesperson, confirmed to CNN in June.
