Experts say many migrants passing through Mexico on their way to the United States are victims of violence along the Mexico-U.S. border, but the journey is perilous from the moment it begins. -- Mexican authorities say they've rescued 94 migrants who were crammed into the back of a hauling truck in "subhuman conditions." They came from as far away as Nepal and as nearby as Guatemala, paying thousands of dollars to get to the United States, authorities said. The driver of the truck has been turned over to prosecutors on suspicion of human trafficking, and the migrants are receiving medical, psychological and legal assistance, Chiapas state prosecutors said in a statement. They showed symptoms of asphyxiation and serious lesions on their hands and feet when they were rescued, Mexico's National Migration Institute said. X-ray equipment detected the migrants at a checkpoint in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas early Tuesday morning.
