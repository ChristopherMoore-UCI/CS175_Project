Mee led Griffin around to the back, where two men -- Laron Raiford and Lamont Newton -- were armed and waiting, authorities said. In January 2010, St. Petersburg police again issued a missing person report for Mee. Mee, Raiford and Newton had all been living together, according to police. But after her hiccups faded, Mee continued to draw attention. And all three were charged with first-degree murder, even Mee, although police indicated she didn't pull the trigger.
