Faouzi Aaish, who was sent off for a second booking in the second half, had put Bahrain ahead with an eighth-minute penalty but India leveled through midfielder Gouramangi Singh inside 60 seconds. The final round on Tuesday sees South Korea play India and Australia take on Bahrain. Abdulatif then took center stage as he pounced on a mistake by India goalkeeper Subrata Paul in the 16th minute, was set up by Nigeria-born Jaycee John for his second three minutes later and completed his hat-trick 10 minutes before halftime after chesting down a pass from Aaish. The Australians, who like South Korea qualified for the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa, are seeking a first title after having joined the Asian federation from Oceania in early 2006. Aaish, who also scored a penalty against South Korea, had to leave the pitch just past the hour mark after being booked for diving but Abdulatif sealed victory with a superb solo effort with 13 minutes to play.
