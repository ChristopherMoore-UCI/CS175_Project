They are also unaware that the course of TB disease is frequently more severe in patients with diabetes, who do not tolerate TB drugs well. We also need strong investment in research and development of TB vaccines, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods for both TB and diabetes, and fast-acting, easy-to-take TB medication. Diabetes could reverse the achievements of several decades in TB control, but, if we combine good science, adequate funding and above all, political will, we can get ahead of this looming crisis. Diabetes impairs the immune system and leaves a person who has been exposed to TB much more likely to develop active disease. Diabetes patients often have difficulty completing treatment, take longer to be cured and are more likely to relapse, even die, and develop drug-resistant TB.
