Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the shootings of Reagan, White House press secretary James Brady, Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy, and police officer Thomas Delahanty. -- A federal judge will allow John Hinckley, the man who shot and severely wounded President Ronald Reagan in a 1981 assassination attempt, more time away from a Washington psychiatric hospital to visit his elderly mother in Virginia. Hinckley's caregivers hope he will one day get a part-time job with pay as part of a self-sufficiency strategy that will also involve expanding his ties with the Williamsburg community. St. Elizabeth's is required to regularly send reports to the court, outlining Hinckley's movements and activities when he is in Williamsburg. In addition, he has received art and music therapy and has had a volunteer job at another hospital, a lawyer for Hinckley said at a hearing in January that assessed a request for expanded visitation.
