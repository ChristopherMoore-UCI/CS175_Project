The vote for the powerful 75-seat regional parliament and Basque president are seen as a bellwether of the region's sentiment on how to end decades of violence by the Basque separatist group ETA. But this year, the Basque nationalist party also has come under ETA attack. For years, Socialist and conservative politicians, even low-level town councilors, in the Basque region have been protected by police or private bodyguards due to ETA death threats. The incumbent Basque nationalists won the most seats in Basque regional parliamentary elections on Sunday, but they could lose a 29-year hold on power because three non-nationalist parties won a combined majority for the first time, according to official election results. For the first time, political parties linked to ETA were banned from running in the Basque elections.
