In a carefully worded statement on his official Facebook page, Suarez, who has been hit by a four-month ban by world governing body FIFA for biting the Italian, said he "deeply regretted what occurred." " Given the bite on Chiellini was the third such offense of Suarez's career, FIFA took an altogether dimmer view of the incident, handing down a tough punishment to the 27-year-old foward. -- Luis Suarez has promised never to bite a player again after the Uruguayan issued an apology to Italy's Giorgio Chiellini. Suarez has been heavily linked with a move away from Liverpool and, with the 27-year-old set to miss the first nine games of the Premier League season, it remains to be seen whether the Anfield team will continue to stand by its man. When playing with Dutch club Ajax in 2007, Suarez was suspended for seven games for biting an opponent, while he was hit with a 10-match sanction for an identical offense while playing for Liverpool in April 2013.
