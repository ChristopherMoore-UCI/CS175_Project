-- Novak Djokovic's blistering start to the year has secured him a place at the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals even before the second Grand Slam event of the year. After a hectic few weeks, Djokovic says he intends to put his feet up for a few days before focusing on the second Grand Slam tournament of the year. He has now beaten Nadal in four finals this year, and was the man to end the Spaniard's two-year winning run on clay in Madrid just over a week ago. But Djokovic told the ATP's official web site Nadal is still favorite in Paris: "Let us be clear -- he is the king of clay and he is the best player ever to play on this surface. "But this is only a couple of tournaments this year and he has been dominant on this surface for so many years."
