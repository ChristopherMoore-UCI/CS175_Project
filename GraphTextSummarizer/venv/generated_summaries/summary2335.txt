"The complications are very rare," said Dr. Albert Wu, director of the Center for Health Services and Outcomes Research at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 10 shocking medical mistakes Wu said patients should tell their surgeons "everything that they know about themselves," including their past experiences with surgery and anesthesia, whether they have any allergies, and if they're prone to bruising or heavy bleeding. Certain patients are at greater risk during general surgery than others, Wu said. Add them all up and "you have probably the third leading cause of death" in the country, Dr. Peter Pronovost, senior vice president for patient safety and quality at Johns Hopkins Hospital, told CNN during a 2012 investigation into common medical mistakes. Another study done in Europe in 2004 that included more than 33,000 tonsillectomy patients found about 1.3% were delayed in being discharged or returned to the hospital in the 28 days after surgery.
