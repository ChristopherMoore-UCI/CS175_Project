The storm, expected to near land between southeastern Louisiana and the Florida Panhandle early Sunday morning, before it weakens into a depression, the National Hurricane Center said. "The government shutdown will not inhibit NHC from providing its mission." Storm preparations Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley declared statewide states of emergency. The storm is expected to drop 3 to 6 inches of rain over parts of the central and eastern Gulf Coast through Sunday night, mainly near and to the east of the storm's center, the hurricane center said. The hurricane center's tracking map shows that the storm could make two landfalls: once over the Louisiana barrier islands Saturday night and again over the Florida Panhandle on Sunday morning. "At all times, FEMA maintains commodities, including millions of liters of water, millions of meals and hundreds of thousands of blankets, strategically located at distribution centers throughout the United States, including in the Gulf Coast region, that are available to state and local partners if needed and requested," the agency said in a statement.
