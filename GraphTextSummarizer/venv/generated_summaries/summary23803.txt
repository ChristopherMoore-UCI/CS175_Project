-- Lindsey Vonn might have surrendered her World Cup crown, the American skier is not giving her heir apparent Tina Maze a free run to glory. It also convinced me I could do well in giant slalom and I will race in four events at the worlds," Vonn said, referring to the February 4-17 event in Schladming, Austria Maze had led after the first run, but Vonn came from third to win by 0.08 seconds in front of 25,000 spectators. Paris topped his only previous World Cup win -- a dead heat tie for first with Hannes Reichelt in Bormio at the end of last year -- with a time of one minute 57.56 seconds. Vonn upstaged the Slovenian on her home course at Maribor to claim the 59th World Cup win of her career in Saturday's giant slalom. She is now three wins behind Annemarie Moser-Proll's record of 62, having picked up just her third giant slalom victory and her first since she clinched a fourth World Cup title in March 2012.
