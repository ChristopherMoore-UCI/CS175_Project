Gov. Romney needs to find someone who wants to run with him. "All of these qualities could help Romney beat Obama, and to me, that's the main goal." A Romney-Rice ticket would restore "hope to America," said Vernon Hill of Morehead City, North Carolina. There are many people who will do it very, very well." Still, voters seem to be calling out her name as they wait for Romney's expected VP announcement. Oliva supports President Barack Obama but said Romney should also pick Portman because "he is a proven attack dog, and he has foreign policy credentials." Rick Huffman said he would also like Rubio to run alongside Romney, mostly because the senator holds strong conservative values.
