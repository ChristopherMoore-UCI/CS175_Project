"While her rehab is progressing, she is not at a point where she will be able to ski next week and is unfortunately withdrawing from the race at Beaver Creek," spokesman Lewis Kay said. She suffered the original injury in a crashing fall at the world championships in Austria last February and has been receiving treatment from Colarodo-based orthopedic surgeon Bill Sterett. "Lindsey is recovering very quickly from abrasions to her face and contusions to her shoulder blade," Sterett reported in comments released through Kay. "Beyond that, she has a stable knee with an MRI finding of a partial tear of her ACL graft. Vonn, the reigning Olympic champion in downhill, is focused on defending her title in the Sochi Games which start on February 7, hoping to emulate the feat of compatriot Picabo Street  at the 1998 Games in Nagano. The American superstar was set to return to competitive action at Beaver Creak next week, but suffered a major setback in training in Colorado Tuesday when she suffered a partial tear of one of her reconstructed knee ligaments.
