-- After a town hall meeting on health-care reform in Belgrade, Montana, President Obama will escape to Big Sky country on Friday evening where he'll spend time with family and go fly-fishing for the first time. But in Washington, Obama is trying to hook Congress and take home health care reform, or risk it being the big one that got away. After you've caught a lot of large fish, you kind of go back to square one and catch just one fish," said Derosier, manager at Taylor Creek Fly Shop in Aspen, Colorado. Learning the fundamentals of fly-fishing can serve as a metaphor for health care reform. Obama is in the "big fish" stage of his presidency: He's trying to get health-care reform legislation passed hook, line, and sinker.
