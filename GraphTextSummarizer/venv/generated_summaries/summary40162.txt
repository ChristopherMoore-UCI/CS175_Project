Recording to, and retrieving data from, tape takes a lot longer than digital storage devices and players we've become accustomed to in an era of Web streaming. The cartridge, which stores 148GB of data per inch of tape, has room for 3,700 Blu-ray discs full of your favorites. Sony has reinvented a tool for storing a mind-numbing amount of data: A cassette tape. Sony's record-breaking magnetic tape technology allows it to store 180 terabytes of data on a single cartridge. So, it's a lot more likely that tape will be used to back up huge databases than to save, and play, our music collections.
