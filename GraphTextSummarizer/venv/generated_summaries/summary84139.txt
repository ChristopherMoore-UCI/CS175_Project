-- Northern Ireland's top police officer on Saturday condemned violent clashes that left 56 of his officers injured as "mindless anarchy" -- and warned that many arrests will follow. The Police Service of Northern Ireland said Friday that 26 officers had been injured, with five of them needing hospital treatment. Hundreds of parades take place across Northern Ireland each year, the majority involving the Protestant Orange Order and associated organizations. The disorder broke out in central Belfast as loyalists held counter-protests Friday evening against a nationalist march. Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton, who led the policing operation, said about 1,200 people had gathered "and it was evident that many of them had violent intent."
