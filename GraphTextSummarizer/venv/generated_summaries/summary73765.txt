'The Voice' Season Three Awards During a junket featuring all four judges and show creator Mark Burnett, Shelton confirmed this season will give new meaning to the term "battle rounds. All four judges, including returnees Adam Levine and Blake Shelton, mean business. Season four of "The Voice," featuring Usher and Shakira filling in for Cee Lo Green and Christina Aguilera, taped blind auditions recently, and Rolling Stone had a chance to watch the new judges in action. At the audition we saw some friendly competition between Usher and Shakira over one contestant, and when Usher bested Levine for another vocalist at the audition, he playfully taunted his fellow judge. Usher brings in his own experience, having mentored Justin Bieber to the top of the charts, and Levine says that does count for a lot.
