A quick search for the word "flappy" in the Google Play store on Monday returned 250 results, from "Flappy Pig" and "Flappy Fish" to "Flappy Troll," "Flappy Cat" (yes, it's the Web's beloved Nyan Cat) and even "Flappy Bieber." Both Apple and Google appear to be cracking down on new apps taking advantage of the demise of "Flappy Bird," the addictively simple casual game that became an unlikely sensation before its creator abruptly pulled it off the market last week. After existing in relative obscurity for months, "Flappy Bird" took off in popularity late last year and became the most popular free app in both Apple's App Store and Google Play, the store for Android apps. Even before "Flappy Bird" topped the download charts last month, a cavalcade of knock-off games began appearing. Then came Vietnamese developer Dong Nguyen's abrupt announcement he was going to pull "Flappy Bird" from online stores.
