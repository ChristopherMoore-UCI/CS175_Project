Hershey holds the license to manufacture Cadbury chocolate products in the U.S., so the import ban also includes UK-made Cadbury and Kit Kat products, which are made differently in the United States than across the pond. Hershey lawsuit angers fans of British chocolate in U.S. Many chocolate lovers have taken to social media to share a similar sentiment, some even calling for drastic action with the hashtag #BoycottHershey. Let's Buy British Imports, one of the nation's top distributors of popular food brands from the UK, South Africa and Australia, agreed last week to stop selling confections like Maltesers and Toffee Crisps to stateside retail outlets and restaurants. To qualify as milk chocolate by UK law, a product must contain at least 20% cocoa and milk solids and at least 25% fat. The owners of Tea & Sympathy, a New York shop that stocks UK goods, aren't buying it -- even urging fans to contact Hershey's CEO about the matter.
