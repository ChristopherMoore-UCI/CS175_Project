On Sunday, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, became the latest in a line of lawmakers to insist that Obama appoint a single person in his administration to shepherd federal resources toward combating Ebola, which health officials said over the weekend had infected a second person in Dallas. Liberal group 'cuts' midterm Ebola ad blaming GOP After the new case was revealed, the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee said patients in the U.S. should all be transferred to specialized biocontainment centers that have been rigorously prepared to treat Ebola cases.
