LaRose is suspected of communicating with Paulin-Ramirez in August 2009, when the pair allegedly conspired to obtain military-style training in South Asia, traveling to Europe to participate and support violent jihad, according to a superseding indictment in 2010. Last month, LaRose pleaded guilty at a federal change-of-plea hearing in Philadelphia after being indicted in 2009 on four counts, including conspiring to support terrorists and kill someone overseas. She was allegedly part of a plot to murder Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who outraged some by depicting the prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog in 2007.
