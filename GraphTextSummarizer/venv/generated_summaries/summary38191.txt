"2009 is going to be very difficult for Latin America, in part, because obviously there is a very important fall in the price of Latin American commodity exports and, in part, because the drop in industrial activity will affect the manufacturing sectors of Mexico and Central American, which are connected to the economic activity in the United States." He called on the U.S. government, "which has access to financing that nobody else has," to use it to redirect resources so that Latin American countries can find financing. " The government also announced a 5 percent decrease in withholding tax for the export of wheat and corn -- taxes that had stirred fierce debate in the country -- -and the launch of two plans, Wheat Plus and Corn Plus, which will result in another 1 percentage point drop in the withholding tax when production increases. "This translates into difficulties in maintaining lines of credit for export and difficulties for countries with external debt to find refinancing." Farmers in Argentina went on strike in October to demand the government lower export taxes.
