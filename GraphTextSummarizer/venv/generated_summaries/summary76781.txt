"It was a disappointing night for us, we were second to every ball in the first half and we were completely dominated by Wigan," said United manager Alex Ferguson. " In the English Premier League title race, leaders Manchester United were stunned 1-0 at struggling Wigan Wednesday to give chasing Manchester City a glimmer of hope. United took until deep into the second half to conjure up a shot on goal against Wigan, who moved out of the relegation zone at the expense of Bolton. Defending champions United had gone into the night's fixtures with an eight-point lead and with the title all but conceded by their city rivals. One of those fixtures sees City host United on April 30, a likely title decider.
