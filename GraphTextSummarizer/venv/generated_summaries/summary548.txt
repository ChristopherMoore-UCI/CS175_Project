But Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the TSA found problems with more than one-quarter of the reports it reviewed, "including gross errors about radiation emissions." "That is completely unacceptable when it comes to monitoring radiation," Collins said. TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said Friday that numerous independent tests have confirmed that body scanners are safe, "but these record-keeping errors are not acceptable. Those inaccuracies included "calculation errors not impacting safety," no reading of background radiation levels, and missing "non-measurement related information." It will also require contractors to re-train machine testers, while increasing TSA oversight over the tests. The announcements came as the TSA, responding to public pressure, posted raw data about radiation tests on its website.
