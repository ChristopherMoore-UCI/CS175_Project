There I was, one of maybe a handful of black people in a crowded, dark room with hundreds of drunk white people yelling the N-word. But I would argue there is very little affection in Kanye using the word in a song, and that our continual injection of the word into pop culture is not only hypocritical but unintentionally gives white hipsters in London, Sydney, New York or any other city where a song like "Gold Digger" can be heard, permission to say it. I thought, "What is it with white people and that word?" But then I also had to ask myself, "What is it with black people and that word?" After all, at least on that night, Kanye was the one who brought it up. I believe Schlessinger and the others deserve the repercussions their actions have drawn, but I am frustrated that as a nation we continue to interpret the censure of such people as progress while ignoring some of the uncomfortable truths nestled inside their racist diatribes.
