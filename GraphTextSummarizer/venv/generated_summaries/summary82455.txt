Instead, Saturday's release provided the usual breakdown of operations in various parts of the country, including South Waziristan. Gilani made a U-turn Saturday -- first declaring that the military offensive against Islamic militants in South Waziristan had ended, then saying there is no timeframe for its completion. Like South Waziristan, it is also considered rife with militants. The Pakistani army is conducting an intense operation to rout militants from their haven along the country's border with Afghanistan. Answering a question from a reporter who asked whether the government will engage in dialogue with the Taliban in South Waziristan, Gilani said the operation was over.
