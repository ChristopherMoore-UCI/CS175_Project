Real gang life -- where gang members stand around in the rain waiting for something to happen, or beg, borrow, and steal converted imitation firearms to make good on their threats -- rarely lives up to the hype. The old "hot spot" approach to gang suppression alienated communities of color by reinforcing the "us versus them" mentality that forced many people into gangs in the first place. Gang members already hold more anti-authority attitudes than the rest of us. When gang members identify with Islam, however, it is only on a superficial level. Above all, gang members desire to be feared, thus, as in the Muslim Boys case in London, they strategically pose as jihadists and trade on powerful false perceptions about links to al Qaeda.
