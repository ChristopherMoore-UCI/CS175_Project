-- Manchester City striker Emmanuel Adebayor has been handed a three-match suspension for his stamp on Arsenal's Robin Van Persie last weekend. The ruling body said in a statement on Thursday: "A regulatory commission today considered the charge of violent conduct issued against Manchester City's Emmanuel Adebayor under the fast-track disciplinary procedure following an incident with Robin van Persie during their fixture against Arsenal on September 12. As well as missing Sunday's eagerly-awaited trip to Old Trafford to face Premier League champions United, Adebayor will also sit out next Wednesday's League Cup tie at home to Fulham and the visit by West Ham to Eastlands on September 28. Adebayor has been a key figure since his $41 million summer switch from Arsenal, scoring in each of the club's first four Premier League games -- two of them being the only goal of the match -- to help the team to a 100 percent record. However, his ugly attack on the grounded Van Persie left his former teammate with facial injuries, and his ill-advised goal celebrations have only further alienated from Arsenal fans -- many of whom were happy that he left after the player publicly courted Barcelona and AC Milan last season.
