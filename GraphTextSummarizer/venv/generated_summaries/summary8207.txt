-- An American soldier went on a house-to-house shooting spree in two villages in the Kandahar region of Afghanistan early Sunday, Afghan officials said, killing 16 people. The U.S. government, NATO and Afghan officials are looking into this, but there are a lot of people asking for swift justice and wanting the person who perpetrated this crime to be tried right here in Afghanistan. What are people feeling in Afghanistan, and how will this affect the U.S. strategy moving forward? Since then, the villagers have been accusing the U.S. government of not telling the truth, saying there were more U.S. soldiers on the ground when this happened. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the soldier acted alone and turned himself in after opening fire on civilians.
