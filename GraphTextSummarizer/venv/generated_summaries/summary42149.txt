In the earlier match, Sudan ended a 36-year Africa Cup of Nations goal drought, but they had to come from behind twice to draw with Angola. It leaves Angola in second place in the section and in a strong position to go through with Ivory Coast who they meet Monday. Earlier, Sudan and Angola shared four goals in their Group B match at the same stadium. Ivory Coast beat Sudan 1-0 in their opening match and look set to qualify as group winners. Kalou pulled up injured and was substituted before his side survived a real scare as Burkina Faso striker Moumouni Dagano outjumped Souleymane Bamba only to see his header hit the woodwork.
