Earlier Thursday, Hu traveled to Capitol Hill, where congressional leaders used the occasion to raise strong concerns about Beijing's commitment to human rights and economic issues such as the protection of intellectual property. Human rights remains a touchy subject in China, as censors in the Asian nation made clear during Hu's visit by blacking out CNN's news broadcast each time the topic of human rights was mentioned. Obama administration officials used the president's meeting with Hu to highlight economic progress between the two countries, announcing Beijing's approval of $45 billion in new contracts for U.S. companies to export goods to China. Hu conceded that key differences remain over economic policy, but he promised that Beijing would continue making attempts to resolve those differences. The two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights but pledged to keep working on the matter in a "frank and candid way," according to Obama.
