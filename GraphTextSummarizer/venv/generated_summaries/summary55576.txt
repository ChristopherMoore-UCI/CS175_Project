"There's a strong working relationship and actually even a strong personal bond between Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama," White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said last week. -- President Barack Obama, a well-known basketball fan, will treat British Prime Minister David Cameron to a little March Madness Tuesday as the two head to Ohio to catch an NCAA men's tournament basketball game. It is unclear if Obama would reveal this year's picks during his interview with Cameron on Tuesday. But Cameron's visit will not be all fun and games. For the record, Obama picked Kansas, Duke, Ohio State, Pitt for his 2011 final four and chose Kansas to take the championship.
