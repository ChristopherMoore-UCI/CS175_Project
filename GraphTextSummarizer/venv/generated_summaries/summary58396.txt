"China and the United States have maintained close communications about the visit, which will be very important and will bring far-reaching influence for bilateral relations in new era," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said Thursday, according to China Daily. Chinese Defense Minister General Liang Guanglie and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates talked in Vietnam, while they attended a security forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. U.S. President Barack Obama referred to Hu's visit last month, while China's Premier Wen Jiabao was in New York to address the U.N. General Assembly. -- China's Foreign Ministry has confirmed for the first time that President Hu Jintao will visit the United States early next year. The countries "have to work cooperatively together in order to achieve regional peace and stability, because the world looks to the relationship between China and the United States as a critical ingredient on a whole range of security issues around the world," Obama also said at the time.
