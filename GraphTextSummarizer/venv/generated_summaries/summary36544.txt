The high-tech designs have come a long way from the 1970s, when adventurous land sailors tested out their hybrid designs everywhere from European beaches to North African deserts. " Need for speed The majority of world championship winners hail from the U.S. but there's also a good showing from European competitors, who are perhaps better used to racing on more rugged beach terrain. "You're hunkered down in the boat, you get nice and low, and you just get a beautiful view of the horizon," says fellow competitor Lester Robertson. "When we first came through the mountains, we saw these beautiful big rocks, and the west end of the lake was just glass smooth," competitor Rod Eicholz says of the spectacular setting. Desert inventors Competitors arrive in campervans loaded with their desert-racing machines, and work late into the evening tinkering with their speedy designs.
