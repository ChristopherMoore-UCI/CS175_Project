Four new releases made it into this week's Top Five: Kem's "Intimacy" took No. 2 with 74,000 copies, while Ray LaMontagne's "God Willin' & The Creek Don't Rise" entered at No. 3 with 64,000 copies -- 49,000 of which came from digital sales, which were aided by a $3.99 Amazon MP3 Store promotion. After topping this week's U.K. album charts, Iron Maiden scored their best-ever chart performance as "The Final Frontier" came in at No. 4, improving on the band's only other Top 10 U.S. debut, 2006's "A Matter of Life and Death," which scored No. 9. Recovery now has the most weeks at No. 1 for a hip-hop album since OutKast accrued seven with 2003's "Speakerboxx/The Love Below." Trace Adkins' "Cowboy's Back in Town" rounded out the Top Five, and John Mellencamp's "No Better Than This" entered at No. 10. Album sales were up 2 percent compared to last week, which was the lowest selling week of the SoundScan era.
