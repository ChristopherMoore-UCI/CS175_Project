-- South African track star Oscar Pistorius, charged with murdering girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, has applied for more lenient bail restrictions, including permission to travel overseas, a family spokesman said Monday. Pistorius repeatedly broke down and sobbed during a bail hearing last month, and the runner's uncle, Arnold Pistorius, acknowledged in a statement that his nephew "will never be the same" after killing Steenkamp. Not everyone surprised at Oscar Pistorius' fall from grace Authorities charged Pistorius with premeditated murder last month after he shot Steenkamp in his Pretoria home on February 14. But the sprinter's family denied BBC reports Monday that he's suicidal as he awaits trial in what prosecutors say was the premeditated death of Steenkamp. Pistorius also is trying to sell some assets to settle legal bills, spokesman Johan van Wyk told CNN.
