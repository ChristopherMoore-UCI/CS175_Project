The report does not single out any physicians or hospitals but shows how well states and the federal government are doing in terms of supporting emergency care, said Dr. Jon Mark Hirshon, an emergency physician at the University of Maryland and board member of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Access to emergency care was particularly lacking across many states, the report card said. In a state-by-state breakdown, grading the 50 states and the District of Columbia on these parameters, the report card found that the District of Columbia leads in emergency care support, with a grade of B-minus. "We'll be asked to do more with less resources, which has the potential to impact emergency patients," Hirshon said. -- Sorry, America: Support for emergency care patients barely receives a passing grade and needs extra help, according to a new report.
