" While recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Stockwell says she was inspired by other patients. Today the 32-year-old veteran works as a certified prosthetist at Scheck and Siress in Chicago and runs a triathlon club she started with friends Keri Schindler and Dan Tun two years ago. Stockwell's parents thought she was going through a phase, but she joined the ROTC program while at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The experience gave her an incredible feeling of freedom and opened up a world of new possibilities. When anyone would ask her what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would say she wanted to join the Army.
