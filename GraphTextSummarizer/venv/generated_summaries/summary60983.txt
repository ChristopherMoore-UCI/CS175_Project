Kimathi was charged with terrorism under Uganda's  Anti-terrorism Act, as well  as murder and attempted murder, and was  held in pre-trial detention for nearly a  year. Prominent human rights activist Al-Amin Kimathi was released from custody Monday at the outset of the trial for suspects in the fatal July 2010 bombings in Kampala, Uganda. The defendants have remained jailed on charges of terrorism, murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He was arrested on September 15, 2010, in  Uganda, where he had traveled   to observe court hearings of Kenyan suspects in the Kampala bombings  who had been transferred to  Uganda. The Kenyan government also had urged Uganda to send Kimathi back to Kenya to be tried.
