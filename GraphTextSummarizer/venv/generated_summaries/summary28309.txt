The true consequences of obtaining nuclear weapons, as North Korea has done, are becoming increasingly clear. Because North Korea obtained nuclear weapons, its erratic behavior and appalling actions have become almost impossible to stop. And it has become a provider of nuclear technology to dangerous regimes. It's a performance that carries a strong message for the West and regimes that are contemplating the possibility of starting nuclear programs of their own. For the rest of the world, it should serve as a reminder of how dangerous it would be to allow more nuclear weapons anywhere, but especially in the Middle East, the most unstable region on earth.
