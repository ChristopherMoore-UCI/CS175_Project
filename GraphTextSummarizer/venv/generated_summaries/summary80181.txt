In the two years since "Lean In" became a best-seller and sparked countless conversations about gender equality, author Sheryl Sandberg says she has gotten one question over and over from men: What can they do? Many of the suggestions might seem like common sense to many women -- such as male managers giving women credit in meetings and men sharing 50-50 in household and child care duties at home. Another huge goal, Sandberg says, is showing men they won't lose out in the workplace when there is more equality in the executive suites and in boardrooms. Work-life balance not just a women's issue Sandberg's #LeanInTogether comes as emphasis seems to be growing on getting boys and men to think about gender equality. If LeBron James is encouraging men to lean in for women, don't you think some of his 19 million Twitter followers will get the message too?
