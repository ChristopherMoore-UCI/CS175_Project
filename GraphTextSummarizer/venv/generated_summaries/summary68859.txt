In the meantime, those thinking of the Internet as an idyllic place for freedom of expression would be wise to take heed: say what you like, but remember that the mob is watching you... ....................................... Do Internet users have the right to track people online? Groups of people organized by Web sites, email and text message descend on public spaces to take part in bizarre demonstrations of performance art. Vigilantes have not stopped at reprimanding their quarry: They have shamed them publicly in front of thousands of people; their identities and personal details have been posted for all to see, making them vulnerable to fraud and identity theft; they and their families have been harassed. The phenomenon has spread to flash parties on subway trains and silent flash raves in train stations in Great Britain; flash pillow fights in Toronto; zombie flash mobs in San Francisco; and a flash proposal of marriage to one girl in Beijing. Flash mobbing is seen at worst as a nuisance that can delay commuters and other travelers who encounter mobs in action.
