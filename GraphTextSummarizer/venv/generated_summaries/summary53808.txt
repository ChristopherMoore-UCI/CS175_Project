The Bluetooth-enabled accessory, for the iPhone 5 and 5S, was apparently the result of a dinner shared by Seacrest and co-founder Laurence Hallier, a real estate developer and serial entrepreneur who, like his partner, doesn't like typing on a touchscreen. The "American Idol" host, radio personality and seemingly ubiquitous showbiz presence has co-founded a tech startup that seeks to make it easier for people to type on their iPhones. The case, which sells for $99, is available for pre-order and is scheduled to ship next month. He joins the likes of Justin Timberlake, Ashton Kutcher and MC Hammer (yes, MC Hammer) as an entertainer dipping a toe into the tech world. Seacrest also is helping bankroll the company, Typo Keyboards, which makes an iPhone case that includes a BlackBerry style keyboard.
