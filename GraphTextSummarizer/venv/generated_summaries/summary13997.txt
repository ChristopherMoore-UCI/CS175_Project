The account, a spinoff of the original U.S.-based hit @RichKidsofInstagram, also has showcased people drinking what appears to be alcohol and young women flouting Muslim custom by not wearing hijabs, or head scarves. After launching in September on Instagram, the mobile photo-sharing platform, @RichKidsofTehran quickly amassed more than 100,000 followers by posting hundreds of pictures of fast luxury cars, house parties in gated neighborhoods and attractive young women in slinky dresses. The original inspired a number of copycat accounts, all showing young affluent partyers purporting to live in Iran. Young men race their latest Porsches and Maseratis, their wrists draped in gold jewelry. "There are conservative elements in Iran that would frown upon these images because they show young people in bikinis and others drinking alcohol.
