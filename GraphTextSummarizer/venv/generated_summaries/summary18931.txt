"Pharmaceutical industries are less interested in diseases in developing countries where potential gains are limited," said Dr. Mario Raviglione, director of WHO's Global Tuberculosis Programme. "As a result, we have a problem (with tuberculosis) because people know that 95% of cases are in developing countries." On Wednesday, the World Health Organization released its 2014 Global Tuberculosis Report, which shows that 9 million people developed tuberculosis in 2013 and 1.5 million died, making it one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases. Tuberculosis, commonly called TB, is a bacterial infection that can be spread through the air. "In addition, around 3 million people who fall ill from TB are still being 'missed' by health systems each year either because they are not diagnosed, or because they are diagnosed but not reported," the WHO said in a statement.
