The Frisky: 13 super annoying ways people abuse Facebook and Twitter Remember how, after watching Ted and Robin's romance begin to blossom, we got to the last second of the season premiere and Ted said, "And that's how I met your Aunt Robin." It made so much sense: Ted and Rachel, Rachel and Ted. Earlier this year, the show's executive producer PROMISED that in episode 100, airing this coming Monday, we would finally be introduced to this elusive mother. It's laugh-out-loud funny and unpredictable (Who can forget Slapsgiving or Robin's Canadian pop single, "Let's Go To The Mall"?), and gets the late 20-something experience like no other show. Only, fours years in, we still have no idea who she is.
