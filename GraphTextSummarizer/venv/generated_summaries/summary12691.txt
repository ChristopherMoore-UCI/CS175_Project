U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Valerie Amos said Friday that 1,400 people were evacuated from the Old City of Homs and 2,500 still there got relief supplies, but she lamented the bleak humanitarian situation throughout Syria. U.S. officials are awaiting for Moscow to demonstrate its intentions about humanitarian relief efforts in Syria, said Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman. As a result, a second round of peace talks intended to plot a path for ending almost three years of civil war in Syria ground perilously close to a halt Friday. Refugees are already arriving in Lebanon, said spokeswoman Melissa Fleming of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. "According to reports we've received from within Syria, there have been numerous aerial attacks and shelling along with a military buildup around the town, suggesting that a major assault by land may be imminent," Colville said.
