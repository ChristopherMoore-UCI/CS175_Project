Family: Amanda Knox won't return to Italy for new trial The convictions of Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were overturned in 2011 for "lack of evidence." However, Patrick Lumumba, the Congolese bartender Knox originally accused of Kercher's murder was in court. Neither was Kercher's family, which said in a statement submitted by their lawyer in court on Monday that they would be following the new trial closely from the United Kingdom. The latest chapter in Amanda Knox's long legal battle began Monday in Florence, Italy, with a retrial over the 2007 killing of her British roommate Meredith Kercher. But Knox, 26, who has expressed concern about returning to a country where she spent four years behind bars, was not in court.
