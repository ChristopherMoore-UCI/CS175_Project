The detention order said Adam Dandach of Orange County told federal agents he planned to travel to Syria to join ISIS, "a known terrorist organization, that he would assist ISIS with anything the ISIS asked him to do, and that he believed the killings of U.S. soldiers are justified killings. A 20-year-old California man who told authorities he wanted to travel to Syria to join the militant group Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been arrested, according to federal documents. It is seeking to create an Islamic caliphate that encompasses portions of Iraq and Syria and has begun imposing Sharia law in the towns it controls. "Dandach stated that he was more disappointed that he did not get to go to Syria than in getting in trouble with law enforcement," the detention order said. Dandach is being held in custody until his next court appearance, scheduled for Monday in Santa Ana.
