Obama takes minimum wage pitch to Michigan "If (a bill) includes raising the minimum wage, then it's a bad idea to put people out of work," said Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Reid has said a minimum wage vote could come up in the Senate as soon as next week. She made one of the earliest proposals to avoid the government shutdown, spent weeks trying to find agreement on an unemployment benefits extension, and has regularly been a key vote allowing issues to come to the Senate floor. -- Again stepping into the role of compromise-seeker, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is launching what may be a long-shot effort to forge bipartisan compromise over a minimum wage increase. He and many Democrats point out that the same CBO report concluded that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 would lift 900,000 Americans out of poverty, but a lower increase would have just one-third the effect.
