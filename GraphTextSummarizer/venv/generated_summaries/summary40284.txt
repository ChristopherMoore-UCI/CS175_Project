Gore's songwriting at its "Goriest" provided a sexual initiation of sorts into a world that blurred the lines between pain, pleasure, love, guilt, and sin. The reality show judge recently became a target when Gore criticized him, joking that Cowell should be shot for his crimes against pop music. " Bands such as RÃ¶yksopp, Coldplay, Linkin Park, the Killers, and Arcade Fire all cite Depeche Mode as an influence. And though Gore might have pushed the sexual concepts visually -- appearing on stage in women's lingerie, skirts, and bondage gear -- the message was a plea to "understand me." Sex "is one of the themes I've tackled over the years, because it's something important, and it's something I feel passionate about," Gore said.
