-- An investigation continued Monday into a helicopter crash that killed five people, including prominent Mexican businessman Moises Saba Masri, the state-run Notimex news agency said. The Sunday night crash also killed Saba's wife, their son, their son's wife and the pilot, said Mexican President Felipe Calderon, in an official statement of condolence. The helicopter's tail hit a house and its blades struck a tree, Moreno Brizuela said at a news conference monitored by Notimex. Fog and other inclement weather may have played a role in the accident, which occurred at 8:35 p.m., said Mexico City's civil protection secretary, Elias Moreno Brizuela. Saba Masri was one of Mexico's wealthiest citizens, said to be worth billions of dollars.
