Tanner told CNN his friend was unaware that Jerad Miller was with Amanda Miller. The officers were sitting in front of me, at the table right next to me, and this man came in out of nowhere," witness Sheree Burns told CNN affiliate KTNV. "They had a backpack, and I saw a gun in their hand," Lopez told CNN affiliate KLAS. Tanner recalled seeing Jerad Miller come into the store, seeing Miller dressed in some kind of fatigues and wearing gear. Amanda and her husband, Jerad Miller, had moved from Indiana to Las Vegas and for two weeks had been living with Fielder.
