Housekeepers and hot dog vendors have something in common Rather than tucking a laundered pillowcase under their chin, hospitality expert Jacob Tomsky says that hotel housekeepers have a chop-and-fold method of slipping pillows into pillowcases. "Why would you need to bring your own?" For guests allergic to down-filled pillows, Tomsky says that hotels keep a large supply of foam pillows. But few pillow menus are as varied as the list at Conrad Centennial Singapore, which has 16 pillows guests can choose from. For most of us, hotel pillows are an afterthought. "That housekeeper is going to see hundreds of thousands of hotel pillows," he explains.
