-- Almost six months after Japan's women gave the country a much-needed boost by winning the football World Cup, the team was again celebrating after scooping a hat-trick of prestigious awards. " Japan's surprise victory in Germany in July last year denied the much-fancied U.S. team a record third title. " Japan's Football Association also picked up the FIFA Fair Play Award in recognition of the hardships the country endured following the earthquake and tsunami that devastated large parts of Japan on March 11 last year. At a ceremony in Zurich, Switzerland late Monday, Homare Sawa was crowned FIFA Women's World Player of the Year after she captained Japan to the Women's World Cup title in Germany, while her manager Norio Sasaki was named coach of the year. Team skipper Sawa, dressed in a traditional kimono, was joined on stage by JFA president Junji Ogura to receive the accolade.
