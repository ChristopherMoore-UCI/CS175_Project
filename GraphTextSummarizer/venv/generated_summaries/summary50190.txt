Prices are going up Holiday airfares appear to be going up, the result of the usual higher demand for airline tickets around the holidays, airline mergers, flight cutbacks and higher airline fuel prices. While some 40% claim that budget is the most important factor in their plans, the American Express survey found travelers will spend more on holiday travel this year: $65 billion or about $773 per person, up from $659 last year.
