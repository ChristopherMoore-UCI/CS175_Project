And once again, it is controversial Liverpool striker Luis Suarez in the firing line. After their Premier League clash on Saturday, Stoke manager Tony Pulis called for the Uruguayan to be banned by the Football Association, for what he saw as Suarez's "embarrassing" attempt to win a penalty. "I find it incredible that in nearly all the coverage about Luis Suarez this weekend, very little focus has been placed on the fact that he was actually the victim of a stamping incident within the first five minutes of the game," said Rodgers. And through the club's official website, Rodgers has expressed his frustration that all the focus is on Suarez, and not Huth. The 25-year-old was banned for eight Premier League matches after being found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra last year.
