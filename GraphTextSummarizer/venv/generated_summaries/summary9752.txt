" "Recently, there was an announcement that it is technically possible to salvage Sewol ferry. On April 16, the Sewol ferry, carrying hundreds of high school students, began sinking after taking a sharp turn. Its cargo wasn't secured properly, which threw the ship off balance as the containers tumbled and knocked the vessel off balance. Earlier this month, several dozens of family members marched to Seoul from Ansan, the suburb where most of the students had resided. In the immediate aftermath, South Korean prosecutors arrested the captain, crew members and business associates.
