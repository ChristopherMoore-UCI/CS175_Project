The 31-year-old former Celtic and Espanyol player will go to his second World Cup, having missed out at home in 2002 after suffering a knee injury in the second-to-last warm-up match. But fellow J-League star Ryang Yong-Gi and Kim Kuk-Jin of Swiss second-division side FC Wil were dropped from the preliminary squad as the Koreans go to the communist nation's first World Cup in 44 years. Verbeek said the 21-year-old was not fit enough after playing through the season with painkilling injections to help a pelvic problem, despite the Dutchman having warned manager Gordon Strachan of English second division side Middlesbrough of the dangers. Lee went to the 1998 World Cup as a 19-year-old, but missed out as South Korea co-hosted the 2002 event with Japan and was injured just before the 2006 finals in Germany. New Zealand coach Ricki Herbert included uncapped duo Aaron Clapham and Winston Reid in his final 23-man squad.
