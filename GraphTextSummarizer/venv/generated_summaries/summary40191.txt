YU55 will not hit the Earth anytime soon, certainly not in the next 100 years, according to NASA's Near Earth Object Program. Scientists know there is far more to asteroids than danger; they are the material out of which the inner rocky planets in our solar system (Earth, Mars, Mercury, Venus) formed. On Tuesday, asteroid 2005 YU55 is scheduled to pass near Earth, slightly closer than the moon. If you've seen the "Asteroid" (1997) or "Deep Impact" (1998) movies, you know why people pay attention to what NASA calls "potentially hazardous objects": A large asteroid hitting the Earth could cause global catastrophe. If a large asteroid were found to be heading toward Earth, scientists and engineers have ideas about how to deflect it, perhaps using gravity or explosives.
