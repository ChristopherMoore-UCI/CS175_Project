"It was slightly delayed, we actually planned to open already last month," Swissotel's Oliver Kuhn told Reuters. In an interview with the Reuters news agency, the manager of Swissotel Sochi said his hotel would accept its first customers on the eve of the opening of the Olympics, rather than in January as had originally been planned. "There are still some issues to be solved as it is always just before the Games, but also in this respect we are in contact with the organizing committee and we hope the situation will be solved in the next couple of days," IOC president Thomas Bach told journalists. Four days before the opening of the Winter Games, some of the hotels being built for the Olympics are reporting construction delays that could affect the tens of thousands of visitors expected to descend on the region. The Sochi 2014 organizing committee announced that at least one of the hotels built to accommodate visiting journalists would not be ready.
