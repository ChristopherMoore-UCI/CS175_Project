The French have the impression that U.S. campaigns are more about the candidates than their ideas, and that when candidates do present ideas, they don't seem particularly substantial. It's all PR." Party animals Unlike the U.S., with only two functioning parties (maybe that's going a little far) that you can sometimes barely tell apart and no real left to speak of, France has many active political parties, from extreme left (and the Parti Communiste Fran√ßais is not considered extreme left) to extreme right. Then there's the cult of personality in U.S. politics that doesn't exist in France (although that's changing). Having so many parties works (kind of) in France because there is universal suffrage here and because French presidents are elected in two rounds. For the first time since 1988, the U.S. and France are holding presidential elections in the same year.
