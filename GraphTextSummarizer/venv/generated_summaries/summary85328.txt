It was Pongo's burning personal quest that brings us "The Uncanny," a black-and-white series that helps us experience the Congo in flesh and blood. It is also a photographic detour from the cliche images of the Congo -- a subtler but deeply psychological representation of how war affects daily lives. "I was allowed into the life of people who were former strangers ... and got a deeper understanding of what daily life in the Congo could feel like. These rich portraitures and compositions of Pongo's family members give us a vivid emotion of what it is like to be human as your country spirals into chaos. Connecting with his family in the Congo, the photographer attended baptisms and weddings, exorcisms and political rallies.
