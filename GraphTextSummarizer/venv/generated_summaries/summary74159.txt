The family of American photojournalist Luke Somers, who was held hostage and then killed by al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen, did not know of U.S. efforts to rescue him until the terrorist group released a video of him pleading for his life last week, family members told CNN on Monday. The organization also pointed out that the "raid is at least the third to be launched by U.S. special forces in an attempt to rescue American journalists held hostage in Syria and Yemen. The family was not asked to sign off on the U.S. effort to free Somers, his stepmother Penny Bearman and sister Lucy Somers said. He reiterated that Britain did not negotiate with hostage takers, saying that the UK government believed that paying ransoms "simply encourages more hostages to be taken. Somers and South African Pierre Korkie, a teacher, were fatally shot amid a failed U.S. military raid to rescue them Friday.
