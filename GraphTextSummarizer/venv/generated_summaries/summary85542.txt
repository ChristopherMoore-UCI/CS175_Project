White House officials said Obama was briefed "several times" by his top counterterrorism officials on the unfolding Navy Yard situation. "At the moment, Republicans in Congress don't seem to be focused on how to grow the economy and build the middle class," Obama said at his Monday event, which was pushed back almost an hour as law enforcement officers flooded the Washington Navy Yard in the southeastern part of the city. By the time President Barack Obama walked into a packed auditorium at the White House Monday, his economic message for the day had already been eclipsed by the unfolding tragedy at the Washington Navy Yard. Obama has deployed a parade of high-profile supporters -- including former President Bill Clinton -- to help convince Americans the law offers them a better deal on health insurance. An Obama administration onslaught to persuade senators and congressmen to vote for strikes was met with skepticism last week.
