As of September 27, the two wings of Jdeida prison were housing about 1,500 detainees, according to Human Rights Watch, which over a one-month span inspected eight prisons in Tripoli and 12 smaller detention facilities. "After all that Libyans suffered in Moammar Gadhafi's jails, it's disheartening that some of the new authorities are subjecting detainees to arbitrary arrest and beatings today," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Those interviewed told Human Rights Watch that they were beaten and given electric shocks. Among the places that Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam, visited during his visit to Tripoli this week was Jdeida prison. A fair system of justice -- absent for decades under strongman Moammar Gadhafi -- is an important step toward building a new Libya, the nation's Western allies have said.
