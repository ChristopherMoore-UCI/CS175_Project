A report from the Times in July alleged that by paying ransoms, European countries have influenced terror groups, including ISIS, to target people for kidnapping. A new report from The New York Times states that Foley and other ISIS captives were threatened with execution, tortured and starved ahead of their beheadings. American aid worker in Syria, Abdul Rahman Kassig, who served in the U.S. Army and was deployed to Iraq, was identified by ISIS as their next captive in line to be killed. As horrifying as Foley's last moments were, it was not the first time Foley looked death in the face at the hands of ISIS. Most of the hostages who were released came from countries which the Times says has a history of paying ransoms.
