Prosecutors seeking tattoo artists who inked Aaron Hernandez Prosecutors: Hernandez discussed killing in jailhouse calls Patriots added to wrongful death suit against Hernandez CNN's Michelle Rozsa contributed to this report -- Why would former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez allegedly "orchestrate the execution" of Odin Lloyd, leaving him shot seven times and his body near a construction pile in an industrial park? One of the incidents involved Lloyd seeing guns and ammunition stored at Hernandez' so-called flop house, his apartment in Franklin, Massachusetts. The motive was hinted at in court this week, when new details emerged about the events at Rumor nightclub where Hernandez and some friends partied before moving to Hernandez' apartment about 10 miles from his home. Investigators believe Hernandez' s simmering anger over two incidents at a nightclub and his apartment led him to allegedly kill Lloyd two nights later, CNN has learned.
