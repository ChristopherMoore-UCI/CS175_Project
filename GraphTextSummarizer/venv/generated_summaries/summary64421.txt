You might call her Hillary Clinton, candidate for president of the United States. According to the new book "HRC," she hired political staff to "keep the Clinton political network humming at State." " -- Ready for Hillary is the grass-roots outfit run by longtime Clinton confidant Craig Smith, who has been called an "adopted son" of the Clintons.

This week that campaign has taken her to the West Coast, where she has been giving a series of stump speeches just the way a presidential candidate would -- only she's getting paid $200K a pop.
