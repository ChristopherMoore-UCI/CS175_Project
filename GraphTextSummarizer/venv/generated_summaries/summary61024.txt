Britain's Queen Elizabeth II's filly Estimate came tantalizing close to defending her Gold Cup title at Ascot only to be edged out by a neck by a fast-finishing Leading Light in one of the most thrilling finishes in Gold Cup history. There was another milestone for Stoute as victory for Cannock Chase in the Tercentenary Stakes gave the trainer his 70th Royal Ascot victory, making him the most successful living trainer at the meeting. It's not often you see two national treasures go head-to-head at Royal Ascot, but Owen himself is popular figure in the paddock these days, having enjoyed a successful second career as an owner and breeder. Also bidding to spoil to the royal party was Brown Panther, owned by former England footballer Michael Owen. A superb ride by Joseph O'Brien on Leading Light ensured that Estimate's jockey, Ryan Moore, did not have things all his own way as they rounded the final bend.
