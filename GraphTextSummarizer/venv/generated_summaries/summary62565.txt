The film, about social-climbing tennis player Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and his fraught affair with American actress Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), makes the city, at times, look as lush as Allen's Manhattan -- no small trick. This romantic comedy, which starred Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall as two American students who get mixed up with a Spanish artist (Javier Bardem) and his mentally unbalanced ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), won a Golden Globe for best musical or comedy film. OK, so the film is barely out, but based on the trailer and the cast, this looks like one of Allen's episodic turns -- there's an older couple (Allen and Judy Davis), a set of confused young adults (Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, Ellen Page) and a couple of Europeans adding color (Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz). Allen's latest follows a sequence of films set in London, Barcelona and Paris. The Paris of "Midnight in Paris" (2011) Allen's whimsical tale of an American writer (Owen Wilson) in the City of Light is his most successful box office hit.
