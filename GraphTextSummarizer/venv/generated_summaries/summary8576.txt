That's why I am happy to support the "Let's Stay Together" campaign to say to everyone in Scotland just how much we do appreciate them being part of the UK family. The UK would feel a deep sense of loss if Scotland left Great Britain. When you write this all down, it looks a little complicated, but in practice millions of people do this every year in the UK with no problem -- some supporting in the way I do, some supporting Scotland, others Wales, and so on. It's a huge decision, especially for those in Scotland but also for everyone in the rest of the UK. I feel it would be for more positive for Scotland to remain an important and integral part of the UK and I wanted to say so publicly.
