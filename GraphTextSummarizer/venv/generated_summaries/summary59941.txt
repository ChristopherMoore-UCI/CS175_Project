The storyline occurs years after Anakin Skywalker won his race in "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace," but many of the characters are still around and add some great dialogue in between races. "Kinect Star Wars" tries to use the power of the Kinect controller for the Xbox 360 to put players into the action, using full-body motions to wield lightsabers, drive podracers and, unfortunately, dance for Jabba the Hutt. Modern dance songs are slightly tweaked to include "Star Wars" characters or plot points. Galactic Dance Off is the least "Star Wars"-like segment of the entire game. Overall, "Kinect Star Wars" has so much going on that it's is likely to have something that appeals to almost any style of gamer.
