Now, Brooklyn prosecutors have recommended that Ranta go free -- and if a judge agrees, he could walk out of court as early as Thursday. Sandy Silverstein, a spokesman for Hynes, told CNN that Ranta will be brought back to Brooklyn from a prison upstate on Thursday. Another acquaintance -- a woman who had brought charges against Ranta in a "prior altercation" -- told police that Ranta had confided in her about the planned jewelry robbery and the murder of the rabbi, prosecutors wrote. Baum told them about Lieberman's call, and the unit began to dig into Ranta's case. CNN's calls to Pierre Sussman, Ranta's current lawyer, were not immediately returned.
