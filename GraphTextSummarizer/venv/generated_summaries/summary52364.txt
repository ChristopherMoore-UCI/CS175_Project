Iranian lawmakers have summoned President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to answer questions before Parliament about his management of economic policies and key government ministers. The motion to summon Ahmadinejad, read out in Parliament on Tuesday, contained a long list of issues lawmakers want to take up with him, the semi-official Mehr News Agency reported, including "the president's alleged resistance to accept the Supreme Leader's decree to reinstate the intelligence minister. One of the most sensitive questions lawmakers say they plan to ask concerns Ahmadinejad's failed attempt to fire Intelligence Minister Heidar Moslehi in April. The move comes after a power struggle between Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei spilled into public view last year. Deputy Speaker Mohammad Reza Bahonar said Tuesday that lawmakers hoped Ahmadinejad would appear by mid-March.
