Vermont State Police Col. James Baker said Monday that investigators are considering that there may be "more victims of sexual abuse"  by Jacques. William Jenkins said the girl Jacques is accused of assaulting told investigators that when she was 9 or 10, she was told -- by telephone call and in a note left under her pillow -- that she had been chosen for enrollment in a "program for sex" and that Jacques was to be her trainer, The Associated Press reported late Monday. Authorities began focusing on Jacques based on information they gleaned through computer forensics, Baker said, adding, "This case is about social networking on the Internet." Jacques is listed as a registered sex offender in Vermont. Police charged Michael Jacques, 42, with aggravated sexual assault against a minor.
