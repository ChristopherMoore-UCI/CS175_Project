Outside the world of animation, Boxleitner hopes for more live-action "Tron" -- with one stipulation. "For anyone who witnessed the onset of computers and the dawn of video games, 'Tron' spoke to a lot of us with concepts about what it was like to be inside a computer or a virtual world," he said. " "We saw enough stuff (ahead of time) to know ('Tron') was going to be really beautiful," the actor said. This groundswell led Disney to relaunch the franchise with "Tron: Legacy" in 2010 (It even went so far as to screen test footage for fans at San Diego Comic-Con in 2008). "I just love looking back" at the time of "Tron's" release, Reubens said.
