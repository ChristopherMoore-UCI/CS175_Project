-- Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook were instrumental as Oklahoma City Thunder won the first game of the 2012 NBA Finals. Game two tips off on Thursday in Oklahoma City. "We are a confident team and it is a long series," said Erik Spoelstra, in quotes carried by AFP. However Durant, making his first appearance in the NBA showpiece, led Thunder's fightback with an impressive performance that culminated in 17 points in the final quarter. "I am just playing off my teammates and not trying to force anything," Durant told reporters after the game, in quotes carried by Agence France-Presse.
