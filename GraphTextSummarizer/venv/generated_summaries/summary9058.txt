Dennis Ritchie is the father of the C programming language, and with fellow Bell Labs researcher Ken Thompson, he used C to build UNIX, the operating system that so much of the world is built on -- including the Apple empire overseen by Steve Jobs. From B to C Dennis Ritchie built C because he and Ken Thompson needed a better way to build UNIX. " Ritchie's running joke was that C had "the power of assembly language and the convenience of ... assembly language." "The browsers are written in C. The UNIX kernel â€” that pretty much the entire Internet runs on -- is written in C. Web servers are written in C, and if they're not, they're written in Java or C++, which are C derivatives, or Python or Ruby, which are implemented in C. "[It] set the tone for the way that programming was done for several decades." As Pike points out, the data structures that Richie built into C eventually gave rise to the object-oriented paradigm used by modern languages such as C++ and Java.
