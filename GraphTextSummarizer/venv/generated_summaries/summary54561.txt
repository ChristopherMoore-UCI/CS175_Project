"Sepp Blatter is a good friend of us," said CSI Zurich co-president Rolf Theiler. "I was also in the Swiss Army as a high-level officer, I was a commander of a regiment -- definitely [there] you have contact with horses." Blatter, who has been involved with FIFA since 1975, was recently a special guest at the CSI Zurich horse show. He might have a special place in his heart for horses, but Blatter admits to having always preferred to admire them from afar rather than jump on board one. But forget felines -- it's equine beasts that really stir the emotions of the head of world football's governing body, Sepp Blatter. "This is what we like in football -- connecting people," Blatter said, comparing the world of equestrian and football.
