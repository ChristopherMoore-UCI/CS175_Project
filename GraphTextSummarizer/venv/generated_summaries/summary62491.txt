Similarly the Our Walmart campaign, which led the Black Friday walkouts at the nation's largest retailer last November, uses community organizing tactics rather than standard unionization methods. As organized money has successfully choked off the traditional road to unionism through the system created by the 1935 National Labor Relations Act under FDR, unions have turned to strategies from the community organizing tradition. One of them the Taxi Workers Alliance, is now formally affiliated with the AFL-CIO, which has developed other partnerships with worker centers in recent years. The worker centers have successfully spotlighted the many abuses such workers suffer, and have helped them organize. Meanwhile, what FDR called "organized money" has been on the warpath against another legacy of the New Deal: organized labor.
