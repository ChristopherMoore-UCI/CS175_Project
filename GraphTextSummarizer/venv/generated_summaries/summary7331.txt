They argue that Facebook is not losing users to other platforms -- instead, they say, more users are visiting other social media sites in addition to Facebook. Other social platforms such as Tumblr, Instagram (which is owned by Facebook), YouTube and Snapchat also have seen big growth among young users in the past year. "The urban legend (that Facebook is losing younger users) flows more often than not from surveys people have done of younger users that indicate that they're using other social services ... "We continue to have really high penetration rates among that age group, both in the U.S. and globally, and ... younger users remain among the most active and engaged users," Ebersman said. Instead of Facebook being the Walmart of social media, it will become just one platform in a big ecology, including photo sharing with Instragram, broadcasting with Twitter, etc."
