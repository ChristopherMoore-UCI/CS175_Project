-- President Barack Obama welcomed area students and children of military families Sunday to celebrate Halloween at the White House. They were greeted by a boisterous brass band and by adults dressed up as quintessential Halloween characters like Dracula and Frankenstein. His Democratic party is poised to lose seats in both chambers, and perhaps its House majority. At stake are all 435 House seats and 37 of the 100 Senate seats, along with almost 40 gubernatorial races. Participants were given M&M's, a sweet dough butter cookie and dried fruit.
