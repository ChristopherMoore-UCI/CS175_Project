Your email is subject to U.S. government snooping even if it is stored in computer servers outside the United States, a federal judge ruled Thursday in a potentially landmark case governing privacy and the limits of government surveillance powers. Under U.S. law, the emails stored in a so-called cloud server are business records subject to federal law enforcement warrants no matter where they are stored. Tech firms complain U.S. technology companies long have quietly complied with government surveillance requests, in part because the U.S. law largely prohibits companies from revealing surveillance orders. Microsoft, with the backing of Internet consumer privacy groups and other tech companies, including Apple, sought to use the case as a warning to U.S. consumers that their emails could become the subject of snooping by foreign governments. "It's hard to believe that the American people will blithely accept that foreign governments can obtain their emails stored in U.S. data centers without letting them know or notifying the U.S. government," Smith said in his opinion article.
