Finalized rules let religious groups opt out of contraception "There is a lot of work to be done to let people know that they will qualify and to even help them understand at a basic level what health insurance is," Curran said. The health care law expands who is eligible for Medicaid and makes insurance available to people who wouldn't have qualified before because of pre-existing conditions. "But now so many more people will be able to get access to primary care services because of this law, and now because of this grant, more people will know about it. " Curran said her center will use the grant to train staff how to help people sign up for insurance. Starting next January, all Americans must have health insurance or face a financial penalty.
