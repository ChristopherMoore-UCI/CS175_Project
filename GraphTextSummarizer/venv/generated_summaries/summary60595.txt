-- When it comes to the trust Americans put in government, a new national poll indicates it's a matter of location, location, location. "How broken is government in the mind of most Americans? That same figure for city folk is 50 percent, and for rural Americans, it is 47 percent. According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday, Americans overwhelmingly think that the government in this country is broken, but the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what's broken can be fixed. But that number surges to 52 percent for those who say they trust local government most or all of the time.
