This cannot make sense in the long run; government spending must be paid for with taxes, so it ultimately comes at the expense of private spending. Even in the short-run, the economic effect of public spending is often weak since it partially crowds out private spending. CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- When the Obama administration takes office in January, it will propose a fiscal stimulus consisting of increased government spending and lower taxes. Economist Jeffrey Miron says it's better to cut taxes than to raise government spending. The overall point is that government spending should be determined by long-run costs and benefits, while taxes should be sufficient to pay for programs that make sense on these grounds.
