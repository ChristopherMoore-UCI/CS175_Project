In 2003, we condemned Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell for relying on dodgy evidence of weapons of mass destruction while making the case for war before the United Nations. The suspected use of chemical weapons against innocent civilians by the Assad regime is despicable and deserves our condemnation. A similar cyber campaign aimed at disabling the communications and weapons delivery systems of the Assad regime could "degrade" al-Assad's ability to attack innocent civilians just the same. Mission creep and chaos are normal parts of war. Two options short of war leap to mind.
