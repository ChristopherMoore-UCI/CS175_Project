House passes measure to bring military chaplains back to work "Because of the letter of the law and the advice from the DOJ we had to identify those with the less direct effect on military members," said Hale. "We will recall a category of civilians who provide ongoing support to military members on an ongoing basis like health care, family programs, training and maintenance and commissaries. The group that will not be recalled from furlough includes staff who are "less directly related to military members," said Hale. We will also recall a second category of civilians whose work, if interrupted by a lapse for a substantial period, could cause future problems for military members. Hale said officials established a series of categories for civilians who will return to work and those who will not.
