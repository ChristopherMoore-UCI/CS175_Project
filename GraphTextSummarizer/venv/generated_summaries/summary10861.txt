U.S. economist Milton Friedman, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan, once said: "Economic freedom is an indispensable means to the achievement of political freedom." Now, with Obama's changes, some ordinary Cubans could gain higher incomes because they work in the growing tourist sector, could set up private businesses, or could receive higher-value remittances from  families in the United States. Across Havana, at a very different type of private business, nail salon owner Indira Yero has a very different viewpoint. Now small businesses like his could get substantial new cash injections thanks to measures announced by President Barack Obama, which came into effect Friday. Equally significant, the Obama administration has approved a four-fold increase in remittances from Cuban-Americans to their families in Cuba and no upper limit on remittances destined to fund small business. Unveiling the changes to U.S. trade and travel policy on December 17, Obama said: "We're calling on Cuba to unleash the potential of 11 million Cubans by ending unnecessary resistance to their political, social and economic activities." Predictably the decision drew fire from some U.S. Republicans who thought the easing of restrictions would put more money into the hands of the Cuban government, the United States' longstanding Cold War foe.
