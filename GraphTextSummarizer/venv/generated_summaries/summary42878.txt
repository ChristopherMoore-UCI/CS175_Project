Last weekend, more than 1,200 volunteers and Virginia Department of Emergency Management officials spent the weekend searching for clues that would lead them to Graham, CNN affiliate WTVR reported. Matthew and the lawyer spoke and then left, Longo said, giving detectives no clearer picture of what may have happened the day Graham disappeared. That was shortly before midnight, according to a timeline compiled by CNN affiliate WVIR. "I hope and pray that we might have an opportunity to talk to Jesse Matthew again because I think he can help up find Hannah Graham," the police chief said. Police executed a new search warrant at his home Monday, and Matthew's landlord told WVIR that police took two items.
