"Among women in the nonscreening group, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, as compared with the preceding 10-year period, presumably as a result of increased breast-cancer awareness, improved therapy, and the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools," the findings state. Researchers from Norway and Harvard University compared the death rates from breast cancer in four groups: one group of women from 1996 through 2005 who were living in Norwegian counties with screening; another group in the same time period who were living in counties without screening; and two similar groups from 1986 through 1995. It concluded the availability of mammography screening corresponded with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, "but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction." -- A new study released Thursday suggests mammograms might not be as effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 as previously thought. "Among women in the screening group, there was a 28 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer during the same period.
