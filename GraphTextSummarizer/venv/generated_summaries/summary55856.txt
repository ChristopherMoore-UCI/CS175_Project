Beckham will be able to play a more active role in England's bid due to the ruptured Achilles he suffered while on loan at Italian club AC Milan, which has also ruled him out of the Los Angeles Galaxy's Major League Soccer season. "It's fantastic news that David's schedule has enabled him to present and head our bid in Zurich," Football Association and bid chairman David Triesman told the FA Web site on Monday. FIFA has strict requirements for accommodation, transport, IT, medical services, broadcasting, safety and security, ticketing, hospitality and commercial rights. England, who have also asked to be considered for 2022 if unsuccessful for 2018, will be up against the United States, Russia, Australia and joint bids from Belgium and the Netherlands, and Portugal and Spain. With Europe likely to win the 2018 event, Japan, Qatar and South Korea are bidding for only 2022 hosting rights.
