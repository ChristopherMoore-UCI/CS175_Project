-- The Los Angeles Police Department can have access to personal tape recordings between Charles Manson follower Charles D. "Tex" Watson and his late attorney that investigators believe might hold clues to unsolved killings, a federal judge in Texas ruled Tuesday. " Judge gives tapes to LAPD in 'Manson family' investigation The tapes are about eight hours of recordings between Watson and his attorney from 1969, Bill Boyd of McKinney, Texas, according to court papers. Gov. Brown nixes release of former Manson follower Watson has long maintained there is nothing for authorities to gain with the recordings. The book was co-authored to show delicate consideration when sharing the graphic details of the crime in order to show respect towards the families of the victims." Watson, Manson and three others -- Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten -- were convicted of murder in the killings. LAPD investigators want the decades-old recordings between Watson and his attorneys because they believe the tapes could shed light on unsolved killings involving the "family," as Manson's followers were called, according to court documents.
