-- The widow of an al Qaeda in Iraq leader has been sentenced to 20 years in prison, after being convicted of involvement in terrorism. When they were killed more than a year ago, then-commander of U.S. Forces-Iraq Gen. Raymond Odierno called it "potentially the most significant blow to al Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency. He was killed along with Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, who was leader of the Islamic State of Iraq, an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq. Hasna Ali was the wife of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, one of the two top leaders of al Qaeda in Iraq who were killed in a joint Iraqi-U.S. operation in April 2010. Al-Masri was military leader of al Qaeda in Iraq.
