Steven Arnold of Mountain View, California, echoed Williams' sentiments and said tigers are wild animals that can do wild things, even in captivity. She says that keeping animals in zoos brings some risk to what is generally a safe environment. Tigers' animal instincts become more apparent at these events, he said. "They definitely give you the impression of being wild animals." Reflecting on the mauling, Williams said she will continue to go see the animals and added that she's observed that renovations go on all the time. "It's always scary when you go someplace where there's large animals in captivity," she said.
