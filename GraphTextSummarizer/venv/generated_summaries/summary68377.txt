As an integral part of this, Secret Service agents have two main concerns: To create and to maintain a tightly controlled environment in which the president can do his job safely and to bring everyone home at night. They miss birthdays and Christmas, Little League games, graduations, school plays, first teeth, first steps, first words. When the president travels, especially overseas, it's a flying circus with 800-1,000 people, limousines, helicopters, communications equipment, big guns, small guns, sometimes food, and often 20-30 planes. It didn't get the supplementary duty of protecting the president and vice president until after William McKinley was assassinated in 1901. It matters because the idiotic actions of 11 agents who forgot who they are and what their badge stands for deeply affects every active duty agent and tens of thousands of retired agents.
