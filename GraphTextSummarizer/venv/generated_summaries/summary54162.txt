-- Almost 24 years after "Baby" Houseman and Johnny Castle first swayed across the big screen, a movie studio announced plans for a remake of the '80s classic "Dirty Dancing." "Paying tribute to the emotional excitement of first love, the thrills and complexity of sexual awakening, the soul stirring power of dance, and the classic tale of teenage Baby's forbidden romance with Johnny Castle, the remake will incorporate classic songs from the 1960s, hits from the original film and brand new compositions," the entertainment studio Lionsgate said in a statement. "I'm so excited about this news and I think there's nobody better to do this than my beloved Kenny Ortega, who is as responsible as anyone for the success of the first one," said the actress, who played "Baby" in the original film. Ortega also directed pop singer Michael Jackson's 2009 posthumous tour film "This Is It." "Patrick Swayze set the bar for men dancing in the movies as Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire did before him. Ortega said he looks forward to casting the successors to the original movie's stars, Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze. The film's original choreographer, Kenny Ortega, will direct the remake.
