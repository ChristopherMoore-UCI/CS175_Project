-- A court in northern Japan found two Greenpeace activists guilty Monday for stealing whale meat, but suspended their sentences, Greenpeace Japan said. Japan's whaling has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocacy groups, who claim it involves the cruel slaughter of whales so that meat can be sold in markets and restaurants. Joji Morishita of the Japan Fisheries Agency has said the government recognizes the right of protest, but activists will be punished if they break Japan's laws. And a U.N. human rights body declared Japan's trial of the men a violation of human rights. Japanese officials say their hunts are permitted under rules that prohibit commercial whaling but allow whaling for scientific reasons.
