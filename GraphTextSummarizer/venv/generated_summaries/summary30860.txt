Lying alone on a mattress on the floor, she told me how Aline Gadhafi and one of her staff poured boiling water over her head and body, simply because she'd been unable to stop one of the Gadhafi children from crying. I ask Shweyga about Aline Gadhafi and she speaks rapidly and with conviction. We found Shweyga abandoned in a Gadhafi family compound in August. But like her husband Hannibal Gadhafi, Aline's whereabouts remains unknown. Shweyga's unbelievably awful story of torture at the hands of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi's daughter-in-law Aline has touched people around the world and resulted in some $40,000 being donated to a special fund for her recovery.
