That aside, after serving, ironing, cooking, chamoising and putting up with bulimic supermodels, there is a real sense of triumph when you complete a two-week or two-month stint with guests on board a 24/7 running (and you are literally running) superyacht. Encountering bad weather and rough seas is inevitable and makes trying to keep guests happy (and from vomiting) quite a challenge. A person in my position with experience can hope to make from $3500-$6000 a month, not including tips, while inexperienced crew can hope to earn around $2000-3000 a month. For all the challenges yachting presents, I actually enjoy the rush, the work and the lifestyle (just don't ask me that after cleaning up after a boat full of sea sick guests!). On a busy and successful charter yacht you can hope to make tips of around 5 to 15% of the cost of the charter per week divided amongst the crew.
