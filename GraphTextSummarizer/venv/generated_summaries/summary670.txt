The publication said that while the modern discovery of an undescribed bird species close to sea-level within the limits of a large city in a populous country was extraordinary, it was not unprecedented, citing the discovery of new species of marsh bird close to Sao Paulo in Brazil in 2005. "The discovery indicates that new species of birds may still be found in familiar and unexpected locations," he said in a statement. According to the Oriental Bird Club publication "Forktail", a half century of human conflict in Indochina -- which made the region off-limits to bird watchers -- has made Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam a fertile zone for twitchers, with the past two decades witnessing a flush of new bird discoveries. "Asia contains a spectacular concentration of bird life, but is also under sharply increasing threats ranging from large scale development projects to illegal hunting," Steve Zack, WCS Coordinator of Bird Conservation said in a press release. But to find one in plain view on a construction site in urban Phnom Penh in Cambodia is nothing short of a sensation in ornithological circles.
