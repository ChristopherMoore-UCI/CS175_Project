Marshals were trailing a vehicle known to be driven in the past by Perez, according to CNN affiliate KPHO. Marshals and other members of a task force had confronted a suspect outside the Sears store on the west side of Chandler Fashion Center, said Arizona Department of Public Safety spokesman Robert Bailey. Perez is accused of shooting at Arizona Department of Public Safety officers December 11 outside a home in Casa Grande, according to KPHO. After a thorough police sweep, the mall reopened later Wednesday, Chandler Detective David Ramer told CNN. The suspect was being sought in an armed robbery, Chandler police said.
