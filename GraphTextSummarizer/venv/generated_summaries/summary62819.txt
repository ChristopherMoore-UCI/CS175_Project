-- NBA players and owners did not reach a deal early Thursday on the bitter labor struggle that has postponed the basketball season, but the two sides agreed to meet again later in the day to continue with the negotiations. NBA commissioner David Stern had said that players had until 5 p.m. Wednesday to accept the terms of a labor offer that would give players between 49% and 51% of basketball revenues. If it didn't accept the deal, the NBA would offer another proposal that would offer players 47% of basketball revenues. Stern said he had frozen that deadline to allow negotiations to continue. Stern has said the 2010-2011 season was not profitable for most of the league's 30 owners, who want cost-cutting help from players.
