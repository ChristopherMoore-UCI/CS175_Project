-- Jeffrey Fowle, an American arrested in North Korea in May for leaving a bible at a club for foreign sailors, has been released and is on his way home, a senior State Department official told CNN on Tuesday. The Ohio Republican said he spoke with Fowle's wife and Robert King, the U.S. special envoy on North Korean human rights issues, after Fowle -- a Miamisburg, Ohio resident -- was detained. " "North Korea is a country with egregious human rights violations and it's important that the U.S. continue to stand for the rights of all people, including religious freedoms, at home and abroad," Portman said. Last month, Fowle gave an interview to CNN pleading for U.S. help and speaking about conditions of his detention. North Korea announced Fowle's detention in June, saying he had violated the law by acting "contrary to the purpose of tourism."
