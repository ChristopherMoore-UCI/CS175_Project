Clay, to step aside because of what people say is his impartiality toward the police. Critical words about harsh tactics Nixon is the latest politician to criticize police tactics that created a war zone atmosphere in Ferguson, a town of 22,000 near St. Louis. The governor, however, offered praise for members of the community who have been protesting Brown's killing during an encounter with police. Thousands of people marched and not a single gunshot fired by a member of law enforcement last night, and the members of community (were) tremendous helpful last night to get through what could have been a very difficult night," he said on CNN's "State of the Union." After days of heavily armed police patrolled the streets of Ferguson with a heavy hand and periodic use of force, Nixon ordered Missouri State Highway Patrol to take over the police response on Thursday. "Police have been beating the hell out of black people for a very, very, very long time before the advent of the video camera and despite the advent of the video camera there are still a lot of incredible trend of police brutality and killing in the street and justice is never served," said the "Grey's Anatomy" actor and board member of the civil rights organization The Advancement Project.
