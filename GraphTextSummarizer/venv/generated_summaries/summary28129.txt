Further down the chart, the Coen Bros.' folky Oscar contender, "Inside Llewyn Davis," made a huge splash in limited release. Movie review: 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' Christian Bale's latest drama, "Out of the Furnace," didn't connect with moviegoers on its opening weekend. "Catching Fire" is still playing about $34 million ahead of "The Hunger Games" at the equivalent point in its run, but as evidenced by this weekend's drop, it's falling faster than that film, too. The rootsy tale strummed up $402,000 from just four theaters, which resulted in a $100,500 per theater average â€” the second best of the entire year after "Blue Jasmine," which managed a $102,011 average from six theaters in July. CBS Films will begin expanding "Inside Llewyn Davis" in two weeks.
