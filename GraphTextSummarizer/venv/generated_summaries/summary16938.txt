On why "Girl Meets World" almost didn't happen: When execs at Disney first approached Jacobs with the idea of revisiting Boy Meets World, he promptly nixed the idea. After months of speculation surrounding the "Boy Meets World" reboot, "Girl Meets World," it seems like the pieces are finally starting to come together. On his vision for Girl Meets World: Like its predecessor, Jacobs says he hopes the pilot for "Girl Meets World" captures "the confusions about growing up and what we are supposed to be and what we are supposed to aspire to be." That was always the column that I wanted Boy Meets World to be included in and I want Girl Meets World to be in that column as well. "A reunion show that's one and done," says Jacobs, who instead suggested centering the pilot on Cory and Topanga's daughter, Riley.
