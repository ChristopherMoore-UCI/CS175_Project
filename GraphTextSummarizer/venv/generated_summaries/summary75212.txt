She's said it once, and she'll say it four times: Sen. Elizabeth Warren is not running for president. Asked four times by NPR's Steve Inskeep on Monday morning whether she was running for president, Warren held her ground, repeating each time: "I am not running for president. It eventually passed both the House and the Senate, however, and Warren said Monday morning that "we don't want to shut down the government," suggesting she has no plans to take Congress past the brink to defend her priorities. Inskeep pointed out that she was speaking in the present tense, and that she hadn't said she would "never" run, but Warren didn't change her tune, eventually becoming so exasperated she demanded, "do you want me to put an exclamation point at the end?" The questions came in the context of a growing movement to draft Warren into the presidential race, launched by a handful of progressive groups that see her as a transformative figure on the left. One rider rolled back a key provision of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, a pet priority of Warren's.
