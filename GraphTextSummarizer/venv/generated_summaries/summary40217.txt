U.S. envoy George Mitchell says Israel and the United States will remain close allies. It was one of several key issues both sides must emphasize if they are to take advantage of the current "historic period" and achieve peace, Peres told visiting U.S. envoy George Mitchell. Peres won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts as foreign minister to secure peace, along with Israeli President Yitzak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. " Mitchell also met Tuesday with Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak, and is expected to meet with Netanyahu, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. "There is agreement in Israel regarding the evacuation of illegal outposts and not to build new settlements," Peres told Mitchell.
