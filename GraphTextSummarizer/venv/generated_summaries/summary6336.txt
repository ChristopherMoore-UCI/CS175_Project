In March Klum and fellow judge designer Michael Kors will be starring in their own "Project Runway" video game, in which players can design fashion lines, choose their models, strut down the catwalk, and strike a pose in a photo shoot. The new season of "Project Runway" kicks off Season 7 on Lifetime network on Thursday. Klum signed on as host, judge and executive producer of the reality show, in which up-and-coming fashion designers compete for the chance to receive money to launch their own fashion line. The German-born model entered a different bracket of current and former models in 2004 when she became an entrepreneur with the television series "Project Runway." The mother of four -- who recently changed her last name to Samuel for her husband, the singer known as "Seal" -- also said that there are certain jobs she just doesn't do anymore.
