-- Eight former Argentine military officers, including two one-time dictators, went on trial this week to face allegations that they systematically stole babies from political prisoners and gave them new identities. " Videla was previously convicted in December of human rights abuses during his rule and is currently serving a life sentence in prison. "We have fought for many years so that today we can have a country where we have justice," Pisani told CNN en Espa√±ol. Bignone was sentenced in April of last year to 25 years in prison for kidnapping and torturing 56 people. Carlos Pisani, whose parents were both kidnapped when he was only 37 days old, said that he's been waiting for more than three decades for justice to be done.
