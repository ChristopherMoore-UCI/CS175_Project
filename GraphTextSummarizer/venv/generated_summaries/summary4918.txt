The Richardson Center for Global Engagement said in a Facebook posting that Bill Richardson, the former governor of New Mexico,  visited Tahmooressi last week at El Hongo federal prison in Mexico and was instrumental in securing his release. U.S. Reps. Ed Royce (R-California) and  Matt Salmon (R-Arizona) issued statements thanking Mexican authorities for showing compassion. A court ordered that Tahmooressi, who'd been held on weapons charges, be freed, a Mexican federal government news release said. "It is with an overwhelming and humbling feeling of relief that we confirm that Andrew was released today after spending 214 days in Mexican jail," relatives said in a statement Friday night. Mexican prison authorities have denied the abuse allegations.
