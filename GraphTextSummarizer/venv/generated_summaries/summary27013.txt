Red Bull driver Vettel edged out Ferrari's Fernando Alonso at the final race of the 2012 season to clinch a third successive drivers' title by just three points, while his team celebrated a third constructors' crown in a row. " Alonso, a two-time drivers' champions, made first appearance of preseason in Catalunya on Tuesday, but Vettel remains focus on ensuring Red Bull arrive at the season-opening Australian Grand Prix on March 17 in the best possible shape. It was an uncharacteristically slow start to year from Red Bull, with Vettel winning the year's fourth grand prix in Bahrain but then not picking up a second success until September's race in Singapore. -- Triple Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel has warned his 2013 title rivals that Red Bull are in better shape than this time 12 months ago. "I don't think it will be much different from what was important last year -- again it will be very close, so it will not be a case of two or three drivers fighting it out," continued Vettel.
