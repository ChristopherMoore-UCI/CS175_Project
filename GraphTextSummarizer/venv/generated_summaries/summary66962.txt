CNN caught up with him backstage at the Bonnaroo music festival last month, where he played with African kora player Toumani Diabate, to discuss his film and experience in Africa and what prompted him to go. The kora is a 21-string harp, and he comes from 71 generations from it being taught from father to son, father to son. I've always wanted to go back to Africa and hear what's going on there and find the instruments that still exist that are the roots of the banjo and play music with them. He's collaborated with bluegrass musicians, jazz players, classical performers and any number of other talented artists. I think it's different than playing pop music or electric instruments.
