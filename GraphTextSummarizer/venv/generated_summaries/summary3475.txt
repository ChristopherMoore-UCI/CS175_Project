There were limited details about the man's health, but he had an illness, rather than an injury, said New Zealand Air Force Squadron Leader Kavae Tamariki. "She's landed, and we're just waiting for confirmation that they've taken off," Tamariki said from New Zealand on Tuesday afternoon. It's the second time in six months that New Zealand's Air Force has been asked to rescue a sick American from McMurdo, because the Air Force is familiar with Antarctic weather and flying conditions, Tamariki said. It was unclear what the man in Tuesday's rescue was doing at McMurdo Station, but research is done at and near the station in aeronomy and astrophysics, biology and medicine, geology and geophysics, glaciology and glacial geology, and ocean and climate systems. A crew of 12, plus three medics, flew to evacuate the man Tuesday from the U.S. research base at McMurdo Station.
