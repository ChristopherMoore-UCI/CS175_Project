The 42-year-old sealed his first victory of this year's meeting by leading home a Godolphin one-two, with stablemate Opinion Poll second under Mikael Barzalona. Dettori had decided to switch rides from Opinion Poll, a decision that paid off when his Saeed Bin Suroor-trained gray won by half a length to earn the Italian's fifth victory in the prestigious race and his first since 2004. The Queen, wearing mint green on the third day of Royal Ascot -- Ladies' Day -- had earlier taken her customary trip to the parade ring to inspect her filly ahead of the race and exchange a few words with her jockey, Hayley Turner. Magnier's part-owned Fame And Glory, the pre-race favorite and the winner last year, finished down the field under Jamie Spencer. Bin Suroor became only the eighth trainer to claim five Gold Cup victories and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's Godolphin matched Sue Magnier's benchmark five for owners.
