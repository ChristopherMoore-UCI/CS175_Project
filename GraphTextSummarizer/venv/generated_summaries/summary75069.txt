He could have used any font, but he chose Comic Sans "to provoke a reaction." "If I'd made it in Helvetica people would've just observed it as a little design experiment," he said in a phone interview Saturday. He also leads YouTube tutorials on how to write in different fonts to show people that they can "retrain themselves" to use media differently from how they were taught in school. The Comic Sans Criminal website urges people to take the "Comic Sans Pledge" to seriously consider whether it is "an appropriate font choice" before using it in any printed work. Instead, by altering a classic machine to type one of the most polarizing fonts, he hopes to make people think about how they consume, generate and store media. "I sincerely want people to consume and generate and make media in a considered fashion," he said.
