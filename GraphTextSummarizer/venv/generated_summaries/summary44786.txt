Burkina Faso is left with just one point from two games and seemingly out of luck after Alain Traore twice saw first half efforts strike the woodwork. Bulot's first time volley early in the match had nearly put Gabon into an early lead but it was turned over the crossbar by Christoffer Mafoumbi in the Congo goal. Congo looks set for the quarterfinals after securing its first victory at the finals of the Africa Cup of Nations for 41 years with an upset 1-0 win over favored Gabon Wednesday. The vital win in Congo's first appearance at AFCON since 2000 leaves Claude Le Roy's team needing just a draw from its final group game against Burkina Faso to reach the quarterfinals. Earlier, 2013 runner-up Burkina Faso and host Equatorial Guinea played to a goalless draw, leaving both sides looking for victories in the final round of group matches to advance further in the 16-team competition.
