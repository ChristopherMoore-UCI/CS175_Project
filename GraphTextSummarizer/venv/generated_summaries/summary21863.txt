-- French President Francois Hollande visited the Malian town of Timbuktu on Saturday, a jubilant trip days after his nation's forces freed the fabled city from the iron grip of Islamist militants. French-led forces liberated the historical city this week after Islamist militants took control of it last year. Hollande's visit comes a day after a rights group accused Malian troops of extrajudicial killings and abuses during the offensive. French troops, he said, are not in Mali to venture into politics. The town is now back under Malian control.
