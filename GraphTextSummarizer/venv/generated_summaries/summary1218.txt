A Kaufman County, Texas, jury on Thursday took about 1Â½ hours to find Williams guilty of murder in the death of Cynthia McLelland, the wife of that county's then-District Attorney Michael McLelland, the county's Bruce Wood said. Williams wasn't put on trial for Michael McLelland's death or the January 2013 killing of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, though authorities did accuse him in both of those deaths. Plus, Eric Williams himself hasn't been tried for Hasse or Michael McLelland's deaths. Eric Williams, a former justice of the peace in Texas accused of killing two prosecutors, could soon be sentenced to death after being convicted of capital murder. "I understand there will be quite a few witnesses brought in on both sides," said Wood, who is a Kaufman County judge in addition to speaking for the county.
