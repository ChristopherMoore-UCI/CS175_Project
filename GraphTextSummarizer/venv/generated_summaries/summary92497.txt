Last year, North Korea sentenced Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American, to 15 years of hard labor on charges he planned to topple the government through religious activities. Merrill Newman, an American veteran of the Korean War detained by North Korea last year, said that he was made to deliver an "apology" on state media that was not his own words. -- North Korea has freed John Short, a 75-year-old Australian missionary whom it detained last month. North Korea has a number of state-controlled churches, but the authoritarian Communist regime doesn't tolerate independent religious activities. "People caught practicing Christianity are subject to severe punishments in violation of the right to freedom of religion and the prohibition of religious discrimination," the report by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea said.
