"I read [every study I could find] and I realized there was a ton of evidence showing concussions lead to depression, and multiple concussion can lead to Alzheimer's." Far from innocuous, invisible injuries, concussions confer tremendous brain damage. On Tuesday afternoon, researchers at the CSTE released a study about the sixth documented case of CTE in former NFL player Tom McHale, who died in 2008 at the age of 45, and the youngest case to date, an 18-year-old multi-sport athlete who suffered multiple concussions. Johnson said he played through concussions because he, like many other NFL athletes, did not understand the consequences. The NFL is planning its own independent medical study of retired NFL players on the long-term effects of concussion.
