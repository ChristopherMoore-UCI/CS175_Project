Twitter's decision in June to no longer let users tweet to LinkedIn may have actually helped the company overcome criticism that it's a low-engagement network: PageLever, an analytics tool for Facebook Pages, found that the Twitter disentanglement actually prompted a 1,000% increase in page referrals from Facebook. Since the Twitter breakup, LinkedIn also ushered in a redesign that made it look more like Facebook or Google+. The elite circle includes President Obama, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, physician/writer Deepak Chopra, Virgin founder/CEO Richard Branson, motivational speaker Tony Robbins and Mashable's founder/CEO Pete Cashmore, among others. -- LinkedIn hopes to jazz up its news feed with the addition of 150 super influencers on the network who fans can follow, a la Twitter. While fake accounts and off-subject tweets are part of that social network's charm, unleashing the same on LinkedIn could destroy its niche as a sober forum for business.
