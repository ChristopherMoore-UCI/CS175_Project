What Wilson told the grand jury "It would be senseless for him to go back to Ferguson," CNN legal analyst Mark O'Mara said. " How prosecutor defended grand jury's decision More investigations Wilson is still the subject of an internal investigation by the Ferguson Police Department over what happened on August 9, the day he fatally shot unarmed teenager Michael Brown. Since the grand jury declined to indict Wilson, one could conclude that the shooting was justified based upon Wilson's and Brown's actions. "If I'm the mayor of Ferguson, believe me, you would want that cop out because you know that he will be controversial," CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said. And the U.S. Justice Department is conducting two civil rights investigations: one into whether Wilson, who is white, violated Brown's civil rights, and the other into the police department's overall track record with minorities.
