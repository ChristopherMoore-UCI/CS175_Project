Rehman Malik, who appeared in a Karachi court regarding an outstanding corruption case against him, said intelligence officers warned him against going to pre-announced events such as Friday's court appearance, which was well-publicized a few weeks ago. -- Pakistan's interior minister, citing police evidence gathered after a deadly house bombing Friday, said people at the dwelling had been planning to attack him during a court appearance in Karachi. Also Friday, a suspected U.S. drone strike killed five people in northwestern Pakistan, two intelligence sources said. Police were investigating the cause of the blast, and Malik said people in the house were members of a family from the Swat Valley in North West Frontier Province. Malik had been among thousands of bureaucrats and politicians who had been granted amnesty by Pakistan's National Reconciliation Ordinance.
