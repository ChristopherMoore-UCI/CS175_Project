In 2009, Gross was arrested by Cuban state security agents and eventually sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned communications equipment to the island. So what has U.S. State Department subcontractor Alan Gross been up to since he was released from a Cuban prison exactly three months ago? Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the Democrat representing the Maryland district Gross hails from, called it "incredibly moving" that a man who spent five years in a Cuban prison has since sat next to first lady Michelle Obama and met the pope. After five years of being disconnected from the outside world, Gross now frequently posts on social media, writing of family reunions, eating the foods he longed for in prison and the reminders he experiences of his time in Cuba. The photos that Gross posted online show a smiling man, slowly putting back on some of the 100 pounds he lost in prison, no longer the gaunt-faced, hollow-eyed prisoner who had gone on hunger strikes to protest his conditions while he was held in Cuba.
