Among the show's nominations were picks for best comedy series as well as best actress in a comedy for creator and writer Lena Dunham. Despite both critical acclaim and a growing audience, Louis C.K.'s FX series "Louie" didn't make the cut for comedy series, though the comedian-writer-DIY guy did receive a nod for best actor in a comedy. "Girls" joined fellow newcomer "Veep" as well as comedy mainstays "Modern Family" -- which led all comedy series with 14 nominations -- "30 Rock" (13 nods), "The Big Bang Theory" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" among comedy series nominees. "Homeland," about a CIA agent combating terrorism and her own demons, received plenty of attention, picking up nine nominations, including nods for best drama series and stars Claire Danes and Damian Lewis. NBC's "Parks and Recreation" missed out on best comedy series as well, though star Amy Poehler got a nomination.
