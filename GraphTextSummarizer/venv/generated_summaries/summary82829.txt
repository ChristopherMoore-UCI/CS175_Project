-- Governors of several Venezuelan states have warned that recent oil spills and other contamination could be polluting local drinking water. "We call on the national government to declare an emergency in the whole water system because ... there is no guarantee that the water going to the homes in the center of the country is drinkable," said Henrique Salas Feo, governor of Carabobo state, alleging that drinking water from a reservoir was contaminated. Two opposition governors in other states have also expressed concerns about water in recent weeks. Critics say the government should analyze what could be causing drinking water problems, rather than investigating those who have expressed concerns. On Thursday, Venezuela's attorney general said a court had issued an injunction requiring media to "act with extreme responsibly" and present evidence when broadcasting information about the country's water, saying that past reports on contamination were presented without proof in order to cause panic.
