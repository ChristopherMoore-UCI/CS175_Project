According to the public affairs office for Fort Bragg, in North Carolina, Sinclair pleaded guilty to committing adultery, engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said he broke military law through sexual relationships -- including threats to some women involved, who had lower ranks -- between 2009 and 2012, overseas in Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany, as well as Fort Bragg and Fort Hood, Texas. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair -- once one of the U.S. Army's top commanders in Afghanistan -- pleaded guilty Thursday to several charges related to sexual relationships with female troops, but not the most serious one against him. His court martial is expected to resume Friday morning with opening statements and the prosecution presenting its case, according to the Fort Bragg press office. Charges also loom for alleged cruel and maltreatment of subordinates and defrauding the government, according to Fort Bragg.
