Murray must now hope to beat world number two Roger Federer and Canada's Milos Raonic in his final two group matches to progress to the knockout stage in London as he admitted. The comeback proved short lived as Nishikori held his service and then broke Murray to 30 to wrap up victory in one hour 36 minutes. Nishikori, beaten by Marin Cilic in the U.S. Open final, overcame early nerves at the 02 Arena as he fell an early break behind to Murray. -- Kei Nishikori chose a timely moment to secure his first win over Andy Murray and leave the home hope facing an early exit from the ATP World Tour Finals in London. A run of 20 wins in his last 23 matches had raised hopes that Murray could challenge for the title at the end of season finale, but Japan's Nishikori has left that in severe doubt after a 6-4 6-4 victory in Group B play Sunday.
