In two preliminary votes, the FDA panel found that Avandia has an increased risk of heart problems compared with other drugs -- but it made the same determination in 2007 without voting to pull the drug, recommending stronger warnings instead. And Dr. David Graham, the author of a June study that also found higher risk of heart problems among Avandia users, said the RECORD study would have been dismissed as "garbage" if it had been used to seek the drug's original approval. Its leaders released documents they said show Glaxo "failed to publish studies that found serious health risks associated with Avandia in a timely manner and actively promoted the drug despite the known safety concerns." But Dr. Murray Stewart, Glaxo's vice president for clinical development, said Tuesday that the company's studies "provide the most robust and reliable data" to assess Avandia's safety -- and those studies have found "no evidence to suggest" the drug increases the risk of heart problems. -- A Food and Drug Administration committee delivered a split verdict on the diabetes drug Avandia on Wednesday, with most members voting to leave it on the market but recommending different changes in how it's prescribed.
