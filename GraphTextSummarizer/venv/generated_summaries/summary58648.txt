In previous interviews, Chung has said that her brother suffers from health problems including severe back and leg pain, kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision. His mother, Myunghee Bae, who visited her son in North Korea in October, told CNN that her son was a devout Christian who had not understood the North Korean system. Among the allegations: Bae was setting up bases in China to topple the North Korean government;  he was encouraging North Korean citizens to bring down the government; and he was conducting a "malignant smear campaign. U.S. officials have struggled to establish how exactly Bae ran afoul of North Korean authorities. Word of Bae's arrest first surfaced in South Korea media reports days after he was detained, with the United States later confirming it.
