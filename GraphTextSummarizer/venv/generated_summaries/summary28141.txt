" Philadelphia Youth Poetry Movement, Â­ a 5-year-old nonprofit run entirely by volunteers, helps Philadelphia youth discover the power of their voices through spoken word and literary expression. The group provides a safe place for personal growth for youth who might otherwise have gone unnoticed, she said, adding that it is disappointing to have flash mobs be the face of Philadelphia youth. Instead, flash mobs in Philadelphia are violent eruptions in which mobs of teens run through the streets attacking people and damaging property. "Winning wasn't on my mind, it was doing the best that we could," said Davis, an incoming high school senior who performed the poem "Femininjas," a social critique on the harassment of women, at the finals alongside teammate Charmira Nelson. The team returned to Philadelphia with very little fanfare, and the students went right back to attending Saturday writing workshops.
