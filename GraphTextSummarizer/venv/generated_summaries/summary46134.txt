After the 27-year-old announced that he's performing in an art piece called "#IAmSorry" this week in Los Angeles, actors such as Jerry O'Connell and Emile Hirsch are turning LaBeouf's apologetic saga into a punchline. He, too, wore a paper bag over his head -- one saying "SUPER FAMOUS" instead of LaBeouf's "I AM NOT FAMOUS ANYMORE" -- but eagerly apologized for "all the world's ills" and even offered one guy a taste of his sandwich. Like LaBeouf, O'Connell's set-up involves a table of items that occasionally reference his career: where LaBeouf had nods to "Transformers," "Indiana Jones" and a copy of Daniel Clowes' book, "The Death-Ray," O'Connell included a DVD of "Stand By Me" and a toy kangaroo (2003's "Kangaroo Jack," anyone?). Considering that LaBeouf is facing accusations of plagiarism with his "#IAmSorry" show anyway, O'Connell's rip-off of LaBeouf's exhibit is "is obviously the point," BuzzFeed notes. On Wednesday, O'Connell actually opened his own exhibit right next to LaBeouf's called "#IAmSorryToo" for Funny Or Die.
