Those, at least, were the conclusions of the 192-page report, the most detailed that a cross parliamentary committee has ever authored, on the gruesome murder of the British soldier Lee Rigby by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale in London in May 2013. " Indeed, the report went as far to suggest that popular networks like Facebook have become "safe haven for terrorists" because messages sent within their services aren't accessible to British intelligence agencies like MI5. They assume that it's a top-down system that, like 20th century postal service or the telephone, can be manageably monitored by state security services like MI5. Ninety per cent of all the world's data has been produced over the last two years and Facebook users alone are sharing almost 2.5 million pieces of content every minute. Some commentators, already paranoid about the supposedly apocalyptic threat of Islamic terrorism, have accused Facebook of "having blood on its hands" and of "not giving a monkey's" about the fate of Lee Rigby.
