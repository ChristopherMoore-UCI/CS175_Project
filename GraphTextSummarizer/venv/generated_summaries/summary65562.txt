The three -- Russian cosmonaut Fyodor Yurchikhin, American astronaut Karen Nyberg and Italian Luca Parmitano of the European Space Agency -- will spend the next six months at the space station until their scheduled departure in mid-November. Once inside the space station, they will join Chris Cassidy of NASA and Pavel Vinogradov and Alexander Misurkin of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, who have been in the orbiter since March. One of them was Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield, who became a viral video hit by singing David Bowie's "Space Oddity" in a five-minute clip recorded on the station. Nyberg went into space on the Shuttle Discovery in 2008, while Parmitano is making his first space flight.
