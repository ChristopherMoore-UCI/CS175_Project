On Monday, Pakistan's intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met with CIA Director Leon Panetta at CIA headquarters to voice his government's complaints about CIA activities in his country. Pakistani officials insisted this week that the United States give them details about other CIA contractors in the country. Drone strikes are now carried out autonomously by the CIA, a senior Pakistani intelligence official told CNN earlier. Although the United States said Davis was a security officer assigned to protect CIA officers, the Pakistanis maintained he was actually a spy whom they had been unaware of prior to the shooting incident. Tensions came to a head recently when when CIA contractor Raymond Davis was arrested after killing two Pakistani men in Lahore.
