Former Sen. John Glenn, 92, had a heart valve replaced last month at the Cleveland Clinic, according to Hank Wilson, director of communications for the John Glenn School of Public Affairs at the Ohio State University. Glenn, piloting the Mercury space capsule dubbed Friendship 7, became the first American to orbit Earth on February 20, 1962, circling the planet three times in just under five hours. The first American to orbit the Earth has undergone successful heart surgery. In 1998, at age 77, he flew a nine-day mission aboard the space shuttle Discovery, becoming the oldest person to travel in space. He is the last surviving of the original seven U.S. astronauts from Project Mercury.
