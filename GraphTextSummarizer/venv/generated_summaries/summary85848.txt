The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which ruled Egypt after the 2011 ouster of longtime President Hosni Mubarak, dissolved parliament in June 2012 in line with a ruling from the High Constitutional Court that declared the constitutional articles that regulated parliamentary elections were invalid. Egypt's high administrative court on Saturday upheld a controversial decision to dissolve parliament -- a move the nation's president emphatically opposes -- state news reported. However, there's no longer a political crisis pitting against Morsy against the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which assumed legislative powers after it dissolved parliament. He also reversed the June constitutional decree by the Supreme Council that claimed to retain legislative authority until a new parliament could be sworn in near the end of the year, Ali said. Morsy opted to override the military by calling back parliament when he took office June 30, though weeks later he vowed to respect the court's ruling that parliament was still dissolved.
