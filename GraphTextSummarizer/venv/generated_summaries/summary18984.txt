Group: 250 dolphins await slaughter, lifetime of captivity at Japan's Taiji Cove Live dolphin trade Sehgal said that local dolphin trainers who "claim to love dolphins" were often seen assisting hunters in wrangling the animals to shore. The slaughter of dolphins has begun again in a small Japanese village, in a controversial annual hunt that pits Western environmentalist values against what locals say are traditional hunting practices. Sea Shepherd's operations in Taiji involve live-streaming activity in the village, including following suspected fishermen they believe to be transporting dolphin meat. I think being here rocks even the most hardened human being, because it is just atrocious." Melissa Sehgal, Sea Shepherd's campaign co-ordinator for the Taiji project, which it calls "Operation Infinite Patience," said that after 15 days without the capture or killing of dolphins, the fishermen had begun killing pods of Risso's dolphins last week.
