To many China watchers, such a mixed bag of ratings confirms that Xi remains a cipher. As a provincial leader in southern China, Xi was in charge of free market-dominated economies. The son of a respected Communist guerrilla leader who was an ally of Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's reform program, Xi grew up in Beijing with fellow "princelings" and political elite. It's been nearly two years since Xi Jinping assumed paramount leadership in China and the world has mixed feelings about him. People -- both inside China and out -- are still debating: Is Xi Jinping a reformist or tyrant?
