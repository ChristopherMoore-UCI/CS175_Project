Apple, among other tech firms, has taken some lumps over reports of poor worker conditions on its assembly lines in China.

Research on consumer applications is underway, and, if we're lucky, it will mean durable, environmentally friendlier batteries that will make finding public spots next to power outlets less of a blood sport. But it's increasingly looking like good business for top tech companies to start making their products in the United States.
