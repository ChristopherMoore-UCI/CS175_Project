That ruthless streak was scarcely more evident than at the title-deciding 1994 Australian Grand Prix where, with his own car already irreparably damaged, Schumacher deliberately collided with title rival Damon Hill. Then there were the groans of dismay at the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix when Ferrari ordered teammate Rubens Barrichello to allow Schumacher to win the race. He racked up victories, wins and titles -- and then some: five consecutive world championship titles between 2001-2004, 56 race victories in six years between 2000-2006, a total of seven F1 crowns and 91 grand prix wins. It took four years for Schumacher to deliver what Ferrari so desperately craved, but when it came it began a period of dominance for the "Prancing Horse." The following year he won just a single race after the introduction of new tire rules, and Alonso ended Schumacher's title streak.
