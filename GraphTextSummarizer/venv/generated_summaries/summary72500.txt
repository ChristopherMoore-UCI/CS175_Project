Kim Jong Un had received little attention from the North Korean state media until he emerged as the likely successor to his father in September 2010. The report of the test firings came nearly a month after the death of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, who had made the nation's military the focal point of his 17 years in power. The regime has since anointed Kim's youngest son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, as its new "supreme leader. "We understand that North Korea test-fired three short-range missiles earlier this week," a spokesman for the Defense Ministry said Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity as is customary for South Korean military officials. " State-run television aired video last weekend showing the younger Kim in a tank and on horseback, continuing efforts to build up his image as the rightful successor to his father.
