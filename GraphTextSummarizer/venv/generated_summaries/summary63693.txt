Romney further blasted the U.S. Olympic committee saying the shirts should all be put in a pile and burned and that it would better for American athletes to wear shirts with USA hand painted on the front. "I think the Olympic Committee should be ashamed," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday. However, this week's brouhaha over U.S. Olympic team gear made in China has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill feeling like the world is, well ... flat. President Barack Obama's re-election campaign even has a "Runway to Win" project by American fashion designers. For $40, folks can paint their tootsies in "Red-y To Win Red," "Victory White" and "Bo Blue."
