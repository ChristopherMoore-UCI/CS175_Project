I grew up near the same tree-moss-draped area of Louisiana where U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise met with followers of David Duke, the Klu Klux Klan leader who in the '90s ran for governor and senator in my beloved state. I understand the so-called conservative values that Congressman Scalise championed, including a deep animosity to taxes. Knight says he didn't invite Scalise to address the convention of white supremacists. Boehner said Scalise "made an error in judgment, and he was right to acknowledge it was wrong." Instead, he asked Scalise to talk to a neighborhood group, the Jefferson Heights Civic Association, composed mostly of elderly citizens.
