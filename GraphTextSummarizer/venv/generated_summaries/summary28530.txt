Watch Rocca discuss Scott Peterson with Larry King Â» King: How and when did you first find out about Scott having this Web page? -- Scott Peterson was convicted November 12, 2004, for the deaths of his wife, Laci Peterson, and their unborn child. Sharon Rocha, mother of Laci Peterson, says Scott Peterson shouldn't be blogging from San Quentin. It also links to his family's Web site and that Web site includes a blog message from Scott discussing what he calls his "wrongful conviction." I think about Laci all of the time, but I don't give a lot of thought to Scott.
