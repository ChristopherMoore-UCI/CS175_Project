But the PlayBook's software suffers from several missteps and oversights, especially in the drought of useful apps -- the very things that have made tablets such a hit -- and the lackluster performance of Adobe's Flash player. For the PlayBook, that edge is support for Adobe Flash, a feature that the iPad is famously lacking. RIM has announced that an Android app player will be available on the PlayBook, which should bolster the number of available apps. Another glaring flaw is the PlayBook's complete lack of native e-mail, contacts and calendar apps. At a svelte 7.6 inches by 5.1 inches, the PlayBook is about the size of Samsung's Galaxy Tab, and considerably smaller than the Motorola Xoom and Apple iPad 2.
