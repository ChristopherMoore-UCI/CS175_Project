Air Chief Marshall Jock Stirrup says the sacrifices of British forces are worth it. So far, 15 British servicemen have died in Afghanistan this month, mostly in connection with Operation Panther's Claw, the British-led offensive in Helmand province that is mirroring a similar operation by U.S. Marines in the same area. -- July is on track to be the deadliest month yet for British troops supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. Stirrup told CNN that the British troops are conducting missions that forces them out of protective vehicles. The sudden spike in British deaths has triggered an outcry in the United Kingdom over the mission there and whether it will be successful.
