"Cardinal Egan spread love and knowledge, and brought comfort to countless New Yorkers and others across the country and the world who sought his guidance and counsel -- especially in the aftermath of 9/11," said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio in a statement. As the leader of one of the largest Catholic communities in the country, Egan oversaw a growth of more than 200,000 registered parishioners and welcomed Pope Benedict XVI on a visit to New York City in 2008 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Diocese of New York. Egan was appointed archbishop of New York in 2000 and later cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. Egan apologized for his involvement in the scandal in a letter read across the New York archdiocese in 2002, though he later retracted that apology in an interview with Connecticut Magazine 10 years later. Cardinal Edward Egan, who led the Archdiocese of New York for nearly a decade, died Thursday at 82, the archdiocese announced.
