How Secret Service could beef up White House security Immediately following the incident, the Secret Service said it notified police and initiated a protective sweep around the outer perimeter of the White House. Official: Secret Service twice interviewed, released would-be White House intruder -- A series of black eyes for the U.S. Secret Service -- including a new report that says supervisors mishandled a 2011 shooting incident at the White House -- should be viewed with the agency's broader mission in mind, a top White House official said on Sunday. Late Saturday, The Washington Post reported that Secret Service officials initially dismissed a series of gunshots that struck the White House in 2011 as backfire from a vehicle near the National Mall, ordering officers on the scene to "stand down." In mid-September a man armed with a small knife made it over the White House fence and into the North Portico door, the first time in memory an intruder made it inside the executive mansion.
