" Graphic ads about the dangers of meth addiction are trying to tackle what's a top drug problem in small towns. It's releasing television commercials in Spanish in Arizona and radio ads throughout the West featuring young Latino addicts sharing real-life meth nightmares. Twelve- to 14-year-olds who live in small towns are more than twice as likely to use meth than those who live in larger cities, the agency said. Flores' drug rehabilitation counselor, Colleen Foster, said that up to 40 percent of juveniles in the Nampa facility have a history of meth addiction. Government leaders there credit the effort with large declines in meth use, including a 45 percent drop in teen use since its ads first appeared.
