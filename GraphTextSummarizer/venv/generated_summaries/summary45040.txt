In 1968, he had just been hired at WAEO-TV (now WJFW) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, as a general assignment reporter. But it was his investigative and storytelling skills that set longtime CNN correspondent and bureau chief Robert Vito apart from the rest. He modeled in print ads and eventually landed a job as a radio reporter in Wisconsin. -- He had a distinguished voice like actor Robert Stack and the looks of a Hollywood actor. From there he went on to CNN's Miami Bureau, where he covered the trial of attorney F. Lee Bailey, the shooting down of civilian aircraft off the coast of Cuba, and the slaying of fashion designer Gianni Versace.
