-- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is "recovering well" after skull surgery Wednesday, officials at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston said. The congresswoman later was transported to Houston for further treatment and rehab. Jared Lee Loughner is accused of opening fire outside a Tucson, Arizona, supermarket where Giffords was meeting with constituents in January. Doctors will discuss the procedure and Giffords' next step in rehabilitation at a Thursday morning press briefing. After the shooting, surgeons in Arizona cut a hole in Giffords' skull to give her brain space to temporarily swell.
