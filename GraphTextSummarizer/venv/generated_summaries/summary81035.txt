" Stenson is also being chased for overall honors by England's Ian Poulter, who carded a 66, but is four behind in third place. Saturday saw Dubuisson move to within one shot of leader Henrik Stenson at the World Tour Championship in Dubai with a stunning eight-under 64, including 11 birdies, one short of the European Tour record.
