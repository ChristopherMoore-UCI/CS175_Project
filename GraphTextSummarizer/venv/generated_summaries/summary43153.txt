-- A drug charge against Paris Hilton, who was detained Friday in South Africa on suspicion of marijuana possession, has been dropped, police said. Hilton and another woman, Jennifer Rovero, were taken into custody at the Nelson Mandela Bay stadium on possession charges, police said in a statement. Hilton's publicist, in a statement to CNN, said the incident "was a complete misunderstanding, and it was actually another person in the group who did it." Dawn Miller, the publicist, said Hilton was accused of smoking marijuana and said "no charges will be made" against her. Miller said Hilton was in South Africa for the World Cup. Hilton appeared calm when she appeared before a magistrate judge in Port Elizabeth, a reporter for affiliate ETV told CNN.
