"Nobody has ever made a flight like this, using only small helium balloons -- in manned flight -- across the ocean," Trappe wrote on his website, clusterballoon.com, after the style of ballooning used in his attempt to across the Atlantic. Trappe said of touching down in pitch darkness near Blow Me Down Provincial Park in the wilderness of Newfoundland. Five people have died trying to cross the Atlantic with balloons. If the patrol is unsuccessful, Trappe, who has confirmed he is safe and well on Facebook, is prepared to spend another night in the mountainous region, which is populated by black bears and moose, said Sgt. Trappe took off from Caribou, Maine, early Thursday with 370 balloons.
