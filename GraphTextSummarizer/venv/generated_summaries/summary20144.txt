The shooting prompted New York Gov. David Paterson to commission a task force to investigate shootings between police officers statewide, spokeswoman Marissa Shorenstein told CNN on Saturday. The task force will ask NYPD and police departments across the state to provide any data related to shootings where officers were either killed or injured by other officers. -- Rep. Charles Rangel said he is satisfied with the steps New York police are taking in response to the death of Officer Omar Edwards, but renewed his call for a federal investigation into instances of police friendly fire. The list does not include officers who were injured by friendly fire, and does not specify whether the officers killed were on or off duty. Also Saturday, the NYPD released a list of 10 New York City officers killed in cases of mistaken identity since 1930.
