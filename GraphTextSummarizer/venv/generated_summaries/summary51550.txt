In Texas, for instance, 15% of births at El Paso's University Medical Center are C-sections; four miles away, at Sierra Medical Center, the rate is more than double that at 37%. Making note of other studies that look at regional variations in surgical birth rates, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine issued guidelines in March. The high number of surgical births, plus the fact that fewer women or children die these days during the childbirth process, "raises significant concern that cesarean delivery is overused," according to the recommendations. The Denver Health Medical Center earned Consumer Report's highest rating for low rate of C-sections. Nation gets "C" for preterm birth rates "The variation is what gets you, that really is the thing," said Doris Peter, director of Consumer Reports' Health Ratings Center.
