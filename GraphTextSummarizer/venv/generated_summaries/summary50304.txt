Russian and Eastern European tourists who had holiday tours set for Egypt or Tunisia may instead go in greater numbers to Turkey, Gallego said, based on information that he said is making the rounds among tour operators and travel agencies. The political turmoil in Egypt and Tunisia has European tour operators scrambling to divert package tours to more stable destinations, and several thousand tourists have already been re-routed to beaches in Spain, a Spanish tourism industry official told CNN. But if the political uncertainty continues in North Africa into the spring and summer, the package tours diverted from those destinations to Spain's Mediterranean coast and islands could involve hundreds of thousands of additional tourists this year, Gallego said. Tunisia's beaches have been a prime destination for French tourists, Gallego said, and some of them could be diverted to Spain's coasts by next summer as well. So hard-fought negotiations over prices have ensued, in which the Spanish hotel operators may agree to a lower price which still turns out to be more than the tour operator and individual tourist were going to pay in Egypt or Tunisia, Gallego said.
