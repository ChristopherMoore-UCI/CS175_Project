Sentinel Police Chief Louis Ross was shot Thursday morning after he entered a house looking for the person who allegedly phoned in a bomb threat to a Head Start center, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. KFOR reported that officers entered the house without a search warrant. "This is country, this ain't Oklahoma City," Jimmy Rhoades told KFOR. "They made entry, cleared the first bedroom, started to clear the second bedroom, he opened fire on police and shot our chief three times in the chest and once in the arm," Dlugonski told KFOR. "We almost lost a good man," Sentinel Mayor Sam Dlugonski told KFOR.
