-- An unmanned moon lander under development crashed and blew up during an engine test Thursday afternoon at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, the space agency reported. Read more about space and science on CNN's Light Years blog Olansen said operators have recovered memory devices from the wreckage and will be pulling the data off of them for clues to the cause of the accident. Its engines are fueled partly by methane, which the agency says is easier to handle and store than other propellants such as liquid hydrogen or hydrazine. "The vehicle itself is lost," Jon Olansen, the Morpheus project manager, told reporters. Olansen said the space agency has spent about $7 million on the project over two and a half years, and the test lander lost Thursday was "in the $500,000 class."
