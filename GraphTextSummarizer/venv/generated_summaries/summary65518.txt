"To stop growing tobacco would be like killing me and my whole family," said Steve Msambira, a Malawian farmer who has been growing tobacco for over four decades. In the southeastern African country of Malawi, where tobacco is the top exports earner, many farmers are worried that some of the restrictions could be devastating for them and their communities. But for the anti-smoking lobby, growing tobacco only compounds the economic and social ills of countries like Malawi. In Malawi, seven out of 10 workers are either directly or indirectly employed by the sector and tobacco represents 70% of the landlocked country's foreign exchange earnings and 15% of its total GDP, according to the ITGA. "My government is already on the program of diversifying away from tobacco," said Malawi's agriculture minister Peter Mwanza.
