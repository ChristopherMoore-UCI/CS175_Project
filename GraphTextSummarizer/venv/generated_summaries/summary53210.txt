Peruvian law forbids the publishing of poll numbers one week prior to election day, but the trend from all pollsters previously was a rise for Ollanta Humala, who entered the final stretch as the leader of the pack. The economist is a one-time minister of energy and mines, minister of economy, and prime minister. Running close to him is Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori. His previous presidential bid was sunk in part because of accusations that he admired and would emulate Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who embarked on a socialist reorganization of his country. Humala denies that he would follow in Chavez's footsteps, and has portrayed himself as an admirer of former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who represented a more center-left position.
