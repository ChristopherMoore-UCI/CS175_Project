" According to testimony and e-mails revealed in court, while Neuman shared his feelings for Sneiderman, she shared hundreds of photos of her children with him, but Rusty Sneiderman is not in any of the photos. Court testimony in Neuman's trial and family interviews in the media portray Rusty Sneiderman as a man who served on the boards of nonprofits and always wanted to help others. According to court testimony, the pair went on several work-related trips together, and it was on a trip to Norfolk, Virginia -- their second -- that Neuman began to feel a special connection with Sneiderman, sharing with her the hard times he had growing up at a boarding school. Sneiderman is charged in the slaying of her husband, Rusty Sneiderman, who was shot and killed execution-style in front of their son's day care center in suburban Atlanta in 2010. I don't know that we have evidence of a conversation between Neuman and Sneiderman where they plotted and planned for Hemy to take Rusty's life.
