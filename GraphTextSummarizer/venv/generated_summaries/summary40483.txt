Cadrecha told me Google added Street View functionality to Skid Row in Los Angeles earlier this year. The readers noticed something I hadn't: The rich side of Lake Providence, which is the largest town in the parish, is mapped in detail by Google Street View; the poor side isn't. Part of Lake Providence -- a substantial part, which includes the public high school and some businesses -- is missing on Google Street View. (I asked Google what percentage of the United States is mapped with Street View and have not received a response; the company would say Street View is available in more than 3,000 cities and 54 countries, plus the Arctic and Antarctica. So, there are poor neighborhoods on Street View.
