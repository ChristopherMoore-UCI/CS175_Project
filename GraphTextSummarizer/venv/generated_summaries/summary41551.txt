But it passed by the Arabian Peninsula about the time that dinosaurs lived," explains Jacobs.

Evidence of dinosaurs has proven scarce, and what little surfaces from time to time have been traditionally difficult to itemize. "They had found an accumulation of fossils that mostly weren't from dinosaurs, but rather giant marine reptiles," he says.
