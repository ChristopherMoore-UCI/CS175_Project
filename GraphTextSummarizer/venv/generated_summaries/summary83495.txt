While the Nintendo DS can only play DS games, the 2DS and 3DS can play games designed for the DS or the 3DS. The October 12 release for the Nintendo 2DS is the same day the company plans to launch the latest titles in the Pokemon universe, "Pokemon X" and "Pokemon Y." The controls are similar to other Nintendo handheld consoles and screen sizes are the same as the 3DS unit. " Nintendo, for its part, has said the new device is designed for young kids, despite having promotional videos with adults using it. I wouldn't be surprised if this is Nintendo's way of directly competing with that market for small kids."
