Last year, when Russia ceased importing Moldovan wine because it said trace contaminants had been discovered, some said the move was really an expression of displeasure at European Union expansion. The monks moved back in shortly before Moldova became independent in 1991 and, in between prayers, they've been busy producing barrels of wine ever since. Moscow opposes a reunion, however, preferring to keep a meek and weak Moldova on its doorstep than have to contend with a bigger, emboldened Romania with close ties to the European Union. Tourism clearly doesn't keep the country afloat, but wine sales do, which is why the Russian embargo causes such concern. In the absence of playgrounds, kids climb on decommissioned Russian battle tanks ceremoniously parked in public spaces.
