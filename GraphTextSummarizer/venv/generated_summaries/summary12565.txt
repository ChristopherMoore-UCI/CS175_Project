Bulgarian international Dimitar Berbatov now plays for AS Monaco and scored the second goal in the French Ligue 1 side's shock 3-1 win in the last 16, first leg tie Wednesday. English Premier League Arsenal was a strong favorite to progress when the draw for the knockout stage was made, but Monaco absorbed early pressure before going ahead just before halftime from a counterattack. Trailing 2-0 Arsenal desperately sought a reply and both Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck were guilty of glaring misses in front of goal. And prospects for the second leg scarcely look any better, with Monaco having an excellent defensive record in the Champions League and holding three away goals. Monaco also remained a threat on the break and Berbatov and the excellent Moutinho combined to set up Martial for a chance which Ospina blocked.
