In fact, I'd go so far to say that, with each crop of new players which comes through, another few card schools fall by the wayside. When you are trapped on a coach or in a plane or in sunny climes with 20 millionaires, one of two things will happen: the conversation turns to women -- and, by extension, wives -- or, as if by magic, somebody produces a pack of cards. And in my time as a footballer, I have seen it all -- from players losing tens of thousands of pounds on the turn of a card, and their families staging interventions, to their more fortunate contemporaries winning $250,000 in a Las Vegas casino after popping down to the lobby to buy a phonecard. That said, I do know players have manipulated the system to their advantage. In another life, a merchant bank will throw serious money at you, start you off on utilities and call you "a trader".
