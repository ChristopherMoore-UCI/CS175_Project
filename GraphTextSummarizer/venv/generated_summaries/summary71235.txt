The IRS is trying to reach people who do not normally file tax returns so they can apply for stimulus checks. IRS phone banks have been inundated with questions about the stimulus payments, which began going out in April. In all, the IRS has sent out more than 76 million stimulus checks, in amounts up to $600 for individuals, $1,200 for married couples and $300 per child for families. The IRS says it's still trying to reach some 5 million Americans -- primarily seniors and veterans -- who have not filed the tax returns needed to qualify for their stimulus checks. The commissioner said the IRS received 72 million calls in May this year, compared with 19 million in May 2007.
