Despite the performer recording the song in the late 1950s, it's been used in many recent films from "Austin Powers" to "Finding Nemo." This fun tune tells of the singer falling in love with a mermaid while fishing one evening, with lyrics like "I'm in love with a creature from the sea, she brings out the crustacean in me". It's believed the band were referring to their "ocean of fans" when they wrote this song, with lyrics such as "singing to an ocean, I can hear the ocean's roar." The group -- made up of brothers Brian, Dennis and Carl Wilson, along with Mike Love and Al Jardine -- are synonymous with beach tunes and surfing hits. But it's just as easy for a keen seafarer to imagine dramatic ocean waves when listening to this tune.
