Parenting: Totally ridiculous baby products War of the births Women who have had C-sections might argue with her: mothers love their babies no matter how they gave birth to them, and what matters more than an ecstatic childbirth is a healthy child. The book reveals that in countries without good health insurance and without good medical facilities, hospital birth is not necessarily any safer than home birth; both arenas leave much to be desired. Hmong women must give birth alone, without expressing any pain or discomfort, as do women in Nigeria; one in 18 die during the process. While the camaraderie of women in childbirth is commendable, even enviable, childbirth in these places can be oppressive, and many mothers are denied choices, or even harassed, during labor. In more developed parts of Asia, especially, the tradition of home birth -- attended by midwives and relatives -- has either disappeared or is only engaged in by the poorest and most rural of women.
