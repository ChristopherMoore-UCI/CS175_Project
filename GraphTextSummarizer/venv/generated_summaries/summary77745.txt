The American will face former top-ranked Serbian Jelena Jankovic, whose closing defeat against the already-eliminated Sara Errani of Italy was meaningless following Li's win. "We had like 14 days of hard work, so I think that it shows on the court," the world No. 6 said of her post-New York training regime. " Having beaten the 2011 runner-up, Li will next face that year's victor after fourth seed Kvitova battled back to seal her last-four place with a 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 win over Angelique Kerber. Since then she won the title in Tokyo and lost to Jankovic in the Beijing semis after beating Li in the previous round. Kvitova finished second in the Red Group behind world No. 1 Serena Williams, who had a rest day after notching up three successive wins in her title defense.
