They include: attempts to increase the number of African-Americans who enter medical school, recruiting African-Americans and minorities for AMA membership, and addressing racial disparities in health care. The National Medical Association, an African-American physician group founded in 1895 when AMA membership was out of reach for most African-Americans, said it accepted the apology. "We are apologizing for policies and practices that we had that ... are offensive to AMA leaders today," the organization's immediate past president, Dr. Ronald M. Davis, told CNN. Dr. Nelson L. Adams said the AMA's  practices had a "devastating" effect on African-Americans' health. "We commend the AMA for taking this courageous step and coming to grips with a litany of discriminatory practices that have had a devastating effect on the health of African-Americans," the organization's president, Dr. Nelson L. Adams, said in a written statement.
