I also went to meet Nepali girls at a government remand home in Delhi. -- Anuradha Koirala is fighting to prevent the trafficking and sexual exploitation of Nepal's women and girls. I'd had meetings with Indian and Nepalese government officials, police officers and [nongovernmental organizations] that are partnering with us regarding rescue and repatriation of Nepali girls. So legal things are one part, but when there are girls, you have to send the girls back to their own country. I have a big family, about 2,000 children and girls.
