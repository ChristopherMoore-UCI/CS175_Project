"The euroskeptic label covers parties of both right and left, many of whom object to the EU for very different reasons -- the radical left denounce Europe as a free-market promoting friend of high finance, while the right objects to a loss of national sovereignty and bureaucracy," said McDonnell, a political science fellow at the European University Institute in Florence. They have little in common aside from a dislike of the Brussels bureaucracy, and a pan-euroskeptic political group is unlikely, according to political scientist Duncan McDonnell. -- Far-right and far-left protest parties have dominated the crucial election in many countries across the European Union The euroskeptics -- from the UKIP in the United Kingdom to National Front in France -- are demanding tighter border controls, nationalized decision-making and a dissolution of the currency union. However, the rise in euroskeptic parties' political clout is likely to put pressure on national governments of the member states. With protest parties coming top in several key member states, the decades-old institution could face a shake-up that will rewrite its future.
