Kirstie Alley said she's going to start dating "butt-ugly men" on an episode of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" airing Friday. The host, who had a tattoo artist waiting backstage, joked that they would play a game to determine Alley's tat. While DeGeneres didn't get the actress a new car, she did help her out with some new ink. When asked about her dating life by Ellen, Alley, 60, admitted she usually goes for "psychos" and "players," so the host suggested she try going with the opposite of what she's attracted to. "I'm thinking ugly men might be the solution," the "Dancing with the Stars" alum responded.
