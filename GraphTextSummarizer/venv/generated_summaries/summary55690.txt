-- Dmitry Medvedev made a strong pitch for foreign investment in Russia Wednesday as he gave his first special address as Russia's prime minister at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Russia ranks very low in global corruption indices, which has held back investment despite a sizable population of 142 million. The speech echoed one Medvedev gave at Davos as his country's president in 2011, when he also pushed foreign investment in Russia while acknowledging that reforms were needed. "Russia is an open country, whatever they might think or say," he said, referring to critics of its record on corruption and governance issues. Few are likely to dispute Medvedev's comments on the need for Russia to prioritize governance issues.
