In Egypt, where Christians constitute 10% of the population, Christian girls are being kidnapped by shadowy Muslim groups and lured into Muslim marriages, with the state looking the other way. Christians have always lived in Muslim lands; indeed Christianity is older than Islam in these areas. Extremist Muslims feel that Islam is under siege by the West and seek to lash out at Christians, seeing an attack on Christians in their countries effectively as an attack on Israelis, U.S. troops in Iraq or the intelligence agencies behind U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan. The Christians who have remained are subjected to pogroms and slaughter by Muslim groups who are committed to exterminating them. Riots are common, and Egyptian Christians live in fear for their lives.
