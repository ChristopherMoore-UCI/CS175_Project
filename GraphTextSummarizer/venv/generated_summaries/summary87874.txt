The New York-based comedy laughed up $281,000 from just nine theaters for a weekend-leading $31,000 gross per theater. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock have reason to celebrate after "The Proposal" takes top box office spot. Sandra Bullock will surely be popping open the champagne as her new romantic comedy, "The Proposal," accepted the top spot at the box office this weekend by grossing $34.1 million, according to early estimates by Hollywood.com Box Office. The weekend's other big release, the prehistoric buddy comedy "Year One," landed in fourth place with $20.2 million -- an okay debut for the $60 million movie. Overall, the box office was up 3 percent compared to last year's Father's Day weekend, when "Get Smart" debuted to a surprisingly sharp $38.7 million.
