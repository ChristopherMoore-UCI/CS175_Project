Marcia Inhorn, professor of anthropology and international affairs at Yale University, says that in many developing nations the greatest social burden of infertility rests on the shoulders of married women, who are expected to become pregnant. She says the social suffering associated with infertility seems to be worse when women are expected to have many children, and can lead to depression, despair, and threats of divorce. In sub-Saharan Africa, many infertility problems in women are related to untreated or poorly treated reproductive tract infections, which could easily be prevented with early detection. Ajayi, who used to live in the UK, says that for many years the only option for childless Nigerian couples was to travel abroad to get treatment. The prevalence of infertility in Nigeria is about 25%, compared to 10 to 15% in the U.S. and UK, according to Friday Okonofua, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of Benin, in Nigeria.
