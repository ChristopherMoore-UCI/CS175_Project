-- The use of mobile phones to transfer money, make payments and access financial services has revolutionized the lives of millions of people who have never had access to traditional banking services. And perhaps the most important factor in the long-term success of mobile money is an open and level playing field that allows non-bank mobile money providers -- including mobile operators -- to enter the market. In Sub-Saharan Africa, one of the pioneering regions for mobile money, services are available in 38 out of 47 countries. Regulators can help expedite efficient mobile money distribution networks that allow customer registration, cash collection and disbursement activities to be outsourced to third parties to lower the cost of financial services and expand their reach. For these communities, where literacy levels tend to be lower and incomes sporadic, mobile money is truly transforming the socio-economic landscape Latest statistics demonstrate the tremendous growth we've seen over the past few years -- as of October 2014, there are a total of 251 live mobile money services across 88 countries.
