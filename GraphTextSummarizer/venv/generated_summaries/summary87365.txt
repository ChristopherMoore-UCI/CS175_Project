in Maguindanao province, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang said. The convoy was on its way back from a raid on the compound of former governor Andal Ampatuan Sr. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. The abductions took place Thursday afternoon in Prosperidad, the capital of Agusan del Sur province. That attack, authorities have said, was an apparent attempt to keep a political opponent of the Ampatuan clan from registering to run for governor.
