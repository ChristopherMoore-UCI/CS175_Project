"It's the ultimate Washington power grab to say let's have a federal constitutional amendment that will federalize the question of marriage," said GOProud chairman Christopher Barron. Through speaking at the event, exhibiting a booth and co-sponsoring the conference, GOProud hopes to highlight the views it has in common with other Republicans -- limited government and fiscal responsibility. The organizers of GOProud will be participating in a roundtable on Saturday, but they won't be talking about issues that affect gay Americans. "But I think there's also more of an attitude among Americans that's sort of more libertarian that says people have the right to do what they want to in their own lives and to take the consequences for it, as well." Chris Plante, who is running the booth for the National Organization for Marriage, said being two booths away from GOProud wasn't an issue. -- An unlikely sponsor at this year's annual conservative conference is hoping to not only promote the issues that set it apart from many Republicans, but also draw attention to the beliefs they share.
