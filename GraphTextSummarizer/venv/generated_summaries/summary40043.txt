The early and pretrial release of prisoners by the Afghan government, at times at President Hamid Karzai's hand, frustrated U.S. officials, diplomatic documents released in 2010 by WikiLeaks revealed. " Abdul Basir Azizi, a spokesman for Afghanistan's attorney general, said the detainees' release was ordered after a review revealed that there wasn't enough evidence against them. The U.S. military in Afghanistan condemned the move, expected to begin Thursday, arguing that the prisoners pose threats to security forces and civilians. But Afghan authorities say they don't have enough evidence to keep the 65 prisoners behind bars. The U.S. military's statement detailed evidence against several of the suspects, noting that the group included an alleged Taliban explosives expert, a suspected Haqqani network commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices.
