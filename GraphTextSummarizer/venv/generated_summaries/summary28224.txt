The United Nations peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo was aware that Rwandan rebels were occupying villages in the region in late July and early August, but did not know of reports that the rebels were raping women in those villages, U.N. officials said this week. -- The United Nations Security Council in New York held an emergency session Thursday to discuss and condemn widespread rapes in eastern Congo, while the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. said she was troubled by a briefing on the attacks. Madnoje Mounoubai, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo -- known by the acronym MONUSCO -- said the U.N. was first alerted to the rapes by humanitarian organizations on August 12. But a senior United Nations official said Thursday that the U.N. was to blame for the incident and that the organization should leave the Congo if it could not protect civilians. During the four-day attack across 16 villages, according to the U.N., rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, as well as militiamen from the notorious Mai Mai movement, also looted villages.
