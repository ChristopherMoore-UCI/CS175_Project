Criticism that calculating rankings over an eight-year period was unrepresentative of a team's recent performances led to FIFA revamping their system after the last World Cup. After all, Egypt, which just won the African Cup of Nations for a second straight time, is ranked 29th, fourth best among African teams." Do you think FIFA's rankings count for much? Their rankings are based on team performances over the last four years, with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. They top their 2010 World Cup qualifying group, with four wins from four games, and have only conceded one goal in their last 10 internationals. European champions Spain are ranked No.1 by FIFA in their world rankings.
