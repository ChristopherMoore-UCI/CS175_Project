-- The Obama administration announced new measures to combat black-market fishing and protect ocean ecosystems on Tuesday, as scientists, diplomats, policymakers, and heads of state concluded a conference dedicated to ocean preservation. In a recorded statement kicking off the second day of the Our Ocean conference, the President cited recent efforts by his administration to limit carbon output from power plants as a first step toward promoting ocean health. That initiative was outlined by White House counselor John Podesta, who said the president is "committed to using his executive authority to preserve ocean areas for future generations as we already protect our most beautiful environmentally significant landscapes. The actor also called on world leaders to increase preservation efforts in their countries, saying, "The only way to address problems of this scale is through smart collaboration between governments, communities, organizations and scientists. Earlier this year, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation pledged $3 million to the ocean conservation organization Oceana, and on Tuesday, the actor announced he would be committing an additional $7 million to promoting ocean preservation.
