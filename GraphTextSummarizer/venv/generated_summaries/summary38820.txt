"In the same spot, on the same day, at the same time, on same boat, with same crew, and I'm even going to use the same hook" So last week the Dracut, Massachusetts, native and his four longtime friends set out for an entire day fishing off the coast of Cape Cod. Will the gang do it again next summer? Although he and his buddies didn't catch anything at all during a fishing trip last summer, he had so much fun they all decided to do it again this year. It was enough tuna to fill nearly 2,000 of the 5-ounce cans sold in the grocery store.
