-- After Washington Mayor Vince Gray voted Tuesday morning and a vocal contingent of volunteers moved on to another precinct, Gray's campaign manager headed downtown to write three news releases to issue based on the outcome of Tuesday's Democratic primary election. " Vincent Gray is the latest D.C. mayor to be dogged by scandal But by Tuesday night, as polls closed across the district and results began to stream in, it appeared that Gray's confidence couldn't overcome the numbers. The Thompson plea deal "sucked a lot of the oxygen out of us," close Gray campaign aide Stephen Glaude said after the primary loss. While Gray was the frontrunner in early polls, a Washington Post poll shortly after the Thompson news showed a surging Bowser with 30% of Democratic support. For Gray, no moment knocked the wheels off his campaign more than what many campaign insiders began calling "Machen Monday" -- the day that U.S. Attorney Ron Machen went to court and linked Gray to a 2010 shadow campaign run by businessman Jeffrey Thompson.
