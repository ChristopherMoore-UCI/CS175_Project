South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen, playing his first tournament at St Andrews since his British Open victory on the famous links in 2010, was in a three-strong group a shot further back with Marc Warren and joint halfway leader Tommy Fleetwood. -- Michael Hoey held off a last-round charge from U.S. Open champion Rory McIlroy to claim the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews Sunday. Graeme McDowell completed the domination of players from Northern Ireland by claiming joint third on 18-under with George Murray of Scotland after a 69. McIlroy, who was seven-under for his first 11 holes on the final day, was disappointed to miss out on victory. Hoey, who like McIlroy hails from Northern Ireland, carded a final round 68 to beat his illustrious compatriot by two shots on 22-under 266.
