Thermal springs The pool is filled with 4.3 million liters (1.1 million gallons) of thermal water from local springs, allowing divers to plunge without the skin suits they'd need in open seas or lakes. The pool's creators hope it will transform Montegrotto Terme into an international diving center and raise the profile of what is said to be Europe's largest area of thermal springs. Designed by architect Emanuele Boaretto and a year in the making, Deep Joy is expected to attract scuba enthusiasts and freedivers -- aquatic athletes whose incredible lung control allows them to spend minutes at depth on a single breath. It also contains underwater caves aimed at training scuba divers to negotiate sub-aquatic landscapes. The Deep Joy, Hotel Terme Millepini, 42, Via Catajo, Montegrotto Terme, Padova; +39 049 891 1766
