Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller told CNN affiliate WISH that he is not aware of a prior case where the courts have overturned caps on damages -- something that Allen acknowledged Monday, saying "this case is without precedent." We won't leave any question unanswered, from both a structural standpoint and the decision that was made," Indiana State Fair Commission Chairman Andre Lacy said last month. He claimed that the fact there was a limit on possible damages didn't give enough incentive to take every safety precaution. -- A woman whose same-sex partner was killed in last month's stage collapse at the Indiana State Fair joined a personal injury attorney in pushing a federal lawsuit against the state of Indiana on behalf of those injured and the families of those killed. Allen was joined at a Merriville press conference by Alisha Brennon, who spoke publicly for the first since suffering severe head and other injuries in the collapse.
