For 18 months, my administration has been involved in good-faith discussions to keep the Braves in downtown Atlanta as their lease at Turner Field nears expiration. Price too steep to keep Braves in city limits Over the next four years, I am committed to making $200 million to $250 million in infrastructure investments in our neighborhoods. On Monday, the Atlanta Braves organization announced its intention to relocate to Cobb County -- in a new stadium. When the Braves leave the city of Atlanta in 2017, Turner Field will be demolished. It was in Atlanta that the Braves won an unprecedented 14 division championships from 1991 to 2005.
