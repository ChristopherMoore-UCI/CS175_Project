Oklahoma Battalion Fire Chief Brian Stanaland said the motorist did not need medical attention. -- Flash floods caused by persistent heavy rains in Oklahoma have claimed the life of a 13-year-old girl, the state medical examiner's office told CNN Friday morning. A flash flood warning remained in effect in several central Oklahoma counties Friday, the National Weather Service said. Heavy rains have battered the Oklahoma area in recent days. The girl is the third child to be swept away in Oklahoma flooding in less than a week.
