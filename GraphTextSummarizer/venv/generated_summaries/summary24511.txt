But seven-time Tour winner Armstrong lost valuable ground on his main rivals after a puncture held up  the Radio Shack team leader as he conceded two minutes and eight seconds to the leading group. -- Thor Hushovd won a brutal third stage of the Tour de France which saw Fabian Cancellara reclaim the leader's yellow jersey and the hopes of a number of race favorites, including Lance Armstrong, dented. Hushovd and Paris-Roubaix winner Cancellara were in a six-strong group which forged ahead to gain valuable time on their rivals. The 213 kilometers from Wanze to Arenberg contained seven stretches of cobblestones, which caused the peloton to split into small groups after a series of crashes and punctures. Like Cancellara, Hushovd is a specialist in the Paris-Roubaix one-day classic which also features the feared pave cobblestones which caused such havoc to the Tour riders.
