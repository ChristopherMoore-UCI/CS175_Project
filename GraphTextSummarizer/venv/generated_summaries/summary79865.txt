Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called school choice "the most compelling civil rights issue of the 21st century" and suggested it will be a significant focus of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on the Constitution, civil rights and human rights when he becomes chairman in the new Congress. The potential GOP presidential contender made the remarks during a Senate hearing on community policing, scheduled in the wake of racial protests sparked by the deaths of two unarmed African-American men at the hands of white police officers. Though charter school programs have drawn many critics, who believe they siphon needed funds and resources away from public schools, they've also earned some bipartisan support. But Cruz, in opening remarks before those three panelists spoke, highlighted school choice — a phrase typically used by conservatives to connote the expansion of charter school programs — as a key civil rights issue. "And in my view, the most compelling civil rights issue of the 21st century is the the need to expand school choice and educational options so that every child, regardless of race ... has a fair opportunity to receive an excellent education.
