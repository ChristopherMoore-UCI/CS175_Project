Gattuso, a near-certain selection for Italy's World Cup squad, said last week he could leave Milan before the end of his contract in June 2011 if his playing time did not increase. -- AC Milan coach Leonardo does not want unsettled midfielder Gennaro Gattuso to leave the club during the winter transfer market. Gattuso has been a reported target for Manchester City but AC Milan club administrator Adriano Galliani added: "The other day I showed him (Gattuso) the midfield of the top five teams in Europe and he would not have been a starter in any of those. "Why leave, only to be relegated to the bench somewhere else?" The 31-year-old has been with the Rossoneri since 1999 and was a crucial member of the Italy squad which won the 2006 World Cup. "If Gattuso has this idea in his head, I will try to make him change his mind," Leonardo told reporters. The veteran has failed to earn a regular spot in Leonardo's side because of injuries and the coach's squad rotation policy.
