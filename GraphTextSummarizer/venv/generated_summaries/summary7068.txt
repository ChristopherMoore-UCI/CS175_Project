On January 8, 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire at a "Congress on Your Corner" event in Tucson, Arizona, featuring U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Loughner sentenced to life for Arizona shootings CNN: After the shooting, you were hesitant to do any interviews, but then a friend who helped you with the press said it was important "to show that a Hispanic man saved the day in a state that has been discriminatory toward Hispanics." For example, I do a lot of driving, and when I'm in rural Arizona, I'll get pulled over a lot but not because I'm speeding but because of what I look like. I still continue to do interviews because I think it's important for people to see "this is the face of Arizona, this is the face of America," and it's a different face from the one you are used to, but it's one that's in every community around this country. After graduating from the University of Arizona, he was elected to serve on a school board in Tucson but also travels the country as an inspirational speaker.
