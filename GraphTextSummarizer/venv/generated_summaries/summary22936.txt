iReporter: Welcome back, President Bush The Bush brothers both said Republicans' setbacks in recent election among Latinos -- which voted Democrat by a 2-to-1 margin -- should be a top concern for the party, with George W. Bush calling the situation "un problemo. Jeb Bush said that he could see either or both of his sons, Jeb and George, following their father, their uncle, their grandfather and their great-grandfather (former Sen. Prescott Bush of Connecticut) by running for political office. Jeb Bush joined his brother for part of the CNN interview, saying he never publicly disagreed with George W. Bush when he was president and is "not going to start now. The comments by the 43rd U.S. president, along with those of his brother and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, aired during a CNN special, "Bush: Two Years Later." Bush said he "genuinely liked" Clinton, whom he called one of his "buddies," in part because he's been so "gracious" to his father, George H.W. Bush.
