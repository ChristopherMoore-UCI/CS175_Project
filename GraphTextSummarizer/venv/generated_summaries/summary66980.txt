The growth of social media and the concept of so-called "citizen-journalists," has created a real quandary for the older forms of media and news delivery. Many news organizations and social media platforms jumped on the bandwagon to showcase the photographs where Michelle Obama is looking away, with what could be considered an angry expression. The ability to use photography to recount life in a visual way and replicate it in the mass media allowed people around the world to see and understand things they may only have imagined before. A photojournalist covering an event will take dozens, sometimes hundreds, of pictures in the process. That is a good question, since what we define as truth can sometimes have many meanings.
