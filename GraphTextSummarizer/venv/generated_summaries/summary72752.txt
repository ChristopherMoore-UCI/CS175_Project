Pistorius' murder trial has been adjourned until August 7, when closing arguments are scheduled to begin. -- South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius was involved in a nightclub dispute over the weekend, after another patron "started to aggressively interrogate him" on matters relating to his murder trial Amen." The postings have prompted messages of support, bewilderment and condemnation on the social media site, with some Twitter users questioning why Pistorius had visited a nightclub while on trial. Reports of the incident and subsequent tweets by Pistorius -- his first activity on Twitter since the one-year anniversary of his girlfriend's death -- have grabbed headlines in South Africa and around the world. Pistorius, 27, is accused of murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, on February 14, 2013.
