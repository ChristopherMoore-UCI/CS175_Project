" Sharapova's retirement means that Kvitova will now face another Russian, Vera Zvonareva, in the semifinals although the Czech player expressed her sadness at the manner in which the match ended. "We played very nice tennis, I think, and it was a great match," she told AFP. -- World number two Maria Sharapova limped out of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo after twisting her ankle during her quarterfinal match against Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic. The injuries come at the end of a grueling season where several top players have raised the prospect of a strike over the amount of tennis being played. The Serbian player, ranked number one in the world after his stunning U.S. Open triumph earlier this month, announced he was pulling out of the China Open after injuring himself in a recent Davis Cup match.
