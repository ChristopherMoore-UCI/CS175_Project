A national effort to prevent the 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of pregnant women who receive flu vaccines, according to the CDC. "Pregnant women are five times more likely to end up in the ICU or have severe complications related to the flu than non-pregnant women who get infected with the flu," she said. Less than 15% of pregnant women received a flu shot before 2009; in the next two seasons, more than half of pregnant women got the vaccine protection. Life-threatening developments like Creekmore's in flu patients are generally rare but not unheard of, Gray-Swain said. No harm has been demonstrated to pregnant women or their babies as a result of the vaccine, the CDC said.
