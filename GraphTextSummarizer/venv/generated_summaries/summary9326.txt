When Bauman woke up the next day after two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. "The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals," he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges, including murder, related the bombings. -- Jeff Bauman may very well personify "Boston Strong," the rallying cry of the wounded but tenacious city where his life almost ended on April 15 at the Boston Marathon.
