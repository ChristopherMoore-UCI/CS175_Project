A parochial teacher, Bernard Shero, who authorities said raped the same boy in 2000, was convicted of rape, attempted rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, indecent sexual assault and other charges. The Rev. Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, died Saturday of multi-system organ failure and a complete heart blockage at 67, Father Kevin Nadolski said. They were among dozens of Philadelphia priests accused of sex abuse in a grand jury report. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said at the time of conviction that the prison sentence "sends a clear message to sexual assault victims in Philadelphia. He has maintained his innocence throughout the trial and appeal, having pleaded not guilty to sexual abuse and conspiracy charges back in 2011.
