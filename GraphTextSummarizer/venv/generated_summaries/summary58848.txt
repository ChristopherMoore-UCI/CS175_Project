Justice Department accuses Sterling of housing discrimination A Justice Department lawsuit filed in 2006 accused Sterling's rental company of refusing to lease Beverly Hills apartments to African-Americans, refusing to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown section of Los Angeles County and turning away families with children from its properties. "Nevertheless, the insurance companies for the trust decided to settle the case because the cost of continued litigation far exceeded the cost of settlement." 2003: Tenants, nonprofit allege housing discrimination The nonprofit Housing Rights Center and a group of tenants who lived in Sterling's properties filed a federal lawsuit in 2003 against Sterling, accusing him of "numerous discriminatory statements and housing practices," according to court documents. This isn't the first time Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling has faced allegations that he's racist. Sterling, according to court documents, "vehemently denied" the allegations and accused the plaintiffs of "being unreliable tenants and for being driven by hidden agendas." Audio recordings from a conversation full of racist comments attributed to Sterling surfaced over the weekend, bringing national attention to him and his team.
