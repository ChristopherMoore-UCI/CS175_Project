-- Secretary of State-designate Hillary Clinton had $6.4 million in presidential campaign debt at the end of November, according to a report filed Saturday with the Federal Election Commission. Under the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law, presidential candidates who loan their campaigns money from personal funds may only be paid back if they do so by the national party convention -- in this case, the Democratic National Convention held last August in Denver. Hillary Clinton says she hopes to have her campaign debt paid before her possible confirmation as secretary of state. Clinton's campaign debt reached its peak, $12 million, at the end of June and has gradually fallen since then. Clinton said she hopes to pay off her debt before her possible confirmation as secretary of state.
