A previous summit in November collapsed without a deal amid deep divisions over EU spending at a time of wide austerity. Britain was among the nations pushing for cuts to spending, with Prime Minister David Cameron insisting that the EU "should not be immune from the sorts of pressures that we have had to reduce spending, find efficiencies and make sure that we spend money wisely." France was keen to protect the budget for agriculture, which was spared further cuts in the new deal. The compromise agreement is not the perfect deal for all 27 EU member states, Van Rompuy said, but it is realistic and shows that European leaders are facing up to their responsibilities at a time of economic difficulties across the region. The deal, which covers the period from 2014 to 2020, will limit actual EU spending to â‚¬908 billion ($1.2 trillion), with a spending ceiling of 959 billion euros. It also maintains development aid for the poorest nations of the world, Van Rompuy said, and will allow the EU to remain engaged with vital global issues such as climate change and nuclear safety.
