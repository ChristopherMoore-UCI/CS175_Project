The November 18 extension expected to win final approval next week was intended to provide time to debate and pass appropriations bills for the remainder of fiscal year 2012. The short-term funding measures were necessary because Congress has failed to complete its full budget appropriations process in recent years due to a sharp partisan divide over government spending issues. The measure was part of a bipartisan agreement intended to end a dispute over disaster relief spending that threatened to cause a partial shutdown of the government when the current fiscal year ends at midnight Friday. Democrats and Republicans had been at odds over a GOP demand to cut spending elsewhere to offset increased disaster relief funding in the current fiscal year. Instead, they have relied on other ways to extend spending authority, such as continuing resolutions or omnibus measures that bundle together multiple appropriations bills.
