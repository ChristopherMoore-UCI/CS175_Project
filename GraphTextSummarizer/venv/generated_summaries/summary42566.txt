Ryan Maseth, a 24-year-old Green Beret, died in a shower at his base in Iraq in January 2008. Maseth, a 24-year-old decorated Green Beret from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was electrocuted in a shower in his Baghdad quarters -- a former palace of deposed Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- in January 2008.
