Last season, New Zealand were crowned IRB champions and McAlister was named player of the year at the end-of-season awards. There's more rugby in high schools now and we've got schoolgirls coming into our squad now. But then the opportunities for female rugby players had generally been limited. That McAlister has got to such heights so soon brought a wry smile to the face of her father and brother Luke, who now plies his trade with Toulouse in France after a six-year All Blacks career in which he earned 30 Test caps. It was her dad, Charlie, a former rugby league professional who played in England and Australia, that spotted New Zealand's Go4Gold campaign to lure women players to the sevens ranks with the 2016 Olympics in mind, and gave his daughter the nudge to follow in the family's rugby roots.
