-- Track and field star Tyson Gay was handed a one-year ban by the U.S. Anti Doping Agency (USADA) Friday and has had to return the silver medal he won at the 2012 London Olympics. "We appreciate Tyson doing the right thing by immediately withdrawing from competition once he was notified, accepting responsibility for his decisions, and fully and truthfully cooperating with us in our ongoing investigation into the circumstances surrounding his case," USADA chief executive Travis T. Tygart told the organization's official website. The standard ban for a doping violation is two years, but Gay has been treated more leniently because he co-operated with USADA, it said. Gay is the joint second fastest man over 100m in history behind Bolt, with a 9.69 seconds clocking. News of his positive test came on the same day that a similar outcome was revealed for former world 100m record holder Asafa Powell, shocking followers of track and field.
