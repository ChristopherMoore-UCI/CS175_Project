With the FFSA's financial backing, Ogier grabbed the opportunity with both hands, winning the Peugeot 206 Cup (a competition for aspiring rally drivers) in 2007 -- the first of many triumphs alongside co-driver Ingrassia. His rivals may hope that his recent marriage to German TV presenter Andrea Kaiser may soften his desire to win, but with most rally drivers peaking in their 30s, Ogier is perhaps just beginning a run of success that could rival Loeb's historic sequence of titles. First there was France's SÃ©bastien Loeb with nine consecutive World Rally Championship titles between 2004 and 2012. We really had a big accident and that was really the time to react and do something," Ogier told RedBull.com at the end of last year. Ogier has begun 2015 where he left off last year, driving to victories at the opening two races in Monte Carlo and Sweden.
