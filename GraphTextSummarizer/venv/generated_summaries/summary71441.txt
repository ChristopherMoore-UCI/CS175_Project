Bachmann was arrested on Tuesday on a 2011 warrant, one of a handful of Swiss bankers to ever face U.S. charges because Switzerland doesn't consider tax evasion a crime and won't turn over its citizens to face such charges. The Senate report described methods worthy of a spy novel that Credit Suisse bankers used to help their wealthy American clients stash money away. His cooperation is expected to increase the scrutiny of assertions made by Credit Suisse CEO Brady Dougan, who two weeks ago expressed regret at a Senate hearing that the bank helped rich U.S. clients hide billions of dollars in assets from the IRS. According to the indictment, Bachmann met with his Credit Suisse clients to help advise them on how to move their assets when the United States began putting pressure on Swiss banks to stop aiding tax evasion. A former Credit Suisse banker pleaded guilty on Tuesday to fraud charges, setting the stage for prosecutors to challenge claims by the Swiss bank that helping wealthy Americans evade taxes was the work of a few rogue bankers.
