-- Russian authorities have released from jail most of the members of a Greenpeace group arrested on their ship in September while protesting oil drilling in the Arctic. The court later dropped the charge, but the 30 still face the charge of hooliganism, which carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison, according to Russian news agency RIA Novosti. After the ship's captain refused to sail into a Russian port, authorities confiscated the vessel and towed it to the nearby city of Murmansk, where the Greenpeace group members were incarcerated. Russian authorities boarded the Arctic Sunrise, drawing guns and smashing communications equipment, Greenpeace has said. The so-called Arctic 30, made of 28 Greenpeace activists and two freelance journalists, were detained after two activists left their ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and attempted to scale an oil platform owned by Russian energy company Gazprom.
