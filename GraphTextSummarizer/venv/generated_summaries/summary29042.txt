-- Dani Pedrosa sealed pole in Sunday's Indianapolis Grand Prix in a qualifying session marred with a number of heavy crashes. The first red flag of the session came after Casey Stoner suffered a suspected torn ankle ligament when he went off early in the session. Spanish rider Hector Barbera has been replaced in tomorrow's race by Toni Elias after it was confirmed he cracked three vertebrae in a crash during Friday's practice session. Ducati's Nicky Hayden was thrown from his bike at the same corner as Stoner later in the day. Yamaha Factory Racing's Jorge Lorenzo took second ahead of Monster Yamaha Tech3's Andrea Dovizioso.
