The 'easy' childbirth: One mom's story Unlike the stereotype, in HypnoBirthing, nobody swings a pocket watch back and forth to lull a mother to sleep during labor. "At the end of labor, right before they're about to come out, I did experience pain," Diez said. " Women who have tried HypnoBirthing say there is pain, but it wasn't unbearable. HypnoBirthing doesn't say you don't have pain. " Johnson took HypnoBirthing courses because she wanted to give birth without drugs.
