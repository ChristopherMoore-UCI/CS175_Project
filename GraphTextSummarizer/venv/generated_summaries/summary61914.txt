The researchers say it's a breakthrough in artificial intelligence and game theory, which can  have applications in other areas. "With real-life decision-making settings almost always involving uncertainty and missing information, algorithmic advances, such as those needed to solve poker, are needed to drive future applications," the news release said. Poker players like to read another player's tell. "We define a game to be essentially solved if a lifetime of play is unable to statistically differentiate it from being solved at 95% confidence," Bowling said in a news release announcing the findings, which were published in the journal Science. Programmers potentially could use it in computer systems for airport security checkpoints or Coast Guard patrols.
