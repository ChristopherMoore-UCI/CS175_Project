Sailors at the Tunisian fishing port of Zarzis said they have seen a spike in the number of boats full of migrants departing on the dangerous 16- to 24-hour journey to Lampedusa, about 100 kilometers (62 miles, or 54 nautical miles) away. "They all think they'll find a better life in Italy, and they don't even speak Italian!" Italy has seen a surge in migrants from Tunisia since the North African country experienced a revolution in January that threw longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali from power. "Yesterday, seven boats left here for Lampedusa," Faisal Jebnoun said Monday as he pulled seaweed and other debris from his net after a long day fishing for squid. At one point, said Souei Abdesslem, president of the Blue-fish Union in Zarzis, so many young Tunisians were anxious to smuggle themselves to Europe that fishermen began sleeping in their boats to prevent them from being stolen for the hazardous passage across the Mediterranean. Italy's coast guard says at least 1,623 migrants have landed on the tiny island of Lampedusa over a 24-hour period.
