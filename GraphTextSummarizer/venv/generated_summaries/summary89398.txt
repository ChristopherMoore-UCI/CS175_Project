Witnesses testified the pair had spent an evening drinking when they got lost and walked into the Newtown housing project in north Sarasota, CNN affiliate WWSB reported. Shawn Tyson, 17, received two mandatory and consecutive life sentences after being convicted of two counts of first-degree murder, said Dennis Menendez, chief information officer for the 12th Judicial Circuit. The teen, who was tried as an adult, was not eligible for the death penalty because of his age, Menendez told CNN. British media covering the trial included Press Association, BBC and Sky News, according to Menendez. The defense argued prosecution witnesses who implicated Tyson either were not credible or made deals, according to WWSB.
