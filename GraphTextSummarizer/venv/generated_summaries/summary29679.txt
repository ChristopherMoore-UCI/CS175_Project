In the case of health insurance, each one dollar the government spends would increase consumption by $2.36 dollars for rural health insurance or $4.16 for urban employee health insurance, according to a series studies by my colleagues and I did in 2010. We found that the top 10% of Chinese households garnered 57% of total income and 85% of total assets -- a concentration level of income and wealth that surpasses those of developed countries, and can only be found in some of the African countries such as South Africa and Seychelles. So far, the coverage rate of the unemployment insurance is only 30% of that of health insurance. Over the last two decades, various measures to encourage Chinese consumption had limited success. Government should bring up the benefit level of the rural insurance to that of urban insurance.
