The collection consists of files from Project Blue Book, Project Sign and Project Grudge, the names given to official investigations into unidentified flying objects by the United States military. Nearly 130,000 pages of declassified Air Force files on UFO investigations and sightings are now available in one place online. But UFO enthusiast John Greenewald says his database, Project Blue Book Collection, is the first to compile every single declassified document from the Blue Book project -- headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio from 1947 to 1969 -- in one place for anyone to search or download for free. Greenewald's efforts are not motivated by a close encounter or personal experience with unidentified flying objects. Greenewald started requesting information related to Project Blue Book through the Freedom of Information Act 15 years ago.
