Four questions for backers of Syria mission The al-Assad government ultimately bears responsibility for the conflict and most of the deaths. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the battle for Qusayr, which unfolded in front of the world's eyes earlier in the summer, with Hezbollah forces buttressing the al-Assad regime on one side and foreign fighters helping the opposition on the other side. Opinion: Syria a distraction from real U.S. challenges Calling for an immediate cease-fire on all sides is the only path towards peace. With over 100,000 Syrians dead and millions more displaced internally or as refugees in neighboring countries, the United States, Britain, Russia, China and others have mostly looked on. It was no surprise then that the standoff turned violent, as ragtag militias formed to contest government forces.
