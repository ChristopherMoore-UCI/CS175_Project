Butcher, with the National Audubon Society, said there may be more reports of dead birds found around the country. The experts CNN spoke with saw nothing surprising in there being a similar report of bird deaths in Louisiana. "As soon as one of these things hits the airwaves, people are just more sensitive to seeing dead birds around. " Meanwhile, Arkansas officials are investigating the death of an estimated 100,000 fish in the state's northwest, but suspect disease was to blame, a state spokesman said Sunday. "It's kind of a freak event," said Greg Butcher, director of bird conservation for the National Audubon Society.
