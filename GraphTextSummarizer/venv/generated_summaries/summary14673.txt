Trace amounts of sheen had been reported on the shores of southeastern Louisiana over the past week, but the landfall reported Thursday appeared to the "first impacts" of oil from the spill, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry told reporters. Salazar's meeting with BP executives -- his second trip to Houston in less than a week -- comes as oil washed ashore on Louisiana's barrier islands and drifted west past the mouth of the Mississippi River. More controlled burns were conducted Thursday, after BP and the Coast Guard used fire to destroy several thousand barrels of oil on the surface Wednesday, he said. But the spill was spreading westward and is projected to drift toward coastal parishes past the Mississippi River delta, spurring Louisiana to begin shifting preventive efforts to its southwestern coast, Gov. Bobby Jindal told reporters Thursday. But he said the failure of the rig's blowout preventer -- a critical piece of equipment designed to shut off the flow of oil in an emergency -- was "a huge malfunction" that has left oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.
