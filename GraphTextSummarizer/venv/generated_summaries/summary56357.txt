Before Rolling Stone ran an article about rape on the University of Virginia campus, the reporter and school officials traded dozens of emails from September 5 to November 19. Also on Friday, UVA Rector George K. Martin spoke to the school's Board of Visitors, or governing body, saying the article had hurt innocent people, set back efforts to stop sexual assaults and tarnished the school's reputation. In the first email, on September 5, Erdely contacted Nicole Eramo, head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board, and said she's writing a story about "rape/rape culture on college campuses" and how sexual assaults are handled at UVA. Jackie was never mentioned in emails between writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the magazine fact checker and university officials. UVA severely limited Erdely's access to university officials.
