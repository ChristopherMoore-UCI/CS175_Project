The range of reactions to the Penn State scandal, from Penn State University itself to the NCAA to the American people, tells us that we don't know what college football is or what it should be. Penn State football is a business -- an enormously profitable one, raking in more than $70 million a year. But under NCAA rules, the criminal actions of a few men are not necessarily NCAA rules violations. As is the case with so many recent college sports scandals, the events at Penn State call into question the effects of big money on the inside workings of college sports. Perhaps it's time for an open and honest debate about giving stipends, living expenses and even salaries to college football players.
