The actress said she loves Cosby and defended his wife, saying there was no way Camille Cosby would stand for such behavior from her husband of 50 years. While introducing the women, Allred -- who challenged Cosby last month to meet his accusers in court or set aside $100 million to settle their claims -- addressed Rashad's statements. Rashad: 'Someone is determined' Rashad, who also starred as the actor's wife on the CBS show "Cosby," said she sees the controversy as part of a larger plot. Why?" Asked why she believed Cosby hasn't spoken up to defend himself other than to say that the black media should cover the story with a "neutral mind," Rashad said she believes he has too much pride to do it. Showbiz 411 reported that Phylicia Rashad, who played Clair Huxtable on NBC's "The Cosby Show," told the outlet that she never saw any indication of the behavior that many women have attributed to the legendary actor.
