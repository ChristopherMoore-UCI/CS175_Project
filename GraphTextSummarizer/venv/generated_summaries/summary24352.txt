Catholic Relief Services and its partners have provided thousands of flood victims with weeks' worth of food aid, emergency medicine, and personal hygiene kits in some of the hardest hit areas around Bangkok. ShelterBox Response Teams have distributed 250 tents, 1000 mosquito nets and numerous water purifiers to flood victims in Ayutthaya and Lopburi. Relief organizations are on the ground providing shelter, supplies and medical aid to flood victims, and there are ways you can help. Their Chiangmai-based team is preparing survival packs for 80 to 100 families living in Ayudhaya, an area north of Bangkok where severe flooding has left many families homeless. World Vision is passing out emergency relief kits and hygiene supplies to people living in highly affected areas.
