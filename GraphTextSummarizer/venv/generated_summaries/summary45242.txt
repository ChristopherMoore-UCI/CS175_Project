Amos clocked one minute 41.73 seconds, matching the former world record time set by London Games chief Sebastian Coe back in 1981, which stood for 16 years. There was further gold medal success for the United States in the decathlon as world record holder Ashton Eaton won with 8,869 points. The artist who turned Usain Bolt from track legend to street hero U.S. teammate Will Claye finished in the silver medal position with Italy's Fabrizio Donato taking bronze. The 25-year-old Bolt became the first man in Games history to defend both the 100 and 200 meters titles, which he had won in such convincing style at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. American Christian Taylor won the men's triple jump with a 17.81 meters effort to add to his world title from Daegu last year.
