Prosecutors do have some discretion, and depending on what happens with the gun, charges ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony can be filed in the event of death or serious injury. Bartlett said his office has filed charges in previous cases when there was culpable negligence on the part of a gun owner. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that 17 states have child firearm access protection and safe-storage laws. Florida law prohibits a person from leaving a loaded firearm where a minor might have access to it. Chief Assistant State Attorney Bruce Bartlett says that although laws are needed, an accident with a firearm can be a greater penalty than any judge could ever hand down.
