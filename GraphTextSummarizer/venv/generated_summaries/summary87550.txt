-- The Obama administration is withholding some military aid to Egypt as it reviews how to proceed with any future help as deadly political violence continued to flare, a U.S. official told CNN. Cutting aid will probably not accomplish much, some experts say -- particularly because Saudi Arabia has said it would consider matching the U.S. assistance if the Obama administration decides to cut it. Billions in aid on the line: What will the U.S. do? But the U.S. official who spoke anonymously said the move is being described as a "reprogramming" of some funds to Egypt. It also has overflight rights, which gives the U.S. military the ability to fly over Egypt on the way to bases in the region.
