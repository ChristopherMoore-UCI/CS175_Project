The verdict of the opinion polls on the UK election debate between seven party leaders was simple enough: Between David Cameron of the Conservatives, Ed Miliband of Labour, Nick Clegg of the Liberal Democrats, Nigel Farage of the United Kingdom Independence Party, Natalie Bennett of the Green Party, Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party and Leanne Wood of Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Nationalists, there really was no clear winner. His party won't win many seats but he has ensured they can still tip the balance in plenty of contests, sometimes taking votes off the Conservatives, sometimes off Labour. The party once dismissed by Cameron as a collection of "fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists" is a serious threat to the Conservatives -- and Labour -- despite the many gaffes that seemed to cost it some momentum lately. By entering a coalition government with Cameron (in which the Lib Dems' insistence on raising the tax threshold for the lower paid has been a key element in increasing employment and economic recovery), Clegg surrendered the Lib Dems' previous ability to pick up protest votes. Back in the 1950s, UK politics was simpler: Labour and Conservatives combined took 97% of the votes.
