New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said state emergency officials were monitoring the quake, felt in parts of the state. "We had a lot of shaking, that's for sure," said Kim Bulmer, town clerk of nearby Renfrew, Ontario. With an epicenter about 11 miles (18 kilometers) from Shawville, in western Quebec, the quake was felt in the Ottawa-Gatineau area and out to Toronto, more than 260 miles away. "At this time, there have been no reports of damage to any of the state's critical infrastructure," Cuomo said in a written statement. Natural Resources Canada gave it a preliminary magnitude of 5.2; the U.S. Geological Survey put it at 4.4.
