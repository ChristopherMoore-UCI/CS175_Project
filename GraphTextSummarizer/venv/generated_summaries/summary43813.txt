Yet another Bush family member is weighing in on whether or not former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will run for president in 2016. Earlier this month, his older brother, former President George W. Bush, told Fox News that he thinks "he (his brother) wants to be president." In April, Jeb Bush's younger brother Neil said their father, former president George H. W. Bush, also endorsed the idea. Before the men in the family had begun floating the idea, former first lady Barbara Bush dismissed the notion, suggesting that her family has had its turn governing the country. Last week, Bush stumped in Michigan for Terri Lynn Land, who faces a closely watched race against sitting Rep. Gary Peters.
