The ads are going to focus on the safety of artificial sweeteners, or aspartame, in diet soda. There's an abundance of evidence that the sugar is contributing to health problems; there's not much conclusive evidence that artificial sweeteners in diet sodas are doing the same. Moreover, the increases in incidence of cancer were seen primarily in the elderly, which as a group, was not the major consumer of diet soda. More often than not, this is because people wind up overcompensating for the calorie savings they think they're getting by switching beverages (think of the person who orders dessert as a reward for having diet soda). Finally, some will claim that diet drinks will cause the brain to release insulin, which can change your metabolism and make you hungry.
