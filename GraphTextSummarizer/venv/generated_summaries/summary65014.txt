-- At least seven Somali civilians were killed Friday morning when people trying to take food clashed with government troops at the Badbaado refugee camp in Mogadishu, a witness told CNN. Al-Shabaab launched a Ramadan offensive Monday amid the spreading famine, with heavy fighting reported in northeastern Mogadishu, according to African Union officials. "This incident highlights the challenges that humanitarian agencies face in trying to deliver assistance in this difficult environment," he told CNN. Valerie Amos, the under-secretary for general and emergency relief, told CNN Thursday that 600,000 may die. She urged support for the aid organizations that are able to operate in southern Somalia, in areas controlled by rebel Al-Shabaab militants, who have banned international agencies.
