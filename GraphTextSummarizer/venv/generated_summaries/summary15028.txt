The Sunday Telegraph, which said it investigated thousands of online transactions over a seven-month period, has reported that Anders Behring Breivik used eBay to procure sulphur powder, which the newspaper described as a key ingredient for the bomb that exploded in Oslo, killing eight people. " Breivik, who is being held in solitary confinement at Ila Prison, near Oslo, mentioned eBay repeatedly in his purported 1,500-page manifesto that rants against Muslims and lays out meticulous plans to prepare for the attacks. eBay and PayPal coordinate regularly with law enforcement around the world and we are assisting Norwegian law enforcement in their investigation," the company statement said. In addition to the Oslo bombing, Breivik is accused of opening fire on Utoya Island, killing 69 people on July 22. The Sunday Telegrah also said that Breivik, under the username "andrewbrei," used eBay to order a drill press vice, a full-face respirator and a "hazmat" suit.
