The Oscar-winning actress, accused of interfering with the drunken driving arrest of her husband last month in Atlanta, pleaded no contest Thursday to a charge of physical obstruction of another and has paid a $213 fine, according to Municipal Court of Atlanta Administrator Christopher Patterson. Witherspoon -- who was in Atlanta working on a movie called "The Good Lie" -- and Toth were arrested on April 19 when a Georgia state trooper stopped Toth after seeing him weave in and out of a lane as he drove, police said. The video shows the trooper, while testing Toth for DUI for more than 10 minutes, asking Witherspoon several times to stay in the car. Later, the video shows that the trooper, while giving Toth a breath test, breaks away to address Witherspoon again: "Ma'am, sit on your butt and be quiet." Then, as the trooper begins to arrest Toth, the video shows, Witherspoon approaches them.
