-- Two teenage girls, who were found hanging from a tree in northern India in May, were not raped as originally alleged, according to new forensic reports commissioned by federal investigators. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sent samples obtained by police in the northern Uttar Pradesh state, where the incident had happened, to a special DNA fingerprinting facility in southern India for re-examination after it took over the case, an official source told CNN Tuesday. But with the latest evidence appearing to rule out rape, investigators, for now, have dropped plans to file charges against the five. That incident energized activists and women generally, with government officials promising action to ensure that girls and women feel safe. No quick fix for India's rape crisis Widespread anger
