The first firefighters on the scene attempted rescues within the home, but "were pushed back by intense flame and heat," said Acting Fire Chief Antonio Conte. "It is a terrible, terrible day for the city of Stamford," said Mayor Michael Pavia, briefing reporters about the "horrible tragedy. The home is in Stamford's Shippan Point neighborhood, just in from the Long Island Sound, fire officials said. Due to the condition of the building, it will be days before investigators can determine what happened, Conte said. Seven people lived in the house, Conte said.
