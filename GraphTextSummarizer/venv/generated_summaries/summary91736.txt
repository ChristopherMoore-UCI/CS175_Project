America is at war, however, against a small number of religious extremists who hide behind women and children and kill indiscriminately without remorse. -- There is little argument that America's respect in the Muslim world has lessened as we enter our 10th year of war against a deadly shadow enemy of religious extremists who wear no uniform, wave no flag and who use their holy book as sword and shield against fellow Muslims as well as all things American. He will -- in just a few seconds of self-proclaimed glory and protest -- paint a target on the backs of U.S. troops, diplomats, foreign service employees, humanitarian relief workers and American tourists. [Snyder v. Phelps] Religion has been the rallying cry of almost every war in recorded history, and there are those in our country as well as in Muslim countries who truly believe that this is the start of a war between Islam and nonbelievers. We must not allow an equally small number of religious extremists in America to widen the war by burning the Quran ... or Torah or Bible.
