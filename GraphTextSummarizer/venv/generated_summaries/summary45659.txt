Shortly after Ben Ali's overthrow, Tunisian Ben Salah told CNN: "You didn't want to be overheard saying something against Ben Ali. Zine el Abidine Ben Ali will be remembered as the first leader to be toppled in what became known as the Arab Spring. Ben Ali is facing a military tribunal in absentia, along with dozens of former senior officials, for his alleged role in the killing of protesters in January 2011. Despite a hospital visit by the then president, coupled with vows to cut prices of basic foods, end censorship and ensure police did not use live ammunition on protesters, Ben Ali failed to quell growing unrest. Ben Ali was returned to office in five elections -- in 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004 and 2009 -- often with claims of more than 90% voter support.
