Ukraine and the West for months have accused Russia of supporting rebels in eastern Ukraine by sending in Russian troops, weapons and supplies. A day earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said Russian troops had crossed the border to support pro-Russian rebels. The United States and European countries have imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its involvement in Ukraine, while Russian officials have frequently denied claims their military has sent forces to bolster the rebels. Ukraine's latest allegations that Russian troops have been deployed into Ukraine are "complete rubbish," the Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday. Unrest in Ukraine began with protests in the country's capital last year after pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, favoring closer ties to Russia, dropped plans to sign a political and economic agreement with the European Union.
