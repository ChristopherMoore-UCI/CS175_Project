This is a culture that begs for closer inspection, something that reveals strong family bonds, a stubbornness for good quality and vibrant, tasty cuisine. -- A colorful platter steams with heat, rising from seasoned fish and an assortment of fresh vegetables all on a plush bed of rice. This type of food preparation is common in Senegal with each member of the family taking on one important role in the food preparation. Young boys run up to the boats, placing rollers underneath as the men hand off large coolers of fresh fish, proceeding to push the boat inland. What I discovered were firm family bonds, handmade artwork and a flavorful surprise.
