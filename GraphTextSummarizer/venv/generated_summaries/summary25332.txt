-- The 20 jurors to be selected in the Orlando, Florida, murder trial of Casey Anthony will cost the court system an estimated $361,000, according to court administrators. " Orange County Clerk of Courts Lydia Gardner told the newspaper that "funding for the Casey Anthony trial is in serious jeopardy" and that she "informed both the chief justice of the state Supreme Court as well as Chief (Judge) Belvin Perry of these dire circumstances. "It's an estimate of the expenses, but it's certainly not all-inclusive," court spokeswoman Karen Levey told the Orlando Sentinel. The jurors will be sequestered for the trial, in which Anthony, who turns 25 on Saturday, faces a capital murder charge in the death of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. According to a cost breakdown spreadsheet obtained by "In Session" on truTV, these expenses include everything from housing, transportation and three daily meals, to wages associated with the sheriff's office, court clerks and courthouse facilities for the duration of the trial.
