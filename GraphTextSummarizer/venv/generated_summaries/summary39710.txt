The criminal complaint filed Monday accused Cruz of trying to hire David Carrington and David Walters -- homeless men who go by the street names Little Dave and Big Dave -- to murder Campbell. Little Dave told TMZ that he was approached first by Cruz, who asked him to kill his wife for cash, and he told his friend Big Dave. The plan fell apart when one of the men whom Cruz allegedly recruited told Santa Monica police, Sgt. Santa Monica police began their undercover investigation of Cruz on May 7, Trisler said. Santa Monica police put them in a hotel room to keep them out of sight, Big Dave said.
