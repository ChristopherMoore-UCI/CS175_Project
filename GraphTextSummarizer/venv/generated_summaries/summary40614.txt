One activist from the organization said there had been more than 40 people killed in local coal mines since the 2006 accident. The mine contains a shaft that is 60 meters (197 feet) deep, Sabinas Mayor Jesus Montemayor Garza said. An organization representing family members of the victims of that accident said Tuesday's blast was a tragic reminder that the federal government must do more to regulate mines. "How long will it take to recognize that there is a very serious crisis in coal mining (in the Mexican state of) Coahuila, in which the workers and their families are those who must endure the worst, with dead, widows and orphans?" -- Rescuers overnight recovered four bodies from a coal mine in northern Mexico that suffered an explosion last week, making a total of 11 bodies that have been extracted so far, the country's labor secretary said Saturday.
