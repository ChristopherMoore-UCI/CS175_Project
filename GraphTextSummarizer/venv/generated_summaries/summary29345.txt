The indictment and a criminal complaint filed last month say Juraboev and Saidakhmetov planned to join ISIS and had purchased airline tickets to Turkey. Court documents say Saidakhmetov once posted some comments on video of ISIS executing Iraqi forces. In one from November, Saidakhmetov told Juraboev that he wanted to join the U.S. military so he could share information with ISIS. Dilkhayot Kasimov was added to a superseding indictment in which three previously arrested men --  Abdurasul Hasanovich Juraboev, Akhror Saidakhmetov, and Abror Habibov -- were charged with two counts of providing support to a foreign terrorist organization. " In August, court documents say, Juraboev was active on an Uzbek-language website that promoted ISIS.
