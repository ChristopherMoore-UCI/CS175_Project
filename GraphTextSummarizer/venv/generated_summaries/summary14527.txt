"Richard Nixon was known as the man who would cut and slash the opposition, and so that kind of dirty politics work would be done by Nixon," Edwards said. On his list of good VP picks, Edwards puts Dick Cheney at No. 5. Edwards said Agnew helped get Nixon elected president, but after taking office, he pleaded no contest to tax evasion and money laundering back when he had been the governor of Maryland. "Lyndon Johnson was the man, and he delivered Texas, which helped John Kennedy in a very close race," Edwards said. CNN asked conservative historian Lee Edwards to rank the VP choices since the 1950s.
