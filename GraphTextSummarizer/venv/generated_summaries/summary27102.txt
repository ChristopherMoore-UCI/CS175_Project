To protect against heat stress, the CDC advises spending time in air-conditioned places, staying informed of heat warning and drinking lots of fluids. Such high temperatures can put people at risk for heat exhaustion or heat stroke, which can be fatal. "It's more the tourists coming into the area, even from Southern California, who aren't used to this kind of heat. From Phoenix, to Las Vegas, to Death Valley in California, which set a world-record high a century ago. Paramedics found the man dead in his home, which did not have air conditioning, said Las Vegas Fire & Rescue spokesman Tim Szymanski.
