According to Steiber, "at one point Mrs. Meyers was following what we consider a suspect vehicle. Tammy Meyers was scared and upset, Steiber said of the woman's feelings at the time. Steiber said only that police don't think Tammy Meyers did anything wrong criminally. Still, Steiber said that police believe a bullet from the sedan driver's gun -- not that of her son -- killed Tammy Meyers. And then, at another point, they broke apart and Mrs. Meyers went home."
