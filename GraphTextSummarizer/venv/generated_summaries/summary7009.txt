In 2005, Davis was charged with murder in the shooting death of a man, but charges were dropped because of insufficient evidence. He was sentenced Wednesday to three years and three months in federal prison on firearm charges. "Davis has a long history of violence and illegally possessing and using guns," U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates said in a statement. Police arrived to find Davis smelling strongly of marijuana, waving a loaded Glock .40-caliber handgun, and making threatening comments. Two days prior, police had been called to a different location in DeKalb County, where Davis was in possession of a different firearm, making threatening comments.
