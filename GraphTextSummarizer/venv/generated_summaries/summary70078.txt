"If it is now possible -- and Mr. Bulger seriously questions whether it will be possible -- for Mr. Bulger to receive a fair trial, law enforcement leaks of nonpublic information must end, with disclosures of information limited to the judicial process," Krupp wrote. Interim defense attorney Peter Krupp had requested the merger, which prosecutors argued was meant to complicate the more severe charges that Bulger faces. Clad in an orange jumpsuit and flanked by two security guards, Bulger was escorted off a helicopter at Logan International Airport in Boston and then ushered to a van that brought the alleged mobster to court. Prosecutors say Bulger waived his Miranda rights after his arrest and told agents who were taking him back to Boston that he had been "a frequent traveler as a fugitive," according to the government. Carney said the case represented "a daunting task, but we're up for it." Prosecutors -- who said FBI agents seized more than $822,000 in cash from Bulger's Santa Monica, California, apartment -- said he should have picked up his own legal tab.
