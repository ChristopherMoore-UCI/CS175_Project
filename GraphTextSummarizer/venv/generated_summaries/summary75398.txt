Police and health officials in Kut told CNN that three people were killed and four others were wounded when a car bomb exploded at a security checkpoint southeast of Baghdad on Tuesday. This comes after Monday's bombings across Iraq that left at least 51 killed and more than 266 wounded, health and police officials in Baghdad told CNN on Tuesday. -- Iraqi authorities hanged 21 men after they were convicted of terrorism, the nation's Ministry of Justice reported Tuesday. Some of them had carried out attacks by planting bombs and rigging cars and motorcycles with explosives. Since then, at least 447 prisoners have been executed, including Saddam Hussein, some of his main associates and alleged members of armed groups.
