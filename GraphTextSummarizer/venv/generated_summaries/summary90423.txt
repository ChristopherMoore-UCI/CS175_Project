Saudi Arabia names new crown prince Saudi women slam dunk sports taboo Saudi female entrepreneurs exploit changing attitudes Last year, Shiite protesters in the Qatif region urged the Saudi government to release Shiite prisoners and grant more rights. Abdullah's move came with his issuance of a royal order relieving Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz of his post and appointing him instead as a ministerial-level adviser and special envoy to the king. Bandar served as ambassador to the United States from 1983 to 2005 and was friends with the family of former President George W. Bush. To fill the vacated spot, Abdullah appointed Prince Bandar bin Sultan bin Abdulaziz, who will retain his current job as secretary general of the National Security Council.
