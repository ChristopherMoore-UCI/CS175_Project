Steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where Nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured, in much less than ideal circumstances. Most of them have visible wounds: deep cuts, bruised faces, broken arms and legs or spinal injuries. We head back to the hospital, where we meet Olivier Hagon. Here, the injured get necessary first aid and as soon as possible are transferred to bigger hospitals in other districts or in Kathmandu.
