If you can't lift heavy weights, so lift light weights. living an intentional life ... thinking about who you are, how you affect other people, how you are perceived in the world and how you can change that to be more positive -- instead of sort of just drifting along like a leaf in the river, being really intentional about how you live. But when you are older, it is very important what you eat because your cells regenerate more slowly and also you put on weight more easily because you have less muscle than you used to, so every single calorie you put in your body has to count for something. Now that the Christmas holiday is coming, I will take a bite of a pecan pie, but I won't eat a whole pecan pie. I try to eat something dark green, dark purple, red, orange, yellow, white, because they all have different vitamins and minerals in them.
