Spencer, who weighed 2 pounds, 2 ounces when he was born prematurely, was in the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, California, for more than 11 weeks. In the past, the bonding process had to be instituted every few days," said Dr. David Hicks, medical director of the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Jude Medical Center. Betty Rowzee, clinical manager of the neonatal intensive care unit, said babies at Parkview typically stay for seven to 14 days.
