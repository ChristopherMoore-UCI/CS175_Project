Watch a video from Tim Federle about his new novel, "Better Nate Than Ever" Federle hopes readers find "Nate" especially relevant in a day where many kids who want to perform on stage are bullied or picked on for being different. Federle has danced in several big Broadway shows and a Super Bowl halftime show and worked as a choreographer with the young dancers of the hit musical "Billy Elliot," and now he's written his first novel, "Better Nate Than Ever." Author Tim Federle has just wrapped a long day at the Atlanta Junior Theater festival, working with several thousand boys and girls who dream of stardom on the Broadway stage. " While Federle ultimately made his Broadway dreams come true, after 10 years performing on stage, he found himself closing in on his 30th birthday and feeling like he was stuck in a creative rut. "Adults are saying to me, 'oh, my gosh, I remember what it was like,' and it's actually inspired a few to say things like, 'I'm going to take up racquetball again,' random stuff that has nothing to do with musicals." Readers who are fans of TV shows like "American Idol," "The Voice" and "Glee" might enjoy "Better Nate Than Ever."
