-- Miss USA Rima Fakih is a Muslim with Lebanese heritage, but her family is "not defined by religion," Fakih said. "And just to be clear, my family comes from many different backgrounds and religions." Fakih was born in Lebanon, but her family moved to New York when she was young. Behar asked Fakih if there were any such photos of her that might eventually surface. "My family comes from a Muslim background, and we're not defined by religion," she said.
