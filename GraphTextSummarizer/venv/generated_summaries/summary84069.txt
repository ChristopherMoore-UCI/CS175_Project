Fredrick's post has gone viral on Facebook and Instagram, generating worldwide media coverage -- both cheers and jeers. Fredrick shaved his son's head bald and then showed him a picture of an old bald man, like the character in "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. " Not familiar with the plot of "Benjamin Button?"  Benjamin begins life as an old man and ages in reverse. The inspiration came from Fredrick's own life, when he was having trouble last year with his 12-year-old son, CNN affiliate WXIA reports. Some call it the "Benjamin Button Special;" others the "old man" cut.
