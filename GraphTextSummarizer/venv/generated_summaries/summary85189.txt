Tens of thousands of Jewish, Sinti and Roma prisoners were also sent to the camp, many of whom died before it was liberated by U.S. Army troops in 1945. -- An iron gate with the notorious Nazi slogan "Arbeit Macht Frei" has been stolen from the former Dachau concentration camp in Germany, officials said. According to the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial, the gate was forged by inmates in one of the camp's workshops after it first opened in 1933 for political prisoners. Police and state security services are investigating, the Dachau Concentration Camp Memorial statement said. The slogan, which translates as "Work sets you free," became emblematic of the forced labor camps of World War II in which so many inmates died.
