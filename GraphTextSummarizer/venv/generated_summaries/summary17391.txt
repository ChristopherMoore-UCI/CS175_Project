The worst flooding in generations crept deeper into Bangkok Friday as the Thai leader asked residents to come to terms with water everywhere. Thanakit Photong, the site's safety manager, said he expected to begin pumping water out next week. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra told western Bangkok residents that the water was sure to linger and they must learn to cope, the MCOT news agency reported. People propped their feet up on coffee tables not for rest but just to keep dry as murky water entered homes. The flooding has had an enormous business impact as many factories and offices have been under water for more than a month.
