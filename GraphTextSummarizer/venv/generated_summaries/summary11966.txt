The stash also includes a May 29, 1963, birthday card for Kennedy signed by his toddler son, John Jr., as well as a marked-up itinerary for his final presidential trip, a visit to Dallas in November 1963. -- Half a century after the heyday of Camelot, a treasure trove of John F. Kennedy personal items now belongs to a bevy of JFK fanatics. November 22 marks the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination in Dallas. The items auctioned included a collection of Kennedy family photographs from the late 1930s, working copies of a foreign policy speech and signed letters from the president to his parents. The $629,000 total includes an 18% buyer's premium, or the amount paid to the auction house, according to John McInnis Auctioneers of Massachusetts.
