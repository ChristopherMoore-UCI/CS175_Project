-- Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi announced his retirement from Test cricket after his side slumped to a 150-run defeat to Australia at Lord's on Friday. Pakistan, chasing a world record fourth innings victory total of 440, were bowled out for 289, with Salman Butt, who is likely to replace Afridi as Test captain, top scoring with 92. "I've not been fully fit with a side strain and so I will not play Test cricket after the match in Leeds," Afridi told gathered reporters. Yawar Saeed, the Pakistan tour manager, told AFP: "Yes, he has told us he is not feeling comfortable with the injury and has told us he doesn't want to play (Tests) but we will talk to him and then decide. Afridi, nicknamed "Boom Boom" because of his big-hitting exploits in one-day and Twenty20 cricket, had only just returned to the Test arena after a four-year absence to take over the captaincy of a youthful Pakistan side.
