Two victims died at a hospital Friday night, he said, and two more deceased victims were found in the water Saturday morning. "One vessel crashed into another, then that vessel hit a third," Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Officer Jorge Pino said Saturday. The accident happened near the Dinner Key Marina in Biscayne Bay around 10:45 p.m. Friday following a fireworks display, as a crowd of boaters was making their way back to shore. Pino said up to five people were thrown into the water after the crash and as many as 12 were transported to local hospitals. One person is hospitalized in critical condition, according to Pino.
