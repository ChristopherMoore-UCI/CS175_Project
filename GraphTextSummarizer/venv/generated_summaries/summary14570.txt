"For every billionaire that Hurun Report has found, I estimate we have missed at least two, meaning that today there are probably 4,000 billionaires in the world," said Rupert Hoogewerf, chairman and chief researcher of Hurun Report, a Shanghai-based publishing group that tracks China's wealthy. " Still, most billionaires on the list have companies listed on China's stock exchanges (212) rather than U.S. exchanges (211), despite Chinese markets underperforming in recent years. In terms of cities, Moscow is home to the greatest number of billionaires with 76, followed by New York (70), Hong Kong (52), Beijing (41) and London (40). The world has at least 1,453 billionaires, with about half of those residing in the U.S. and China, according to the Hurun Global Rich List. Three out of four billionaires in the Hurun List are self-made, with real estate, telecommunications, media and technology and retail leading industries that produce the super-rich.
