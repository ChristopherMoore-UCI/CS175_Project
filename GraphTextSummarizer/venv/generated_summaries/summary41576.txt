The incident took place Tuesday evening on a Southwest Airlines flight from Las Vegas to Boise, Idaho, said Lt. Kent Lipple of the Boise police. -- A 68-year-old Idaho man has been charged with misdemeanor battery after police say he struck a teen who would not turn off his iPhone while the plane they were in was taxiing for takeoff. Miller told police that the 15-year-old boy refused to turn off his phone after directions from the flight crew. The man, Russell Miller, was arrested after the plane landed, Lipple said. The suspect "felt he was protecting the entire plane and its occupants," Lipple said.
