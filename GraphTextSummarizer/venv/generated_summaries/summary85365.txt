Scientists chose Mount Sharp as the rover's destination long before the roving lab launched from Cape Canaveral in November 2011 and touched down in August 2012. Mars exploration fast facts Living up to its name, Curiosity explored the crater floor as it made its way to the base of Mount Sharp. -- After roving across more than five miles of the Red Planet's sometimes rough terrain, NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has reached its primary destination: the base of a Martian mountain in the middle of a vast, deep crater. NASA says Curiosity found evidence on Gale Crater's floor that a lake bed existed billions of years ago that offered fresh water, key ingredients for life and a source of energy for microbes. Earlier this year, Curiosity's team members had to change the rover's route because sharp rocks were poking holes into four of the rover's six wheels.
