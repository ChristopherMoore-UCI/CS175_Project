Thane hit the states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry. Many people in largely agricultural and fishing communities along the coast live in thatched-roof huts that could sustain extensive damage, the India Meteorological Department said Friday. Parts of coastal and inland Tamil Nadu and Puducherry can expect heavy rainfall over the next day, the agency said. Lashing winds and heavy rain pummeled India's southeastern coastline Friday as Cyclone Thane roared onshore killing at least 19 people. Emergency crews were working to restore power supplies and clear roads of fallen trees and downed power lines, she added.
