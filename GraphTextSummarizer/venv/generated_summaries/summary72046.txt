Head of Egypt's powerful intelligence services, Suleiman also served as vice president under Mubarak before his ouster. Suleiman had headed Egypt's intelligence since 1993, maintained close CIA ties and was often criticized by rights groups for his heavy-handed approach with suspected militants. In June 1995, both Suleiman and Mubarak survived an assassination attempt during an African summit in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. In a somber one-minute television announcement in February 2011, Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned his post as president and declared that the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces would run the country's affairs. The announcement followed an 18-day popular uprising in Egypt that saw tens of thousands take to the streets to demand Mubarak's ouster.
