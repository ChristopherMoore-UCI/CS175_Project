-- American citizens who want to leave Egypt on a U.S. government flight should report to the airport as soon as the nightly curfew ends, according to official Twitter messages from the Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs. Exact costs hadn't been determined, but a State Department official said it should be comparable to a one-way commercial flight from Egypt to the evacuation points. Other countries, including China, Canada, India, Thailand and Australia were attempting to get stranded citizens out of Egypt. A media note from the State Department warned U.S. citizens to move carefully in the streets and to avoid demonstrations along the way. More than 1,900 U.S. citizens and their family members have left Egypt since an evacuation operation began Monday, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department.
