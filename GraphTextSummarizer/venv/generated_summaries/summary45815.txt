Off-screen, Stewart's sex life is also of interest, particularly her relationship with "Twilight" costar Robert Pattinson, which Glamour describes as "likely-but-never confirmed-nor-denied. The pivotal sex scene in the new "Twilight" film, "Breaking Dawn -- Part 1" is so steamy that the MPAA originally gave the film an R rating, according to its star Kristen Stewart, who says even she was shocked by what her character does between the sheets. " Only 17 when she was first cast as Bella Swan in the "Twilight" saga, Stewart says she's finally starting to feel comfortable doing interviews, but that it's "a fair assessment" to say she often comes off as shy and nervous in public. "There are two big sex scenes in the two [final] films, and we did them fairly early," Stewart, 21, tells the U.K. edition of Glamour. " Though the actress -- who's currently shooting "Snow White and the Huntsman" -- certainly isn't a fan of such attention, she seems to take it in stride.
