-- Voters in Germany vote Sunday for the first time since the eurozone crisis left the single currency -- and much of the continent -- teetering on the brink of chaos. The AfD, founded in April 2013, is made up of so-called "euroskeptics," opposed to the single European currency and to Germany's role in the bailouts of several struggling eurozone nations, which they see as a waste of money the country can ill afford. Votes given to parties that do not meet this threshold are redistributed amongst those who do. Merkel, a physicist-turned-politician from the former East Germany, came to power in 2005 as leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), a center-right conservative party. Alternatively, should they perform well at the polls, the Social Democrats could seek to oust Merkel by forming a left-wing coalition with the Greens and The Left.
