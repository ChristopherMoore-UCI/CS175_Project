Still, as optimists are fond of pointing out, "apocalypse" doesn't mean end, but is Greek for "revelation" -- an unveiling of truth. Last weekend's box-office champ "2012" primarily uses an ancient Mayan prophecy to spin a tale of world destruction. "It's been a constant part of the landscape in the Western world for a long time," he says, though it's been particularly present in recent times, perhaps driven by ever-quickening social and technological change, he adds. And many terrorists and agitators subscribe to end-times beliefs, with hope that their provocations can lead to apocalypse. The fact that none of these events led to the end of the world hasn't calmed end-times fears.
