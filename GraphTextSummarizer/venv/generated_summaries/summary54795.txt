"The terrorists responsible for this attack must be brought to justice," said department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Residents and their representatives and lawyers have appealed to the U.N. Secretary-General and U.S. officials to let them return to Ashraf, which they say has concrete buildings and shelters that offer more protection. MEK last year moved from Camp Ashraf in Diyala province to Camp Hurriya in Baghdad. The rocket and mortar attack occurred at Camp Hurriya, a onetime U.S. base formerly known as Camp Liberty, which is now the home of the Iranian exile group Mujahedin-e-Khalq. It urged the Iraqi government to investigate the attack promptly and take all appropriate measures to enhance camp security.
