"I did it on a Monday morning, was out on Tuesday and back here on 'Larry King Live' on Tuesday night," King said. -- Minutes after Bill Clinton's doctor divulged that the former president underwent a stenting procedure to restore blood flow through a coronary artery, CNN's Larry King made a similar announcement. "A month ago, maybe five weeks ago, I had the same procedure at Cedar-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles that Bill Clinton had today," the 76-year-old talk show host told viewers of his program, "Larry King Live." He described his experience with heart disease in his 1989 book, "Mr. King, You're Having a Heart Attack." "I felt some strange feelings in my shoulder, where I had the original heart attack," said King.
