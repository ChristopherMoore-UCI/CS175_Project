In November 2009, five lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain 100 count with the EZ-open cap were recalled for unusual odor leading to nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. Following the pediatric medicine recall, Johnson and Johnson suspended production at McNeil's facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania that manufactured the children's drugs. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform also invited Johnson and Johnson Chief Executive William Weldon, but he declined to attend because of health reasons. Among the measures, the drugmaker said it has hired an independent pharmaceutical consulting firm to identify corrective actions to improve quality and manufacturing systems at its Fort Washington facility. "McNeil is taking steps to bring its operation back to a level of quality that Johnson and Johnson demands of its companies, and that the public rightly expects of us, and that we expect of ourselves," the company said in a statement.
