" Chris Christie on possible Ebola lawsuit: 'Whatever' The heckler, Jim Keady, told CNN on Thursday he was trying to bring attention to what he described as Christie's failed handling of Superstorm Sandy recovery funds. -- New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie defended his verbal beat down of a heckler from earlier this week, saying he's not the kind of person to sit back and let people "be rude." "If someone is going to stand up and I ignore them for a while and then they continue to be rude and talk over me, and block other people, well then I'm going to engage," he said Thursday. Christie's temper could be a liability on the campaign trail, Democratic strategist David Axelrod said Thursday on MSNBC, adding that "every day is filled with aggravations and provocations, and if that's the way he's going to react, he has no future in this. "I don't look forward to doing that stuff but I won't shrink away from it either," the Republican told reporters Thursday in New Mexico.
