The 67-year-old Berezovsky was found dead at a country estate south of London over the weekend, triggering speculation about the fate of a onetime tycoon known for his opposition to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The agency said a family friend told Russian media that Berezovsky had suffered a heart attack. Moscow is ready to consider burying him in Russia, if it receives such a request, Russian media said, quoting presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Berezovsky also blamed the Kremlin for the death of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, who was poisoned by radioactive material in London. Berezovsky fled Russian and began agitating against Putin from Britain, calling for a coup to oust the Russian president.
