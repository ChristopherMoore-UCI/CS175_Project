Dart said the talks persisted for hours and proved to be a "very thoughtful approach" to hostage negotiations. The hostage-takers shot and injured at least one police officer when the standoff began Tuesday, but no shots were fired and no one was hurt when police moved into the home Wednesday, having determined negotiations were no longer progressing and that tensions were rising. "We're very happy that there's been a peaceful resolution," Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart told reporters. Started with robbery attempt The incident began at about 12:45 p.m. Tuesday when two people tried to rob the home, Dart said. Asked if police and the suspects were in a struggle, Dart answered: "They didn't surrender themselves."
