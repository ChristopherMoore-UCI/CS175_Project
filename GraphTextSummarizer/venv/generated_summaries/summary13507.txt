"You are a key to the success of your father," Federal Bureau of Prisons Director Charles E. Samuels, Jr. told the daughters, according to a bureau press statement which said "connections to families and children are critical aspects" of inmates' reentry into society. He urged the men to stay engaged with their children while in prison and use the facility's self-improvement programs to learn skills and become productive members of the community when they are released. The fathers at this social event were all inmates in a federal prison, serving time for a variety of offenses. "There is Still Time at the Ball" was the theme of this inaugural dance for prisoners -- all nonviolent offenders -- and their daughters at the Federal Detention Center in Miami, Florida. -- The daughters came in tights, frilly dresses and patent leather shoes.
