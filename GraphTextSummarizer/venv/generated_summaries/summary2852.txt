Patrick L. of Montreal, Quebec Steve Irwin will be remembered for his courage in dealing with dangerous animals, his skill as an entertainer and his humanity. Michael Yang of Singapore Steve and Terri have been a big part of my life. Denise Cole of Union Lake, Michigan  The one and only time I saw Steve Irwin on television my thoughts were "You can't do that to wildlife and not get killed." Few people take the risks Steve did in dealing with dangerous animals; even fewer manage to do this type of job with the flair and heart that was visible from watching Steve at work. Without a doubt, Steve has helped make the world a better place both for people and animals.
