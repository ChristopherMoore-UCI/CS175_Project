During that period she also set 14 world records, literally raising the bar from 1.74 meters (becoming in 1958 the first woman to clear six feet (1.83m) to 1.91m. Such was Balas' domination that at the time she set her final world record in 1961 no other woman had gone higher than 1.78m. Her career best 1.91m would stand until 1971, by which point the sport had been revolutionized by Dick Fosbury's famous "flop" at the 1968 Olympics. Although she won consecutive gold medals in Rome in 1960 and in Tokyo in 1964, the Romanian's achievements are perhaps better reflected in her 140 consecutive competitive victories in the event between 1957 and 1967. In Rome and Tokyo none of Balas' opponents even got close. Balas continued to compete for three more years, battling with knee problems, until finally in 1967 she was beaten. It was her first defeat since finishing an inauspicious fifth on her Olympic debut in Melbourne in 1956.
