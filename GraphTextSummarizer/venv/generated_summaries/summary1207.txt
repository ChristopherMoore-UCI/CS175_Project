-- As more than one pundit has noted, President Barack Obama now has three choices in Syria: Bad, worse, and horrible. Last year, Obama made it clear that the United States would take action if Syria crossed "a red line" by using chemical weapons in its civil war. Secretary Kerry has described the lurid pictures of chemical attack victims, saying "All of them show and report victims with breathing difficulties, people twitching with spasms, coughing, rapid heartbeats, foaming at the mouth, unconsciousness, and death..." President Obama himself sat down with PBS to explain the broader, regional implications of allowing Syria to use chemical weapons with impunity. "Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra, is generally acknowledged to be the most effective force fighting," says CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen who adds, "Al-Nusra's military prowess and close ties to al Qaeda make it a potentially serious threat to U.S. interests in the region. Why Russia, China, and Iran are standing by Syria President Obama calls it an "incapacity" on the part of the U.N., but there is no sign that the name-calling will change anything.
