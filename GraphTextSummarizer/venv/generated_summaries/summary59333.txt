Gazelle.com spokesperson Kristina Kennedy explained that the company, which buys over 20 categories of electronics products in addition to cell phones, ends up "finding new homes" for more than 90 percent of the used devices they buy. Gazelle.com also follows the EPA's Responsible Recycling (R2) practices -- which is a good start, even though a recent Government Accountability Office report points out that the federal agency "does not specifically regulate the export of many other electronic devices, such as cell phones, which typically are not within the regulatory definition of hazardous waste despite containing some toxic substances." And even when devices are broken or useless, I can't bring myself to landfill them -- I save them up for local electronics recycling drives. "As phones become more like computers, we might start to pay closer attention to that." However you get rid of your old cell phones, be sure to protect yourself with proper precautions to delete your data. So yes -- if I want to sell my old iPhone, I definitely could make more money elsewhere.
