According to an Army statement about Hasan's incarceration at the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, "All inmates must conform to AR 670-1, wear and appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia. " The statement also said, "In keeping with the provisions" of the regulations, "Inmate Hasan has been shaved." A military jury on August 28 recommended the death penalty for Hasan convicted for the 2009 massacre at Fort Hood that left 13 people dead and 32 others wounded. Hasan attorneys filed an appeal and the court martial was on hold. Later, the judge, Col. Gregory Gross, found Hasan in contempt of court. Nidal Hasan, the former Army psychiatrist convicted of 13 murders and dozens of attempted murders, is clean shaven again.
