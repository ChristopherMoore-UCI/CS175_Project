But what isn't "just me" is the irritation that comes from knowing these cable providers, banks, doctor offices and such have all taken what has traditionally been a fairly painless process and injected all of this stress into it because automated service seems easier on the bottom line than customer service. Now, not only do the people answering the phone not know English, they're not even people. I swear I never noticed just how important that part of life was until I started yelling that sentence into my cell in public. Siri and her girls may not get the caller's request right the first dozen times, but they don't require overtime, health insurance or raises. It just seems like busy work and obviously we're busy enough.
