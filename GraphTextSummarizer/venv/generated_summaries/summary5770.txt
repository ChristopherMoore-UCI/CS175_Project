North Korea also wanted South Korea to stop "attracting" U.S. military hardware, including strategic bombers and a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, into the region. The latest launch comes the day after South Korea dismissed a North Korean "special proposal" to improve ties and reduce military tensions. And a few days later, North Korea fired at least two shells near a South Korean patrol boat in the Yellow Sea. North Korea has carried out a series of missile and rocket launches into the sea in recent months, drawing criticism from South Korea, the United States and the United Nations. North and South Korea remain technically at war since the Korean War ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, in 1953.
