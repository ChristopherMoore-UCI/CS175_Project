Save for some bit roles in a smattering of unremarkable TV shows, the world hasn't heard much from Ben Savage since 2000. As important as it is to a lot of fans and a lot of people who watched our show, it's just as important to me after all this time. I know a lot of people grew up with that show. I think people can really appreciate a show with a good message, but one that does that with some humor. Titled "Girl Meets World," the spinoff series, which is set to begin shooting in February and will air on the Disney Channel, stars both Savage and Danielle Fishel (as his wife, Topanga Lawrence) and follows the couple's experience raising a 13-year-old daughter.
