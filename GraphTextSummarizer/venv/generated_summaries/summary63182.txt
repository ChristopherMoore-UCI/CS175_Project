"This plan is designed to enhance the potential of Dayton as a competitor in the global economy by attracting immigrants who bring new ideas, new perspective, and new talent to our work force," Leitzell said in the statement. The pro-immigrant sentiment in Dayton stands in contrast to a number of high profile laws at the state level targeting illegal immigrants, but it is not a perfect comparison. The city plan has nothing to do with illegal immigration, officials say, but rather with welcoming immigrants and treating all residents with respect. The plan suggests the creation of a municipal identification card for Dayton residents who don't have any other form of ID. Other Dayton recommendations include improving the interpreter capabilities offered by the city and creating hiring incentives for government employees to learn a foreign language.
