On a conference call with reporters Thursday, Rhodes indicated any decision to conduct airstrikes would occur after Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and a White House counterterrorism adviser travel to the Middle East to gauge support in the region for an anti-ISIS coalition. But Rhodes told CNN it would be difficult to ultimately destroy ISIS without dealing with the organization in Syria, where it currently enjoys a safe haven. A key national security adviser to President Barack Obama said he believes the United States will "absolutely" secure an international coalition to defeat the rapidly growing terrorist group operating in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS. So they are very concerned that this threat in Iraq and Syria could end up posing a threat here in Europe," Rhodes said. Rhodes argued there was no inconsistency in the president's remarks, insisting the mission to defeat ISIS is a multi-step process.
