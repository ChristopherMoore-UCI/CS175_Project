Madrid should have added to their lead, but Ronaldo was denied by goalkeeper Diego Alves while Karim Benzema and Mahamadou Diarra also missed good chances. Veteran midfielder Guti struck the post from the edge of the area before Rafael Van der Vaart put the rebound wide. And the winning goal came in the 69th minute when Van der Vaart collected Gonzalo Higuain's pass before firing home a low shot into the bottom corner. However, the visitors drew level in the 27th minute thanks to a moment of superb skill from Cristiano Ronaldo. And the home side nearly doubled their advantage just seven minutes later when Domingo Cisma's free-kick was superbly saved by Iker Casillas.
