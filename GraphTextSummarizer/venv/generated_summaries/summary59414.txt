-- Sen. Ted Stevens, indicted Tuesday on seven counts of making false statements on Senate financial disclosure forms, has a long history in the Senate. Stevens is the Senate's president pro tempore emeritus; co-chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee; vice chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation; and ranking member of the Disaster Recovery Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee. Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens was charged Tuesday with making false statements on financial disclosure forms. And in the last few years, the Alaska Republican has been a poster boy for congressional spending critics. After his stint in the White House, Stevens moved back to Alaska and ran for state representative.
