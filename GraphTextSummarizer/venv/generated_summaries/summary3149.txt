In its "State of the World 2010" report, the Worldwatch Institute warns that without a shift from consumerism to sustainability "no government pledges or technological advances will be enough to rescue humanity from unacceptably hazardous environmental and climate risks." The 244-page study details the work of 60 authors who explain strategies and present examples of cultures reorienting away from excessive consumption towards sustainable practices. "Despite the vast majority of media today reinforcing consumerism, there are efforts worldwide to tap media's vast reach and power to promote sustainable cultures," he said. Erik Assadourian, senior researcher and director of the 2010 report told CNN: "In essence, the whole point of the report is to say that for humanity to thrive long into the future we'll need to transform our cultures intentionally and proactively away from consumerism towards sustainability." Assadourian believes the path towards sustainability will also be aided by harnessing social marketing to spread a new message.
