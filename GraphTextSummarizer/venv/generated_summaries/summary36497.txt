After Miller won a bronze in the men's super-G alpine skiing race Sunday, Cooper asked him about his emotions and stuck with the questions after Miller teared up talking about his brother, Chelone, a snowboarder with his own Olympic aspirations who died last year at 29. "In the end, people will sort of see that it was more me just dealing with all these emotions and the build-up of several years of very tough personal life stuff," Miller said. "She asked questions that I feel like with her knowledge of my brother and the situation, I felt like were pretty normal questions," Miller said. " Miller's brother was in a motorcycle accident in 2006. I mean, I felt like it was me, not her," he told CNN about NBC reporter Christin Cooper.
