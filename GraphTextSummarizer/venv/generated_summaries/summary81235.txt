"What we're finding now with the Olympics coming up, some of these players that left sevens to go to fifteens want to come back into sevens to try and go for a gold medal in Rio in 2016," International Rugby Board CEO Brett Gosper told CNN. "It's as much about the party as it is about the matches themselves," former Australia rugby union international Joe Roff told CNN's Rugby Sevens Worldwide show. Welcome to the wonderful world of rugby sevens, a combination of fast and furious on-field play augmented by no little fun in the stands in a nine-leg circuit which reaches its party peak in Hong Kong. For old hats like Roff, modern sevens is as close as it gets to the free-spirited days of rugby as an amateur sport. "It's a little bit of a throwback to rugby when I played," Australian sevens coach Mick O'Connor told CNN.
