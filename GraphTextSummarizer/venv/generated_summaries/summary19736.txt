The use of drone aircraft perpetuates the illusion that military force is an effective means of countering terrorism and resolving political differences. Many important legal questions have been raised about drone strikes. Nor do we have legal authority to launch military strikes in Yemen, Somalia and other countries where the United States is not officially engaged in armed hostilities. The U.S. government claims that drone strikes are an effective tool against al Qaeda leaders, but most of those being killed are low-level militants. White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan claimed in June that no civilians have been killed in Pakistan in the last year because of drone strikes.
