"He had run off from his mum," said airport spokesman John Greenway. He went to Manchester Airport, snuck past passport control and boarding pass checks, went though a metal detector and was on a plane halfway to Rome before anyone realized there was anything unusual going on, an airport spokesman said Wednesday. -- Many kids manage to slip away from their parents in shopping centers during summer vacations, but an 11-year-old boy from Manchester, England, got farther away than most this week. He was noticed while the flight was in the air and sent back home when the plane returned to England, Greenway said. It looks like he evaded some passport checks and some boarding pass checks and ended up in Rome," Greenway said.
