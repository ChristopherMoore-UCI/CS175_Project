At a December 2011 event honoring his career, House Speaker John Boehner reflected on Livingood's 17 years of service in the chamber. Livingood never expected to introduce the president when he became House sergeant at arms in 1995. " Livingood was sergeant at arms during some difficult years that included the anthrax attacks on Capitol Hill offices. He also helped reform House security systems after the September 11 attacks. "Announcing the president at the annual State of the Union address has made Bill Livingood known in the homes of many American families, and his service of nearly 17 years, and under four different speakers of the House, puts him in the history books," she said in a statement.
