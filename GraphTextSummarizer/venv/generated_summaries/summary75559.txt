Other evidence of climate change came from IPY research vessels that found warming waters in the Southern Ocean and an increase in melting ice that is creating fresher bottom water around the coast of Antarctica. Among efforts to study the effects of climate change on Antarctica, was aNorwegian Polar Institute project to study marine mammals. The electronic tags -- which fell off when the seals molted -- sent back data on temperature and salinity the oceans around Antarctica, particularly around the Fimbul Ice Shelf in east Antarctica. According to a report published by the IPY organizing committee in February, their research indicates that global warming is affecting Antarctica in ways not previously identified. While ice-shelf melt has been recorded in the west of Antarctica, scientists are concerned that it could happen in the east as well.
