The pilot reported engine failure at 9,000 feet at about 3 p.m. MT (5 p.m. ET) and asked the Salt Lake tower for coordinates to a remote airstrip near Cascade, a small town in central Idaho, said Lt. Dan Smith of the Valley County Sheriff's Office in Cascade. -- Emergency responders searched a mountainous section of Idaho Monday for a single-engine plane carrying five family members that went missing Sunday afternoon. Deputies and rescue workers also joined the search in mixed rain, snow and fairly high winds, Smith said. Smith said authorities used the pilot's cell phone signal to narrow the search to a two- to- four-square-mile area in the mountains. The plane dropped off the radar and all contact was lost, Smith said.
