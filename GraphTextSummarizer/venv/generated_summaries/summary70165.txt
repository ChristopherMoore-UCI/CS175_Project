You may not have heard of them, but you've probably seen their most famous product: an interactive, Multi-Touch Collaboration Wall better known as CNN's "Magic Wall." CNN's John King uses the "Magic Wall" to illustrate and explain election projections. The big map allows King to instantly tally electoral votes, shift swing states from one candidate's camp to another's and highlight red swaths of John McCain turf alongside blue pockets of support for Barack Obama. Han's multi-touch screens are undeniably cool, with a seemingly magnetic effect on users and audiences alike. Watch the wall in action Â» The inspiration for the multi-touch technology came from a decidedly non-digital event: Han was drinking a glass of water.
