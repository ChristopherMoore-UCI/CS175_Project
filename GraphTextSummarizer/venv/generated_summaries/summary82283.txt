Assistant Deputy Coroner Suzanne Greenaway ruled in October that Winehouse, who was found dead on July 23rd, died of accidental alcohol poisoning. Adding to the intrigue is the fact that Greenaway was appointed to her post by her husband, Andrew Reid, who serves as a London coroner himself. " Reid indicated he would be willing to perform any of Greenaway's inquests again if the families of the deceased requested it. The Camden Council, the local authority in the matter, said it believed Reid "had made an error in good faith. In a statement, Reid said that he was under the impression that his wife's tenure as a registered lawyer in her native Australia qualified her for the post.
