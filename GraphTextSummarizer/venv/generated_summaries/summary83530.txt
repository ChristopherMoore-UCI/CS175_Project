President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi stopped short of announcing a full-fledged deal but did say they'd moved forward on the issue. With U.S.-Russia relations worsening to Cold War levels, Obama hopes to balance Moscow's influence in India during his visit this week. In a surprise break in protocol, Modi greeted Obama on the tarmac on his arrival in New Delhi and wrapped him in a hug. Officials also hope to exact climate commitments in New Delhi, where air quality warnings remained in place even during Obama's visit. Local television networks profiled weavers preparing elaborate gold-threaded saris for first lady Michelle Obama, who is accompanying her husband for the three-day state visit.
