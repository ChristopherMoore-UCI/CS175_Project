That decision drew criticism from a number of FIFA member countries, given the allegations of corruption relating to the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup, awarded to Russia, and the 2022 installment, given to Qatar. Blatter announced his intention to step down at the end of his fourth term but backtracked at FIFA's congress in Brazil last year, claiming his mission was "not yet finished." Van Praag was one of those to suggest Blatter should step down, telling him at a meeting of European officials: "Few people still take FIFA seriously and, however you look at it, Blatter is mainly responsible. " Blatter enjoys firm support from the majority of FIFA's 209 member associations and many see May's elections as a forgone conclusion, despite the last few being blighted by scandal and difficulty. It remains to be seen whether Ginola, or any of his fellow candidates, can make a significant dent in the support Blatter holds among FIFA's members, and make the May elections anything more than another forgone conclusion.
