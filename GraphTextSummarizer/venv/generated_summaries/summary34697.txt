Added U.S. Attorney Sally Quillian Yates, "This is how people get hurt, and we are committed to ensuring that convicted felons not have guns." After Gucci Mane became "increasingly agitated" and threatened officers, police said, he was taken into custody and charged with disorderly conduct, marijuana possession and carrying a handgun. Atlanta Police Chief George Turner said in a statement, "We cannot tolerate convicted felons ignoring the law by carrying firearms and endangering our citizens." -- Rapper Gucci Mane was charged in federal court Tuesday with two counts of possessing a firearm as a felon after two September incidents during which he showed a gun and threatened police, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia. On both occasions, Davis displayed the loaded firearm, acted erratically, and made threats to individuals, including police and his attorney.
