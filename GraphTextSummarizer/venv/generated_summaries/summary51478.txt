However, the president said U.S. intelligence officials had received information signaling AbdulMutallab might be a terrorism threat but failed to take steps to prevent the man from boarding the flight. The president said information on AbdulMutallab should have sufficed to alert authorities to prevent him from getting on the flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands. "What already is apparent is that there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security," Obama said. AbdulMutallab bought his ticket from Lagos, Nigeria, to Detroit, Michigan, via Amsterdam on the day before the December 17 airstrike, Nigerian officials said. "It's been widely reported that the father of the suspect in the Christmas incident warned U.S. officials in Africa about his son's extremist views," Obama said. But senior Obama administration officials said Tuesday they are starting to see a link to the terrorist group.
