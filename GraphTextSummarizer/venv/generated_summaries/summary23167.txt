-- Chelsea still have work to do if they are to qualify for next season's Champions League after dropping points in a 1-1 draw at Fulham in the English Premier League on Monday night. But from the resulting corner Fulham got their reward as Dempsey's header, which took a slight deflection off Chelsea defender Gary Cahill, found its way past Cech. The west London club's immediate rivals for the final Champions League place experienced mixed fortunes earlier in the day. Everton scored four second-half goals against Sunderland at Goodison Park to consolidate their lead over Merseyside rivals Liverpool who travel to Blackburn on Tuesday. The English midfielder scored his 150th Premier League goal from the penalty spot in the 45th minute after Danny Murphy had brought down Salomon Kalou.
