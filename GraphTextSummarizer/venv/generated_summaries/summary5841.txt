He said Kazemi had seen another woman leave McNair's condo a few days before and was concerned "whether or not her relationship was unraveling with Mr. McNair." -- Former NFL quarterback Steve McNair may have been struggling to fill a void after retiring from football, something most star athletes go through when their careers come to an end Nashville Police Chief Ronal Serpas told reporters that Kazemi's life was spiraling out of control in the final week, believing that McNair had another mistress and that she talked about killing herself. In the end, Serpas said Kazemi decided to kill McNair and herself. "McNair was seated on the sofa and likely was asleep, and we believe that Kazemi shot him in the right temple, then shot him twice in the chest and then shot him a final time in the left temple," Serpas said.
