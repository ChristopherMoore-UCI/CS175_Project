Nearly 53,000 children in China have been sickened by the formula or other products containing melamine. Japan is the latest country to report products tainted with melamine after thousands of Chinese children fell ill. Dozens of countries have banned or recalled Chinese milk products. On Thursday, the European Union joined authorities worldwide in banning the import of Chinese milk products for children. Officials stresses though that there were no reports of anyone becoming ill from consuming the sweets, which were made with ingredients imported from China, according to a representative of Tokyo's Marudai Food.
