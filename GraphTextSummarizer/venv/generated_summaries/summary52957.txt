French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday night put the country's southwest region on the highest possible security alert level, hours after a teacher and three children were gunned down at a Jewish school in Toulouse. Abraham Foxman, national director of the New York-based Anti-Defamation League, said that Jewish people had just as much reason to be vigilant before Monday's attack as after, given some people's anti-Semitism. France, which has one of the largest Jewish populations in Europe, had 389 reported acts of anti-Semitism in 2011, according to Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France, known by the French acronym CRIF. The Interior Ministry has ordered police across the country to contact Jewish organizations to arrange increased vigilance, Brandet said. Representatives from France's Jewish and Muslim communities will meet with the president Tuesday, when a moment of silence is being planned to remember the victims, according to Sarkozy.
