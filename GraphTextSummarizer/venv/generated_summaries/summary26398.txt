With the English seemingly fissuring over how best to tackle racism, former English Premier League striker Vincent Pericard questioned Roberts' boycott and called for a united front in the continued fight against discrimination. It is against this backdrop of abuse, bans and fines that Reading striker Jason Roberts launched his own protest against what he perceives to be a lack of action by anti-racism group Kick It Out. "They are listening to what is being said by different black players and I can guarantee a lot is being doing done at the moment," added Pericard, who retired earlier this year after a playing career which included spells with Juventus and Stoke City. The t-shirt gesture that Roberts is not going to participate in is part of Kick It Out's annual awareness raising drive which is aimed at highlighting the work it has done to rid football of discrimination. " It is rumored other black players may follow Roberts' lead, while Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Aston Villa confirmed their players will wear the t-shirts.
