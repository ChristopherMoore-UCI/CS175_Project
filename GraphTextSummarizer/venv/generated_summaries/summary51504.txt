"I just don't want to be involved in that kind of website anymore," Kevin Bollaert told KFMB. Court documents allege that in December 2012, Bollaert created the website ugotposted.com, which allowed for the posting of sexually explicit photographs of people without their permission. KFMB reported that court documents contained pleas to the website from women who said the postings resulted in nearly around-the-clock harassment from creepy men. -- A California man accused of running a "revenge porn" website told CNN affiliate KFMB that he hasn't done anything criminal, but that he understands why people are upset and is done with the business. "I have gone to the police, I've had a restraining order put in place because of this site, (and) my phone has been going off EVERY 2 MINUTES with strange men sending inappropriate things to me," one woman, who said she was a minor when the photographs were posted, wrote to the website, according to the court documents cited by KFMB.
