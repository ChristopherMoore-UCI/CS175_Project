Williams' remarkable twelve months - a spell where she won the Wimbledon, U.S. Open, French Open and Olympic titles - was finally at an end however and she was quick to praise her opponent. Lisicki will face Kaia Kanepi after the Estonian ended Laura Robson's dream of becoming the first Briton to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 29 years. The 19-year-old was the first British woman to reach the second week at Wimbledon since 1998 but left the court in tears after being beaten 7-6 7-5. Since she missed the 2010 edition through injury, the run starts in 2009 when she beat Svetlana Kuznetsova, a success that has now been followed by defeats of Li Na in 2011, Maria Sharapova the following year and Williams herself on Monday. The seeds just can't stop tumbling out of Wimbledon and on Monday it was the turn of world No.1 and five-time champion Serena Williams to experience that sinking feeling.
