Repeated delays The museum was first conceived in 1999, but bureaucratic issues caused repeated delays, meaning it took 15 years to complete -- five more than the Canal, which opened in 1914 after a decade of construction. It stands at the entrance to the Panama Canal and took longer than the waterway to build, but a brightly colored biodiversity museum designed by architect Frank Gehry has finally celebrated its official opening BioMuseo, a 4,000-square-meter exhibition space and botanical park, has been commissioned to highlight Panama's natural wonders and its role as a geological bridge between two continents. Although its shape is reminiscent of Gehry's earlier works -- which include landmarks such as the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles -- its bold color scheme is a departure. Visitors to BioMuseo will pass through a series of galleries incorporating interactive dioramas, including "Panamarama" -- a three-level, 12-screen projection space intended to create an immersive rainforest experience. With its vivid appearance, BioMuseo has become a familiar sight to ships using the Canal's eastern gateway and to people using the nearby Bridge of Americas that connects to an offshore archipelago.
