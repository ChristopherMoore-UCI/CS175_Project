Over here in China, a tourist tout is trying to sell us North Korean currency. We meet "Chen," a smuggler who makes a midnight run across the Yalu several times a month to trade with North Korean soldiers. North Korean spies We can't use Chen's real name, he claims that Dandong is crawling with North Korean spies. Whole neighborhoods in the back streets of the city are lined with trading shops quietly run by North Korean officials. And as the four-piece all-female North Korean band plays to the Chinese tourists drinking North Korean beer, I think how perfectly it sums up this city: extremely bizarre and perhaps a little tragic.
