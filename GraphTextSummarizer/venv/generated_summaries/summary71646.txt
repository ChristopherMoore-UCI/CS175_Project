" African leaders have urged Ouattara to ensure that Gbagbo and his supporters will not be persecuted if he steps down. The incident came on the same day that talks between Ivory Coast's political rivals and African mediators failed to break the political impasse that has left Gbagbo clinging to power, despite international pressure for him to step down. The Kenyan leader, who visited Abidjan on Monday along with a delegation representing West African states, said Gbagbo agreed to negotiate a peaceful end to the crisis without conditions. President-elect Ouattara has said he will not meet with Gbagbo until Gbagbo acknowledges electoral defeat. But Ouattara will not negotiate until he is recognized as the legitimate president and Gbagbo lifts a siege on the waterfront Golf Hotel, where Ouattara has been holed up since the runoff, Odinga said.
