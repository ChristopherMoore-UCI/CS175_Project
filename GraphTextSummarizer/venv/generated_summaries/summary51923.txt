Following London's September 20-21 showcase, October sees New York follow suit, alongside other destinations such as Lisbon, Dublin, Chicago, Barcelona and Thessaloniki in Greece. Churches, cinemas, theaters, colleges, government buildings and subterranean top secret wartime bunkers are also included. The weekends have proved so successful, they've been adopted by 24 cities around the world, including Melbourne, Buenos Aires and Oslo. This year's big draws in London are expected to be some of its tallest skyscrapers -- among them the gherkin-shaped 30 St. Mary Axe and another giant known as the Cheesegrater. Open House Worldwide scatters its events across the calendar, potentially allowing globetrotting architecture addicts to hit several in the space of a few weeks.
