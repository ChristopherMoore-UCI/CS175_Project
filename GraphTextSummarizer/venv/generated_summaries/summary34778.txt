The pilots of Air France 447 lost contact with air traffic controllers on June 1, 2009, while flying across an area of the Atlantic known for severe turbulence, officials said. It is really going to help us work out what happened on that plane," said Martine Del Bono, spokeswoman for France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA). All 228 people aboard Air France 447 were killed when the Airbus A330 belly-flopped into the ocean June 1, 2009, in stormy weather. They will not bring more bodies up from the ocean if they cannot identify the two they already have, they said Thursday. Recovering more bodies will be a difficult task, with miles of cable required to bring each one up over a period of three hours, they said.
