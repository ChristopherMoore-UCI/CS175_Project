With the assistance of funding from Kim and some investors, "Miami Connection" was filmed in Orlando and Miami. Though it's not always easy to figure out what exactly is going on in "Miami Connection," the story follows members of Dragon Sound as they find themselves mixed up with a group of ninjas linked to the bubbling cocaine trade out of Miami. Originally made in 1987, "Miami Connection" was rediscovered in June 2009 when Zack Carlson, a programmer at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Austin, Texas, came across it on eBay and made a blind bid on it. Moviegoers ate up the bad dialogue, laughed at the bad special effects and staged ninja fights, and reveled in a heavy dose of '80s cheese. It stars Grandmaster Y.K. Kim, a central Florida martial-arts expert, who was pitched the idea of a feature-length film after director Richard Park saw him in the mid-'80s on the South Korean talk show "Meet at 11 p.m." Most of the actors and crew were Kim's tae kwon do students.
