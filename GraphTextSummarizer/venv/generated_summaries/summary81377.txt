-- Amanda Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito took the stand in an Italian court Wednesday, defending himself at a retrial in the 2007 killing of British exchange student Meredith Kercher. The court hearing Wednesday is expected to address new DNA tests of the knife that prosecutors say was used to kill Kercher. According to recent Italian media reports, the tests rule out the possibility that Kercher's DNA is present in the sample. The presiding judge, Alessandro Nencini, read out the details of the case, including the conviction of Ivory Coast citizen Rudy Guede for his role in Kercher's murder. Citing health reasons, Kercher's relatives said in September that they had decided not to return to Italy for the retrial.
