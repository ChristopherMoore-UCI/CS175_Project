-- A crude bomb made from a water bottle was used in an explosion that damaged a Starbucks coffee shop on New York's posh Upper East Side, New York police said. "We believe it to be ... a six- to 10-ounce water bottle that was wrapped in black tape," New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told CNN on Wednesday. New York police say they're aware of both incidents, but Kelly says it is too early to draw any conclusions. Kelly said the witness saw the two approach the Starbucks, then looked away. One is described as blond, wearing a red shirt, and the other had brown hair and wore a gray shirt.
