Gonzalez said Anthony's accusations turned her life upside down and led to death threats against her and her children. Anthony was acquitted July 5 of murder and child neglect charges in her daughter's death. Anthony, 25, is being sued in civil court by a woman named Zenaida Fernandez Gonzalez. The judge handling the defamation lawsuit against Casey Anthony has stepped away from the case, leaving open the question of whether the Orlando woman will have to submit to a formal interview by her accuser's lawyers just days after leaving jail. After the abbreviated morning hearing, Gonzalez attorney Keither Mitnik said there's no reason the deposition should not go on as scheduled.
