"The price of the dollar on the open market today dropped to (between) 28,500 and 29,000 rials, but the price of all foreign currencies, including the dollar, is still fluctuating and only a few transactions took place today," Mohammad Kashtiarai, head of the National Gold and Jewel Association, told the semi-official Mehr News Agency. Demonstrators chanted slogans opposing firebrand President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and decrying the skyrocketing cost of basic goods. Sixteen people were arrested Thursday, a day after police dispersed a crowd at the bazaar, where protesters were blaming President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for the high price of the dollar and goods in general. " The rial's value was cut in half from September of last year through last month, the Congressional Research Service said in a report. But protesters in Tehran blamed Ahmadinejad, chanting slogans against his regime and complaining about high prices.
