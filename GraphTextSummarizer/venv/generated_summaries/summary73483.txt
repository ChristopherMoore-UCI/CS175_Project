-- After shooting several people at the home of his former in-laws, police say Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, still dressed as Santa Claus, sprayed gasoline throughout the home intending to set it on fire. During a search of Pardo's home in Montrose, California, police found five empty boxes for semiautomatic handguns, two high-powered shotguns and a container of "racing fuel." Police said they have not accounted for Pardo's ex-mother-in-law, ex-father-in-law and ex-wife. The home exploded, windows were blown out, and part of Pardo's Santa suit melted onto his skin. Pardo killed nine people, police said.
