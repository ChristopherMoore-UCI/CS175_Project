Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a member of the Russian punk rock collective Pussy Riot, was sent to Mordovia last year for her part in a performance of a "punk prayer" critical of Vladimir Putin -- then the prime minister, now the president -- at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. Maria Alyokhina, another convicted member of Pussy Riot, went on a hunger strike earlier this year, protesting conditions in a different remote prison camp. Bakhmina was convicted of embezzlement and served three years in a Mordovia prison camp. Four days later, she ended the hunger strike, said Pyotr Verzilov, her husband. She had started developing complications because of the length of the hunger strike, Verzilov said.
