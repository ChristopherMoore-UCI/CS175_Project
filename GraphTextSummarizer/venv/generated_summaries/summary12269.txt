School shooting: Shattering the sense of safety 10 ways to put brakes on mass shootings in schools People are sharing their concern and sadness over the Newtown school shooting. Authorities, meanwhile, in Hoboken, New Jersey, were questioning Ryan Lanza, the suspected gunman's older brother, law enforcement sources said, though they did not label him a suspect. Also killed were Dawn Hochsprung, the school's beloved principal, school psychologist Mary Sherlach, Vicki Soto, a first-grade teacher, and substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau. Law enforcement officials have identified the gunman as 20-year-old Adam Lanza. Flags were lowered to half-staff in a number of states, and vigils were held at houses of worship and at schools amid a national outpouring of grief.
