Desperate for a home in 2013, Davion Navar Henry Only dressed up in a suit and borrowed a Bible from the boys home where he lived. His official adoption date is April 22. Then he headed to a St. Petersburg, Florida, church to make a plea for his own adoption. Thousands of calls came into his agency, and a minster's family in Ohio asked him to come live with them. For a year, he went through four more foster homes and wouldn't speak about what happened in Ohio.
