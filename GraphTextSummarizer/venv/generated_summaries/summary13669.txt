Lead writer Rhianna Pratchett said her team wanted to explore Lara Croft's character beyond her physical accomplishments. " Creative director Noah Hughes said the goal was not to recreate the Lara Croft character but to show her at her genesis -- to tell the story of where Lara had come from. "It was important that we showed this more realistic, more human side of Lara," Pratchett said. "She is vulnerable, because she's human and she's in very traumatic and chaotic circumstances in which she has to get her head around and deal with it." Pratchett points to the first time Lara has to kill someone. "Lara is still a bold and strong female character, and just because you show someone in circumstances where they seem more vulnerable, it doesn't make them less of a strong character," Pratchett said.
