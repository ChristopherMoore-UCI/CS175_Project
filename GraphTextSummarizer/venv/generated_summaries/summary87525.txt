-- Rapper T.I.'s furlough from prison was cut short last week because prison officials objected to his manager and a reality TV producer riding with him on a trip to a halfway house, according to a prison document. " Cris Abrego, a reality TV producer who was on the bus, wrote to prison officials that he also believed it was allowed since he "was on the authorized visitor list, and had visited with Mr. Harris a couple of times prior to his release." It was initially believed prison officials objected to his use of a luxury tour bus for the trip from Arkansas to Georgia, but the furlough agreement T.I. signed specified only that he would travel in a "POV," a privately-owned vehicle. "It was clear to me that Mr. Harris believed that I was permitted to be with him on the trip back to Atlanta because I had been authorized to visit him and have contact with during his time in Forrest City," Sher said. The two men whose presence was questioned by prison officials each said they and T.I. believed they were allowed to ride with him since they were on the prison's approved list of visitors.
