NASCAR driver Kurt Busch, who has been accused by his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll of domestic assault, testified in a court hearing Tuesday that he believes Driscoll is a trained assassin and that she once showed up wearing a gown covered in blood. Driscoll has accused Busch of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head into a wall three times while they were in Busch's motor home at Dover International Speedway. In his testimony, Busch said that once when he and Driscoll were in El Paso, Texas, Driscoll went out in camouflage gear, only to return later wearing an evening gown covered with blood and a trench coat. He also said that Driscoll had claimed a character in the movie "Zero Dark Thirty" was based on her and other women. While testifying in court in Dover, Delaware, over Driscoll's request for a no-contact order, Busch said that Driscoll is an assassin for the U.S. government who would go on covert missions around the world.
