"Some people are so keen and quick on the trigger to collect that they will pick up anything." Beach herbs Stoltz guides visitors through the soft forest ground, brimming in spring with wood sorrel and ramson, past the black cheery trees, which Henriksen uses in the castle kitchen for making breads and tea, and down the fields scattered with juniper bushes. " Henriksen and Stoltz sometimes go on their own private foraging sessions where they talk tastes, plants and new ideas. One of its lunchtime favorites is potato salad and house-made ramson sausages sprinkled with wild herbs from the beach and forest. On a recent autumn morning, Henriksen went to the fields to find wild violet flowers ("they taste like Hubba Bubba bubble gum"), which he put together with caramel mousse, thyme and rye bread. When Henriksen was serving grilled breads on a stick -- a Danish children's favorite known as snobrod -- Stoltz suggested he try using branches from a black cherry tree.
