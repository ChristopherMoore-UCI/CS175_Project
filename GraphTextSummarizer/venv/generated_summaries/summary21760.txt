But the New Zealand government prosecutors, acting on behalf of the U.S. authorities, argued that Dotcom's bail request should be denied because he presented an "extreme" flight risk. The U.S. authorities shut down Megaupload last week and announced indictments against seven people connected to the site, accusing them of operating an "international organized criminal enterprise responsible for massive worldwide online piracy of copyrighted works. Despite the charges against him, Dotcom appeared "really calm" in court, said Emma Brannam, a reporter for TV3 New Zealand, who attended the proceedings. -- The founder of the shuttered file-sharing site Megaupload appeared in a New Zealand court Monday, as the U.S. Department of Justice seeks to extradite him and other company officials on criminal charges. The judge at the hearing reserved his decision on the bail request for Dotcom and the other Megaupload officials -- Finn Batato, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk -- until Tuesday or Wednesday.
