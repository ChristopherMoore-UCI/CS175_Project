Making the venture financially sustainable and attractive to potential investors will be vital if BAR want to compete with Oracle, which is funded by U.S. billionaire Larry Ellison. The British government announced Tuesday that it would provide Â£7.5million ($12.8 million) of funding towards supporting the Ben Ainslie Racing team (BAR) and their new state-of-the-art base in the city of Portsmouth on the UK's south coast. Speaking alongside British prime minister David Cameron, Ainslie said he wanted to create a new sailing institution and legacy for the UK. "(This project) will not only build on Portsmouth's global reputation as a center of marine and maritime excellence but will also deliver a real sporting and economic boost to the UK," he said. Ainslie, the most successful Olympic sailor of all time and winner of the America's Cup in 2013 with Oracle Team USA, now hopes to change all that with his own organization when the prestigious event is next held in 2017.
