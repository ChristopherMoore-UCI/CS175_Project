The men were convicted on conspiracy charges related to at least three large trans-Atlantic shipments of cocaine that were to transit through Liberia, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in New York. Federal prosecutors say Konstantin Yaroshenko, 42, and Chigbo Peter Umeh, 43, were arrested in Liberia in May after trying to bribe high-level Liberian government officials -- including the son of President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf -- in an effort to safeguard the route they used to bring Colombian cocaine to market. The two men are scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. federal court in New York on July 28. Umeh, who prosecutors said served as a broker between suppliers in South America and distributors in West Africa, faces a minimum of 20 years in federal prison. Yaroshenko, a pilot who -- according to the U.S. Justice Department -- transported thousand-kilogram quantities of cocaine through South America, Africa, and Europe, will face a minimum term of 10 years in federal prison.
