-- Duke men's basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, affectionately known by fans and players as "Coach K," surpassed the all-time record for wins in men's major college basketball with a victory Tuesday night against Michigan State at New York's Madison Square Garden. His career, including 32 years at Duke, has encompassed some of the most memorable moments in basketball, including beating the dominant UNLV Runnin' Rebels on the way to his first NCAA national championship in 1991 and leading the 2008 "Redeem Team" to an Olympic Gold medal in Beijing. Anna Levina, a Duke graduate who joined other alumni at the game, said, "We were sitting with a lot of fans who were rooting for Michigan State...and when we won, they just stopped talking." Duke beat Michigan State 74-69. " Admiration for Krzyzewski extends beyond sportswriters and critics to include students and worldwide fans of the team.
