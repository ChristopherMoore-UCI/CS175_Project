-- A mother died trying to protect her daughter when a tornado hit her home, a Louisiana mayor said, one of at least two twisters tied to a weather system that's caused major damage in the state and wreaked havoc on Mardi Gras festivities. There were also flood warnings in effect for the Atchafalaya River at Morgan City, Louisiana, through Sunday afternoon; The National Weather Service confirmed that tornadoes hit that city, about 80 miles west of Baton Rouge, and the nearby city of Crowley on Saturday morning. Other parade-related festivities were pushed up to start earlier Saturday, given the rain-soaked forecast for Saturday afternoon and beyond. About 150 miles to the east, meanwhile, revelers and residents of New Orleans were soaked much of Saturday as steady rains fell on the city.
