Many inspectors have a background in science, but their ranks are also made up of logistics experts, weapons experts who identify munitions that may have been used to deploy chemical weapons, and health and safety experts to make sure the teams do not get overexposed to potentially dangerous chemicals. This hostile environment training course, conducted by the German army, is teaching OPCW inspectors to identify dangerous situations and to avoid getting kidnapped, but also to help if they witness violent events -- knowledge that may be indispensable in war-torn Syria. OPCW inspectors have been tasked with cataloguing and monitoring the destruction of all of Syria's chemical weapons. The OPCW, which has been on the ground in Syria since October 1, was awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize. A team of international investigators is exploring a site for chemical weapons when a sudden explosion rips through the air, scattering the workers and terrified civilians, who make a frantic run for cover in the ensuing chaos.
