Zero to Three, a nonprofit early childhood organization, argues that harm could be reduced if parents made screen-time "a shared experience," and if children still had lots of time to play in the "real, 3-D world." Similarly, the Harvard Family Research Project has argued that "young children may benefit from computer use" if the software is sufficiently interactive and "empowering." Lawmakers in the island have outlawed iPads and other electronic gadgets for children under the age of two, and demanded that those under the age of 18 do not use digital media for "a period of time that is not reasonable. As one study put it, "the immediate practical advantages and believed educational benefits of entertaining children with screen media often override the long-term harm that many [parents] feel does not apply." " "A child's brain develops rapidly during these first years, and young children learn best by interacting with people, not screens," it says. It is worth noting, for instance, that even the Harvard study emphasizes that "excessive screen time harms healthy growth and development, regardless of content".
