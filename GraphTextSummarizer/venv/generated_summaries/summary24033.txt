A bill allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt was passed earlier this year by the French parliament and signed into law by President Francois Hollande. -- France's top court ruled Friday that French mayors cannot refuse to officiate same-sex marriages based on their personal, moral or religious beliefs. A bill to allow same-sex marriage in England and Wales is also now law, though it isn't expected to come into force until 2014. Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa are the non-European countries in the group, according to the Pew Research Center. A growing number of countries around the world now allow same-sex marriage, the majority of them in Europe.
