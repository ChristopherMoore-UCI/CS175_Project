"We realize that this is a nontraditional setting, but this program is about normalizing HIV and extending testing opportunities," said Angela Fulwood Wood, chief operations officer for nonprofit Family and Medical Counseling Service. Test takers will get $15 to go toward DMV costs, but Wood emphasizes that knowing one's status is the primary incentive. "We want to stress this project is about education as it is about testing." Wood said those who opt not to find out their status at the DMV office will get information on other free sites to get tested. The test will be confidential, just like other HIV tests offered elsewhere, Wood said. The nonprofit will offer testing and counseling, and help those who test positive get medical help through a provider of their choice, said Dr. Pierre Vigilance, director of the D.C. Department of Health.
