Rowell has won the hearts of Goodreads users before -- her young adult novel "Eleanor & Park" was the 2013 pick for best young adult book -- but that didn't make this year's win any less sweet. As for the top young adult book this year, Goodreads users elected E. Lockhart's "We Were Liars" as the best read. In fiction, the best book for Goodreads users was Rainbow Rowell's "Landline." This year, Goodreads, the website devoted to pairing up eager readers with books they'll love, asked its users to vote for the books they thought were irresistible in 2014. In the nonfiction category, Marina Keegan's "The Opposite of Loneliness" was chosen by Goodreads' users as the best of the year, an honor that was awarded posthumously.
