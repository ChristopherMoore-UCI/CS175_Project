The kids went to Czech schools and then to international schools. I am also a brain cancer survivor and an activist for brain cancer research and patient care. Brain cancer patients need new, better treatments, and for that, we need more research. During this time, as I split my time between homes in London, England, and New York City,  I did several 10K races, indoor rowing competitions, and the UK Three Peaks Challenge. The project consists of me and my trainer and friend Gundula cycling from San Francisco, California, across America to Washington, D.C.
