The video showed two males in Rangers jerseys being punched and kicked by three males wearing Flyers jerseys. The assault left Neal Auricchio, an off-duty Woodbridge, New Jersey, police officer and Iraq war veteran, unconscious and requiring stitches. The district attorney's office will appeal the bail amount in court next week and seek an increase, according to spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson. Veteri turned himself in after an arrest warrant was issued and was arraigned shortly after 2 a.m., according to Philadelphia police. Dennis Veteri, of Glassboro, New Jersey, is charged with aggravated and simple assault, conspiracy and recklessly endangering another person, according to the Philadelphia district attorney's office.
