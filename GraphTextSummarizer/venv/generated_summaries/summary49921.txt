Kenneth L. Wainstein, a 19-year veteran of the U.S. Justice Department, will have access to "new information that may become available," UNC system President Tom Ross and UNC-Chapel Hill Chancellor Carol L. Folt said in a joint announcement Friday. The prosecutor has been investigating UNC's Department of African and Afro-American Studies -- the department where fake classes were uncovered. "We have directed Mr. Wainstein to ask the tough questions," Folt said. " The UNC statement said Wainstein's finding will be made public. "Based on information that the district attorney is able to offer, Wainstein will take any further steps necessary to address any questions left unanswered during previous reviews commissioned by the university," the UNC press release said.
