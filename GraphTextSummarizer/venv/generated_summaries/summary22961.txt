A senior Iranian naval official said Iran is sending warships toward U.S. maritime borders to send a message -- a move a U.S. defense official characterized as an announcement, not a deployment. "Iran's military fleet is approaching the United States' maritime borders, and this move has a message," Adm. Afshin Rezayee Haddad said, the semiofficial Fars news agency reported Saturday. "Announcement not deployment" It's not the first time Iran has made such a threat, a U.S. defense official said. "They do send some ships from time to time to the Gulf of Aden for unilateral counter piracy operations. In 2011, Iran twice announced plans to send ships toward the U.S. maritime borders.
