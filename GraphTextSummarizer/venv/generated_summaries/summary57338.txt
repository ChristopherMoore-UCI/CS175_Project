Saiqa Akhter, 30, now faces two charges of capital murder of a child under 5 in the deaths of her 2-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son, Dallas County district attorney spokeswoman Jamille Bradfield said. Police and paramedics tried to resuscitate the children, but Zain Akhter died at the hospital Monday, and his younger sister, Faryaal Akhter, died at the hospital Tuesday evening, according to authorities. A woman who identified herself as Akhter called police Monday evening and said she first tried to kill her children with bathroom cleaner, but they would not drink it. She asks why she killed her children, and the woman says she wanted normal children. According to the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, the Akhter family had a referral in 2009 for "neglectful supervision."
