Hutchinson, 32, is among dozens of active-duty U.S. troops and veterans who have asked for help through USAtogether.org, which listed their stories and specific needs online. Requests can be filled quickly, so the organization is looking for more service members and their families to list their needs, Mahler said. Dave Mahler spent his entire career in technology and decided to apply his know-how to help veterans. Mahler said he was ready to sweep the halls or read to a veteran but envisioned something with more leverage. The assistance is meant to be a short-term safety net, so service members with recurring financial problems are referred to the many other groups that help veterans.
