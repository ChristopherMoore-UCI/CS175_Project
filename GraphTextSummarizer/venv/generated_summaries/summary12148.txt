On Tuesday, 17-time NBA finals champions the Celtics defeated the much hyped up Heat and their star signings LeBron James, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh in the most watched regular season basketball game of all-time. Boston coach Doc Rivers was congratulated by Cleveland fans for having overcome the Heat, but his side then received no mercy from the Cavaliers. "`We took them a little bit too lightly,'' Shaquille O'Neal, who spent last season with Cleveland, admitted to the NBA website. "JJ was unbelievable today," James told the NBA website while Wade added: "Give it up for JJ, really stepping up." But it was another James, James Jones, who really stood out for the Heat, finishing with 20 points on nine attempts and receiving praise from his star teammates.
