The 33-year-old was replaced by Ignazio Abate 28 minutes into the 1-1 draw at the San Siro last Wednesday, which left Milan two points behind group leaders Real Madrid ahead of the final match away to Swiss side Zurich on December 8. Giuseppe Biava had a header tipped onto the crossbar by Samp goalkeeper Luca Castellazzi, but he was then sent off just before halftime after receiving a second yellow card for deliberate handball. In Saturday's other game, top scorer Antonio Di Natale returned from suspension to inspire Udinese to a 2-0 win at home to struggling Livorno. He curled in a 29th-minute freekick before Antonio Floro Flores made it 2-0 with a header from Aleksander Lukovic's cross 10 minutes later, lifting Udinese up to 12th and leaving Livorno in the bottom three. Marco Rossi doubled the lead in the 53rd minute, passing the ball through Castellazzi's legs after evading the hapless Ziegler, who gave away his second penalty of the night in the 75th minute for a foul on Sokratis Papastathopoulos.
