Widespread strikes and demonstrations occurred Monday around the country, with thousands of state workers from various ministries demonstrating for better pay and better work conditions, witnesses told CNN. A group of police officers joined demonstrators Monday, a sharp contrast to the clashes between police and protesters during the early days of the uprising. For the third day in a row, clashes broke out Monday between pro- and anti-government demonstrators in Yemen's capital of Sanaa. Though efforts are on track to "realize the legitimate demands of the people for a true democratic environment," widespread strikes and demonstrations continued Monday in certain state sectors, "even though normality has been restored," the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said in a statement. It cited "negative consequences" of continued unrest, including harming national security, adversely affecting the state's ability to get necessary goods to the public, disrupting production and operations, delaying the nation's return to "day-to-day life," adversely affecting the economy and "creating an atmosphere that gives the opportunity to irresponsible persons to commit illegitimate acts.
