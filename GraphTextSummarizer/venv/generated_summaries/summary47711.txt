The man closest to Tiger Woods when he plays golf says he had no idea about the extramarital affairs that have sidelined Woods from the game. With Woods not playing, Williams is spending more time with his personal passion: speedway racing in New Zealand. "But I'm 100 percent telling you, I knew nothing, and that's that." Williams' wife, Kirsty, defended her husband, insisting he would not have been able to keep the secret from her or Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren. In his February 19 statement, Woods left open the possibility of returning to professional golf this year. " Woods, 34, apologized last month in a tightly controlled televised statement for his "irresponsible and selfish" behavior, which he said included infidelity.
