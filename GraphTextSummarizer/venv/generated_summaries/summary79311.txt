On social media, many African-American users have used the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, to share their stories about "the talk. At Howard University, students at a back-to-school housing meeting posted a photograph in which hundreds stood in the "hands up" position, which witnesses say Brown had done to show he was unarmed before he was shot.

In a related viral trend this week, students and other social media users -- many of them black -- shared images of themselves with their hands up in the air.
