Dunhill week wouldn't be complete without curry night in the great company of Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Henman, Sir Steve Redgrave and Sean Fitzgerald, to name a few -- wonderfully organized as always by Netjets supremo Rob Hersov and the lovely Claire -- thanks guys. Mr Qool (Samuel L. Jackson), who had enjoyed all the compliments wearing his Q'aja's at the Bob Hope earlier in the year, asked us to design something appropriate for the first day of Dunhill this year. He also went to Munich to see the new technology that will revolutionize golf fashion and looks at a golfer's susceptibility to harmful UV rays. With the great Scottish culture and weather (rumor has it that it rains there) in mind, I put together a cream and black, bold tartan trouser with the Q factor of cream trims worn with a silk black polo and a cream angora jumper. -- Fashion designer to some of golf's big names, Tony "The Tailor" Q'aja, was hanging out with the stars at the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St Andrews in October.
