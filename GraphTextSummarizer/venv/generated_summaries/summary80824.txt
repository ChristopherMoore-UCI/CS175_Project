-- A report detailing the CIA's controversial interrogation and detention program after the 9/11 terror attacks will be delayed over the issue of redactions, Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein said Tuesday. The report's creation has been highly controversial, with the CIA director apologizing and admitting the agency spied on computers used by Senate Intelligence Committee staffers who prepared the extensive report. 'Shocking' report on CIA interrogation closer to public release CNN's Dana Bash and Evan Perez contributed to this report. Senators on the committee have indicated the report is critical of the CIA's treatment of terrorism suspects, saying it amounted to torture, something CIA officials have denied. I believe the best way to accomplish that is to make public our thorough documentary history of the CIA's program.
