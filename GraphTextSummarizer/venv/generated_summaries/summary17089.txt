-- Prosecutors fighting to keep American student Amanda Knox behind bars for murder in Italy defended on Monday the DNA tests that linked her to the killing of British student Meredith Kercher. Maresca said Monday that Kercher's family has faith "in the whole baggage of evidence" aside from evaluation of the DNA on the knife and bra clasp. DNA on Kercher's bra was also traced to Sollecito. Vecchiotti testified that the knife tested negative for blood and the amount of DNA said to be Kercher's was so low, it could not be examined again with any conclusions. Stefanoni said according to the protocol she used, the amount of DNA on the knife was sufficient and clearly attributable to Kercher.
