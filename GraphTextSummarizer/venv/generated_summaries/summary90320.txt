While Iraqi officials say the victims were innocent bystanders -- most of them civilians -- Blackwater says its contractors were part of a U.S. State Department security entourage that came under fire in a Baghdad square. The objective is to recommend ways to ensure that private security details do not endanger public safety, the statement said, adding that Jassim and Butenis "agreed to continue their coordination and to complete the process of inquiry in order to prevent the recurrence of any incidents in the future." The September 16 shootout has sparked intense Iraqi and U.S. criticism of private military contractors. However, an order from the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority appears to shield security contractors from Iraqi laws. The pair "expressed the mutual commitment of the Iraqi government and the U.S. government to work together to evaluate issues of safety and security related to personal security detail operations in Iraq," the statement said. Iraqi officials said Blackwater bodyguards indiscriminately opened fire in Nusoor Square, killing civilians and a traffic police officer.
