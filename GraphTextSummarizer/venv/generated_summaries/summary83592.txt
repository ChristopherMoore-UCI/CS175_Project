The incident occurred earlier in the day when a team from the Coast Guard patrol vessel Monomoy was dispatched in a smaller boat "to query the Iranian dhow" in international waters, the Navy said in a statement. The Navy statement said the dhow crew did not respond when fired upon and left the scene without communicating with the Monomoy.

Earlier, the Monomoy had established communication with the dhow and determined that it was an Iranian-flagged vessel, the Navy said, adding that it subsequently refused to communicate further.
