Hundreds of students came together Tuesday night to remember Hipps at a candlelight vigil on Bowman Field at Clemson, according to CNN affiliate WLTX. Student responds to university's decision Tanner Parsons, a freshman at Clemson, says he met Hipps briefly at a fraternity pledge event this year. " "It is especially prudent to suspend fraternity activities given the tragic death of Tucker Hipps," she said. " An autopsy revealed the teen likely fell, according to CNN affiliate WHNS. It's kind of sobering to think how fast something can happen," said Parsons, who first shared his story on CNN iReport.
