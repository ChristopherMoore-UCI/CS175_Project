Clark could have been arrested Wednesday if he had declined to provide DNA samples and allow police to search his home, but he was released after complying, New Haven city spokeswoman Jessica Mayorga said. Bond for Clark has been set at $3 million, New Haven Police Chief James Lewis said. Watch police discuss the investigation Â» Lewis earlier said police had reviewed about 700 hours of video and interviewed more than 150 people, some more than once. Clark answered police questions for a while but later retained an attorney and stopped, Lewis said. Lewis said Clark and Le worked in the same building and passed in the hallway, but he refused to comment further on whether they knew each other.
