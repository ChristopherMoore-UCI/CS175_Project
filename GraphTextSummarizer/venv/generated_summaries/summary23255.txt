About 60 to 70 inmates were involved in the disturbance at California State Prison-Sacramento, said Lt. Tony Quinn, a penitentiary spokesman. It's next door to the Folsom State Prison made famous by singer Johnny Cash, and it was designated New Folsom Prison until 1992. -- Guards at the California state prison known as "New Folsom" put down a brief riot Wednesday that left 13 inmates hospitalized, including one shot by a correctional officer, prison officials said. No staff members were injured, and Quinn said order was restored within 10 minutes. Eight of those taken to the hospital had stab wounds, while a guard shot one inmate in the "hip or flank area," Quinn said.
