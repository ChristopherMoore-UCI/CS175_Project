That law established the tribunal system used to try terror suspects held at Guantanamo, outside the civilian federal trial courts. Military convictions of two terror suspects will get a full federal appeals court review, testing whether the men could be charged with offenses that were not in place when Congress passed a 2006 anti-terror law. The law also sought to limit federal court jurisdiction to hear habeas corpus challenges to detention, but judges have consistently said they do have the power to be involved. Ever since the 9/11 attacks, federal courts have been asked to determine if detainees had the right to contest their imprisonment and the rules set up to try them. Both defendants were charged with providing material support to terrorism and conspiracy for al-Qaeda, around the time of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, offenses that were not included as crimes before the Military Commissions Act went into effect several years later.
