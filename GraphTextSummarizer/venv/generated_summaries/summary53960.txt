" "Ms. Neal took great joy in meeting patients and their caregivers every time she visited Knoxville," said a statement from the Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center where the Neal rehabilitation center is located. "The theatre and movie world has lost a great talent but, at the Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center, we have also lost a friend," said a statement from the Knoxville, Tennessee, center that bears the actress' name and assists people in recovering from strokes and brain injuries. -- Academy-Award winning actress Patricia Neal, whose off-screen life was one of dramatic triumph over adversity, died Sunday at her home in Edgartown, Massachusetts. Concerns over Neal's health and her ability to handle the difficulties of a weekly television series led the producers to offer the role to Michael Learned when the show when into production. Neal suffered several strokes and kept acting.
