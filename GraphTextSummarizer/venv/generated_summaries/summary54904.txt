(More about Asma al-Assad) The younger brotherMaher al-Assad Maher al-Assad is Bashar's youngest brother and considered by many to be the second most powerful man in Syria. In the past year, as pressure on the regime increased, al-Assad's inner circle has become more of a family affair, said David Lesch, a professor of Middle East history and author of "The New Lion of Damascus: Bashar al-Assad and Modern Syria." Upon news of his brother's death, Bashar was brought back to Damascus to undergo military training to eventually take his brother's place as successor to their father's role as president. He oversees two of the Syrian army's strongest units: the Republican Guard, which protects the regime in Damascus, and the elite Fourth Armored Division, which suppressed the early uprisings in the southern part of Syria. He is said to be one of Bashar's close allies, although there are reports that he was demoted after Hezbollah military commander Imad Mugniyeh was assassinated in Damascus in 2008.
