" Williams, an African-American comedian known more for his erratic behavior than his jokes in recent months, said that he can't be anti-Mexican because many of them are his fans. -- Comedian Katt Williams on Saturday partly walked back an apology for making insensitive remarks to a Mexican member of his audience, telling CNN that he is not sorry for what he said, but apologizes to anyone who thought he was being hateful. Maupin had accepted the written apology and called on the comedian to return to Arizona to show his commitment to the Latino community, much like comedian Tracy Morgan's return to Nashville, Tennessee, this summer to personally apologize for anti-gay remarks in a stand-up show there. Williams singled out a man seated near the stage and asked him if he was Mexican. But Williams told CNN that as a comic, he cannot apologize for his uncensored thoughts during a show.
