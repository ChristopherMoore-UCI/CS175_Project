Funds are used to help newcomers to travel to Seattle for a two-week intensive crash course in superhero crime fighting. In spite of being shot at and stabbed twice, Jones insists that Seattle heroes don't deliberately try to get involved in trouble. -- As the sun sets over Seattle, Phoenix Jones straps on his bodysuit and pulls a black and yellow mask over his face. "Purple is a color which is very often used in domestic abuse awareness campaigns, and reign comes from the fact that I now reign over my own life," she said.
