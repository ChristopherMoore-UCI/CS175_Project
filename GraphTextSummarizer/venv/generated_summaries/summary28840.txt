Haleigh Cummings has been missing since 3 a.m. Tuesday, when her father's girlfriend called 911 to say the child had vanished from her Putnam County home. On Monday night, Ronald Cummings' girlfriend, 17-year-old Misty Croslin, was watching Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother, police said. The brick was actually holding open the door to the trailer, Putnam County Sheriff's Office Lt. Johnny Greenwood told CNN. Haleigh Cummings, 5, went missing Monday night from her home near Orlando, police said. Though that number may sound high, it includes both Putnam and Palatka counties, which are separated by the St. Johns River, the law enforcement spokesman told CNN.
