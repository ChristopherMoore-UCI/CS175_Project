Solar eclipses were shrouded in superstition in ancient times -- in China, for example, viewing total solar eclipses was important for divining the future success of an emperor. The total solar eclipse became visible in the far north of Australia about an hour after sunrise local time on November 14 (afternoon of November 13 in the United States and evening of November 13 in Europe). Eclipse Chasers, a website devoted to solar eclipses, has several pointers for photographers. That means when viewing any partial phase of a total eclipse, you need to wear proper solar eclipse glasses. -- A total solar eclipse occurred over the northeastern Australian coast early in the morning of November 14 local time.
