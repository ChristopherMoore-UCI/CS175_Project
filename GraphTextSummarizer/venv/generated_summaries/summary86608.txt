The reason for the policy, according to Air Force officials, is that the demands of deployment and military service put strain on family life and even more so for single parents. Edmonds, her family and her attorney claim that the Air Force is encouraging its members to give up their children, through either adoption or abortion, a position they say was revealed in a comment from an Air Force colonel. Edmonds' mother said she believes the policy discriminates against single women and encourages pregnant single women to abort their pregnancies. That was before she says she learned the Air Force forbid single parents from enlisting. "The Air Force is making an assumption that single parents cannot provide adequately for their children if deployed," Edmonds' mother said.
