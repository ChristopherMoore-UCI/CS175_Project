Other important appeals that may yet be added cover such issues as same-sex marriage, affirmative action, abortion rights and further litigation over President Obama's health care reform law. THE CASE: Anthony Elonis was convicted in federal court for threatening language in Facebook posts aimed at his estranged wife, judges and law enforcement. Other states have adopted similar laws, and lower courts have issued conflicting rulings. But many states say that the voters -- not the courts -- should decide such matters and that traditional marriage encourages opposite-sex couples to raise children in a stable family unit. Or they could leave the current patchwork of state laws in place, allowing state legislatures to sort it all out, for now.
