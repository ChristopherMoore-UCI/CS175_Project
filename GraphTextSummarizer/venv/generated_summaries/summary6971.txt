" In early October, the Consumer Electronics Association announced support for an FAA committee recommendation that passengers generally be allowed to use typical lightweight electronic devices at all altitudes of flight on airplanes hardened against radio interference. About 69% of passengers traveling with an e-device reported using their devices on a flight, and almost one-third of passengers admitted to accidentally leaving one on in flight, according to a 2013 CEA/Airline Passenger Experience Association study. Development of crew training and passenger messaging is also needed to ensure passengers pay attention to safety messages from flight attendants, the union said. Some fliers admit leaving devices on in flight The periods of flight in question are fairly short. It's no surprise that advocates for the travel and electronics industries cheered the easing of the restrictions on devices during flight.
