Screeds seized at the 2011 raid in which Osama bin Laden was killed outlined plans to unleash terror attacks in the U.S. heartland -- with hopes of pressuring "300 million Americans" to demand an end to what al Qaeda called the "unjust wars" against the Muslim world. In a Brooklyn, New York, courtroom, a federal jury this week was the first to hear the contents of the letter and other documents seized during the bin Laden raid in Pakistan. The al Qaeda papers released in the Naseer trial were found in the walled and fortified compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where Osama bin Laden was killed in 2011 by a group of U.S. forces, including Navy SEALs. A document included an oath of loyalty that al Qaeda recruits swore to bin Laden. They were penned by senior al Qaeda operatives, according to prosecutors.
