Israeli police spokesman Mickey Rosenfeld called it an apparent "intentioned event" and terror attack. A Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem on Wednesday, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. "Baby dies of injuries in hospital after this evening's terror attack in Jerusalem," the tweet reads. Rosenfeld said in a tweet that the driver was an Arab resident of Silwan who had served time in an Israeli prison. CNN's Erin McLaughlin reported from Jerusalem, and Chandrika Narayan reported and wrote from Atlanta.
