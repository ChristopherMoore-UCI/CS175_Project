North Carolina Gov. Mike Easley, a superdelegate, endorsed Clinton on Tuesday. -- Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain are pushing for a gas-tax holiday, but Sen. Barack Obama says the plan is a quick fix that would do more harm than good. Obama also is in North Carolina, where he has town hall-style meetings scheduled Tuesday in Winston-Salem and Hickory. Sen. Hillary Clinton campaigns this week in Wilmington, North Carolina. Analysts and Obama said the proposal to suspend the tax temporarily would do little to stimulate the economy or lower gas prices and could leave roads in disrepair.
