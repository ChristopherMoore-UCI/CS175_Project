Further, the current indefinite detention of children in Nauru places Australia in violation of its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Operation Sovereign Borders targets asylum seekers who come to Australia by boat, in violation of Australia's obligation under the Refugee Convention to refrain from punishing refugees for their mode of arrival in a country. If an intercepted boat is unseaworthy, Australia may transfer asylum seekers to lifeboats, with limited provisions, and release them close to Indonesian waters. By failing to determine the suitability of detention for each individual detainee and exposing asylum seekers to unacceptable conditions, Australia is arbitrarily detaining asylum seekers and subjecting them to "cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and punishment," according to Amnesty International. Asylum seekers are transferred to the Pacific island nations of Nauru and PNG's Manus Island for detention and processing within 48 hours of arriving in Australian territory. Disingenuously, Australia has attempted to argue that it only plays a support role in the facilities and has no responsibility for asylum seekers in these detention centers because Nauru and PNG are sovereign nations.
