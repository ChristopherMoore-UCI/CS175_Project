-- Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg will start the Brazilian Grand Prix in pole position after a breathtaking final qualifying session at Interlagos. Rosberg narrowly beat teammate and rival Lewis Hamilton in to second place on the grid after both drivers broke course records. Neither driver can win the championship in Brazil but if Hamilton wins, and Rosberg fails to finish, double points means that the German could still steal the title from Hamilton despite being 49 points behind. The former friends have locked horns, and clashed wheels, at a series of races, from Bahrain to Germany to Hungary to Belgium. The season has, in many ways, been defined by the bitter rivalry between, and dominance of, Rosberg and Hamilton.
