-- The son of a Florida couple known for adopting special-needs children was in his parents' room when they were slain in a home invasion last month, according to documents released by prosecutors. "There is nobody that I know in Pensacola that would want to see Bud Billings killed," Tice told WEAR, using Billings' nickname. The state attorney's office said last month it was focusing on the robbery, but was willing to consider other motives. Seven males are charged with first-degree murder and home invasion robbery. Two of the other suspects told authorities he was the lone gunman, according to court documents.
