In the last 12 years, Taylor's organization, WriteGirl, has helped around 500 girls graduate high school and go on to college. "Some of our girls face the greatest challenges teens could ever face: violence at home, violence in their community, huge schools with security guards in the parking lot and in the lunchroom," said Taylor, 50. This, Taylor says, gives them the confidence to speak up and reach out for help in school, in their relationships and at home. Taylor has directed the production of more than two dozen collections of works by teenage girls and their mentors. CNN Heroes Taylor expects all 60 of the seniors in the core program to enroll in college next year.
