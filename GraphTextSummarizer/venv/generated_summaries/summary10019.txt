Southern Florida has become the capital of Latin America, as wealthy families have realized it is the most stable nearby place to put their money and families. The I-4 corridor, from the Space Coast to Orlando to Tampa/St. Pete, is largely made up of young families -- some native to Florida, but many others Midwest transplants looking for a new start. But in the 1980s, young families began to move into Florida en masse, following economic opportunity and now-ubiquitous air-conditioning. And two Florida cities, Gainesville and Tallahassee, are among the top 10 youngest cities in America, with median ages of 24 and 26 respectively. Interestingly, despite Mitt Romney's attacks on fellow Republican candidates who support comprehensive immigration reform and the Dream Act, polls show that he is doing surprisingly well with the Hispanic vote this time around.
