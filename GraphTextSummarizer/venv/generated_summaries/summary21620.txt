-- Comedic actor Chris Kattan was charged with driving under the influence after his car slammed into a highway construction truck on a Los Angeles freeway early Monday, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. Kattan, 43, suffered a bloody nose in the crash, but no workers were in the truck, Officer Leland Tang said. The former "Saturday Night Live" cast member failed field sobriety tests and was taken to the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys precinct to be booked on the DUI charge, he said. Kattan posted a message to fans on his Twitter account Monday afternoon: "Those concerned or just adding gossip: I'm fine, passed all tests, released without bail, have drivers license, cop offered to drive me home" CNN's Henry Hanks contributed to this report. "It could have been a lot worse," Tang said.
