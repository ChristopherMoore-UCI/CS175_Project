President Obama and the first lady also attended that fundraiser dinner, but foundation spokesman Lance Jones emphasized that "at no time did Mr. and Mrs. Salahi have access to President Obama and Mrs. Obama. " Yet White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday the Salahis were not on an invitation list of guests. Tareq Salahi said Tuesday he and his wife "did not party-crash" a White House state dinner last week. "At that time, I went to grab a few security personnel, who were not Secret Service," Jones said. "I did not state at any time, or imply that I had tickets for ANY portion of the evening's events," Jones said in a prepared statement released by a White House official.
