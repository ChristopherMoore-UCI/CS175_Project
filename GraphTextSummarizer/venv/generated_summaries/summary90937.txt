Hollande urgently needs to reset his Presidency - and there are a few clear rules to do so: He needs to take on the banks where necessary, take on the benefits system, the impediments to innovation and to setting up new businesses, take on the appalling situation of France's forgotten inner city misery; his need not be a hard-nosed liberal agenda. The second problem is that he lacks the political will to break the log-jams in French society: Making industry more competitive, reducing government spending. In fact, the New Year's Eve wishes everyone in France did believe were the Churchillian tones of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Use the referendum like de Gaulle did between 1958 and 1962, as a major political weapon to break the deadlocks in French political society. And not only does he need to address the structural issues in France's economy and society, but he made the mistake of telling everyone he could solve the country's problems painlessly, or by taxing the super-rich, and he is not managing to do that either, so he is just taxing everyone else.
