Kim Kardashian's 20-carat diamond engagement ring, a remnant of her 72-day marriage to NBA basketball player Kris Humphries, was auctioned Tuesday in New York by Christie's for $749,000, US Weekly reported. Humphries, an NBA forward, accused Kardashian of fraud by entering the marriage only to make millions of dollars with their wedding, Humphries' lawyer, Marshall Waller, told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge. The ring "far exceed the presale estimate" of $300,000 to $500,000, said Gabriel Ford, a spokesman for Christie's. The couple's divorce was finalized in June just days before she gave birth to a girl fathered by rapper Kanye West. It did not reveal whether it was the ring that Humphries gave Kardashian.
