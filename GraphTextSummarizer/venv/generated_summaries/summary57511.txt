Espinoza said he was never worried about whether California Chrome would be able to wear a nasal strip, as he has in his past six races, all wins. -- A dozen years ago, jockey Victor Espinoza went into the Belmont Stakes on War Emblem with a chance to win one of sports' great titles, the Triple Crown. "I am ready for it this time, and I am prepared to get it done," he said Tuesday at Santa Anita Park in California, adding that being in the situation before was a big help. Stewards in New York voted Tuesday to change the state's policy toward nasal strips on thoroughbreds. Espinoza, who has been riding professionally since 1993, told CNN that he is excited to get a second chance for greatness on June 7 on California Chrome.
