I recently heard a promo with a player saying, "51 weeks a year, No. 17 at TPC Sawgrass is the easiest hole in the world for Tour players." TPC Sawgrass is a very special place being that it's the home of the Players and PGA Tour. Borocz: In the 36-year history of the Players, 10 of the victories have been by international players. Before the tournament tees off, we had a chance to catch up with TPC Sawgrass PGA Head Professional Matt Borocz, who provided some inside insight on the home of the PGA Tour. Is there any truth to what that Tour player said?
