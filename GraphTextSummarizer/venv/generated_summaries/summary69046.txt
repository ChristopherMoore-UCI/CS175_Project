Well, there's no way to say for sure, but things are certainly looking grim in this photo of a rough-looking Mark Sloane, tweeted by Patrick Dempsey. We know Eric Dane is on his way out of Grey's Anatomy, but could McSteamy be joining Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) in that big hospital in the sky? For the record, Shonda Rhimes told EW earlier this week that viewers should assume nothing about Mark's fate in light of Dane's exit. (It was later taken down at ABC's request, per Dempsey.) Will Mark be in a coma?
