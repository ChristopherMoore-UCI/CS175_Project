-- An Indian court has handed down death sentences to 11 people for their role in the 2002 burning of a train carrying Hindu activists in the western state of Gujarat. Twenty other people convicted of the same arson attack were sentenced to life in prison, public prosecutor J.M. Panchal said Tuesday. Death-row prisoners in India can file appeals in the Supreme Court in New Delhi if their petitions are turned down by lower courts. It's always appealable," he said, referring to the rights of the convicts to challenge the sentencing in higher courts. A suspected Muslim mob attacked the Sabarmati Express near the town of Godhra on 27 February, 2002, killing more than 50 people, most of whom were Hindu pilgrims.
