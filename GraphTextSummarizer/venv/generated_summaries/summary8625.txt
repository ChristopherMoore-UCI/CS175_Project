-- Two of the dozens of bush fires burning out of control in the eastern Australian state of New South Wales were sparked by power lines that had been buffeted by strong winds, fire officials said Saturday, citing preliminary investigations. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell warned Thursday that hundreds of homes could be destroyed. A huge blaze near Lithgow, New South Wales, started on October 16, when officials "were conducting an explosive ordnance training activity," the Australian Department of Defense said. Fires sent plumes of smoke into the air. Fire investigators were still looking into the cause of the other fires.
