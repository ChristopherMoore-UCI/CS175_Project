In Philadelphia alone, electric provider PECO said that at the peak of the outages midday Wednesday, more than 623,000 homes and businesses were without power. The couple are among an estimated 578,000 who remained without power early Thursday in the wake of Wednesday's snow and ice storm, according to a CNN tally of outage figures provided by electric utilities. "Harder to push, not as easy actually to plow," said Boston snowplow driver Nick Sfravara. "We're very content," Bob Burns told CNN on Wednesday night. Tens of thousands also remained without power elsewhere in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with a handful of outages remaining in Ohio as well.
