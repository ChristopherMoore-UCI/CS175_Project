Landrieu said her office now has a new system successfully used by other Senate offices to prevent future mistakes. "No matter how Sen. Landrieu spins it, she billed taxpayers for dozens of private jet flights since the turn of the century," he said. Landrieu's flight troubles first came in late July when USA Today listed Landrieu as one of the Senate's most frequent flyers after she billed the federal government more than $47,000 in chartered flights in 2013 alone. Landrieu's campaign spokesmen said then that the charter company mistakenly billed Landrieu's Senate office instead of her campaign and that mistake had already been rectified. Marc Elias, Landrieu's attorney who conducted the review, also wrote in a letter to the Senate Ethics Committee that future taxpayer-funded charter flights would be "cleared in advance by counsel." Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican challenging Landrieu for her Senate seat, slammed Landrieu for only disclosing her travel records since 2002, when the Federal Elections Commission changed the rules on payment for campaign-related travel.
