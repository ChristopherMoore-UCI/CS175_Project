No wonder after the Serb surpassed such luminaries as his head coach Boris Becker on the all-time list of grand slam winners with a seventh career title after edging Roger Federer for a second Wimbledon crown.

But as two of the defining forces of men's tennis traded blows in a match complete with 143 winners, it was Djokovic who emerged triumphant, putting him on a par with John McEnroe and Mats Wilander on the list of all-time grand slam winners. A year ago, Andy Murray had blazed past Djokovic in three sets to win Wimbledon.
