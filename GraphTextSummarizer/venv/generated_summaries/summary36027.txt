KUSA reports: Colorado man returns envelopes of cash Gilbert said he called McCarran International Airport and was told it could not put third parties together. Cash money is very difficult to get back. McCarran International Airport released a statement to CNN thanking Gilbert, who got the cash to Marquez late last week. Gilbert said he had an inkling the envelopes carried money, but he hesitated to give it to someone he saw a few feet away because he wasn't sure the person was the rightful owner. Gilbert, who won some money of his own at Vegas, told KUSA he would want someone to do the same thing for him, even if the cash could go toward a mountain of bills.
