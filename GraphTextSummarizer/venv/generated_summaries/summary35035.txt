What is the 5-digit number in which the first, third and last digits are the same, the first digit is four less than the second, the last is four less than the fourth and the second and fourth are the same? In a pie-eating contest, Alice was neither first nor last, but she beat Evan. Take this informal test, developed by Dr. Abbie F. Salny of Mensa, to see if you're among the mental elite. Ben beat Alice. All but five were signed, all but five were rookie cards, and all but five were less than 10 years old.
