When U.S. forces toppled the Taliban government following the 9/11 attacks, there was a global wave of support from people horrified by the plight of Afghan women. Indeed, over the past 10 years there have been significant improvements for Afghan women and girls. Afghan women fear being abandoned again by the rest of the world, as they were during the Taliban era. With international interest in Afghanistan waning, negotiations with the Taliban in the offing, and Karzai's endorsement of the Ulema Council's statement, Afghan women are more vulnerable than at any time in the past 10 years. The risks for Afghan women are too high to do anything less.
