Photos: Raonhaje's Ego Compact Semi Submarine The little boat cruises along at a leisurely sightseeing pace that's unspecified by its maker, which will only say that its batteries will last eight hours at cruising speed or four hours at top speed. It's built by South Korean company Raonhaje, which plans to sell fleets of these Ego Semi-Submarines to resorts, and single units to individuals and yacht owners. We're thinking super-safe leisure subs like these would be a huge hit at a resort, especially seaside marinas near coral reefs, with their colorful and bustling underwater wildlife. The company offers to build custom moorings for the craft, as well as hoists for yachts. Think of it as more akin to snorkeling than scuba diving.
