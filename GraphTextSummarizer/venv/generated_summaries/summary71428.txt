-- Sergio Garcia, a 36-year-old undocumented immigrant in California, has held two lifelong dreams: to become a U.S. citizen and to practice law. California's Supreme Court ruled Thursday (PDF) that no state law or public policy should stop Garcia or others like him from obtaining a law license in the state. Now that he has a law license, however, one thing that Garcia will not specialize in is immigration law. But the case raises many questions, particularly among those who have been critical of Garcia's efforts to practice law. Asked why he didn't choose a different career or pursue other opportunities, Garcia said law was his singular focus.
