-- Hours after being mobbed by hundreds of cheering fans at the airport upon his arrival, former Chelsea striker Didier Drogba made his official debut with new team Shanghai Shenhua Saturday afternoon and insisted his move was motivated by challenges of helping Chinese football. "The most important thing is that I come here to help Chinese football," Drogba said. " Critics, however, describe the luring of top players to China as vanity projects by club owners more interested in benefiting their business empires than developing football at the grassroots level in the world's most populous nation. His arrival highlights the spending spree by Chinese football clubs on foreign talent. " On the outskirts of Beijing, coach He Hongguang feels even more concerned about the "money as solution" approach to improve Chinese football.
