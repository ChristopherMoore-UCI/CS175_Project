He has the support of California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who wrote in a brief to the state supreme court last year: "Admitting Garcia to the bar would be consistent with state and federal policy that encourages immigrants, both documented and undocumented, to contribute to society. "Immigrants must wait longer if they are from Mexico, India, China or the Philippines, because lots of people from those countries want to immigrate to the U.S., and so demand is greater than supply," said Hiroshi Motomura, professor of immigration and citizenship law at the UCLA School of Law, "This seems superficially fair but I believe it's quite unfair and unequal, because the waiting period can vary so much." Larry DeSha, former prosecutor for the State Bar of California, said Garcia shouldn't be given his law license because his immigration status would be in violation of a civil immigration statute and could affect his ability to represent his clients. He, along with the Florida Board of Bar Examiners, petitioned the state supreme court in December 2011 for an advisory opinion: "Are undocumented immigrants eligible for admission to the Florida Bar?" In New York, City University of New York law graduate Cesar Vargas, 29, who was also brought to the United States illegally as a child, filed an application to practice law in 2012. "Basically all I'm seeking is my law license in California, which I already had but was taken away from me because I'm undocumented," Garcia said to CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Many undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children qualify for two-year work visas under President Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but Garcia is too old to be eligible.
