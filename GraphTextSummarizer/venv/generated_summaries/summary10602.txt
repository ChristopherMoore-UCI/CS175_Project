" State Department spokesman Mark Toner echoed Carney, saying that the United States has confidence in Japanese authorities but wanted to put out the new information about the crisis based on the evaluation of U.S. experts and what they would propose in a similar crisis inside the United States. "Our experts are in agreement with the response and measures taken by Japanese technicians, including their recommended 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius for evacuation and additional shelter-in-place recommendations out to 30 kilometers (18 miles)," Ambassador John Roos told journalists at a briefing in Tokyo Wednesday afternoon. State Department officials could not explain why the military was concerned about U.S. military operating in the area but the State Department did not feel a need to warn American citizens until early Thursday in Japan. The U.S. change came Wednesday afternoon in Washington but in the middle of the night in Tokyo. Before  Wednesday, the United States had urged American citizens in Japan to  follow the recommendations of the Japanese government.
