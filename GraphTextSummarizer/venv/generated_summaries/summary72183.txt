Last year Garris reported a bumper crop of acorns, which scientists say may be one clue to this year's scarcity. In far-flung pockets of northern Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and other states, scientists have found no acorns whatsoever. "Last year we collected 25,000 pounds of seeds, most from a bumper crop of acorns," said McNamee. Some scientists fear a mysterious shortage of acorns this fall in the eastern U.S. will affect squirrels. It's also hard to think of acorns without thinking about squirrels.
