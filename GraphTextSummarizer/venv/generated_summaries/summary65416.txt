Pope Benedict XVI on Saturday began his second visit to Spain, where he prayed at the tomb of an apostle and planned to consecrate one of Barcelona's most famous sights -- the distinctive Gaudi-designed Sagrada Familia church. The pope's first stop on his two-day trip is Santiago de Compostela, in Spain's northwestern tip, an important pilgrimage site for centuries. The cathedral there was built 900 years ago atop what is said to be the tomb of St. James, an apostle of Jesus. Gaudi planned the church to have 18 towers -- 12 for the apostles and the tallest for Jesus. Saturday night, the pope planned to head all the way across Spain to Barcelona, the Catalan city on the Mediterranean.
