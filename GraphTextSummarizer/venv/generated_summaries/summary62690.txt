For former top-10 player Robredo, a Spaniard who has returned from injury, it marked his second consecutive comeback from two sets down. Benneteau -- a winner over Federer this year and a five-set loser to the Swiss at Wimbledon last year -- was bothered by a leg injury. Novak Djokovic, in the same half as Nadal, also had a day off and Roger Federer advanced to the fourth round with a victory over Julien Benneteau. Maria Sharapova, the defending champion, completed a rain-delayed 6-2, 6-4 win over Wimbledon junior champion Eugenie Bouchard. "I cannot play third after men's and girls when my possible opponent plays second after girls," Nadal, who lost the first set of his opener to Daniel Brands, said.
