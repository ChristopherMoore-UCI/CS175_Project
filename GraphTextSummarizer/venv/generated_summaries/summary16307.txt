-- Colombian President Alvaro Uribe enjoys one of the highest popularity ratings of any leader in South America, so much that his supporters are pushing for a third presidential term for him. In Colombia, there is also talk of "vision" among congressional supporters of a third term for Uribe. Observers say the efforts to expand presidential terms reflect a historical shift in South America. Colombian President Alvaro Uribe has not said whether he would be willing to run for a third term. The third-term argument in Colombia mirrors to a large degree the situation in rival Venezuela, where President Hugo Chavez announced last month that he will press for a constitutional amendment to enable him to seek re-election in order to govern until 2021.
