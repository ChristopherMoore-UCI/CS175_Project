The IAEA will also get information and explanations to help it assess Iran's desire to develop Exploding Bridgewire detonators, which trigger reactions in explosive materials. Also, Iran agreed to give information about and allow inspectors to visit Lashkar Ab'ad Laser Centre and provide information on various source material. The seven steps that Iran agreed to over the weekend with IAEA officials will be implemented by May 15, 2014, according to the IAEA. First, Iran will provide "mutually agreed relevant information and managed access" to the Saghand mine in Yazd, which will give an accounting for the mining and refinement of uranium. Second, Iran will provide information and "managed access" to the Ardakan concentration plant.
