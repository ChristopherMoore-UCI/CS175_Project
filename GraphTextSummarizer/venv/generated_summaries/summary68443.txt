Title and city rivals, Manchester United -- who confirmed the signing of former Arsenal striker Robin van Persie on Friday -- take on Everton at Goodison Park on Monday. -- English Premier League champions, Manchester City have appointed Ferran Soriano as their new chief executive officer, the club announced Friday. With the implementation of UEFA's Financial Fair Play rules -- which can impose penalties on clubs which spend more than they earn -- City will look to Soriano to help balance the books. The Spaniard, who was CEO and vice-chairman at Barcelona FC from 2003 to 2008, replaces outgoing CEO Garry Cook. UEFA started auditing football clubs' financial statements last season, with a two-year lead in for the start of the 2013-14 season when FFP kicks in.
