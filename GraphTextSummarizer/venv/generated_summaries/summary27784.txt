The Serbian has taken this week off ahead of the men's season's penultimate event, the Paris Masters -- which Federer also won last year before triumphing in the ATP Tour World Finals. With U.S. Open champion Murray pulling out of Basel for the second year in a row, this time due to a back problem, Federer faces a relatively weak field. "Unfortunately last year I was a bit injured and wasn't able to play 100%, so it's nice coming in this year knowing I'm ready,"said Sharapova. It all went so fast at the end, but the first set was really tough," said Federer, who has won the Basel title five times and been runner-up on three occasions in 12 previous appearances. " Federer, playing for the first time since losing to Andy Murray in the Shanghai semifinals earlier this month, won 7-5 6-3 against the 83rd-ranked German -- a late replacement for injured Frenchman Jeremy Chardy.
