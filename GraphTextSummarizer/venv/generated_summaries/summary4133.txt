Peter Bergen: Growing threat from Afghan security forces This year, a third, or 16, of the 46 American service members killed in Afghanistan have died at the hands of Afghan security forces, including Monday when a man alleged to be a local Afghan police officer killed an American service member in eastern Afghanistan. -- An Afghan police officer shot and killed nine other officers in southeast Afghanistan on Thursday night ISAF officials are working with provincial and local authorities to investigate the attack, which is the latest by a member of Afghan security forces. The latest killings come after a shooting rampage in Afghanistan this month left 17 villagers dead in the Panjwai district of southern Kandahar province. The incident occurred in Paktika province, a spokesman for the provincial governor said.
