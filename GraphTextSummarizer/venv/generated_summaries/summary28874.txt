Earlier arrests in the week totaled about 20 on previous days for similar charges, according to New York City Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne. The mission is for " 20,000 people to flood into lower Manhattan, set up beds, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street for a few months," the official "Occupy Wall Street" website read. -- About 80 people were arrested on the eighth day of protests in New York on Saturday, the greatest number since demonstrations started near Wall Street. " CNN called police officials, but they declined to comment further on the extent of injuries or specific use of force. "We've got a whole bunch of people sitting in Washington that can't figure it out," said organizer Bill Csapo.
