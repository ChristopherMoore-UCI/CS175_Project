America's best road trips For thrill-seekers, there are the serious adrenaline rushes: white-water rafting through the Class Four rapids of the Salmon River's Middle Fork in central Idaho or heli-skiing in British Columbia's Bugaboo Mountains. Other all-American adventures include driving down the dramatic Pacific Coast Highway, with a stop at the Redwood Grill for a pulled-pork sandwich, and paying a visit to the millennia-old sequoias in Yosemite's Mariposa Grove (documentary filmmaker Ken Burns's pick). Gliding through the waters of Orne Harbor, you may encounter humpback and minke whales, leopard and fur seals, and cormorants and other seabirds. If you're seeking a gentler pace, consider a stay at Campi Ya Kanzi, a community-owned lodge in eastern Kenya where Masai trackers lead guests through the savanna and cloud forest. David Chang, the chef behind the Momofuku restaurant empire, favors fly-fishing in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
