The preschoolers whose moms reported regulating their feelings with food ate more snacks than did the other children. The same goes for fatty foods. Recent research indicates that eating a lot of fatty foods can end up negatively affecting your mood over time. The takeaway: Although you initially may feel euphoric from eating fatty foods, the more you do it, the worse you feel. "Foods that are laden with carbohydrates, sugar, or fat simply taste delicious," says Heather Hausenblas, Ph.D., an associate professor of exercise psychology at the University of Florida, in Gainesville.
