While the community college proposal "sounded exciting at first," Boehner's staff writes — paired with a gif of Swift to illustrate the excitement — "when President Obama said 'free' what he meant was '60 Billion dollars over 10 years.' House Speaker John Boehner turned to an unorthodox messenger for his pitch to young Americans panning President Barack Obama's proposal to offer free community college for everyone: Taylor Swift. " "Not even all the Taylor Swift album sales in the world would cover that bill," the post declares, atop a gif of Swift looking perturbed. The post goes on to suggest Obama's proposal would either require a tax hike or else contribute to the national debt, accompanied by clips from Swift's music videos that range from infuriated to goofy. Newly-minted Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst said she would "shake it off" when outgoing Sen. Tom Harkin compared her to Swift.
