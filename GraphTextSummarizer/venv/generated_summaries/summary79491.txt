New York Times: ISIS hostages were tortured before beheadings U.S. military strikes Word of the casualties comes as U.S. military forces continue to strike ISIS targets in Syria. Most of those killed were ISIS militants and Syrian Kurdish fighters, battling for control of Kobani, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The U.S. military has conducted five airstrikes near Kobani since Saturday, according to a statement released by U.S. Central Command on Sunday. The group said it believes the actual casualty figure is twice the number documented, "because there is absolute secrecy on casualties and due to the difficulty of access to many areas and villages that have witnessed violent clashes and bombardment by the two sides." At least 800 people have been killed in a key Syrian city over the past 40 days, a Syrian monitoring group said Sunday.
