Opinion: Why women are less free after Iraq War You summon the courage to overcome the stigma, and you go to your local Department of Veterans Affairs to get some help. If you are a young vet who's filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs in New York or Los Angeles, you will wait an average of 600 days. The VA has testified that it has hired 3,300 new claims processors, but it has failed to report that, because of staff turnover, the net increase in processors is only 300 since 2010. And, in Chicago; Waco, Texas; and Oakland, California, the overall number of claims processors has gone down. Now imagine waiting 600 days before you get an answer from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
