The child's mother wanted to obtain photos of her son from the seized computers for use at the funeral but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore, the attorney for Harris. Police in Cobb County, just outside Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said whether what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris. Justin Harris, 33, won't be allowed out of the Cobb County Jail to attend, sheriff's office spokeswoman Nancy Bodiford said. " "The manner of death is homicide" As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media. A timeline of events On the day Cooper died, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said.
