Web programmer, David Mudkips, 25, from east London, told PA that the event was "Like rush hour but fun. Photographer Desmond Fitzgerald, 48, from south London, told PA that by 11pm at Gloucester Road subway station he was afraid someone might slip onto the tracks due to the amount of spilt alcohol on the platform. A spokesman for British Transport Police, which patrols the network, said that police had been told of a large "large amount" of disorder and "multiple instances of trains being damaged", causing them to be pulled from service, the UK's Press Association reported, adding: "This was an unfortunate end to what should have been a fun event." Authorities were forced to close six stations on the network, including major transportation hubs at Liverpool Street, Baker Street and Euston. "I firmly believe that banning the drinking of alcohol on London's public transport will create a better traveling environment for all Londoners and that if we drive out antisocial behavior and so called minor crime then we will be able to get a firm grip on more serious crime."
