If you were running for election, faced with the choice of paying for clean needles and health services for injectors or with putting more cops on the streets and cells in the jails, which do you think would play best with the voters? The science tells us, for example, that making clean needles universally available to drug injectors can more or less wipe out HIV transmission in this group. Funny, then, that we ignore this important piece of evidence: When scientific facts go up against moral ideologies, ideology usually wins. Iran has one of the world's better prevention programs inside its jails, and sterile needles are available to injectors from dispensing machines around Tehran. China makes needles available to injectors through pharmacies at subsidized prices.
