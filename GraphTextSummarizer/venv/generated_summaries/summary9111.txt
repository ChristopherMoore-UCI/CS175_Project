"I thank all my fans for their well wishes and continued support." The 2004 "American Idol" winner announced her pregnancy in August at a Florida concert. Barrino later testified in the child custody case that she knew from the first day of her relationship with Cook that he was married and still living with his wife, according to court records. She was treated at a Charlotte, North Carolina, hospital for a "sleep aid" overdose several days after Cook's wife filed a child-custody petition that included allegations of the affair. -- Singer Fantasia Barrino gave birth to a boy in North Carolina on Tuesday, her representative said.
