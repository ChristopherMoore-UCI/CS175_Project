So it comes as no surprise that 58% of people don't trust Internet companies to protect privacy. Ironically, the companies known as the biggest online privacy offenders who've created business models that rely on monetizing user data are now calling for limits on surveillance.

The government must change surveillance laws to avoid destroying our trust and the current Internet economy.
