However, the Fonepad is very different from most other Android tablets in a one important way: it's powered by the new Intel Atom Z2420 processor (for comparison, the Nexus 7 is powered by ARM's Cortex-A9 CPU). More from Mobile World Congress: Future of mobile is virtual reality, says Android Intel vice president Hermann Eul claims the processor "delivers the power, performance and flexibility required to accommodate a range of devices and market needs." With our short time with the Fonepad, we've tested Eul's claim, and we can say that the Fonepad feels snappy, on par with other tablets of its size of the iOS and Android variety. Other specs include a 1280x800 7-inch IPS screen, 8/16GB of storage (expandable via SD memory cards), and a 3-megapixel camera that can record 720p video. There's no smartphone-becomes-tablet witchery here; the Fonepad is a 7-inch tablet, powered by Android 4.1 and sporting a 3G chip.
