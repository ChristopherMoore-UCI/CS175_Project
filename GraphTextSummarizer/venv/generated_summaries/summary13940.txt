Watch: Office explosion rocks Mexico City -- An explosion rocked the offices of Mexico's state oil company Thursday, killing at least 25 people and injuring 101, Mexico's interior minister said. It was unclear what caused the blast, and Mexico's attorney general's office is investigating, Pemex said in a statement. Crews were still searching Thursday night for people who could be trapped in the Pemex office complex, which includes one of the city's tallest skyscrapers. CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Krupskaia Alis reported from Mexico City.
