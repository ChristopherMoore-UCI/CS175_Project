-- A pioneer in sales of digital music, Apple on Monday became a late entrant in the booming music-streaming wars. It's no mystery why Apple, like Facebook, Google and Twitter before them, wants in on music streaming. "Apple's entry is a discovery tool that seems to exist just to help sell you tracks from the iTunes music store," wrote Roberto Baldwin at Wired. The Recording Industry Association of America, in its annual report, said that while overall music sales were down in 2012, digital-music sales were up 14%, topping $4 billion. Streaming, by which users listen to ad-supported music for free or pay a monthly fee, is the fastest growing form of music listening, according to industry reports.
