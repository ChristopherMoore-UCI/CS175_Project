All the top SEC and DSE executives sat in an emergency meeting and a DSE spokesman said the decision was taken to safeguard the tens of thousands of small investors who went on a selling spree in panic Monday morning. The protests also spread many parts of the country including the southern port city of Chittagong, holy shrine city of Sylhet and many other places.
