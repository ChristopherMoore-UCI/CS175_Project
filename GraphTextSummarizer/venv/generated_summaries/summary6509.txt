Arsenal, who were surprisingly beaten in the English League Cup final Sunday, now face a testing trip to Barcelona for their Champions League second leg tie. David Silva scored the only goal just before halftime as his shot was fumbled by Wigan goalkeeper Ali Al Habsi. Everton beat Newcastle 2-1 at St James Park while West Ham's revival continued with a 3-0 win over Stoke, their scoring rounded off by German international Thomas Hitzlsperger, who has been a big influence since returning from long-term injury. In other action Saturday, Birmingham came down to earth with a bump after their cup heroics as they were beaten 3-1 at home by fellow strugglers West Bromwich Albion and slip into the bottom three. Manchester United, who still lead Arsenal by three points at the top, go to arch-rivals Liverpool Sunday.
