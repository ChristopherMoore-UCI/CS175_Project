The following day, a California court refused to grant Spears visitation rights with her children -- Sean Preston, 2, and Jayden James, 1 -- until mid-February at the earliest. In the last year, the onetime Mouseketeer has shaved her head as photographers looked on; been cited for "habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol" by the judge in her custody case; and seen her "comeback" performance on the MTV Video Music Awards panned by critics who derided her singing, dancing, costume choice and weight. Federline, Spears' former backup dancer, holds primary custody of the children. We ask only that the court's orders be enforced so that a tragedy may be averted." Spears left the Los Angeles hospital Wednesday afternoon, nearly a week after being admitted in the latest stage of an extraordinary public meltdown. Spears' parents obtained a restraining order against her manager earlier this week, accusing Omar "Sam" Lufti -- whom Spears met in October -- of drugging her and controlling her life, her finances and her exposure to photographers.
