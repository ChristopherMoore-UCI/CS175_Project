As the co-founder and co-chairman of Infosys Technology, Nandan Nilekani has received plenty of accolades for being at the forefront of India's transformation into a global leader in information technology. You've either got IT or you haven't: Nandan Nilekani and Infosys is one of India's biggest success stories. While he has said that he lacked ambition as a young man -- "it came later in life" -- he had enough foresight and initiative to set up Infosys in 1981 with six others, and so the fabled company story goes, with only $250 of capital. Nilekani told CNN: "I had the patience to listen to those points of view and then hammer out a resolution or a solution that was acceptable to everybody. " He's been realistic about the current global economic crisis, predicting an inevitable slowdown in the growth of India's IT sector but stated at the India Economic Summit in New Delhi in November that they will continue to grow, despite the difficulties ahead.
