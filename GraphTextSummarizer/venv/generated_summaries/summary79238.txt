For "True Blood's" series finale on Sunday, fans received a wedding, a funeral, and ... an infomercial starring Eric and Pam? "Eric and Pam need a spinoff show," tweeted one fan, as another called for a "new season of #TrueBlood called #NewBlood and it's the adventures or lives of Eric and Pam." Even after seven seasons, "True Blood" kept fans guessing right on through to the end. Yes, the demise of Tara (Rutina Wesley) and Alcide (Joe Manganiello) were shocking to viewers earlier in the season, but they were secondary characters. So thank you, "True Blood," for taking viewers on an unforgettable, bloody ride, and staying true until the very end.
