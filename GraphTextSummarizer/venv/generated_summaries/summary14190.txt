Speed killed "Fast & Furious" star Paul Walker, according to the investigation of the fiery car crash that ended the actor's life last year. "No eyewitness contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to say there was a second vehicle and there is no evidence to indicate there was a second car involved in the collision," it said. "Investigators determined the cause of the fatal solo-vehicle collision was unsafe speed for the roadway conditions," Los Angeles County Sheriff's Commander Mike Parker said Tuesday. Video recorded by several security cameras on nearby buildings "helped skilled investigators to determine the cause of the collision and that no speed contest was taking place." Walker and Rodas, racing team partners, left a charity event at a car shop co-owned by the men to take a ride in an office park in the community of Valencia in Santa Clarita, about 30 miles north of Hollywood.
