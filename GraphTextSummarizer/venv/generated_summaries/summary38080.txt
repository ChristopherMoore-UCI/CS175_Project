Buffy saved the world from plenty of "big bads," like vampires, demons and witches, but she did something pretty heroic for the people who tuned in every week to watch her adventures, too. "(The show) really brought a lot of nerdy girls out of their shell," said Andrea Carlson, 27, a dedicated Buffy fan who works for the state of Minnesota. "I don't think it's so much a respect for women, but it's just the acceptance of a human being." Jeanty said Whedon broke the stereotype of helpless, attractive girls in horror movies with "Buffy." "He just thought, what if, once the monster did catch up to the blond girl who was screaming and running away into the alley, what if that girl then turned around and really started kicking some ass?" Espenson sees characters like "Battlestar Gallactica's" (a sci-fi television show for which she also wrote) Boomer and Starbuck as homages to "Buffy," as well as "Torchwood's" Gwen Cooper. something so amazing and clever that we will all sit in awe and forgive her, but it's really, really hard to think of 'Buffy' without Joss Whedon. " "Buffy is the sexy, hot chick that's always slaying everything, but the fact that she has her smart sidekick -- always with the laptop, always researching, I think (the show) did a lot to show that there's more than one type of girl," said Janeka Rector, a 32 year old die-hard Buffy fan who works at the University of Texas at Austin as a development specialist. "We are definitely in tune with our feminine side," said "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" comic book artist Georges Jeanty of his collaboration with Whedon.
