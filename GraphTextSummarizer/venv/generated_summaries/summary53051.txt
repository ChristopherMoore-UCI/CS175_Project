Common myth 1: Arthritis is a disease of the elderly While older people do develop arthritis, children and teenagers can get certain forms of the condition, Klippel said. "I think people tend to think of this as more of a nuisance," said Dr. John Klippel, president and CEO of the Arthritis Foundation. Klippel also doesn't buy the argument that arthritis patients are better off if they live in a warmer climate. "It's annoying -- it's certainly not good for the joints, but on the other hand, it doesn't cause arthritis," Klippel said. Staying active actually is one of the most important ways to prevent and ease the pain of arthritis, Klippel said.
