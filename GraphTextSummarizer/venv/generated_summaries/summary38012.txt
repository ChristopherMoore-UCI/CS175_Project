The mauled body of Rory Nelson Wagner, 53, was found in a rural area in southern British Columbia on Wednesday evening, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Wagner and two other people were charged with the 1993 killing of a man they thought had sexually assaulted a relative, CNN affiliate CTV reported. "The driver's window of the vehicle was down and investigators noted numerous muddy animal prints and scratches on the car," police said. Conservation officials say the bear was caught, but may be killed to ensure public safety. -- A bear ate the corpse of a convicted killer in a wooded area of Canada, according to authorities.
