He fired six shots, hitting Redus five times, said Alamo Heights police Chief Richard Pruitt. It started with a night out, and student Robert Cameron Redus, who went by his middle name, had some drinks. At the end of the night, Redus was headed in the direction of his apartment, when he drove past Carter, who was patrolling in a campus police pickup truck, Pruitt said. Redus struck a curb on the right, Carter reported, then swerved left into the opposite lane of traffic, so the officer switched on his emergency lights and pulled him over, Pruitt said. Had Pruitt's officers, who were closer, been called to respond, Redus might still be alive, the chief said.
