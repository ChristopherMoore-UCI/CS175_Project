Smoove, who also played the cab driver in the car chase scene from the movie "Date Night," explains, "The ruckus is different experiences you go through throughout your life which builds your ruckus points up -- your tolerance. But there's only a fine line between comedian JB Smoove and his character on the hit HBO series. So said the character Leon Black to Larry David on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" in a scene we'd share if it was even mildly safe for work. You've got to have a high tolerance for dealing with stuff all the time. " Leon, Smoove says, is the guy you take with you to court to fight a ticket.
