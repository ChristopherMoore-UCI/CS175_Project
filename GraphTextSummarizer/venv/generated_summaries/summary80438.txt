The plane was scheduled to fly from Mexico City, Mexico, to Seattle on Tuesday, but was diverted to Portland, Oregon, because of thick fog, said Kara Simonds, a spokeswoman for Portland International Airport. The couple said they waited in the airport in Mexico City for 10 hours before getting a flight back to Seattle on Wednesday night. Passengers were then flown back to Mexico City after officials could not solve the issue with customs agents, Simonds said. In Portland, the passengers were not allowed to exit the plane for four hours because the airport did not have enough customs agents to process them, according to CNN affiliate KING. Seattle residents Mike and Karin Kuntz said they had a good vacation in Mexico, but it went downhill after they tried to get home.
