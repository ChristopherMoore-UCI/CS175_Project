Dogs may excrete infectious Ebola particles in their urine, feces or drool, the scientists wrote, as has been observed with other animals. That raised questions: Can dogs really get Ebola and spread it to humans? "Whether or not dogs shed Ebola once their immune systems encounter it remains to be seen.
