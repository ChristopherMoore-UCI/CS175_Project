Union officials have accused the airline of planning to outsource ground jobs at a cost of thousands of Australian jobs and of putting profits first. The industrial action is aimed at ensuring Qantas will not have enough funds to set up overseas operations that will jeopardize job security, union officials said. Throngs of weary passengers crowded the help desk to rebook with other airlines, as suitcases lay scattered all over the floor. The decision "provides certainty for Qantas passengers," Joyce said in a statement following the decision. "For a month or two, everyone will be anti-Qantas, there's no doubt about that," Fuller said.
