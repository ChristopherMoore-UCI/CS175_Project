Since the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, Liverpool, which finished second in the Premier League last season, has endured a dismal period in which the success of last year appears nothing but a distant memory. The second half followed a similar pattern with Real dominating possession, though it seldom managed to find a way past a solid Liverpool defense. At the Bernabeu, where Real had not tasted defeat in its previous 19 Champions League matches, Liverpool stepped out as heavy underdogs. Basel, which overcame Ludogorets of Bulgaria 4-0, sits three points ahead of Liverpool and has already beaten the Premier League side in the competition this season. While Real is through to the next stage, Liverpool will probably need to win its final two games against Swiss side Basel and Bulgarian team Ludogorets to qualify.
