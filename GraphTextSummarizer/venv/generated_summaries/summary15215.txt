Readers take aim at kids on a plane Passengers booked on AirAsia X, the long-haul arm of AirAsia, can now opt for the seats for an additional cost of RM 35 (U.S. $11) or RM 110 (U.S. $35.50) -- the standard fee charged for picking specific seats in economy class and in the "hot seats" section, which provide more leg room. Beginning this week, under-12s are banned from the first seven rows of economy class on AirAsia X flights to China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Australia and Nepal. AirAsia's competitor, Malaysia Airlines, started flying last year year with child-free first class cabins as well as a child-free upper deck economy section on its A380 service. Just as cigarette smoke could waft into the non-smoking areas before it was banned, so too will noise, said George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, speaking to NBC news when AirAsia X's new option was announced last year. AirAsia is Asia's largest budget carrier, with hubs in Malaysia, Thailand, Japan and Indonesia.
