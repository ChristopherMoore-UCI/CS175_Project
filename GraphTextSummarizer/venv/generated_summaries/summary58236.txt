The Kellogg Co. announced a voluntary recall of 16 products, including Keebler and Famous Amos peanut butter cookies, because they contain peanut butter that could be connected to Peanut Corp. Food and Drug Administration officials said Saturday that peanut butter and peanut paste made from ground roasted peanuts, manufactured in Peanut Corp.'s Blakely, Georgia, plant were found to contain the bacteria, although a direct link to the strain that has now sickened 474 people in 43 states has not been found. Peanut Corp. announced an expanded recall of peanut butter and peanut paste produced from its Georgia plant Friday night. It is also urging companies whose products do not contain Peanut Corp. peanut butter or paste to make that information available to the public. The administration is urging companies to notify consumers if the products they manufacture may contain peanut products from Peanut Corp.
