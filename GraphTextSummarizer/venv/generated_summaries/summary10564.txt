Earlier this year when the Orbit was first unveiled, London's mayor claimed it was better than the Eiffel Tower. "We hope it will be a monument for London, that will stand for 50 years -- though it might need a paint job by then -- and that it will be a beacon, drawing people to the area. Visitors climb 455 steps -- or ride one of two elevators -- to two observation decks offering expansive vistas across London.
