They say they want to protect the lives of police officers, but what if they're just trying to protect the revenue that flows into government coffers due to speeding tickets? The app also uses a small icon of a tiny face in a police hat to warn users if police are nearby, either in speed traps or parked on the side the road. If police have a quota to meet, or a sheriff's substation is competing with other substations as to the number of tickets it hands out, discretion will suffer. When police set up a speed trap where motorists are likely to be driving over the speed limit -- say, at the bottom of a hill -- and then wait for drivers to meander into their web so they can write tickets that generate revenue for a city, county or state, they're violating a social contract. The folks at Waze, for their part, insist that the app improves the safety of roadways because most users tend to drive more carefully when they think police are nearby.
