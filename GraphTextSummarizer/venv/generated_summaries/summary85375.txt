LAX shooting reignites debate over TSA worker's role in security Government report slams TSA program to spot possible terrorists CNN's Stella Chan contributed to this report. Investigators say Ciancia, 23, killed TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez and wounded two other agents and a passenger in what appeared to be an orchestrated assault on members of the federal agency responsible for airport security. Relatives in New Jersey had received alarming texts from Ciancia before the shootings and raised concerns with local police, who had asked Los Angeles police to check on his welfare. The man accused of killing a Transportation Security Administration officer in a rampage at Los Angeles International Airport was out of the hospital and in the custody of U.S. marshals Tuesday, authorities said. Ciancia was taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals Service upon his release, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.
