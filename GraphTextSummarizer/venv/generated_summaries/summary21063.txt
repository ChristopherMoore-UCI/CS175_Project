See the rest of "Richard Garriott A.K.A. Lord British" Garriott's salad days were spent nearby Texas' Johnson Space Center, where his father, scientist and early space shuttle astronaut Owen Garriott was stationed. Somewhere in between this new spectrum of chartered space flight sits pioneers like Garriott, who is showing that even without NASA's support, everyone should get excited outer space, and have a chance to get there too. Brooklyn, New York (Motherboard.tv) -- Video game pioneer Richard Garriott resides in a castle-like mansion outside of Austin, Texas, that would be the fantasy dwelling for any grown-up kid. Garriott would become the sixth private citizen to reach space, a distinction held only by a handful of people, including engineer and first self-funded woman and Iranian citizen in space, Anousheh Ansari and entrepreneur/philanthropist/poker player Guy Lalibert. With the space shuttle program gearing up for its last two scheduled flights, Garriott has become an ambassador of the next monumental relationship between mankind and the cosmos -- the privatization of space.
