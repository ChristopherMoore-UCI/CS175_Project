Your wedding website -- two weeks after the big day Informative wedding pages are ever-so-useful in the months leading up to the nuptials; they provide travel and lodging information, present the greedy wedding registries in a nonobnoxious way and give us lots of opportunities to laugh in private over those super awkward engagement pics where the woman's standing behind the dude and clutching his pectorals and the guy's wearing an expression of laughing-gas bliss. Usually, making such exhibitionist accounts private will do the trick; if you can't remember your log-in information (and your e-mail address has changed, rendering the "forgot your password?" option useless), e-mail or call the company to ask it to log you in or take the page down. and featuring an image of you looking haughtily up at a webcam -- An embarrassing tapestry of snaps in your public Photobucket account -- An angsty LiveJournal, Xanga or Blogspot account peppered with complaints about your parents/teachers/The Man, as well as various and sundry Dashboard Confessional lyrics. Check the Facebook help page for more information; family members also can shut down the account permanently, but in many cases the online memorial may be gentler on everybody. If you're older, the references might change: websites someone made for that overly involved professional football league, a derailed blog purporting to document your child's first year of life, whatever.
