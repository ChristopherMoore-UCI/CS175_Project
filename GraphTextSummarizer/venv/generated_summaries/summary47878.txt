Check it out below: "'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' begins as Katniss Everdeen has returned home safe after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman has signed on to "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" as Plutarch Heavensbee, the politically crafty Head Gamemaker who oversees the 75th Annual Hunger Games, Lionsgate announced Monday. Hoffman is the first new actor to officially join the wildly popular franchise, alongside stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz, Elizabeth Banks, and Donald Sutherland. Along the way Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) â€” a competition that could change Panem forever. Director Francis Lawrence is aiming to start shooting "Catching Fire" later this year.
