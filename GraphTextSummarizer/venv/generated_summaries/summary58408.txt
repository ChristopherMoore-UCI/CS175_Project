" "To play a role in fulfilling Palestinian aspirations, to unify the Palestinian people, Hamas must put an end to violence, recognize past agreements, recognize Israel's right to exist," Obama said. The leadership of Hamas, considered by the United States and Israel to be a terrorist organization, won elections in Palestinian territories in 2006, prompting stringent sanctions from the West. The speech comes months after an eruption of war in Hamas-controlled Gaza, when Israel launched a tough offensive against militants firing rockets at communities in southern Israel before the forging of a cease-fire that Hamas says is violated by Israel. He now thinks the West needs to prove that it is "really sincere" about Palestinians concern and is "ready to help the Palestinian to have their own independent state." Yousef said the recognition of Israel should be considered until there is an independent Palestinian state.
