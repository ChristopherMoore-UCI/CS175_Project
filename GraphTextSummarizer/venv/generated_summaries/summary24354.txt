With the World Health Organization announcing Wednesday that 932 deaths had been reported or confirmed as a result of Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Saudi Arabia joined the list of countries with suspected cases. A male patient at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York has tested negative for Ebola, the hospital announced Wednesday. Ebola spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. " Concerns about the spread of the deadly virus escalated with Saudi Arabia reporting that a man died, apparently of the virus, after a trip to Sierra Leone, and Nigeria reported that a nurse died after treating someone believed to have contracted Ebola in Liberia. WHO did not immediately confirm the deaths, and its count of Ebola cases does not include the two.
