The 25-year-old South Australia batsman, who has played for his country, collapsed after he was struck by a "bouncer" from New South Wales bowler Sean Abbott. Hughes was playing for South Australia against Sydney-based New South Wales, a team he represented between 2007 and 2012. "Players and staff from both South Australia and New South Wales are obviously very concerned for Phil's health and, like Phil, are receiving appropriate support. "As you are aware Phil Hughes was hit and injured by a bouncer at the SCG this afternoon," read a statement from Cricket New South Wales. After joining Middlesex in England in 2009, Hughes struck up a strong friendship with fellow batsman Nick Compton.
