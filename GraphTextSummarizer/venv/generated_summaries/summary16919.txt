A Kansas judge on Wednesday granted the former Army intelligence analyst's request to formally be known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning. Manning is currently serving a 35-year sentence at the Army prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. "However, I have not yet seen their treatment plan, and in over eight months, I have not received any response as to whether the plan will be approved or disapproved, or whether it follows the guidelines of qualified health professionals," Manning said in Wednesday's statement. In August, one Army official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about Manning's case, said the private would remain a man in the eyes of the Army. George Wright, an Army spokesman, said Wednesday the name change would have little consequence.
