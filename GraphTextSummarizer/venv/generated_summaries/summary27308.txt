Now that they've gotten a peek at it, publishers of books, newspapers and magazines are hoping Apple's forthcoming iPad tablet device will breathe new life into their struggling industry. Apple will launch an online bookstore to sell titles for the iPad, much like iTunes sells music for iPods and other Apple devices. "Machines like this make you want to consume more media, which is good for us." Chubb and others are hoping that the Apple's iBookstore and other pay-based models for the iPad will do for the print-media industry what iTunes did for the music industry. Chubb noted the launch of GQ's iPhone app was widely successful in showing Conde Nast that consumers have a desire to read magazines on electronic devices. She thinks the iPad could join Amazon's popular Kindle e-reader in boosting demand for digital media.
