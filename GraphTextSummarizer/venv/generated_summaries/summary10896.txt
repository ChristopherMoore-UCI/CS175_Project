The recent smartphone video of Marines urinating on the bodies of slain Taliban should trouble all Americans. At the most basic level, intelligence will be asked what are the Taliban's interests or more precisely what is it they think they are. Much of this will be distasteful, but even if the Taliban aren't simply contemporary manifestations of J.R.R.
