The Indian government said the French Rafale fighter jet had beaten the four-nation Eurofighter Typhoon to become preferred bidder to equip India with the multi-role fighter jets in one of the world's largest military contracts. The decision will be a setback to Eurofighter, which had strongly lobbied India to buy its aircraft and considered its bid stronger in terms of performance, security of supply and strategic alignment. France's Dassault has been awarded frontrunner status in the hotly contested $20bn race to supply 126 fighter jets to India, providing a much-needed boost for French economic and industrial prestige. India's defence ministry said a final contract would be awarded in the financial year beginning April 2012. After trials last year, India selected the Rafale and the multinational Eurofighter Typhoon to compete in the final stages of the competition.
