Footage shot by CNN affiliate KGO showed Trebek taking the long way to the stage, hobbling on crutches up the disabled-access ramp. -- Alex Trebek, longtime host of the television quiz show "Jeopardy," was injured while chasing a burglar out of his hotel room early Tuesday. It does say that movement in the hotel room awoke one of the victims, who gave chase as a suspect left with stolen personal items. But the San Francisco Police Department revealed details of the case and the subsequent arrest in response to inquiries from CNN. The 71-year-old TV personality revealed his condition at the National Geographic World Championship in San Francisco.
