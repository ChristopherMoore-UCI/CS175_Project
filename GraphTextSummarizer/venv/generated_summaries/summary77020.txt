"They believe that it's very important to do that." Kerry told reporters he had a very good side meeting with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal, and Saudi Arabia was one of the countries to sign on to a statement condemning the reported use of chemical weapons last month by the Syrian military against rebels. -- U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that Saudi Arabia will support military intervention in Syria by the United States and its partners. The statement called for a "strong international response" and "supports efforts undertaken by the United States and other countries to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons." The Syrian government has denied being behind chemical weapons attacks, which it blames on rebels. Al-Assad's rare interview with U.S. media comes as U.S. President Barack Obama lobbies Congress and the country to support military action.
