"Therefore, I believe the only way to determine once and for all whether there are bodies buried at Barker Ranch from the time of the Manson family is to proceed with limited excavation in a very few areas." He said four methods of testing were used at five sites on the ranch. Soil testing to determine the possible presence of buried bodies was inconclusive, authorities said Friday, so "exploratory excavation" will be done this month, Inyo County Sheriff Bill Lutze said. -- Authorities said Friday that they will begin digging for evidence of graves at a California ranch that once was home to the infamous "family" of convicted killer Charles Manson. Manson and four others were convicted of murder and other charges in connection with a two-night spree in August 1969 that included the slaying of actress Sharon Tate. In March, search crews found indications that human remains may lie within a few yards of Barker Ranch, the onetime hideout of the Manson family.
