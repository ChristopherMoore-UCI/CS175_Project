Air traffic controllers at Miami Center helped White at first, talking him through disengaging the autopilot, turning the plane and beginning his descent. "The husbands and the wives of air traffic controllers have no idea what their spouses do for a living," White said. Although White sounded fairly calm, some tension is evident on recordings released by the Federal Aviation Administration as controllers at Fort Myers, Florida, attempted to talk him through landing at the airport there. "I'm grateful, thankful to be alive," Doug White of Archibald, Louisiana, told CNN affiliate WINK. They then handed the plane over to air traffic control at Fort Myers' Southwest Florida International Airport.
