The real anchor is a job, the kind eagerly provided by U.S. employers who thumb their noses at federal law prohibiting the hiring of illegal immigrants. Lastly, one of the things you hear from amnesty opponents is that illegal immigrants should certainly not be given U.S. citizenship. The U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants are legally entitled to U.S. citizenship. As U.S. citizens, they're subject to U.S. laws, but they also enjoy the protection of the U.S. Constitution. This fall, the Arizona legislature is expected to debate a bill that would deny birth certificates to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants -- the "anchor babies" that some Republicans have been trying to marginalize for years.
