Tim Clark, Matt Kuchar and Bubba Watson all finished tied for second place on 29 under. Haas led by two strokes after an fine start but the chasing pack reduced his lead and a birdie on 17 put him level with leaders Clark and Kuchar. American Bill Haas claimed a one-shot victory in the Bob Hope Classic on the final hole to join his father as a winner of the tournament. He completed victory with a birdie four at the last hole after he struck a brave tee shot. My dad and my brother and his uncle were there," Haas told the tournament's official Web site.
