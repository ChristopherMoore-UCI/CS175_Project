Areas from eastern Pennsylvania all the way north to Maine could see powerful winds and large hail, said CNN meteorologist Todd Borek. DTE Energy said wind gusts as high as 75 mph downed more than 2,000 power lines across southeastern Michigan. Others attending church festivals around the region got a scare when high winds caused tents to collapse, WDIV reported. At least the weather cooperated in one respect Saturday in Michigan: Conditions were comfortable, with temperatures peaking in the mid-70s and relatively light winds. The same storm system that caused the extensive power outages in Michigan moved through the Northeast on Saturday.
