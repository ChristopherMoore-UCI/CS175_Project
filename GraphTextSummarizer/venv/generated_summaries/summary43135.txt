Iraqi judges are not named for security reasons. Before that, Iraqis had complained that private security contractors were operating in a state of lawlessness, never held accountable by Iraqi authorities for incidents in which Iraqis were killed. A spokesman with the British Embassy in Baghdad said it was a matter for Iraqi law. But Salam Abdulkarim, who represents the families of the victims, said Fitzsimons had committed an ugly crime and according to Iraqi law, he should get the most extreme punishment. Under Iraqi law, murder is punishable by hanging.
