The violence came despite police raids of Golden Dawn offices and the arrest of a 45-year-old party supporter who police say admitted killing Pavlos Fyssas. At least 10 more people have been arrested, including Golden Dawn party members, police said. One more Golden Dawn lawmaker is still being sought, police said. Pavlos Fyssas, a popular anti-fascist figure and well-known hip-hop artist with the stage name Killah P, was the victim of the knife attack that was allegedly committed by a Golden Dawn supporter. -- The leader of Greece's extreme right wing Golden Dawn party and four party lawmakers were charged Sunday with forming and participating in a criminal gang.
