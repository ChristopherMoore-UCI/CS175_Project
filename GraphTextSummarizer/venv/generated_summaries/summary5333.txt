Referring to an ad produced by black Republican Louisiana State Sen. Elbert Guillory focusing on Landrieu's record with blacks, Murdock said: "I think state Sen. Guillory has done a tremendous job and service, by asking in this ad a very basic question: What have the Democrats done for us lately? Many black people may want Obama to provide more productive policies, but to suggest, as Dash does, that blacks are largely "uneducated" and "getting money for free" is a racist narrative that conservatives need to stop perpetuating. The "Hannity" segment was about the Louisiana Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republicans Bill Cassidy and Rob Maness. Dash and other guests discussed how blacks in Louisiana have voted for Landrieu since electing her in 1997 but have not benefited from it. Dash's comments are insulting and give blacks another reason to tune out the GOP and not take our party seriously.
