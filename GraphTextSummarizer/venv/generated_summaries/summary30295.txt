While Ebola is highly infectious, it isn't particularly contagious, as it's only spread by direct contact with bodily fluids -- not through the air. It's clear talking to patients like Teneh, the will to beat Ebola is here too. The West African nation crippled by Ebola is responding to the outbreak through a day of prayer and reflection. Ebola can kill up to 90% of those infected and more than 930 people have already died in this epidemic, dwarfing all previous Ebola outbreaks. The work is intense, the stress levels are incredibly high, and there's little doctors can do here except treat the symptoms of Ebola.
