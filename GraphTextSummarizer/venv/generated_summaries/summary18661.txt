Google Glass, worn like regular glasses, has a high-resolution display and lets wearers use voice commands to access features like e-mail, text messaging, Google Maps, Google search and a handful of other apps. The New York Police Department has procured two pair of Google Glass specs, the experimental head-mounted computers, to determine possible applications to police work, the department said in a statement. Patrick Jackson, a computer-savvy firefighter in North Carolina, has developed a Google Glass app that he hopes to expand to include useful data such as information on specific buildings -- blueprints, potential building hazards and contact information for owners. The ability of Google Glass to snap photos and record video and audio has raised privacy concerns. The high-tech specs are not on the market yet and are available only through the Google's Glass Explorer Program, which allows organizations or individuals to test the glasses for $1,500, according to Google's website.
