When Latinos/Hispanics aren't being pursued by marketing agencies and Fortune 500 companies hungry for a slice of more than $1 trillion in annual buying power, they're being hounded by nativist mobs, racist politicians and the perpetrators of hate crimes. Aside from Madison Avenue advertising firms, government bureaucrats and the political parties, it shows not many people seem to be all that fond of all-encompassing umbrella terms like "Hispanic" and "Latino." And yet, in Congress, you see Puerto Rican and Cuban-American lawmakers pushing for comprehensive immigration reform. According to a new survey by the Pew Hispanic Center, the preferred term for many is "Hispanic."
