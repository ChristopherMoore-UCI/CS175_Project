Several other photos DeGeneres posted were sent using an Android device, most likely the Samsung phone she used to pose with Bradley Cooper, Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt and a handful of other A-list stars. Several of them, such as a photo of DeGeneres with actor Channing Tatum, were sent not from a Samsung Galaxy handset but a rival iPhone. And singer Alicia Keys claimed she was hacked after she was caught tweeting from an iPhone last year while serving as a "creative director" for BlackBerry. The Academy Award host broke Twitter with her Oscar-night group selfie using a mobile phone built by Samsung, a major sponsor of Hollywood's big night. The source of the photos and tweets can't be seen on DeGeneres' Twitter page, but is visible when they're viewed on another platform such as TweetDeck.
