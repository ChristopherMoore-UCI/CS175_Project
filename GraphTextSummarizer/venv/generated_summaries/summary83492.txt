Many tech bloggers and writers have called for Apple to open the iPhone to other networks, including Verizon Wireless. -- Just after Apple CEO Steve Jobs debuted the next version of his company's iPhone to the world, the tech luminary had a bit of technical trouble. "It's Wi-Fi," said Carolina Milanesi, research director for mobile devices at Gartner. The technical faux pas came during Jobs' keynote address at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California. The new iPhone will remain an AT&T-only device.
