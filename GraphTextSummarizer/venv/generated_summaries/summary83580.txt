Michael Skakel, the nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, has been denied parole after serving 10 years in prison for bludgeoning Martha Moxley to death with a golf club outside her home in 1975. The decision Wednesday morning marked Skakel's first chance at parole since his conviction in Moxley's killing, according to a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Correction. She added that "there has never been a person more deserving of parole than Michael Skakel." "His track record during the past 10 years shows the person we all know him to be -- caring, generous, and committed to his faith, family and friends," Seeley said. The 15-year-old's body was found after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. "I believe that Michael Skakel is representative of the most dangerous aspect of our society in that he was raised in an environment in which he was exposed to and at some point embraced the mind-set that the rules of our general society did not then and do not now apply to him.
