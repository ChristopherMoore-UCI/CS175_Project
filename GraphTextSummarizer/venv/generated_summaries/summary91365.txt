In the early 1980s, he worked on the Sony Walkman and and the Apple iMac and over  his long and varied career, has worked with a wide range of influential clients including Airbus Industries, Peugeot, Issey Miyake,  Tag Heuer, Herman Miller. With money seemingly no object, Lovegrove has designed what he calls an ''alpine capsule," to fulfill the wishes of restaurateur and club owner Moritz Craffonara, who has lived in the Badia region of Italy for more than 40 years. The bed will be built within a couple of years according to the designer, who hopes that it will attract people from all over the world. Away from his client work, one of Lovegrove's projects is the "Car on a Stick," an electric bubble car that turns into an elevated streetlight at night.
