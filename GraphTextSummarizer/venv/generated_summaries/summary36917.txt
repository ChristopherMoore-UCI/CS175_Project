The $25,000 reward would be the largest offered in Suffolk County history, in an apparent bid to fill out a possible serial killer case that some fear has gone cold. -- Suffolk County Police have upped the ante in their search for a killer or killers who apparently dumped their victims along a remote stretch of beach in Long Island, New York. "I am hopeful that the increased reward will provide critical information to help bring those responsible to justice," Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said. "We're hoping the increased reward money will encourage somebody to come forward by calling the police in respect to the families and to (the) victims," Lt. Robert Donohue said. Like the four victims who were found in December and have since been identified, Gilbert advertised prostitution services on websites like Craigslist.
