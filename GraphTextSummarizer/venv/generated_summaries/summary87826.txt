Pinal County communications director Heather Murphy said inmates began showing symptoms at the Arizona State Prison Complex Eyman in Florence. -- Contraband alcohol is believed to have sickened at least seven Arizona inmates, who are receiving antitoxins for suspected botulism poisoning, officials said Tuesday. Symptoms can include "double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness" in patients. "It is suspected that the inmates came in contact with the toxin from homemade prison 'hooch,' made from fermented fruit," said Murphy. Bill Lamoreaux, a spokesman for the state corrections department, said preventative measures will include educating prisoners about the dangers of contraband alcohol and searches to ensure it can't be manufactured or consumed.
