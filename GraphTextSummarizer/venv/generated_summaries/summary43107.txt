People who spend most of their waking hours at work or dealing with work-related activities have little time to build and nurture relationships outside of work. In addition to damaging the body and mind, long hours at work cut people off from their family and friends. There is a significant body of research that shows long working hours have negative physical and psychological effects on people. Not only that, when people are tired from long hours, they tend to make more irrational and risky decisions. The most productive countries among the developed economies often have the shortest work hours.
