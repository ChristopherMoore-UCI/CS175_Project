The school's board of trustees announced Friday that it'll offer the president's job to Tressel, who has worked as an administrator at the University of Akron since departing as head football coach at Ohio State University under a cloud of controversy. "Mr. Tressel has the personality and leadership skills, in addition to widespread community support, to dramatically raise YSU's profile and prominence across Ohio and the nation," board Chairman Sudershan Garg said in a statement. -- Jim Tressel -- who gained fame then infamy as a collegiate football coach in Ohio -- is now poised to lead a new team: Youngstown State University. The job as president at Youngstown State, which boasts nearly 13,500 students and more than 135 undergraduate and graduate programs, would be another step for Tressel. The student government leader said he thinks Tressel, as president, would excel at "being a cheerleader, the face of the university (because) he knows the area and donors" and expressed confidence he can craft "a vision" for Youngstown State and its future.
