The IMDB bio continued: "For Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, the release (accidental or not-so-accidental) of boudoir tapes didn't result in shame but celebration. The bio then noted various superstars who have derided Kardashian for her faux fame, including Daniel Craig and Jon Hamm, before concluding with a walloping pulpit-imploding rant, noting that Kardashian's fame was kick-started by a sex tape, "an apt metaphor for socio-economic-cultural malaise in Washington and the country beyond, where everything seems to be run by amoral prostitutes in bed with each other and merely out for a buck." The bio has disappeared from IMDB, but Uproxx has a screenshot, where it's credited to Jon C. Hopwood, a writer who has crafted over six hundred IMDB biographies.
