Others may argue that the Supreme Court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment, and struck it down. Sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country, and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure. Recently, Nashville's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals. And are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals? Present-day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime, and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment.
