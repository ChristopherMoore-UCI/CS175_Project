"In light of the incessant anti-Israel and anti-Semitic rhetoric worldwide, we urge that all Jewish institutions review their security procedures in conjunction with local law enforcement," said Dr. Shimon Samuels, director of international relations for the Los Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center. "Unfortunately, the Jewish community lives in vigilance against terrorism and anti-Semitic attacks 24/7/365 days a year," said Foxman. People around Jewish institutions in New York, at least, said attacks like Monday's in France raise awareness, sympathies and concerns, but it doesn't mean they're expecting it to unfold in their backyard. Jewish leaders, law enforcement officials and others around the world have responded with promises that security will be sound and requests that all be on the lookout for suspect activity. There are increased patrols at Jewish schools, synagogues and neighborhoods in San Francisco as well, said police spokesman Albie Esparza.
