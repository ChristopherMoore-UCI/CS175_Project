-- Two NATO-led soldiers were killed and six wounded in an attack in a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan early Sunday, officials said. The majority of the troops do not leave the base and are in various support roles for U.S. troops across Afghanistan. U.S. soldiers at the Bagram  base in Afghanistan prepare for a mission earlier this year. Spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said three missiles were launched at the base at about 2 a.m. local time (5:30 p.m. Saturday ET). The international alliance was formed under a U.N. mandate to bolster a secure environment and support the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
