Several returning ISIS fighters have already been implicated in attack plans in Europe. In recent weeks, European security services received indications of an ominous possibility: that ISIS may have started directing European extremists in Syria and Iraq to launch terrorist attacks back in their home countries, the Belgian counterterrorism official said. The Belgian counterterrorism official said indications of ISIS ordering attacks in Europe mark an apparent significant shift by the terrorist group. But the worry now is that ISIS has pivoted toward launching attacks in Europe. Before the air campaign against it, the official said, there was little indication ISIS leaders were directly plotting attacks in the West.
