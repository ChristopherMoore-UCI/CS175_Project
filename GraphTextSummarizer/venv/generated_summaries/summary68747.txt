-- Early this year, comic book writer Nathan Edmondson set out to tell fictional stories based on the super-secret U.S. government paramilitary organization once named the Intelligence Support Activity (or ISA). Edmondson's writing on this and other books such as "Dancer" has gained him a following in the comics world, but it goes beyond that with "Activity. Edmondson said that many of his ideas come out of conversations he has with those involved in various special ops areas. You can go a lot of places with that," Edmondson said, talking about possible story ideas. "The ISA is a secret kept from the Army, it's even a secret kept from itself," said Edmondson.
