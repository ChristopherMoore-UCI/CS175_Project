-- A businessman and his wife were arrested on charges of blackmailing Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Italian police said Thursday. Tarantini, who is accused of paying escorts to go to parties with Berlusconi, has said the leader was not aware of the payments. That same year, another young woman, Patrizia D'Addario, alleged she and other girls were paid to attend parties at Berlusconi's residence. A judge issued an arrest warrant for a third person, Valter Lavitola, who authorities said was the link between Berlusconi and Tarantini. In a separate case, Berlusconi is presently on trial in Milan for allegedly paying for sex with a then-17-year-old Moroccan belly dancer named Karima el Mahroug, nicknamed "Ruby the Heart-stealer."
