In an exclusive interview with CNN's World Sport, Blatter pointed to the eight Spain-based players in the 2010 FIFA World XI and Spain's World Cup success as justification. Have your say on Blatter's decisions Blatter said Messi needed to win a World Cup before he could be compared to fellow Argentine Diego Maradona, captain of the 1986 champion side. "It's a good league, with good players, but when you consider not one player made the best XI of the world, maybe they should think about whether something can be adapted. " The FIFA World XI featured six players from Barcelona and two from Real Madrid, with the other three from Italian Serie A champions Inter Milan. The Spanish league also has the highest number of local players."
