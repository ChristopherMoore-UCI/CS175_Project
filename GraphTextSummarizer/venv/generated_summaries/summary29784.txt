According to CNN weather producer Rachel Aissen, this would be a double rainbow that has been reflected in the sky, due to a smooth body of water underneath the rainbow. CNN iReporter Yosemitebear Vasquez posted a video to YouTube in 2010 reacting to a double rainbow he spotted in Yosemite National Park. "It's been surreal I feel like we're breaking the Internet but in a really great way," she told CNN affiliate WPIX. This isn't the first time rainbows have shown up in multiples. After the New York area received a large amount of rain, four rainbows stretched across the early morning sky on Tuesday.
