Then the Senate passed the plan, which imposes sweeping new spending cuts over the next decade, on a 74-26 vote on Tuesday afternoon. Credit rating agency Moody's said Tuesday the United States will keep its sterling AAA credit rating for the time being, but lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to "negative." " "I think all of us need to reflect on how these institutions are conducting themselves, how members are conducting themselves," said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, who has announced he is not seeking re-election next year. "The agreement creates room for the private sector to continue to grow, without the threat of default and the burden of higher interest rates," Geithner wrote, noting the measure passed Tuesday locks in at least $2 trillion in long-term savings that are "phased in gradually to avoid hurting the economy in the near term." If the debt ceiling had not been increased before the end of Tuesday, Americans could have seen rapidly rising interest rates, a falling dollar and shakier financial markets, among other problems, because the government would have been unable to borrow more money to account for the difference between revenue it collects and bills it owes.
