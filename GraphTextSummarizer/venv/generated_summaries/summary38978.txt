If the injury proves long-standing it could affect his build to the second major of the season, the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach in mid-June. Clark, who was winning for the first time on the PGA Tour, charged through the field to set the clubhouse target, with Australian Robert Allenby finishing second, one shot behind, after failing with birdie attempts on the final two holes. Mickelson could have leapfrogged Woods if he had won the Players, but he shot a closing 74 to tie for 17th. England's Lee Westwood led going into the back nine on the final day, but a series of lapses, including a double bogey on the notorious short 17th, ended his hopes. Tiger Woods was forced to pull out of the final round of the Players Championship at Sawgrass on Sunday with a neck injury.
