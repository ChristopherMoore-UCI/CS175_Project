Such eclipses are basically as old as the galaxy itself, happening when the moon and sun are at just the right distance from the Earth and they appear to be of the same apparent size in the sky -- even though the sun is actually about 400 times larger. Eclipses aren't everyday events, and they're getting less common. While there will be more full eclipses, they will get rarer and rarer as the moon moves away from the Earth at a rate of about 3.8 centimeters (about 1.5 inches) every year. Clouds be damned, some folks there used a sun costume, along with an Earth-and-moon prop, to put on a show of their own. That means what used to be morning suddenly looks like nighttime again, until the sun and moon get out of each other's way.
