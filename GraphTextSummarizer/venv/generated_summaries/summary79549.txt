The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a 30-day stay of execution for condemned Georgia murderer Warren Lee Hill, whose attorneys say he's mentally disabled. State prosecutors say Hill has repeatedly failed to meet that standard in years of appeals. A federal appeals court in Atlanta halted the execution to give lawyers a month for written arguments on whether Hill should be spared under the federal ban on executions of the mentally disabled. That reversal "establishes consensus among every doctor who has evaluated Mr. Hill that he is mentally retarded," his lawyer, Brian Kammer, said Thursday. But three doctors who examined Hill for the state have reversed their conclusions and now say he should be spared, giving fresh ammunition to Hill's attorneys.
