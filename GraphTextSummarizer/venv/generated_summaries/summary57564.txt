On Tuesday, Vice Adm. Jose Luis Vergara Ibarra, a spokesman for Mexico's navy, said Mario Cardenas Guillen was connected with a number of pending cocaine trafficking cases. Mexico's Calderon defends drug war in final state of nation address Alleged senior member of Tijuana drug cartel extradited to U.S. Man gets 25 years for trying to buy military weapons for cartel A man who "is presumed to be and says he is" Mario Cardenas Guillen was detained Monday in the northern state of Tamaulipas, a spokesman for Mexico's navy told reporters. More than 47,500 people have been killed in drug-related violence across Mexico since Calderon deployed federal troops to combat cartels shortly after taking office in December 2006. The cartel split into two factions after its former leader, Antonio Cardenas Guillen -- also known as Tony the Storm -- was killed in a military operation in 2010, Vergara told reporters Tuesday.
