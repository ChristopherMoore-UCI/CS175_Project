But Google TV is stumbling over obstacles from TV networks that don't want their internet content available on the big screen. Several other companies are producing Web-connected boxes that can hook up to TVs, but those could be less desirable as new TVs come with Wi-Fi functions and Web features built in. After sales of LCD TV sets grew last year, sales are expected to slow 13% this year, according to a report by research firm DisplaySearch. Google's inability to find the right formula for TV software, like it did for smartphones with Android, leaves a major opportunity for software makers. For Samsung, standing out in a sea of smart TV platforms could come down to unique methods for connecting its various products together.
