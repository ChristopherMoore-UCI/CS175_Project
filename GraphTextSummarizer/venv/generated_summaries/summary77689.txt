He coached the legendary Forrest "Phog" Allen, who succeeded Naismith as Kansas coach in 1920, remaining at the helm through 36 years and three national championships. The auction house had estimated that Dr. James Naismith's two-page "Founding Rules of Basketball" would bring less than half the $4,338,500 that David and Suzanne Booth bid for the 119-year-old document. The Booths hope to bring Naismith's rules to the University of Kansas, inspired, they said, by lifelong Jayhawk basketball fan Josh Swade and his campaign to return the rules the university, where Naismith spent the last 41 years of his life and is buried. The family has always been involved in the game of basketball, but after many offers, it is "time to move forward," said Naismith, now living outside Chicago. The first 13 rules of basketball sold Friday for more than $4 million, setting a record for the highest sales price for sports memorabilia, according to Sotheby's, which conducted the auction.
