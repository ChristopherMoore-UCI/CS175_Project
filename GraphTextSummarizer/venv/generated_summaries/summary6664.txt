-- Egypt's renowned resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh  that attracts millions of tourists from around the world is growing tired of its most famous guest: Hosni Mubarak. Asked why tourists stopped coming, hotel and nightclub operator Adly El Mestekawy had one simple answer: the revolution. The sight of helmeted riot police forming a human chain of black uniforms around the perimeter of the pyramid-shaped hospital, contrasted sharply with the palm trees, souvenir shops and sun-burned European tourists who wander past, staring curiously at them. " Fahmy spoke across the street from Sharm el-Sheikh International Hospital, where Mubarak has been staying under heavy police protection since prosecutors began questioning him on Tuesday. The once bustling harbor in Namma Bay is mostly quiet, except for the occasional motorboat puttering past pulling squealing tourists riding inner-tubes.
