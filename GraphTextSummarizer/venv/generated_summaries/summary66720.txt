-- Arriving in central Bangkok from the sparkling international airport, a visitor might not know at first glance that much of the city is under water. For almost a month, residents in outlying areas such as Rangsit and Lumlukka have been living in water that is often chest-high. From his factory office in Rangsit, supplies donated by friends and family are sorted into rescue packs for men, women and children, while the factory workers man an array of water pumps -- some of them cannibalized swimming pool pumps -- around the clock, praying that the defensive wall they erected around the warehouse doesn't collapse. The smell of stagnant water is also overpowering, while mold is starting to appear on the upper floors, thanks to the "cooking" of the water below in mid-afternoon heat. Read predictions that flooding would remain for weeks Romeo Romei, a local businessman, lost his house and is battling to save his factory, but he still manages to take a boat out each day with his friend Alex Stamp and cousin Duccio Lucchesi to distribute water, food and clothes to those in need.
