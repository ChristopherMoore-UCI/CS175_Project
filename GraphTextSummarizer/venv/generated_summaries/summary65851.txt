Tyler was the caregiver to Katherine Ragazzino, a Marine injured in Iraq, who was seeking Filner's assistance in negotiating problems with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs for her traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. The alleged incident occurred June 11 when Tyler, Ragazzino and a veteran's representative were in Filner's office, and then Filner asked to meet alone with Tyler, telling Ragazzino and the veteran's representative: "Please step out, you don't need to hear this," Allred said. Ragazzino was homeless during her post-war ordeal and now resides with Tyler, Allred said. Stunned, Tyler responded, "I am here to focus on Katherine," according to Allred. Tyler said she needed to leave his office, but the mayor allegedly told her, "If we were not here in my office, I would like to kiss you," Allred said.
