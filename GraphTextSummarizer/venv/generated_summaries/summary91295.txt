On Monday, a portion of the ashes of 20-year-old C.J. are expected to be launched into space by a Houston company called Celestis, which has been sending cremated remains into Earth orbit, onto the lunar surface or into deep space since 1997. It will be the company's 13th launch, delivering remains to the weightlessness of space before returning them to Earth. We were very emotional when we found out not only that was this something that can happen but that the CEO was offering us a sort of complimentary ride into space. "I cannot think of a person more perfect to reach outer space. " More than 800 packets, each containing a small portion of ashes, have gone out so far, with 9,000 people offering to extend C.J.'s journey.
