Go inside an Airbus A380 with Google Street View Deals between airlines and football clubs are nothing new, but the size of the deals and scope of the partnerships have boomed in the last few years. Chattaway believes the number of deals and their value will only increase in years to come, as brand positioning and the desire to find new markets becoming more important for both football clubs and airlines. If the Aeroflot Manchester United deal seems slightly incongruous, it is perhaps because the biggest players in sponsorship deals have hitherto been the booming airlines from the Middle East-- Emirates, Qatar Airlines and Etihad Airways -- with Emirates a long-time supporter of sports teams, not just football, around the world. With privileged access to players for airline promotions and pitch-side advertisements, Lukashin expects the airline to ally with the most eye-catching parts of Manchester United. The real pay-off however comes from the boost in finances as clubs seek new way to grow revenue and reach emerging markets.
