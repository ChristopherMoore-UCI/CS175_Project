Columbus firefighter David P. Santuomo, 43, took Sloopy and Skeeter to his home's basement, suspended them from a pipe near the ceiling and fired at least 11 shots from a .22-caliber rifle fitted with a homemade silencer, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Ron J. O'Brien said. The Columbus Division of Fire has received more than 2,000 outraged e-mails and calls from the public, said Battalion Chief David Whiting, the department's spokesman. Miller said appalled fellow firefighters turned Santuomo in to authorities. The Division of Fire has concluded an internal investigation, including interviews with Santuomo, Whiting said. In the meantime, Santuomo is working in the division's fire alarm office, "where he is not dealing face to face with the public," Whiting said.
