Since the fall of Wang and Bo, Li has devoted himself to exposing alleged police abuse of power during Bo's reign in Chongqing. Media reports and online posts claimed Wang clashed with Bo after suggesting Bo's wife poisoned and killed Neil Heywood, a British businessman and Bo family friend, last November amid a financial dispute. Wang, 52, was a right-hand man of disgraced politician Bo Xilai, once considered among Communist royalty and a fast-rising star within the party destined for the highest office of the country. Wang headed the police department of Chongqing, a sprawling southwestern metropolis with more than 30 million residents, during most of the period when Bo was the local party chief from late 2007 to early this year. Gu Kailai: China's 'Jackie Kennedy' Bo, 63, a charismatic albeit controversial politician, launched a "smashing black, singing red" campaign in Chongqing that promoted Communist ideology as zealously as it cracked down on organized crime.
