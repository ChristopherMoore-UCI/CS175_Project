IATA represents some 230 airlines comprising 93 percent of scheduled international air traffic. Runway excursions -- instances when a plane leaves the runway during take-offs or landings -- accounted for 21 percent of the worldwide accidents, IATA said, saying the number has dropped because of attention to the problem. There were 786 fatalities in passenger aircraft compared to 685 in 2009, IATA said. He said African carriers should make use of an IATA audit system to improve safety. IATA Director General Giovanni Bisignani said African systems must improve.
