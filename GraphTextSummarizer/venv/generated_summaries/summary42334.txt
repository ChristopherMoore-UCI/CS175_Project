Witonski ahd enlisted the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor and quickly rose to the rank of colonel during World War II, his son, Peter Witonski, told CNN. Witonski is not the only one that did not know about his mural being hidden; most of the current congregation was surprised by the announcement of the unveiling, said parishioner Jennifer Maguire. Back from the war, Witonski found a home at St. Peter's. Maguire, who has been attending St. Peter's for 16 years, only learned about the painting when she volunteered to help take a survey of the church's artwork. Peter Witonski told CNN he is looking forward to seeing the painting again after so much time.
