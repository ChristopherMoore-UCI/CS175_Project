Sweden's Joel Sjoholm also shot a 67 at St Andrews for a 12-under total to share second place with Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, who carded a fine 69 at Carnoustie. Grace, who also won on South Africa's winter circuit last weekend, will face a tougher test at Carnoustie Saturday before heading back to St Andrews for the final round. -- Branden Grace continued his charge towards a fourth European Tour title of the season with a five-under-par 67 at St Andrews to take a five-shot halfway lead in the Dunhill Links Championship. But they will do well to catch Grace, who was one shot shy of the record lowest 36 hole total on the European Tour, set by compatriot Ernie Els at the 2004 Heineken Classic in Australia. The South African carded a stunning 12-under 60 at Kingsbarns in his opening round to lead by two, but extended his advantage with more fine play.
