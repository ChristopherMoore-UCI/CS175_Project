USDA new rules for school meals About 90% of schools are now in compliance with the new guidelines, according to the USDA, with students eating about 16% more vegetables and 23% more fruit on a daily basis. A survey published in the Childhood Obesity journal reported that 70% of elementary school children, 70% of middle schoolers and 63% of high school students liked their school's meals. But there's been controversy over the program's implications for school food budgets. Economics of school lunch Established in 1946, the National School Lunch Program was created to provide free or low-cost meals to students. The USDA says 1 million fewer students nationwide are eating federal school lunches since the guidelines were enacted in 2012 -- either by personal choice, or because their schools have opted out of the lunch program altogether.
