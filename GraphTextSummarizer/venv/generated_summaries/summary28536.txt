Just a year after Nigeria's 2007 general elections -- which brought Umar Yar'Adua to power in a election derided by some as a "charade" -- Obama's race to the White House was a chance for Nigerians to vicariously participate in a political process that appeared transparent and was no doubt inspiring; not to mention the amusement of indulging in debates about whether things would've been different had Barack Obama, Sr. been Nigerian and not Kenyan. Lawyer and Big Brother Nigeria alumnus Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, another of my friends who watched that first debate, told me he did so as a "cynic", merely for an opportunity to see Barack Obama "challenged" after a lackluster first term. Postcard: Greeks fear what could follow U.S. election That sort of name-calling, as opposed to debates around manifesto highlights, lies at the heart of Nigerian politics. Postcard: Obama, Romney ignore Afghans at own peril Still, we're nowhere near the 2008 levels of U.S. election enthusiasm. -- I recently stumbled on a Nigerians For Obama Twitter handle, launched on October 10 this year.
