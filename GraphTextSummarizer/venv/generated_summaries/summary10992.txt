Honduran prisons have been criticized for being overcrowded places with poor conditions. Two previous deadly prison fires have occurred in San Pedro Sula. The incident comes on the heels of another prison fire in Honduras that killed more than 350 people last month. A fire last month in the central Honduran town of Comayagua killed 358 inmates. The cause of the fire at the prison in San Pedro Sula was not immediately known.
