Republicans have to referee a civil war between nativists who want less immigration because they fear that the country's complexion is changing, and business interests that want more immigration because they need workers. Weeks ago, Labrador walked away from immigration reform efforts in the House. It is not true, however, that it was Syria that killed immigration reform for this Congress. One of them is Rep. RaÃºl Labrador, R-Idaho, who recently told Univision's Jorge Ramos that it is becoming less likely that immigration reform will pass anytime soon because Congress is turning its attention to Syria. No, a proper autopsy would show that immigration reform is meeting its demise in this Congress for a variety of reasons.
