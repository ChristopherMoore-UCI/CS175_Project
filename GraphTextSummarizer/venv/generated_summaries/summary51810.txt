Pope Francis has been at pains to explain what he is about, which he characterizes as a new chapter of evangelization for the church. -- Last Sunday, a group of us sat on the beach, watching the children play, when the talk turned, as it often does, to Pope Francis. My friend's comment illustrated the peculiar power of Francis: that of presenting the central message of the church -- that God loves every man and woman passionately and desires their good -- in ways that those quite outside the influence of the church can recognize and warm to. The joy of the gospel, as Francis sees it, is capable of setting us free from sorrow, loneliness and inner emptiness. A priest reflects on Francis' first year He used the word "we."
