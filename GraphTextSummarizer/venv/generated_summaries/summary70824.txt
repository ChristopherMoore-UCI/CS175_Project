U.N. envoy to Yemen Jamal Benomar and Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General Abdul Latif al-Zayyani arrived in Yemen on Monday, Saba reported. A video on YouTube Monday purports to show the body of a 10-month-old child killed by gunmen in Sanaa. Bloody violence raged Monday in the capital, Sanaa, triggering a new wave of international pressure on Yemen. Thirty-one people were killed Monday in clashes in Yemen, 28 in Sanaa, and three in Taiz, according to medical officials. Amnesty International said that since February, 200 people have been killed and more than 1,000 have been injured in protests in Yemen "as security forces have repeatedly used excessive force, including by firing live ammunition at peacefully gathered protesters."
