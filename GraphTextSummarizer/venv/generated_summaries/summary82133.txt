-- Tom Greer is an 80-year-old crime victim who had the absolute right to use deadly force to defend himself when a pair of burglars -- a man and a woman -- broke into his home in Long Beach, California, and began assaulting him. Then, Greer told the television station, he fired on the burglars, hitting Miller in the back. If Greer shot Miller in the back, it makes it hard for him to argue that he wasn't in control of the situation and that somehow he felt threatened by Miller. Finally, Greer said with no remorse, as Adams ran off, Miller pleaded for her life and claimed to be pregnant. But they are not enough to let Greer avoid taking some responsibility for killing Miller.
