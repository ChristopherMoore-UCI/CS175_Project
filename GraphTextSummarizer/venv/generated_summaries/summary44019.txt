The musician was charged with vehicular homicide in Nashville, Tennessee, last April after his speeding car allegedly clipped a pickup truck, sending it down an embankment and killing the driver, according to a Davidson County, Tennessee, sheriff's spokesman. Police found Todd Harrell "slumped over the steering wheel" of a vehicle stopped at an intersection in D'Iberville, Mississippi, a police statement released Wednesday said. Harrell showed signs of impairment and acknowledged he had consumed hard cider and taken the prescription pills Lortab and Xanax after that incident, police said. Harrell, 42, "showed signs of impairment and was arrested and charged with 2nd offense DUI," police said. The bassist of the rock band 3 Doors Down faces a driving under the influence charge after his arrest Tuesday in Mississippi.
