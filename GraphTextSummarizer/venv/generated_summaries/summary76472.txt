-- A football fan has been arrested after a bizarre attack on a team's goalkeeper which forced Wednesday's Dutch Cup match between Ajax and AZ Alkmaar to be called off before halftime. Referee Bas Nijhuis ended the match prematurely, with Ajax leading 1-0, after Alkmaar coach Gertjan Verbeek took his players off the field. He said he hated the AZ goalkeeper and had therefore attacked him." Slop said Ajax had tried to reassure the visiting team, but they left the ground. "This was a terrible incident and we deeply regret it and offer our sincere apologies," Ajax's financial director Jeroen Slop told the Amsterdam club's website. Ajax coach Frank de Boer was bemused by the chain of events.
