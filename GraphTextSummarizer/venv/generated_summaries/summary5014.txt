A statement on the game's official Web site, wizards.com, said Arneson died Tuesday evening "after waging one final battle against cancer. "Game campaigns are as limitless as the player's imaginations," wizards.com says. In 1974, Arneson and Gygax created "Dungeons & Dragons," which allowed players to assume roles in a magical world. " Arneson "developed many of the fundamental ideas of role playing: that each player controls just one hero, that heroes gain power through adventures, and that personality is as important as combat prowess," the statement said. "Dungeons and Dragons" spawned video games, novels, a cartoon, and a movie.
