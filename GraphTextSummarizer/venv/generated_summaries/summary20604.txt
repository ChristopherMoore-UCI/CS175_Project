On Thursday, French president Francois Hollande told a delegation of professional French football club leaders he wouldn't abandon the government's plan for a 75% tax on salaries reaching more than a $1.35 million. For French football clubs it's a new punitive tax law that's worrying them to death. "French teams will be at a disadvantage with regard to English clubs who only pay 40% tax," former Monaco chief executive Tor-Kristian Karlsen told CNN. "The high-income tax of 75%, which was included in the 2013 draft budget of France, will have a disastrous effect on the competitiveness of French football," said the Professional Union of Football Clubs (UCPF) in a statement. It might also affect money coming into French football from foreign investment --- potential owners might be tempted to get more value for money elsewhere.
