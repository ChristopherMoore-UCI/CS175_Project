Over the last couple days, Leak, a new service that allows people to send anonymous emails, sent a number of reporters questionable emails as part of a push to promote the app. Leak cofounder Laurent Desserrey confirmed to Mashable the emails were sent to reporters as part of a PR push. While some apps that encourage anonymous sharing have gotten flack for their potential to enable bullying and other negative interactions, Desserrey says he wants Leak to be used for good. In a post on Medium Desserrey explains he was inspired by apps such as Secret which encourage anonymous sharing. And if it's getting negative you can block emails from Leak."
