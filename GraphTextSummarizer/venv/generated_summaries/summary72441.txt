The Syrian military used the Homs National Hospital as a detention center "for all those violating the regime's law, meaning opposing the government," said activist Tariq al Homsi, who was in the embattled city. -- Anti-government fighters found the bodies of 78 people, apparently tortured to death, in a refrigerator at a hospital in Homs, Syria, captured from government forces Monday, opposition activists said. Another activist, Abu Bilal al Homsi, said the 78 bodies have not been identified, but it is believed that most of them were people from the Baba Amr neighborhood. Opposition activists have made previous claims that the Syrian government was using hospitals for torture. "We know people were captured and taken there to be tortured, and many activists and youths were taken," he said.
