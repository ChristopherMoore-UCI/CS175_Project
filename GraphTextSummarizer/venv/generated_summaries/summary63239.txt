"James Cromitie, David Williams and Onta Williams voluntarily agreed to target synagogues and military planes using what they thought were real bombs and missiles," said Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. David Williams and Onta Williams also apologized to their families and thanked supporters, and Onta apologized to the people of Riverdale. "What these three defendants did was as serious a set of offenses as is imaginable," said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Raskin in court Wednesday. James Cromitie, Onta Williams and David Williams were arrested in 2009 after planting what they thought were live explosives. In an emotional statement on Wednesday, Cromitie apologized to the people of United States, his family and friends.
