The Saturday announcement by Minister of Public Works and Housing Diosdado Cabello, who oversees the state telecommunications regulator, came at a counter-rally to marches protesting the hardline tactics of President Hugo Chavez. Demonstrators hold up a picture of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at a pro-Chavez rally on Saturday. "There are 29 [radio stations] that will be off the air shortly," Cabello said at Saturday's pro-Chavez rally. Cabello also announced a new legal complaint against television broadcaster Globovision as a sanction for allegedly calling for a coup against Chavez during its coverage of Friday's rallies. Chavez has accused private television stations of supporting his brief ouster in 2002, and the president was a driving force behind denying a license renewal in 2007 to one broadcaster he said cooperated with the opposition.
