Five survivors told refugee agency representatives that the boat was overcrowded and started having trouble soon after leaving the port of Bosasso in northern Somalia on Tuesday. -- At least 55 people have drowned or are missing after a boat capsized off the Somali coast on Tuesday evening Before Tuesday's incident, 95 people had drowned or gone missing this year in the waters between Somalia and Yemen. The incident marks the largest loss of life in the Gulf of Aden since February 2011, when 57 Somali refugees and migrants from the Horn of Africa drowned while attempting to reach Yemen. At least 100,000 people have crossed the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden this year, despite warnings from U.N. and aid agencies about the risks of those kind of trips.
