-- Iraqi authorities executed 17 people, including an Egyptian man and two Iraqi women, most of whom were convicted of terrorism, Iraq's Ministry of Justice said in a statement released Monday. Nearly 70 people were executed in Iraq in 2013, according to CNN tally, and Human Rights Watch reports that more than 120 people were executed between 2011 and 2012. The prisoners were put to death in what appears to be the latest of several executions carried out by authorities in recent months, despite a United Nations call for restraint. The executions come as Iraq smolders with sectarian tension and political infighting. Baghdad's Shiite-dominated government has blamed the recent attacks on Sunni insurgents with ties to al Qaeda.
