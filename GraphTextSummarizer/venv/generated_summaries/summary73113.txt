In the early days of the trial, it was like a meeting of old friends, Bulger listening carefully -- laughing heartily at one point -- to colorful recollections of former Boston bookie Richard O'Brien, who ran a successful bookmaking operation that he inherited from his father. His voice shaking, Bulger insisted he had a deal with the late Jeremiah O'Sullivan, head of the Justice Department's New England Organized Crime Strike Force who later became U.S. attorney in Boston during the height of Bulger's alleged gangland reign. In a trial that exposed deep-seated corruption in the FBI and government during Bulger's heyday, jurors heard from a disgraced FBI supervisor who admitted to tipping off Bulger's rogue informant handler that one of Bulger's associates had turned and had become an informant. -- As the seven-week-long parade that was the trial of Boston mob boss James "Whitey" Bulger passed by, jurors, courtroom spectators and the public watched and listened as former bookies, former drug dealers, extortion victims, gangsters, convicted killers, families of murder victims, and former FBI agents made their appearances. Prosecutors offered up extortion victim after extortion victim to show Bulger conspired to collect "rent" from operating criminals in South Boston.
