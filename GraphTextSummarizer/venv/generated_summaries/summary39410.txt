The White House argues the president didn't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and haven't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities.

John McCain, R-Arizona, expressing congressional support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libya.

Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told NBC's "Meet the Press" on Sunday.
