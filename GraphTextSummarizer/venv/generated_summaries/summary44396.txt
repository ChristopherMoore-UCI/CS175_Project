Obama, calling attack 'terror,' shifts to response Though Obama didn't mention "terror," federal investigators and a White House official later classified the bombings as such. Key officials, including White House chief of staff Denis McDonough, who in 2009 served as National Security Council chief of staff, and homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco, who formerly served as a senior Justice Department official, are at Obama's side now. "Any time bombs are used to target civilians, it is an act of terrorism," Obama said. "There were three attacks in the first 17 months of the administration, four if you count Fort Hood," said Matthew Miller, who served as a director of the Office of Public Affairs for the Justice Department during Obama's first term. -- When President Barack Obama addressed the nation in the hours following Monday's Boston Marathon bombing, he did not use the word "terror," immediately raising questions.
