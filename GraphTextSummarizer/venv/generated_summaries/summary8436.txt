Perhaps Ted Cruz, chastened by his brush with un-American identity, will proceed with greater empathy for those on the margins of American life. Born in Calgary to an American mother, Cruz learned that he has unwittingly held Canadian citizenship all his life. Cruz's comical predicament illuminates three things about the politics of American identity in this era of demographic flux. What was in doubt, thanks to a few birthers from the right and some mischievous eggers-on from the other side, was whether he could also claim American citizenship by birth. He realized this because it was members of his own party who had incubated and propagated such insinuations about whether our son-of-a-Kenyan president was insufficiently committed to the American way.
