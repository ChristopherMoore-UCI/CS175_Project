-- Johannes Mehserle, a former San Francisco Bay Area transit police officer, is appealing his involuntary manslaughter conviction for the killing of 22-year-old Oscar Grant in Oakland. Mehserle was accused of fatally shooting Grant on New Year's Day 2009 on a platform of a Bay Area Rapid Transit station. " This case has been controversial in California's Bay Area community for years. He committed such gross negligence that he should not be allowed back on the streets to protect and serve again," said Grant's mother Wanda Johnson at a news conference Friday in Oakland. The move has deeply angered Grant's family, who say the appeal is an attempt for Mehserle to clear his name so that he can become a police officer again.
