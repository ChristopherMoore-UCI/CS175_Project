The bus was carrying elementary-school and high-school students when the accident happened around 7 a.m. Friday, said Cedrick Ellis, superintendent of the Shaw School District, in Shaw, Mississippi. -- One child died and several were injured Friday in Bolivar County, Mississippi, when a school bus collided with a tractor-trailer on a foggy stretch of road, officials said. A "younger child" was killed in the accident, said Dr. J.O. Trice, a deputy county coroner. The Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol is investigating, Ellis said. Ellis said the bus and a tractor-trailer loaded with gravel collided, causing both vehicles to overturn.
