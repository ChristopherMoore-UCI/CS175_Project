As a third-generation Mexican-American growing up in Los Angeles, I had never encountered such overt racism. The son of a naturalized immigrant from El Salvador and a Mexican mother from Texas, he grew up in Los Angeles during a time of racial tension. A few minutes earlier I'd met a group of five people who'd been standing in front of me -- here from Mexico City -- and I had begun speaking Spanish with them. The group of people from Mexico City looked at her in disgust and, realizing from the look on my face that I must not be accustomed to what I was hearing, they turned toward me to offer support. My Mexican friends remind me that I am American first, Mexican second and that my English is better than my Spanish.
