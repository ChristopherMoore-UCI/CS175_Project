In the wake of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, reactors have not been allowed back on, making Japan now the first major economy to see the modern era without nuclear power. As of last weekend, all of Japan's nuclear reactors were offline for the first time in four decades as the Tomari Nuclear Power Plant's reactor 3 in Hokkaido was shut down for maintenance. The national government's ruling party, the Democratic Party of Japan, has been urging local communities to allow reactors to return to operation. "We cannot possibly agree to do the kind of energy saving yet again this year, or every year from now on," said Chairman Hiromasa Yonekura, referring to the country's efforts to turn off air conditioners and shift operation of production lines to weekends. But the nuclear disaster that followed Japan's historic earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 has left it dependent on government support.
