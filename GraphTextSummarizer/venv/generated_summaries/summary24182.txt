"The state crime lab confirms some of the blood samples are Ayla's," said Stephen McCausland, a spokesman for the Maine Department of Public Safety, referring to young Ayla Reynolds. The blood was discovered in the Waterville, Maine, home soon after Ayla was reported missing December 17. McCausland said Sunday that Ayla's father "is still talking to us when we ask him to. Testing on blood found in the home of a missing Maine toddler has determined that some of it belonged to the girl, police said Sunday. "We don't know what happened other than we know Ayla didn't walk out on her own, and we have grave doubts she was abducted because there were three adults in the home that night (and) it's a very small house," McCausland said.
