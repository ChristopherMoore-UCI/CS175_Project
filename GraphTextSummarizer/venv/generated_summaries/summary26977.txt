French President ducks questions over affair allegations Opinion: Personal or political, it's time Hollande got his affairs in order Report: French President mulls legal action over claim of affair with actress CNN's Sandrine Amiel and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report. -- French President Francois Hollande has paid his first visit to partner Valerie Trierweiler since she was admitted to a hospital amid reports that he is having an affair, his office said Friday. Asked then whether Trierweiler was still the first lady of France, Hollande said personal affairs should be dealt with in private. A survey by French pollster Ifop with French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche found that more than three-quarters of respondents saw the alleged affair as "a private matter that only concerns Francois Hollande." Hollande and Trierweiler are expected to visit the United States at the invitation of President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle.
