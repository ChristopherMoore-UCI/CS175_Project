-- Boston bombing suspect Dzhokar Tsarnaev has tweeted since the Boston Marathon bombings on what two friends of his tell CNN is his Twitter account. On August 10, 2012, for instance, Tsarnaev wrote -- in response to another user -- "Boston marathon isn't a good place to smoke tho." Another tweet from Tsarnaev on Tuesday was a quote from rapper Eminem: "Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin to say but nothin comes out when they move their lips; just a bunch of gibberish." After another Twitter account posted a photo Tuesday saying it showed a man who was going to propose to his girlfriend at the marathon in Boston and found her dead, Tsarnaev tweeted a two-word response: "fake story." Shortly after midnight, on Tuesday morning, he tweeted, "There are people that know the truth but stay silent & there are people that speak the truth but we don't hear them cuz they're the minority." Tsarnaev uses the handle "J_tsar" and does not describe himself in the profile, which reads only, "Salam aleikum," a greeting among Muslims.
