Kennedy International Airport in New York. Abdul Kadir is one of four people who faced charges in a 2007 plot to explode fuel tanks and the fuel pipeline under the airport, according to a statement from the U.S. Eastern District Court of New York. A criminal complaint accused the men of obtaining satellite photos of the airport and using DeFreitas to conduct surveillance and identify potential targets and escape routes. Kadir was found guilty on five counts but not guilty of surveillance of a mass transportation facility.
