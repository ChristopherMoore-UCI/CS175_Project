Meanwhile, Malaysian police are denying a report in a London newspaper that MH370 pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah is the primary suspect in the probe into the plane's disappearance. An FBI review of the two pilots' hard drives, including one in the flight simulator Zaharie had built at his home, had not turned up a "smoking gun," a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN in March. The story also said evidence from the flight simulator at Zaharie's home showed he had plotted -- but then deleted -- paths to the deep southern Indian Ocean and landings on short runways. The article cites unnamed industry and non-Malaysian government sources familiar with the state of the investigation as claiming that Zaharie is "the prime suspect if the plane's disappearance turns out to be the result of human intervention." The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said Sunday it's been re-examining data that could shift the search area hundreds of kilometers south along an arc derived from satellite data.
