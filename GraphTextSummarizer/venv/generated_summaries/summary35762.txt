In addition to voting and commenting, Facebook users can join a live webcast on Tuesday, during which Facebook officials will answer questions. -- Users have one week to vote on the proposed changes to Facebook's policy, including the ability of users to vote on future privacy changes. "This feedback allows us to respond to your questions and make substantive changes to our proposals before they are implemented," Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of communications and public policy, said in a blog post announcing the vote. In that post, Facebook also proposed to end public voting on changes to site governance. They also say the changes could violate Facebook's settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, in which the social network said it would obtain consent from users before sharing their personal data with third parties, and provide users with clear notice when that information is shared.
