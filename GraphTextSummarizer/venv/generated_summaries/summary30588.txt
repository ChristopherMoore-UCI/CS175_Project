, Lorna Patrick removes eggs from a sea turtle's nest on a Florida beach. Ninety percent of the United States' sea turtle population can be found on Florida's beaches, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "Shy of letting the hatchlings swim in oil, it's our best alternative," said Sandy MacPherson, the national sea turtle coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service. It is also the first time that wildlife experts had to deal with oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. "If it falls, you probably killed the hatchling that's developing inside," said Patrick, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
