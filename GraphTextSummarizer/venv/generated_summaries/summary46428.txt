He went into the final round tied for second with European Ryder Cup teammate Lee Westwood, one shot behind veterans Mickelson and Vijay Singh. Rory McIlroy has put himself in pole position to win the $10 million FedEx Cup jackpot by claiming his second successive playoff event on Sunday. It was the 23-year-old's third win in four starts, a run which started with his second major triumph at last month's PGA Championship. Woods closed with 68 to finish another shot back tied for fourth with fellow American Robert Garrigus, whose 69 helped lift him from 31st to 20th in the playoff standings. McIlroy still has work to do to clinch the title, however, as Woods, third-placed Nick Watney, Phil Mickelson and fifth-placed Brandt Snedeker can all overtake him by winning at East Lake.
