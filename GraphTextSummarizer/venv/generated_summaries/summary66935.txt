-- A Polaroid picture of the late Dennis Hopper was stolen from a Los Angeles art gallery and the photographer, actor Jason Lee, is offering $25,000 to the photograph back. Lee, who starred in the TV show "My Name Is Earl," loaned the picture to the art gallery and is very sentimental about it, the gallery, which is called This Los Angeles, said. "Jason is devastated and sickened by the theft," said Nancy Iannios. "There is no way that this Polaroid will ever have the same worth to you that it holds for Jason." "It has great sentimental value to Jason."
