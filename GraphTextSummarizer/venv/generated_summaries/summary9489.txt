Kokesh was originally arrested July 9 after a police search of his suburban Washington home in Herndon, Virginia, found a firearm and an illicit drug, an illegal combination in the state of Virginia. -- Pro-gun activist Adam Kokesh, recently seen in an Internet video loading and cocking a shotgun, is being held in a Washington jail for three days pending a detention hearing on Monday, a judge ruled. Kokesh's attorney, Peter Cooper, said after the appearance in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia that his client is making a "political statement," but argued the government is doing the same thing. District of Columbia Magistrate Judge Lori Parker said Kokesh "poses a danger" and went "out of his way" to violate the district's laws. Kokesh, an Iraq veteran, made headlines with a July Fourth video posted to YouTube in which he loaded a shotgun in the middle of the national capital's Freedom Plaza.
