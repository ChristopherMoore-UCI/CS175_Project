M.I.A., along with Nicki Minaj, Cee-Lo Green and LMFAO, joined Madonna as she treated fans to a greatest hits medley that included "Vogue," "Music" and "Like a Prayer." Rapper M.I.A. provided a middle finger salute to network cameras Sunday night during the 12-minute extravaganza, when she joined Madonna during a performance of the latter's new single, "Give Me All Your Luvin'. -- Ahead of her Super Bowl halftime show, singer Madonna promised there would be no "wardrobe malfunction." The "spontaneous gesture," as NBC called it, came during a performance of Madonna's latest single. After the Jackson-Timberlake showstopper, the halftime show largely relied on classic rock artists such as Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, The Who and Tom Petty.
