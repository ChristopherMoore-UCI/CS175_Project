" On border crisis, Jeb Bush, Rubio and Perry remake image The Rio Grande sector, where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol, has a large number of agents but it is also the largest crossing. Perry's state has received the majority of migrant children, especially in the Rio Grande region, and he has repeatedly called on the federal government to beef up border security. Conservatives largely point to border security as their top immigration priority and Perry has been an outspoken proponent of securing the border since the influx of immigrants began. "You cannot have (national security) without border security," Perry said. At the same time, resources for border security have steadily increased: More than 18,000 agents patrolled the border in 2013 compared to 10,000 a decade ago.
