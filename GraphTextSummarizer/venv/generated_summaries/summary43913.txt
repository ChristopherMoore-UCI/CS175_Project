Scott arrived in Barcelona before the official start of the study-abroad program, and on January 6 he went with other Dartmouth students -- not those from the Portland State program -- for dinner and drinks in a popular nightlife area along the city's Mediterranean shore, Inman said. Scott was on a study-abroad program in Barcelona that was run by Oregon's Portland State University, Charles Inman, the coordinator of the program, told CNN on Monday by telephone from Barcelona. A 41-year-old Ecuadorian man has been arrested in the Esplugues de Llobregat suburb of Barcelona, according to the police statement released Saturday. Scott never returned to his apartment and did not appear January 7 for a program orientation lunch, Inman said. Scott, a native of Seattle, played on the Dartmouth men's rugby team, his college newspaper reported in January.
