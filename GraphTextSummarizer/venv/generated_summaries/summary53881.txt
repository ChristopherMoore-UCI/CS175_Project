The Aztecs practice on a field at the center of Hunting Park in the heart of North Philadelphia. Berry, who played football growing up and even played on the same field in Hunting Park, said the Aztecs program went from three teams in 1994 to eight teams today, serving close to 400 young people from ages 5 to 15. Other sport legends signed on to help the troubled Hunting Park, including the Phillies' Ryan Howard and tennis great Billie Jean King. But this week, the Aztecs -- the first inner-city youth football team to win a Pop Warner championship -- got word they're getting a new field, compliments of Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback Michael Vick. I think this is one of the most remarkable comebacks in my 30 years of public service that I've seen anywhere," said Michael DiBerardinis, commissioner of Philadelphia Parks & Recreation.
