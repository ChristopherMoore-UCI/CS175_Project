-- Thousands of supporters have donated money to outspoken Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in order to pay a 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) tax bill from the Chinese government. On his Google+ page, Ai has detailed various payment channels for the donations which include cash, PayPal, China Construction Bank, and the Chinese third-party payment network Alipay. Ai has called the actions by Chinese authorities a "retaliation against a dissident" and says he has no choice but to pay the bill. While many have sent money via post and the internet, other have resorted to rather unconventional methods -- folding bank notes into paper planes and throwing them into Ai's garden at night. As well as support Ai says he has received further unwelcome attention from authorities, with an increased police presence around his compound in Beijing.
