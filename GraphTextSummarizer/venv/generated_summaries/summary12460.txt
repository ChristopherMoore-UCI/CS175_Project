Now 54, Talbot said his prime accomplishment has been revamping the procedures bus drivers follow to accommodate wheelchair users, the deaf and blind and people who use a cane, walker or crutches. According to Talbot, the elevators didn't work half the time, bus lifts were broken and drivers were not educated in dealing with the disabled. When Talbot started at MBTA three years ago, drivers pulled to the curb and lowered the bus -- or kneeled -- for disabled passengers about 25 percent of the time. " The Americans with Disabilities Act doesn't just give disabled people physical access to buildings, restaurants and restrooms, Talbot said. In 2007, Talbot left Florida to join the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority as assistant general manager for systemwide accessibility.
