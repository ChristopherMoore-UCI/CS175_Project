After major turns in movies such as "The Avengers" and "Lucy," Variety reports that the actress won the lead role in DreamWorks' live-action version of "Ghost in the Shell." A police force is assigned specifically to track down hackers, including the movie's main character, Major Motoko Kusanagi. DreamWorks' Steven Spielberg has been wanting to adapt the movie for many years, and Rupert Sanders is attached to direct. Part science fiction, part crime drama, it has been praised for what were then advanced animation techniques. Scarlett Johansson has become the go-to woman for action movies.
