"We've confirmed that he was in good health, Mr. Grapel's family is aware of his arrest, and refer you to the government of Egypt for details on the charges against him," State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday. Grapel was apprehended Sunday and ordered held for 15 days on suspicion of spying for Israel, said Adel Saeed, a spokesman for Egypt's general prosecutor. Grapel's mother denied Monday that her son was involved in espionage, saying: "Law students don't have time to be spies." "There is no chance he's a spy," Irene Grapel said from her home in New York. The Israeli government allegedly sent Grapel to Egypt after the January 25 revolution to take advantage of the security vacuum that then existed by recruiting others to provide the Israelis with military and political information, Saeed said. Grapel is a rising third-year student at Emory University School of Law in Atlanta, school officials said Monday in a statement.
