-- Bordered by Thailand, Indonesia and Brunei, and with a heritage of diverse influences including a long period of British colonial rule and an economically powerful Chinese community, Malaysia is one of the most multicultural nations in southeast Asia. Comprised of two regions separated by 640 miles of the South China Sea, with Peninsular Malaysia to the west and Malaysian Borneo to the east, the country is a federation of 13 states that is home to an estimated population of 25.7 million people. Melaka and George Town, in Penang state, are "exceptional examples of multi-cultural trading towns in Southeast Asia," says the prestigious UN body. Malaysia was formed in 1963 when the former British colonies of Singapore and the states of Sabah and Sarawak on the northern coast of neighboring Borneo also joined. From the 18th until to the 20th century, the region formed part of what was loosely known as British Malay -- a divided collection of colonized states.
