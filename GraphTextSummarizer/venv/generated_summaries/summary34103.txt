One day after President Barack Obama announced that he is delaying executive action on immigration, top lawmakers urged the President to ditch his plans for an executive action altogether and work with Congress. "The first blame is with Congress not doing its job, and now the President is forced to have to take a measure like executive actions," he said on CNN. He said Democrats have looked at polling in red, Southern states with small Latino populations, including Georgia, North Carolina, Arkansas and Louisiana, where Democratic Senate candidates are at risk of losing in November. Even Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, who is a strong proponent of immigration reform, said "it's clear that playing it safe is what is going on at the White House and among Democratic circles." On Saturday, the President announced he is delaying any action on immigration that could have protected many undocumented immigrant workers and families from deportation until after the midterm elections in November.
