-- Forty-three Transportation Security Administration workers in Florida are facing disciplinary action for not performing additional screening on random carry-on bags and passengers, according to TSA spokesman David Castelveter. Castelveter said the incident was reported by TSA employees and identified in an internal investigation. One congressional critic of the TSA said the incident is another in a string of TSA lapses. It happened over two months last year at Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers. "TSA holds all of its employees to the highest professional and ethical standards and has a zero tolerance for misconduct in the workplace," he said in a statement.
