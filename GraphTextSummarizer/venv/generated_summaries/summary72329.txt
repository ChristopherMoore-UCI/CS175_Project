" Els claimed the WGC-CA Championship in his last outing and heads into the year's first major, the Masters at Augusta in early April, in good shape. -- Ernie Els survived some nervy moments to secure his second successive Arnold Palmer Invitational title in Orlando on Monday. Els recorded four pars to end his round on a total of 277 (-11) but had to rely on his powers of recovery to avoid dropping shots on the sodden course. The South African's charge for the trophy was halted by bad weather on Sunday night, forcing play to be abandoned when he was leading by two shots with four holes left. American Kevin Na cut Els' lead to just one stroke on the 16th hole but his hopes ended when he left his par putt short on 18.
