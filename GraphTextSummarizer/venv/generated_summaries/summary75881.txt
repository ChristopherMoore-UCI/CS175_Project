With this spirit of maritime adventure in mind, CNN asked Herman Ho, Boat Asia 2012 managing director, and Stuart McDonald, founder and editor of Asian travel website, travelfish.org, to give the lowdown on Southeast Asia's most spectacular coastal spots. With vast expanses of sparkling blue ocean, remote dive sites teeming with marine life and thousands of uninhabited tropical islands ripe for exploration, Southeast Asia is home to some of the world's finest adventure sailing spots. Sailing around the Similans is still allowed, though, and those who venture there are treated with "turquoise blue waters full of marine life," says Ho. Koh Chang, Thailand Located near Thailand's maritime border with Cambodia, the Koh Chang archipelago offers a wealth of secluded tropical islands that are perfect for exploration by sea, says Stuart McDonald. It's apt then that luxury boating manufacturers will this weekend drop anchor in Singapore, one of the continent's most vibrant  harbor cities, to take part in the 20th annual Boat Asia show.
