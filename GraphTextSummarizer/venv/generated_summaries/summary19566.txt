Local volunteers have joined police and rescue teams in searching the town and surrounding area, a task made more difficult by poor weather, flooding rivers and hilly terrain. I mean the terrain is difficult, waterlogged, working near to flooded rivers with the potential for mine shafts and unstable ground," police Superintendent Ian John said. The desperate hunt for a 5-year-old girl abducted in Wales entered its fourth day Thursday, with hundreds of police officers, volunteers and mountain rescue workers combing a rural area for any trace of April Jones. Mark Bridger, 46, remains in police custody and will be questioned again Thursday, said Detective Superintendent Reg Bevan, of Dyfed-Powys Police. Police said Wednesday that the search was focused on more than 20 different areas, including houses, outbuildings, river banks and open countryside.
