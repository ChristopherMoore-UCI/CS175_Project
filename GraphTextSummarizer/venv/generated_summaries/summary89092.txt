If the writers get a cut of Web revenues -- an unknown value since nobody knows what Web syndication is worth -- the value of broadcast and cable syndication could decline. "Once another medium, particularly cable, gets a chance to draw viewers away, they don't come back, and that wasn't the case in 1988," TV historian Tim Brooks told the trade publication Multichannel News. Watch a writer talk about how "nobody wins" Â» Robert Thompson, the Syracuse University pop culture expert, doubts things will come to that: "When you think about the shows we loved best ... they were told by brilliant writers," he told Multichannel News. (Actually, Brooks is a little off: Broadcast viewership did decline slightly after the 1988 strike, according to Multichannel News, and has been trending downward since the early '90s.) They're generally inexpensive to produce -- and, as many writers noticed during the reality craze earlier this decade, they don't need writers.
