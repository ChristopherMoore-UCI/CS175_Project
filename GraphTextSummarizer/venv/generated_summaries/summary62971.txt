KPIX reported the barge structure will become one of a small fleet of luxury event spaces, complete with party decks, designed to be disassembled and transported via barge or train to other locations. Google's brief statement is consistent with a report last week by CNN affiliate KPIX-TV in San Francisco, which said the mystery barge would house a floating showroom for the company's Google Glass connected eyewear and other products. Sheesh!" Google Glass, worn like regular glasses, has a small high-res display above the user's right eye and lets wearers use voice commands to shoot photos or videos and access e-mail, text messaging and other features. Sadly, none of the above," the company said in a statement e-mailed Wednesday to CNN and other news outlets. "Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology," the statement continued. -- Google has finally broken its silence on the mysterious structure atop a barge floating in the San Francisco Bay.
