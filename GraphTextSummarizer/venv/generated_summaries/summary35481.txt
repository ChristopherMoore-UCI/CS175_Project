As is usually the case in the Internet age, deleting the post did nothing to keep it from being screen-captured and shared widely on social media, where people had some fun with Rivers, who in later years joked frequently about her own death. In it, "Rivers" writes: "I got this one in 2010, and after 4 years, my only complaint is that apps are now designed for bigger screens, and the battery is getting tired." "iPhone is so big, Joan Rivers came back from the dead to endorse it," one Twitter user wrote. Rivers died five days before the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus ("the fat one") were introduced. "This badass is being replaced by an iPhone 6 (not the fat one)," someone wrote, in Rivers' trademark irreverent style, in a post that accompanied a photo of an iPhone 4S Friday morning.
