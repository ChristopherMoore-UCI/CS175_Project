-- Flamboyant fashion designer John Galliano was found guilty Thursday on charges of making anti-Semitic comments against at least three people in a Paris cafe. Galliano was convicted on charges of making public insults based on origin, religious affiliation, race or ethnicity, related to two incidents at the same Paris cafe, one in February this year and one in October 2010. Galliano, who was fired by fashion giant Christian Dior in March after a video surfaced showing him praising Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, testified at the start of the trial in June that drugs were to blame. Galliano has kept a low profile since his firing, but Vanessa Friedman, fashion editor of the Financial Times newspaper, said that given time, he could return to the industry. Galliano testified that he suffered from an increasing workload and that he had had no time to mourn after the 2007 death of his alter ego at Dior, designer Steven Robinson. "With his death, I found I had no protection," Galliano said.
