A survey published in the June issue of Archives of Surgery found that surgical interns believed the new regulations would decrease their time spent operating, acquisition of medical knowledge, development of surgical skills and overall educational experience. So what's the real benefit to reducing resident work hours?

The Archives of Surgery survey also found that the majority of interns believed the new regulations would improve the quality and safety of patient care. Sure, I occasionally caught a few zzz's in the call room, but many nights were spent wide awake taking care of patients.
