-- Fang Lizhi, a famed Chinese democracy activist, has died in the United States, where he fled in exile more than 20 years ago, fellow activists said. Fang died Friday in Tucson, Arizona, according to Wang Dan, a prominent student leader of the 1989 Tiananmen Square student protests. I hope that the Chinese people will forever remember him, that in our history there was a thinker named Fang (Lizhi) who inspired a 1989 generation and awakened the people to aspire to human rights and democracy." He was one of the three noted intellectuals who were publicly criticized during the "anti-bourgeois liberalization" campaign at that time, though Fang continued to speak out for democracy. "My most, most respected teacher Fang Lizhi has died," Wang wrote on Facebook.
