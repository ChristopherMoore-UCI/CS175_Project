The first season of "Homeland" was nothing short of a masterpiece, many critics agreed, and it won award after award. There were episodes devoted to Brody's daughter, which some found grating, and a twist in which Carrie pretended to go off the rails and was sent to a mental facility -- all as part of a plan devised by her and another character, Saul. The show returns after a season which saw the excruciating death of Brody, Carrie's lover and the father of her child (and once a U.S. congressman and terrorist). That's a question that "Homeland" will attempt to answer on Sunday's fourth season premiere. Will you tune in for season four?
