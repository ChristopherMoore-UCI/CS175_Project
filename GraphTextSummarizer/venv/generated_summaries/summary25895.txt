Gursky-Doyen said she would like her graduate student, Nanda Grow, also on the expedition, to return to the field site for her dissertation, to learn more about the number of animals and how altitude and other variables affect them. Over a two-month period, scientists working in Lore Lindu National Park on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi caught and released three pygmy tarsiers. "I do believe that the density of these animals is very low," she said, noting that many villages are located within Lore Lindu National Park. Many scientists had believed them to be extinct until eight years ago, when two scientists trapping rats in Sulawesi accidentally trapped and killed one. And, on the second night of trapping in August on moss-covered, chilly Mt. Rore Katimbo, her group caught the first small nocturnal creature in a mist net.
