Two more wickets fell in the next over bowed by left arm spinner Ravi Jadeja to leave England reeling. Chasing a moderate target, but on a worn pitch taking spin, England looked well-placed to win after a fine stand between Eoin Morgan (33) and Ravi Bopara (30). For India, it's another triumph under the captaincy of MS Dhoni, but victory looked unlikely after a below par batting display, only lifted by an excellent late stand from top scorer Virat Kohli (43) and the ever dangerous Jadeja, who was named man of the match. -- India made Edgbaston a home from home Sunday to beat England by five runs in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy. After rain had reduced the allocated 50 overs per side to just 20 overs each, India successfully defended their 129 for seven score as England fell agonizingly five runs short.
