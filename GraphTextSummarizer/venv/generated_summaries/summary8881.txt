It's almost as if cross-country skiing becomes a form of transportation in and around the area, Bergin said. " The Telemark Resort offers trail passes that are cheaper than most: $11 per day. While the linear path is "not a typical layout" compared to most cross-country loops, Bergin said the trails offer a sense of adventure and exploration. It backs up to the mountains and you've got a great view of a lot of trails," Bergin said. -- Cross-country skiing is less speedy -- and therefore less intimidating -- than its steep-sloped cousin, downhill skiing.
