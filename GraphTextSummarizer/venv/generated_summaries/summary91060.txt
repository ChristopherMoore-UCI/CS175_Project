Northrop Grumman, a defense company with its own system to protect planes from portable missiles, urged the Defense Department in March to install its system on commercial flights that take soldiers and equipment to war zones. The missile-protection equipment will be installed on two more American Airlines 767-200 aircraft for daily cross-country flights through March. "BAE Systems worked closely with DHS and the airline industry to develop an effective response to potential terrorist threats," said Burt Keirstead, JetEye program director for BAE Systems in Nashua, New Hampshire. The plane flew from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport in California, the company said. The JetEye infrared missile-defense system was tested on an American Airlines flight that took off July 11, according to a  statement from BAE Systems.
