Watch Barrett in his shop Â» His small shop is tucked into a corner of a building in Brookline, Massachusetts, on the outskirts of Boston. "I love a new puzzle every day." Seth Barrett is surrounded by scores of projects in his shop, "Village Green Renewal." His shop, "Village Green Renewal," will fix almost anything that can fit in the front door, as long as it doesn't require any kind of special licensing or permits. Barrett hopes that by getting people to repair items instead of replacing them with new ones, it will mean less trash heading for the landfill. "The pigs win it, hands down," Barrett says, referring to a pair of leather pigs that needed some serious stitching up.
