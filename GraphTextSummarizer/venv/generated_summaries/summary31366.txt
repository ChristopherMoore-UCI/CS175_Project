Faulty information: It's not only consumers wanting to sign up for health insurance who are having trouble, but the insurance companies that provide coverage are experiencing difficulties with the exchanges, too. Time: While the exchanges opened on October 1, coverage doesn't begin until January 1, and the deadline for having coverage in place is March 1, so there's still time to sign up. But both HealthCare.gov and the state-run exchange websites are providing detailed information about what people will get and how much it will cost. 1-800-318-2596: That's the number to call if you want to sign up for health insurance by phone; by speaking to an actual person. Justin Nisly, spokesman for Enroll America, said they have nearly doubled the number, from 4,000 to 7,000, working to educate the uninsured about the exchanges and health insurance.
