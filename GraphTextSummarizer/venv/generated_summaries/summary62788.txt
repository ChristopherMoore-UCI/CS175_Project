" The students earned the visit from Obama by winning the Race to the Top Commencement Challenge, a high school competition in its second year in which high school students write essays and create videos to show how their school is innovative in education. For a long time, just a handful headed to college each year," President Barack Obama pointed out in his address to the students. That represents the American spirit at it's best," said Kriner Cash, Memphis superintendent of schools. The students, bedecked in green-and-yellow caps and gowns, erupted in applause and tears of joy when the president appeared to tell them how inspired he was with their accomplishment of graduating high school. Graduate Catron Roland attributed his success in school to his teachers, who he said pushed him to succeed.
