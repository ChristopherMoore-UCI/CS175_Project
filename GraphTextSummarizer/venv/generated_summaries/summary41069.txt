Those shoes were not with Lennon's body when he arrived at the state medical examiner's office, according to the NAACP review. However, she says, local and state investigators have done neither to support their theory that Lennon Lacy hanged himself one summer night. Instead, a department spokesperson confirmed the exchanges through a written statement: "The comments that were released by the NAACP were a synopsis of a professional exchange between the NAACP's independently-retained forensic pathologist and Dr. Radisch," according to a spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. Lacy says she told investigators that the belts used to fashion the noose did not belong to Lennon. "He may have either been strangled somewhere else or been placed there or he was hung there while people were around watching him die," Lennon's older brother, Pierre Lacey says.
