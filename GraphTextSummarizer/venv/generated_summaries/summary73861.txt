The law does not specifically mention the World War I massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians by Ottoman Turks. "He massacred democracy," announced another newspaper, Hurriyet, next to a front-page photo of French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Many Turkish politicians and historians argue Muslim Turks were also massacred by Armenian militias in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish leader said his government would lobby for a petition of 60 French lawmaker signatures to block the law in France's Constitutional Council. Turkish politicians have warned of further sanctions against France if Sarkozy allows the new law to go into effect.
