Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Kaim accused Qatar late Wednesday of providing rebels in eastern Libya with anti-tank warheads, but he did not say when. A week ago, a CNN team in eastern Libya saw the rebels with anti-tank missiles, which they didn't have before. Are they those who hold RPGs and other weapons?" The emir of Qatar, meanwhile, told CNN "it's possible" weapons provided by his state have reached Libyan rebels in the past two days. To the west, in Tripoli, antiaircraft fire followed several thunderous explosions, and Libyan state television reported civilian casualties from NATO airstrikes. The organization said the boat was carrying hundreds of tons of medical aid to Misrata and was en route to the port.
