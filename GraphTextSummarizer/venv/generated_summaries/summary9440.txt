Former police officer Rolando Mendoza, upset at having lost his job, held a busload of tourists from Hong Kong hostage in Manila on Monday, and killed eight of them before being shot dead. The tour group was scheduled to leave for Hong Kong early Wednesday evening with about 60 officials and family members on a chartered flight from Manila. Amy Leung was enjoying the last day of a family holiday in Manila when the gunman boarded with an M16 automatic rifle. -- The wife of one of the victims of the Philippines bus gunman has told reporters that she pretended to be dead in order to survive. Her husband and two daughters were killed in the ensuing gun battle, and her son is being treated in intensive care for injuries he sustained.
