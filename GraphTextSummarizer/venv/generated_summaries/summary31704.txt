Companies such as Ryno Motors in the United States and Airwheel in the UK are producing unicycles with internal stabilizers that will scoot a passenger along at 12mph. "We got an email from a disabled user who had mobility problems who was now able to go on nature walks with her partner -- they would hold hands and actually go quite some distance off-road with these which really opened up a new lease of life for her," Parham said. "It really feels like you're gliding on nothing," said Parham, a former stuntman in James Bond films. But the proof of the pudding, as they say, is in the eating and Airwheel say that "posties" -- as mailmen are called in Britain -- have taken to its ease of use and rugged go-anywhere design. "In many ways, it feels like technology and science is headed in that direction; towards that mode of transport."
