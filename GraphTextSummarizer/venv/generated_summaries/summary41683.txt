In Honduras, the coup prompted an unprecedented international rejection; in Israel, international reproach has mounted over time, with the flotilla attack providing the most recent justification for anti-Israel rhetoric. Like Micheletti, Netanyahu can likely withstand the current crisis by turning his back on the storm of international criticism and celebrating Israel's avowed defense of its sovereignty against Islamist extremists. Reacting only hours after the incident, Turkey's prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said that Israel's actions were "totally contrary to the principles of international law," branding them as "state terrorism." After both events, officials in power in Israel and Honduras resorted to similar narratives: The world misunderstood them and underestimated the threats they faced. In both countries, the sitting governments explained that the world did not fully grasp the perilous, external threat they face -- in Honduras, chavismo (the left-wing ideology associated with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's government); in Israel, the existential threat of Hamas and Iran.
