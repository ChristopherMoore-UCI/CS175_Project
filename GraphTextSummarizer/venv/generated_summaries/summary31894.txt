ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, has taken over swaths of land in Syria and Iraq and carried out barbaric killings. In the video, he shows parts of Aleppo, saying the destruction is caused not only by the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad but also U.S.-led coalition airstrikes. ISIS has released a new video in which a captive British journalist acts as though he is reporting on Aleppo in Syria. Cantlie was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley. John Cantlie, who has appeared in previous ISIS videos, calls this one the "last in this series."
