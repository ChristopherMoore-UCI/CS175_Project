Reel said she is "relieved" by the settlement and would like to look for a new job, probably in another state.

Reel said she made multiple requests for a transfer from the school before filing a discrimination lawsuit. " When she took the job at the Brooklyn high school, Reel said, she had already been teaching at the high school level for seven years.

"Every school year I hoped the situation would get better but it didn't," Reel said.
