Attack targets polio workers in Pakistan, kills 11 CNN's Sophia Saifi and Saima Mohsin reported from Islamabad, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. Two militants threw hand grenades, fired guns and then blew themselves up at the district court building, said Sikander Hayat, inspector general of Islamabad police. The court building is in an upmarket residential district in central Islamabad. Attacks of this nature are rare in Pakistan's heavily policed capital. The Pakistani Taliban, which on Saturday declared a month-long cease-fire, denied any involvement with the Islamabad attack Monday.
