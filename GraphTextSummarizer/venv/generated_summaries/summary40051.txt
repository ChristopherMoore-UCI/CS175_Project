Kids are living in this world where the line between what's real and what's not really is blurry, and because they have such vivid imaginations, witches and monsters can feel very real. I wouldn't have thought that until she said it, but it made me more thoughtful about all the other movies -- great movies -- that have scary witches and themes in them. Highlighting that and making it feel important -- your sister, your brother, your mom and dad -- is something little kids can really identify with. This was something that little kids under 5 aren't going to have nightmares about. These are serious issues and themes, and sometimes little kids aren't ready to process and understand these ideas.
