One resident of nearby Port Royal said by telephone that people are staying out of Kingston -- even failing to show up for work or school -- because they do not want to get caught in violence. " Violet Dias, an American citizen from New York, said Tuesday she was locked down in her home in Kingston's Tivoli Gardens neighborhood because of the violence. They were met with violence that has left at least 29 people dead, including police, a soldier and many civilians. People can get essentials in Port Royal, but many go into Kingston to shop, he said, declining to give his name. It's a similar situation to after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks in the United States," one Kingston florist told CNN.
