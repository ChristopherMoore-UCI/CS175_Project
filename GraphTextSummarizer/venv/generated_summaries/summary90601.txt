Swimmers' grueling training schedules, combined with their larger bodies, mean they require many more calories than most other top athletes, James says. Lewis James, a lecturer in nutrition at the UK's Loughborough University, told CNN. " "You've got someone who has a higher requirement (for calories) but technically has less hours to consume that requirement because he's in a pool for three to four hours a day. -- He's used to making waves in the pool, but Ryan Lochte has caused a few ripples of excitement on social media after tweeting out a photo of himself in front of what he claims was 10,000 calories worth of food, including piles of chicken and asparagus. "Everyone should be working hard to make sure they have got the appropriate diet for their sport or their event, making sure they are well fed and have consumed the right nutrients at the right times so that we can really maximize performance," James says.
