The High Roller Ferris wheel is part of "the LINQ," a Caesars Entertainment-created shopping and entertainment district. Ticket prices range from $24.95 for a standard day ticket to $59.95 for the express that allows you to board anytime without waiting in line. Riders will get a 30-minute ride and view of the city in one of two booths in each of the wheel's 28 Italian glass cabins, each 44,000 pounds in weight. Check out the gallery to see how it compares to other favorites around the world. The wheel received its operating license on Friday.
