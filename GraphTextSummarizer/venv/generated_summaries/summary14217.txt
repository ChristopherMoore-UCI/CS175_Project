Mexicans feeling persecuted flee U.S. That's why outgoing Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Thursday sent to the Mexican Congress a piece of legislation to change the country's name officially to simply Mexico. After gaining independence from Spain in 1821, Mexico officially became the "United Mexican States." In announcing his decision to propose officially changing his country's name, Calderon said Thursday the name United Mexican States was originally taken because back in 1824 the United States of America was an example of democracy and liberty for the new independent nations in the Americas. But the reality is the official name is used only by Mexican officials who deal with diplomatic protocol and official documents pertaining to international relations. The American independence movement had inspired Mexican leaders of that era and since Mexico, in fact, also was a territory composed of states, the name stuck and became official in 1824.
