According to "Family Guy" executive producer Steve Callaghan, creator Seth MacFarlane is a "big fan of 'The Sopranos' and always loved Tony Sirico in particular, and he thought it would be fun to write a character based around his voice and his personality," he told E! News. Naturally, fans don't know what to make of this shocking news, with some having suggestions for another character who could've said goodbye: To make matters worse, the series has replaced Brian with another pup named Vinny, voiced by "The Sopranos' " Tony Sirico. Apparently, the idea to kill off Brian was thrown out into the writers room, and "it sort of caught fire" as "a fun way to shake things up." "Our fans are smart enough and have been loyal to our show for long enough, to know that they can trust us," he told E!. On Sunday's episode of the animated Fox series, the Griffin family pooch, Brian, was killed.
