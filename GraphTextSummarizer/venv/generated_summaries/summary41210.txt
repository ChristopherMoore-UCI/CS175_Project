" Kessel's encyclopedic knowledge of the region made him a favorite of CNN producers when news broke. "If the producer said in his ear, 'keep going' there would be a hint of a smile, and he would keep right on going," said CNN Senior Editorial Director Richard Griffiths. -- CNN colleagues have been paying tribute to the network's former Jerusalem correspondent Jerrold Kessel, who died Thursday at age 65 after a long battle with cancer. "Jerrold worked for CNN for 13 years from 1990 to 2003 during some of the most spectacular highs and lows of the Middle East and was one of the network's regular reporting faces from the region," said Jerusalem Bureau Chief Kevin Flower. He was a widely published print reporter who worked for the Jerusalem Post and Israel Radio before joining CNN as a field producer, then correspondent and deputy bureau chief.
