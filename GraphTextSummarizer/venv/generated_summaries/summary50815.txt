Janet Evans, at 5-foot-6 and 108 pounds, is now 40 years old, and just as Dara Torres made an extraordinary comeback at age 41 to be the oldest swimmer in the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, Evans is now seeking her own Act 2. In a recent interview with CNN at her Huntington Beach, California, training facility about 35 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles, Evans said she has been working out five hours a day -- with her husband spending more time taking care of their two small children. But she admits to having an occasional bad night of sleep because her daughter or son is up at night. Her trainer, Mark Schubert, said returning to swimming shape wasn't easy for Evans. Evans' husband, Bill Wilson, said his admiration for his wife has grown.
