Mega Millions mystery winner about to emerge Clayton, a Lincoln Park resident, faces two felony counts of welfare fraud after being investigated by the Department of Human Services and the Office of Inspector General. Amanda Clayton, 25, collected thousands of dollars in state assistance for months after she won $1 million in the 'Make Me Rich" game sponsored by the Michigan lottery, a statement from state officials said. "That commitment to investigation and uncovering the truth, combined with the new law recently enacted by the legislature and signed by the governor, will make it easier to ensure that outrages involving instant millionaires on public assistance don't happen in the future," said Maura Corrigan, director of the state's Department of Human Services.
