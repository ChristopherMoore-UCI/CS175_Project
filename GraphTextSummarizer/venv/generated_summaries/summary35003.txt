The Supremacy Clause gives preference to federal laws over state laws. Opponents worry such laws could all but end any joint operations between local and federal law enforcement agencies when it comes to taking guns off the streets. "There are people saying this is the same as seceding from the Union," said gun owner Kevin Jamison. The measure, HB 436, would have essentially nullified federal gun laws in the state. And it would have nullified federal gun laws and allowed citizens to take legal action against officers who try to enforce them.
