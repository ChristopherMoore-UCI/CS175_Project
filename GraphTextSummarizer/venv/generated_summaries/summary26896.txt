As CNNMoney reports, Apple shares fell below $600 earlier this week after a management shakeup and mixed iPad Mini reviews. In Hong Kong, the sale brought out the Apple faithful such as Thomas Wu, who added the Mini to his collection of products that include the iPhone, iTouch and iPad. Scott Forstall, one of the late Steve Jobs' top lieutenants, also was shown the door after some recent missteps, including Apple's heavily criticized release of Apple Maps -- which led to an apology from Apple CEO Tim Cook. The cost of the new iPad Mini was a chief complaint among reviewers when the tablet was previewed by the press last week. However, more than 750 people lined up to buy the tablet -- or other Apple gadgets -- Friday morning outside Apple's flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York City, according to Fortune's Philip Elmer DeWitt.
