It is a series of art, music and photography workshops, often aimed at refugees or people who have never been interested in art before. "It's almost an impossible situation but we wanted to go on because if we don't go on people will lose hope," said Touma. He said: "Many people are living in the street or in the entrance of buildings, in schools, in churches, in gardens, many families are living together without much space. "These are people who have had to leave their homes, who have never been to a gallery before and now they are turning up to do art and see art. I will never forget those nine days in all my life." Amnesty International said in a report on August 23 that civilians had borne the brunt of air strikes, mortar and artillery attacks on residential areas, with scores of people not involved in the conflict killed and injured.
