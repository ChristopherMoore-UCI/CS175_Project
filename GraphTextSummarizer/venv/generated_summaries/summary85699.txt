As South Sudan and Sudan continue to battle over border and oil issues, 37,000 refugees in South Sudan's Jamam camp are running out of time, Oxfam said. South Sudan split from Sudan last year as part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. Simmering tensions peaked this month when South Sudan seized the oil-producing region of Heglig from Sudan, raising the stakes by targeting a resource that fuels the economies of both nations. Sudan claims ownership for the region, and lodged complaints with the United Nations and the African Union to pressure South Sudan to withdraw troops from its territory. A day after South Sudan withdrew from the disputed region, it accused Sudan of launching ground and aerial attacks on its territory.
