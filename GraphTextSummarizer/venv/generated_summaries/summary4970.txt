The win sees Brazil move onto 24 points, level with former leaders Paraguay who relinquished top spot after a shock 2-0 home defeat at the hands of Chile. With only the leading four teams guaranteed a place in South Africa next year, fifth-placed Uruguay now appear to have a mountain to climb, as they trail Argentina by five points with just five matches remaining. Goals from Matias Fernandez in the 12th minute and Humberto Suazo in the 50th gave Chile a crucial win, lifting them up to third place -- just a single point off the top two. The fifth-placed team will have North America's fourth-placed side in a play-off for the remaining World Cup qualification place. Barcelona full-back Daniel Alves gave them an 11th-minute lead with a speculative long-range effort that goalkeeper Sebastian Viera allowed to bounce over him and into the net.
