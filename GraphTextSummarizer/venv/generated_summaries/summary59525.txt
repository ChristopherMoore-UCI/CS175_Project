McCain's ads have also shown up on a pro-Clinton Web site named "Obama WTF" that accuses Obama of being "spineless," having "communist influences," "courting Jew haters" and being "in the pocket of America haters." SavagePolitics.com, another anti-Obama site that has run McCain ads, has called Obama a "bold faced liar, a thief, a sexist and a racist." John McCain's campaign says it's getting its ads off Web sites that vilify Barack Obama. -- John McCain's campaign will stop advertising on several Web sites that have vilified Barack Obama as unpatriotic and, in one case, compared the Democratic nominee-in-waiting to Adolf Hitler. McCain has made it known he is reaching out to former Clinton supporters, and there are nearly two hundred well-trafficked blogs and online communities run by former Clinton supporters who refuse to support Obama. That's because the campaign uses a third-party vendor -- in this case, Google -- to distribute their banner ads across a broad array of political Web sites by searching for certain key words.
