"She had a smile on her face, like she always does when she comes in here," said clerk Rebecca Guerrero, whom FBI agents interviewed Saturday about conversations she'd had with Bradley. Flanked by family members wearing T-shirts with a picture of Lisa and the word "Kidnapped" above it, investigator Bill Stanton said Tuesday night that he wants a "happy ending" to the case. "We are here to cooperate with anyone and everyone that will help us find the guilty party and return Lisa home safely," he said. Surveillance video recorded at a grocery store on October 3 shows Bradley and a man purchasing the items from Guerrero the day before 11-month-old Lisa Irwin was reported missing. "We would just pretty much talk about what they've been doing, stuff like that; the children, her two sons, and then when she found out she was pregnant with Lisa, that's all we talked about," Guerrero said.
