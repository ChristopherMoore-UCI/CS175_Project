The UK government Tuesday blocked the extradition of computer hacker Gary McKinnon to the United States to face trial for what the U.S. government says is the biggest military computer hacking of all time. A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity. McKinnon has admitted to breaking into computers at NASA and the Pentagon but says he did so to find out if the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs. In one case, McKinnon allegedly crashed computers belonging to the Military District of Washington. However, under Britain's Extradition Act of 2003, U.S. prosecutors are not required to provide such evidence.
