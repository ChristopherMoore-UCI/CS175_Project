" Lucy Liu: Syria's children deserve chance to be kids again Dr. Ibrahim becomes emotional when he speaks of young patients he has encountered. Their father sped through the streets desperate to flee shelling that was destroying their neighborhood in Dara'a, in southwest Syria. The indiscriminate shelling and bombing of villages and the destruction of schools and hospitals have forced Syrian youngsters and their families to take flight. Like others in Jordan, Ibrahim monitors YouTube channels posted by doctors in field hospitals in Syria. He remembers 4-year-old Mohammed, who crossed into Jordan from Syria with two broken legs, a fractured skull, two broken arms and a smashed pelvis after his home caved in during intensive shelling.
