President Barack Obama hailed Ghana as a "model for democracy" during a meeting with the nation's leader that addressed issues ranging from democracy to economic ties. In Obama's address to the nation's parliament, he applauded government leaders for a peaceful transfer of power during prior elections,  a rarity in African polls. Last year, Obama hosted various African heads of state, including the presidents of Benin, Guinea and Niger. The leaders said their meeting addressed various issues, including economic growth, increasing commercial and investment ties, and other bilateral and regional concerns. On Thursday,  Mills visited the White House, a trip Obama described as a chance to reciprocate the hospitality he got in the West African nation.
