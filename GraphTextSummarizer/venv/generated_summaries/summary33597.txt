Fahey said doping is not just a problem in successful sporting countries like Kenya and Jamaica, but rejected the notion performance-enhancing drugs were beginning to ruin sport. " WADA's role in the fight against doping in sport has been in the spotlight in recent months after a string of athletes failed tests in Kenya and Jamaica. " As for athletics, Fahey acknowledged that doping is "widespread" and said part of the reason might be that there are different resources available to tackle the problem in different countries. -- World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) president John Fahey has told CNN he doesn't think Novak Djokovic "has the faintest idea" what his organization does after the former world No. 1 said he'd lost faith in the system. There had been a suggestion that certain countries could be banned from the Olympics if they refused to comply with anti-doping programs -- raising the prospect of Jamaica's six-time Olympic champion Usain Bolt missing out -- but Fahey said that was for the International Olympic Committee to determine.
