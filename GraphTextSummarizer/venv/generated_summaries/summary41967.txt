Tsunami warnings were issued Friday for at least 20 countries and numerous Pacific islands, including Japan, coastal Russia and the Marcus Islands, the Northern Marianas, Wake Island, Taiwan and Guam. List of countries threatened by tsunami Tsunamis are a series of long ocean waves that can last five to 15 minutes and cause extensive flooding in coastal areas. The West Coast and Alaska Tsunami Warning Center early Friday issued a tsunami warning for coastal areas along the United States and Canadian west coasts. A succession of waves can hit -- often the highest not being the first, said CNN International meteorologist Ivan Cabrera. Japan's NHK showed footage of cars, boats and buildings -- some of them ablaze -- being swept inland in Miyagi Prefecture.
