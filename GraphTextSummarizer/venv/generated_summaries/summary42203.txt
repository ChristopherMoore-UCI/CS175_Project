Congress: 12 work days to compromise on border crisis " A national protest day This weekend, at least 11 groups are organizing what they describe as "the largest coordinated protest against all forms of amnesty, comprehensive immigration reform, and the government's failure to enforce immigration laws and secure our borders will begin, all across America." Tuesday's protest came a day after the federal government deported its first group of the recent wave of undocumented Central American immigrants to Honduras. On July 1, a wall of angry protesters blocked three buses of undocumented immigrants from entering their community and forced them to turn around. Even though a majority back the President's proposal, only a third of Americans give Obama a thumbs-up on how he's handling the issue of undocumented immigrants entering the country, and only 23% of those questioned say they approve of how congressional Republicans are dealing with the crisis.
