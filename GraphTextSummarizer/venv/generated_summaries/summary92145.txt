Hagupit has had a powerful impact across several major Philippine islands, driving hundreds of thousands of people from their houses, tearing down trees and causing floods. Humanitarian workers were also facing challenges coping with the sheer number of people relying on evacuation centers for support. Officials revised the death toll downward to 25 from 27 on Wednesday after two people were found alive, Philippine Red Cross Chairman Richard Gordon told CNN. But officials praised the success of efforts to relocate large numbers of people away from vulnerable coastal areas, citing fears of a repeat of last year's devastation as a motivating factor. It brought fierce winds and torrential rain to roughly the same region ravaged by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November last year.
