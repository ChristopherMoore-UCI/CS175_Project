Facebook investigates each report and may send a suicidal person an e-mail offering phone numbers for suicide hot lines, he said. "In times of crisis, it's important to try to help people by quickly providing information," the spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. In addition to phone support, the lifeline will now let Facebook users communicate with suicide prevention specialists in a Web chat room, the statement said. Mechanisms in place in Facebook's system and in Google's search engine can look for suicidal messages and direct people to help. That feature has been around since at least the summer, but Facebook said in a statement on Tuesday that it is expanding a partnership with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
