Other celebrities that have owned equestrian estates include musician Bruce Springsteen, whose daughter is an avid equestrian competitor and actor Tommy Lee Jones who once owned a 52-acre polo ranch. "All three structures, the main house, guest house, and barn were built to exceed Miami/Dade hurricane specifications with impact glass and reinforced rebar concrete roofs, walls, and floors, and multiple generators," said Sotheby's. Located in the gated community of Ranch Colony in Jupiter, Florida, the property, described by Sotheby's as "Spanish/Mediterranean," also includes a heated saltwater pool, a chef's kitchen and an observation lounge offering panoramic views of the ranch. Former FedEx CEO Ted Weise is selling his 50-acre equestrian estate in Florida, which includes scenic horse riding trails and a riding arena. This is an equestrian lover's dream, boasting fully equipped eight-stall stables, a riding and jumping arena, eight turnout paddocks, and riding trails that wind through cypress and pine trees -- not to mention a 20,000-acre nature reserve surrounding the grounds.
