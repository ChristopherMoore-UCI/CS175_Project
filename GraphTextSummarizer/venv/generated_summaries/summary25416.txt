CNN took the pulse of voters in auto towns in Wisconsin, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio -- important states that could make or break Election Day for Obama and Romney. Pitcher, an electrician at one of four Kokomo Chrysler plants, counters, "Romney might be able to create jobs, but they're gonna pay $7 or $8 an hour Numbers don't mean anything in the creation of jobs if they're not quality jobs." As Obama makes a second journey down the campaign trail, he's touting the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler -- and you can bet he'll continue to do so. But this year Indiana is leaning toward Romney -- and Ohio is a tossup.
