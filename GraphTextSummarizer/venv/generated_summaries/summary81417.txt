Blaming a weekend of bad winter weather and new Federal Aviation Administration rules on pilot duty times, JetBlue canceled nearly all operations from Monday afternoon into Tuesday morning at Logan, New York's John F. Kennedy International and LaGuardia airports, and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. You might have to wait until your flight crew rests up if your travel includes Boston's Logan International Airport or the three New York City-area airports. The new rules require a minimum 10-hour rest period for pilots before their flight duty period, which can range from nine to 14 hours, depending on the start time and the number of flight segments and time zones crossed. While saying JetBlue was prepared for the new rules that increase rest requirements for pilots, scheduling pilots and crews is a "delicate" operation under normal circumstances, spokeswoman Tamara Young wrote via e-mail. "In the midst of us repairing those schedules disrupted by this week's winter storms, we're facing an additional challenge as new FAA rules went into effect for crew rest," she wrote.
