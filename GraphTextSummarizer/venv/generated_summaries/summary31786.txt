He removed Yuvraj for 62, caught behind, then soon afterwards had India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni caught at second slip by James Anderson.

"It's always nice to get a hat-trick anywhere but to get it at Trent Bridge is special," Broad told Sky Sports. Dravid and Yuvraj Singh had taken India to 258 for four wickets with a stand of 128 until Broad struck.
