But Birmingham were also dangerous in sporadic attacks and substitute Jean Beausejour set up Keith Fahey for a 57th minute shot against the foot of the post with Szczesny well beaten. The Nigerian international pounced after a dreadful mix-up between Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny and defender Laurent Koscielny gifted him a chance he gratefully accepted. A clever pass from Zigic sent Lee Bowyer racing through on goal and the midfielder rounded Szczesny only to be brought down by the giant keeper. After the exchange of first half goals, a header after a corner for the giant Zigic, and a fine volley by Dutch star van Persie, Arsenal, bidding for a quadruple, looked the more dangerous. TV replays showed Bacary Sagna had been playing Bowyer yards onside.
