A Dutchman rented a crane intending to reach his girlfriend's window Saturday morning and pop the question, Dutch affiliate RTL News said. Tell that to the residents of 32 homes in the Dutch town of Ijsselstein, who were evacuated after a planned marriage proposal fell through. Instead, the crane tipped over, crashing through the roof of a neighboring home. Hours later, during an attempt to right the crane, it fell through the roof again, making the hole bigger. As a result, residents of 32 homes were evacuated as a recovery company made another attempt to stabilize the crane.
