The SOHR said an ISIS fighter took down a regime fighter jet over Raqqa, a stronghold of ISIS. Well over 190,000 people have died in Syria in the country's three-year civil war, which is now complicated by violent takeovers of cities by the militant group ISIS.

The staggering death toll from the Syrian conflict has grown even further as at least 200 people were killed Tuesday, an opposition group said.
