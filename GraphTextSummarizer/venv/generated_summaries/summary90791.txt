-- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin charged into the culture wars Saturday in Pennsylvania, painting Sen. Barack Obama as a radical on abortion rights. I've said it before, and I'll say it again -- Sen. McCain has served this country with honor, and he deserves our thanks for that," Obama told an early morning crowd assembled in the northern part of the city. "Sen. McCain's campaign manager actually said that Sen. McCain wasn't talking about the market because there's just not much a candidate for president can say -- and they aren't sure what he'd say each day even if he did talk about it," Obama said. Watch McCain tell voters not to be afraid of Obama Â» " Obama opposes any constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade and disagreed with Supreme Court ruling to uphold the "Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act."
