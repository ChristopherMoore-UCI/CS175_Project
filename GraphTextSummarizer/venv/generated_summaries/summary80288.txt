Photos: Madonna Strikes Many Poses "She has no mandate to decide where she wants to build a school because she doesn't know our needs and where we want new schools," Chide told Reuters. According to Neilson, Madonna's Raising Malawi organization had communicated with Malawi's Minister of Education and that buildOn had discussed the project with local officials and "cleared all plans for school construction with them. Malawi's Ministry of Education spokeswoman Lindiwe Chide told Reuters that the government was "fed up" with the pop icon, complaining that she did not inform authorities when she scrapped plans for a girls academy due to the alleged mismanagement of funds. "Now she decides to announce that she plans to build 10 schools without getting authority from us again," Chide said of the singer's partnership with the non-profit organization buildOn. The government of Malawi has accused Madonna of refusing consultation over her plans to build 10 new schools in the impoverished African nation.
