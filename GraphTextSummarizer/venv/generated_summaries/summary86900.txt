Having overtaken overnight leader Jim Furyk at Oak Hill on Sunday, Dufner carried an advantage down the stretch and didn't buckle to beat his fellow American by two shots. Two years ago at the same tournament, Dufner led by five shots in the dying stages but he crumbled and eventually lost in a playoff to pal Keegan Bradley. Defending champion Rory McIlroy had an outside shot of catching the leaders, six shots behind Furyk entering Sunday. "To come back from a couple of years ago, when I lost to Keegan in the playoff, feels really, really good," Dufner said in a televised interview. "I decided I was going to be confident, put my best foot forward, be aggressive and try to win this thing, not be scared or too soft," Dufner said.
