McEwen had never spoken publicly about her relationship with Thomas until the recent revelation that Thomas' wife, conservative activist Virginia Thomas, left a voicemail for Anita Hill asking her to apologize for her 1991 testimony at the confirmation hearing. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was a binge drinker who had a pornography habit or fetish in the 1980s, then changed radically when he stopped drinking alcohol, his former girlfriend told CNN on Monday. Thomas almost had his Supreme Court nomination derailed when another woman, Anita Hill, accused him of sexual harassment when they worked together in the 1980s at the U.S. Department of Education and then the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. McEwen, a former prosecutor and administrative law judge who has written her own memoir and is seeking a publisher, said she believed Hill's account of sexually suggestive statements by Thomas because of his use of pornography. Asked if she believed back then he was qualified to reach his goal of being a Supreme Court justice, McEwen said it was a difficult question and cited "instability," a "lack of intellectual curiosity," and trouble with concentrating when reading for a long time as issues about Thomas that would make it difficult to do the job.
