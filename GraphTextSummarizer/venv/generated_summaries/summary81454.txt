To get iTunes Match, just upgrade your iTunes version to 10.5.1, click the iTunes Match link on the iTunes Store page, and sign up using your Apple ID and your favorite credit card. iTunes Match also takes care of songs that weren't purchased from iTunes. iTunes 10.5.1 is now available, and with it comes iTunes Match, Apple's cloud-based music subscription service. Registration availability is currently a bit spotty as users flock to download iTunes Match, so you may get a message (like in the screenshot above) that tells you new iTunes Match subscriptions are unavailable, and to check back in an hour or two. iTunes Match has been available exclusively for developers since late August, and was supposed to land by the end of October.
