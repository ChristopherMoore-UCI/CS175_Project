Defending motorcycle champion Marc Coma of Spain won Wednesday's 362km fourth stage of the Dakar Rally from San Juan to Chilecito, although the Spaniard still trails KTM team-mate Cyril Despres in the overall standings. The 46-year-old Mini driver finished five minutes and 19 seconds ahead of Argentinian Orlando Terranova in a Toyota, while South African Giniel De Villiers was third, also in a Toyota. Peterhansel leads De Villiers by 5:41 in the overall standings, but defending champion Nasser Al-Attiyah of Qatar is now over 30 minutes behind in seventh place after his Hummer broke down. "I was able to overtake a few drivers and gain some time on Cyril and I will keep on fighting every day. " Meanwhile, nine-time overall winner Stephane Peterhansel took the lead in the car section after coming home first in Wednesday's stage.
