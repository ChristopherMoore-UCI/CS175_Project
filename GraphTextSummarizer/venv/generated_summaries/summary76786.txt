In Larache in northwest Morocco, a representative of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights reported that protesters set fire to a police station, robbed stores and attempted to break into banks, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds also demonstrated in Casablanca, Marrakesh and Agadir, Human Rights Watch said, as well as in the Rif, the mountainous area in northern Morocco. "Unlike most Arab countries, rallies and protests are common in Morocco," said Khalid Naciri, communication minister and government spokesman. In Rabat, Morocco's capital, an estimated 2,000 demonstrators gathered at Bab al-Had Square and marched to parliament, where they chanted slogans calling for change, including "Down with tyranny" and "The people demand change," according to Human Rights Watch. The demonstrators were calling for political reform, according to Human Rights Watch.
