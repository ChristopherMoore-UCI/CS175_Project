-- A man suspected of kidnapping and sexually assaulting an 18-year-old woman was shot by his captive, police in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, said Friday after the man's body was discovered in neighboring Mississippi. The incident began Wednesday afternoon when police say suspect Stephen Cronk, 58, asked the woman to meet at a Mount Juliet gas station after she got off work. While he was doing so, she managed to get control of the gun and shot him in the stomach, according to Aberdeen Police Chief Henry Randle. Cronk proceeded to restrain the woman to the seat using duct tape, police said, then drove to a hotel in Aberdeen, Mississippi, about 250 miles away. The woman has been returned to her family in Gallatin, Tennessee, Mount Juliet police said.
