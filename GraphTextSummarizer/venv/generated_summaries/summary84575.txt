-- Maria Elena Bergoglio was in her home west of Buenos Aires last week when she heard the shocking news: Jorge Mario Bergoglio -- her brother -- was the new pope. She dismissed concerns raised by critics who accuse Francis of being complicit with Argentina's brutal military dictatorship from the 1970s -- an accusation the Catholic Church denies. New pope explains his new name CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Jose Manuel Rodriguez reported from Buenos Aires. Standing outside her house in a middle-class area about 45 minutes from Argentina's capital, she laughed Monday as she described his comments. Her brother, who chose the name Pope Francis, told her not to worry and reassured her he was well -- something she's also seen watching his face as the events of recent days unfolded on television.
