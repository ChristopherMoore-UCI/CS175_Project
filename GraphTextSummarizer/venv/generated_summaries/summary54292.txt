-- FBI agents raided the offices of California state Sen. Ron Calderon and the Latino legislative caucus on Tuesday. "This afternoon, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation served search warrants in the State Capitol at the office of Sen. Ron Calderon and in the Legislative Office Building at the Latino Legislative Caucus office," Tony Beard, chief sergeant at arms for the California Senate, said in a statement. The Senate has and will continue to fully cooperate with the agents in this matter." Calderon, a Democrat, represents the city of Montebello in Los Angeles County. But his attorney, Mark Geragos -- a high-profile lawyer who has represented Michael Jackson, among other celebrities -- said the raid is "an example of how out-of-control this Department of Justice is. "Senator Calderon is a victim of this agency that has no moral compass."
