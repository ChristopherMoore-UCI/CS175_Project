Manchester United defender Evra accused his Liverpool opponent of racially abusing him during Saturday's 1-1 Premier League draw, and the English Football Association said it would investigate after match referee Andre Marriner reported the incident. Suarez denied the claims in a statement on his Facebook page, but United manager Alex Ferguson told reporters on Monday that Evra stands by his comments to French television channel Canal Plus. It is as simple as that." Ferguson said Evra would be in contention to play in Romania, with last season's Champions League finalists United seeking to kickstart a faltering European campaign after picking up just two points from two Group C matches. He is adamant he wants to follow it on," Ferguson said ahead of Tuesday's Champions League clash with Romanian minnows Otelul Galati. There is no problem," he said, while confirming that England striker Wayne Rooney would play despite Sunday's top-of-the-table derby clash with Manchester City looming.
