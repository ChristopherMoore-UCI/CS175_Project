Ronaldo matches La Liga scoring record A statement on UEFA's web site read: "The report lodged by Real Madrid CF concerning racial abuse against Marcelo by FC Barcelona player Sergio Busquets has been dismissed due to a lack of strong and convincing evidence. Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets is free to play in the Champions League final against Manchester United after UEFA dismissed an allegation of racism by Real Madrid. Real posted a video on their official web site which, they claimed, showed Busquets shouting towards Marcelo during their match at the Bernabeu. " UEFA also confirmed they had dismissed an appeal from by Real regarding to an original complaint they had made about the behavior of Barcelona's players during the first leg in Madrid. An ill-tempered semifinal that saw two players sent off and Real manager Jose Mourinho sent to the stands finished 2-0 to Spanish champions Barca, who then secured their place in the final with a 1-1 draw in the second leg at the Nou Camp.
