"This has not changed the underlying nature of Skype's peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture, in which supernodes simply allow users to find one another (calls do not pass through supernodes). Chaim Haas, the spokesman, would not say, for instance, if the update actually enabled the company to tap into and record Skype calls. Until recently, those supernodes were other Skype users who had fast Internet connections and could handle the work. "As part of our ongoing commitment to continually improve the Skype user experience, we developed supernodes, which can be located on dedicated servers within secure datacenters," the statement from Skype says. The video calling service Skype recently made a change to how it routes calls.
