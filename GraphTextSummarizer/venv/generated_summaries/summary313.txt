-- A New Jersey teachers union is coming under fire after an internal memo included a veiled threat to Gov. Chris Christie. "But I am sure there are teachers all across New Jersey when they learn about this today who are going to be ashamed." The incident comes as Christie and the New Jersey Education Association are entrenched in a bitter struggle over funding for New Jersey's school system. "This year you have taken away my favorite actor, Patrick Swayze, my favorite actress, Farrah Fawcett, my favorite singer, Michael Jackson, and my favorite salesman, Billy Mays. Seeking to address an $11 billion budget deficit, Christie, a Republican who was elected in November, has proposed severe cuts to the state's education system, with teachers being hit especially hard.
