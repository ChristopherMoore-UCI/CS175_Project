-- Just six months after leading Chelsea to European Champions League and English FA Cup glory Roberto di Matteo has been sacked by the English Premier League club. Former Chelsea midfielder Di Matteo took over first team duties following the sacking of Andre Villas-Boas in March 2011. The former West Bromwich Albion manager guided Chelsea to English FA Cup success, beating Liverpool 2-1 in the final, before leading the west London club to its first Champions League triumph in May. In order to reach the last 16 of the Champions League, Chelsea must beat Danish side Nordsjaelland in the final round of group matches and hope Ukrainian group leaders Shakhtar Donetsk defeat Juventus. Third in the English Premier League despite a series of injuries to key players, Chelsea is on a run of just one win in five league matches and face league leaders Manchester City on Sunday, with the league champions four points ahead of the London side.
