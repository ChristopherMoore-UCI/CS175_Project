-- Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho has rejoined former coach Jose Mourinho after completing a transfer to Spanish giants Real Madrid. Since leaving Inter Milan, where he won the Scudetta and the Champions League last season, Mourinho has been linked with a string of his former players, including Chelsea left-back Ashley Cole and Inter's Brazilian wing-back Maicon. "Chelsea Football Club can confirm it has agreed terms with Real Madrid for the transfer of Ricardo Carvalho," read a statement on the club's official website. The 32-year-old, who made 22 appearances for Chelsea last season as the London club clinched their second English Premier League title, signed a two-year-deal. "Ricardo Carvalho seems to have problems understanding things, maybe he should have an IQ test," said Mourinho.
