A Mexican man pleaded guilty on Tuesday to first degree murder in the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, the first conviction in a case with an indirect link to the politically charged "Fast and Furious" gun-running operation. A September report by the Justice Department's inspector general said the anti-gun trafficking operation was marked by "a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures" that allowed hundreds of weapons to reach Mexican drug cartels. The group encountered Terry and other Border Patrol agents along Arizona's border with Mexico and a gun battle broke out. Tuesday's plea is an important step in seeking justice on behalf of agent Terry." Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, 36, admitted that on the night of December 14, 2010, he and four others were looking for drug traffickers to rob them of marijuana.
