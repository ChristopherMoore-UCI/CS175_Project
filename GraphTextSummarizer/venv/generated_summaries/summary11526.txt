The attacker entered the day care center in Dendermonde, about 16 miles northwest of Brussels, around 10 a.m. (4 a.m. ET) and began stabbing children and staff, the ministry said. "You don't expect such acts happening in a daycare center," Dendermonde deputy prosecutor Jan Kerkhofs told CNN. Officials said two adults and 10 children, some of whom were in a critical condition, were being treated in hospital following the attack in Dendermonde,  25 kilometers (16 miles) northwest of Brussels. Police look at a hearse parked in front of the childcare centre in Dendermonde where the attack took place. Local journalist Bart Bekaert told CNN that the attacker's face was painted black and white.
