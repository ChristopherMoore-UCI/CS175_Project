Iran's official attitude toward America, its policies, its actions in the region, are a matter of record. Because the Iran you see from the inside, once you walk the streets of Tehran, meet Iranians, is a very different place than the Iran we know from the news. How it treats its own citizens, as far as their personal behaviors, also is a matter of record. It took us many years of trying to finally be allowed into Iran, the country with whom the United States has probably its most contentious relationship. You do not want to be perceived as behaving inappropriately in Iran -- as we have seen with the recent video of kids dancing along to the song, "Happy."
