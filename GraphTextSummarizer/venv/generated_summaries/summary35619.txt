Barak said Israel "will not always be able to prevent such attacks." "The Egyptian control over Sinai is weakening, and this is probably the reason that this attack that originated in Gaza has made it all the way down here." "In light of what's happening near Eilat, our deepest condolences go out to the victims, their families and loved ones, of what appears to be a brutal and cowardly act of terrorism in southern Israel," the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv said. Eilat generally has not endured the kind of strife faced by other regions including the swath of southern Israel near Gaza, the coastal Palestinian territory just south of the Jewish state along its west coast. Israel believes that the attacks had their roots in Gaza but were coming out of the neighboring Egyptian region of Sinai. Questions are being raised about the Egyptian military presence in the demilitarized zone in Sinai, which was created under the terms of the Camp David Agreement signed in 1978 between Egypt and Israel.
