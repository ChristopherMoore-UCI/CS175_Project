-- Martin Kaymer stretched his lead at the top of the U.S. Open leaderboard with a second successive round of 65 at Pinehurst No. 2 Friday. Meanwhile, reigning U.S. Open champion Justin Rose shot a carded a 69 to finish the day at one-over-par after a difficult 72 on Thursday. The 20-year-old, who tied for second at the Masters in April, was equal 10th alongside McIlroy (68), world No. 5 Matt Kuchar (70) and fellow American Chris Kirk (68). "We all know that U.S. Opens get very difficult and if I can just somehow put together two really good rounds, maybe slowly but surely I'll creep my way up towards Martin." The record was previously held by Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy who carded 131 (65 and 66) over the first two rounds as he went on to win the 2011 U.S. Open at the Congressional Country Club's Blue Course in Bethesda, Maryland.
