But there may come a time when Premier League sides aren't made to feel quite so welcome on this side of the pond. Meanwhile, City and Chelsea's post-season tour of America, coming at the end of a long and tiring year for both sides, demonstrates how important the U.S. market is becoming for Premier League teams. And the appetite to consume the game in any way possible has boomed, with the value of Premier League TV rights packages tripling. This week's announcement that Manchester City will become majority shareholders in the league's 20th franchise in New York City is proof that the strongest football markets are now taking the U.S. seriously. The American team will benefit from City's scouting network and player development, and club Manchester will learn from the Americans' marketing expertise and reap the financial rewards of MLS success.
