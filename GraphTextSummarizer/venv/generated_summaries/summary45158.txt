-- About this time last year, many American families were sharing Thanksgiving leftovers and curious conversations about a traffic accident involving the world's most famous golfer. The Thanksgiving-weekend accident last year outside the couple's home in Florida shattered Woods once tightly-controlled image and led to the golfer's admission that he had engaged in multiple affairs during his nearly six-year marriage. While his story last year was filled with scandal, talk around the Thanksgiving table this year may be more about redemption. Authorities were alerted of the crash near Woods' Orlando-area home the morning after Thanksgiving. On December 12, Woods announces that he is taking "an indefinite break" from professional golf, according to a statement posted on his website.
