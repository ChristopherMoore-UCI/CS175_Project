The first ever global survey of sea turtle bycatch conducted by Conservation International and Duke University in the United States suggests that the Mediterranean and the Eastern Pacific are locations where the marine turtle populations are in danger of collapse. The report, published this week in "Conservation Letters" investigated the impact of bycatch on sea turtles around the globe from 1990 to 2008. However, Wallace and the reports' co-authors believe bycatch is the most serious threat to sea turtle populations around the world. The report says that the increase in fishing gear, like longlines and gillnets, in marine habitats is directly linked to the increase in the accidental capture of sea turtles. Sea turtles are highly migratory animals that cover vast areas of ocean between nesting and feeding grounds.
