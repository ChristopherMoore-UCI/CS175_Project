-- Ninety-five acres of farm land where young men in blue and gray fought and died during the epic Civil War battle is being added to Gettysburg National Military Park, federal officials said. "Even as we celebrate this great success, we must remember that other vital pieces of the Gettysburg story are still vulnerable," trust president James Lighthizer said in a statement. The Civil War Trust is pursuing the purchase of three other pieces of the battlefield at Gettysburg, where the Confederate forces of Gen. Robert E. Lee were turned back after three days of combat that included Pickett's Charge. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Friday thanked the Conservation Fund and The Civil War Trust for helping to make the department's acquisition of the former Emanuel Harman Farm possible. Land that once belonged to the now-closed Gettysburg Country Club is where major fighting occurred on the first day of battle on July 1, 1863.
