Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says he feels no pressure to run for president at 47 because a certain political rival of his is toying with the idea well into her 60s. "I could run 20 years from now and still be about the same age as the former Secretary of State (Hillary Clinton) is right now," the Republican governor said in an interview Sunday with CNN affiliate WITI. "I think the biggest loser (in the midterms) was Hillary Clinton," Walker said. Walker, who was recently re-elected for a second term, says he believes that the closer you get to running for president, the more you realize how crazy you have to be to actually do it. Shortly after the latest midterm elections, Walker told Fox News that Clinton, who recently turned 67, embodies "old" politics.
