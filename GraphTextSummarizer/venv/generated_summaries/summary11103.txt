Tens of thousands turned out Saturday to protest against election results that returned Putin's United Russia party to power but with a smaller majority. Claiming the results of parliamentary elections were rigged, protesters chanted "Putin out." Looking ahead, Putin said the opposition must have the opportunity to control everything that is going on at polling stations, and he proposed that live web cameras be installed at all voting stations across the country in the presidential elections next March. Its election-observer mission detailed alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes, manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors. -- Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday brushed off widespread criticism that the December 4 parliamentary elections in Russia were falsified.
