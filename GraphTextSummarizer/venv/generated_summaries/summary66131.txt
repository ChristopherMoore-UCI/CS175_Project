Bryan Nichols' aunt Sue Keller of Palco, Kansas, said Monday that Braydon, Nichols' only son, was stung by the way the news of the deadly Afghan incident played out on the airwaves. Keller said Nichols parents and his wife were at Dover Air Force Base to collect the remains Tuesday. Bryan Nichols and Braydon's mother were divorced but father and son were close, Keller said. He signed his name, Braydon Nichols, said he was from Kansas City and that he was 10 years old. There were just nine left before Bryan Nichols, 31, was to fly home to Kansas City for a two-week leave.
