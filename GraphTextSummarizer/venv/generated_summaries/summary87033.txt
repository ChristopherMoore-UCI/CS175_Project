When police arrived, "the reporting party identified herself as Tila Nguyen, aka Tila Tequila, and her alleged assailant as Shawne Merriman," the statement said. Sasha Pasulka, head writer of the entertainment Web site Evil Beet, said Nguyen may have fallen into the trap that many face in their pursuit of celebrity: not being able to shield their personal lives. After hours of Twitter silence, Nguyen tweeted Sunday evening that she was safe at home in Los Angeles and thanked fans for their concern and support. The high-profile nature of the domestic violence case involving singers Chris Brown and Rihanna has heightened public interest in such incidents, Pasulka added. Tequila, whose real name is Tila Nguyen, said she was assaulted by Shawne Merriman, a linebacker with the San Diego Chargers.
