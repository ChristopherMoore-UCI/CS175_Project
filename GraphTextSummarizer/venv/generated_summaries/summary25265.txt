-- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is expected to meet Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a day after she said she would take the oath of office for the country's parliament after initially resisting it. "I will go to the parliament because there is a demand of people who voted for me," Suu Kyi said after meeting with party members in Yangon on Monday. She added that she had been urged to enter parliament by some parliament members and representatives of Myanmar's ethnic minority groups. The success of Suu Kyi and her party at the by-elections this month was welcomed by the United States and European Union as a sign of progress toward democracy. " Nyan Win, a spokesman for the NLD, said Suu Kyi will attend parliament in the capital, Naypyidaw, on Wednesday for "just one day."
