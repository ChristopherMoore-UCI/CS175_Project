The radical Islamic cleric, who faced charges relating to terrorism, was killed in a daylight ambush Monday morning in the coastal city of Mombasa, Kenya police said. But Rogo's wife, Hania Said, claimed Monday the shooters were Kenyan police. Anti-riot police responded with tear gas, and a government vehicle was burned near a mosque where Rogo once preached. "Let us come together in calm instead and join hands in order to get to the bottom of the murder." Aside from its sandy white beaches that draw big tourism dollars for the Kenyan economy, Mombasa features a large port that is used for transportation by neighboring landlocked countries. Protesters threw a grenade at a vehicle carrying anti-riot police in Mombasa Tuesday, killing one officer and wounding 13 others, a police official said.
