In Maiduguri, in Borno state, where many of the deaths have occurred, Amnesty researchers found residents are reluctant to speak out over Boko Haram abuses for fear of reprisals. -- Nigeria's security forces have been guilty of serious human rights abuses in their efforts to crack down on the militant Islamist group Boko Haram, Amnesty International said Thursday in a new report. While condemning the grave abuses committed by Boko Haram, Amnesty International said Nigeria's security forces "have perpetrated serious human rights violations" in their response. However, the abuses by Boko Haram do not absolve the government of its responsibility to live up to its obligations under the law, the report said -- something Amnesty International alleges it is failing to do. In one example cited in the report, "Witnesses interviewed by Amnesty International described seeing people who were clearly no threat to life -- unarmed, lying down or with their hands over their head or cooperating -- shot at close range by the security forces." Amnesty International also points out the challenges faced by a police force that is poorly resourced, with some officers lacking bulletproof vests or handcuffs, and has itself been a frequent target of attacks by Boko Haram.
