Sen. Rand Paul marked the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at a ceremony this week honoring the late Maurice Rabb, a renowned ophthalmologist and civil rights leader. "Saying the Civil Rights Act was about property rights is sort of akin to those who say the Civil War was about states' rights," he said. Defending his father, Paul said the problem with the law was the unintended consequences it had on property rights. In a May 2010 interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Paul famously suggested that if he were around in 1964, he "would have tried to modify that" section of the law and "there would have been some discussion" on property rights. If Paul runs for president, Democrats are almost certain to make sure his comments about the Civil Rights Act overshadow any other efforts he's made to appeal to African Americans.
