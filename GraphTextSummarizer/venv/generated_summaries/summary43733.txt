I can vote (or not) for Alan Trammell, Lee Smith, Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and others who have been on the ballot for multiple years without success, guys who still have time to be reassessed and accepted into the game's highest society. Just as today's voters continue to debate who did and didn't demonstrate exemplary character, we could argue whether Pete Rose must be forever bound by "rules are rules," or if rules, as some have been known to say, are made to be changed. Yep, yet again, no Pete Rose. Maybe you saw 73-year-old Pete Rose autographing bats and balls for a fee as he sat in front of a rack of red T-shirts emblazoned with: "Vote Pete Into the Hall of Fame." I do not vote for Pete Rose, alas, because I cannot.
