"For the first time in many years, we have the opportunity to start down a new path," Obama said in a message timed for Nowruz, the Persian new year. Obama said Thursday that "a comprehensive agreement ... this year can help open up new possibilities and prosperity for the Iranian people for years to come." In a message to the Iranian people, an upbeat President Barack Obama said Thursday that the long isolated Middle East nation can soon improve its economy, its world standing and its people's lives if there's a breakthrough nuclear deal. That includes more open trade, more jobs and "more opportunities for Iranian students," according to the President. For one, Iranians elected Hassan Rouhani -- who campaigned, in part, on opening up Iran more to the world including negotiations on its nuclear program -- as president last summer.
