Two men arrested at the scene of the killing are now under guard in South London hospitals after being shot in a confrontation with police. The brutal slaying Wednesday of British soldier Lee Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in a working-class neighborhood in southeast London shocked people across the United Kingdom. Late Sunday, a mosque caught fire in the city of Grimsby on the country's east coast, and police arrested two men on suspicion of arson. "Those people should be aware that we are monitoring these sites in Humberside and we will take action against those intent on attempting to incite violence or post messages of a racial nature," police warned. The three arrested Saturday were released early Monday on bail, police said.
