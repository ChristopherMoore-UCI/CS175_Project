Last year Interactive got attention for a community effort that was completely unplanned and that didn't spring from the fest itself: After earthquakes and tsunamis devastated Japan on the opening day of the festival, attendees launched "SXSW4Japan," which raised funds for relief efforts. All those extra bodies stuffing panel rooms and downtown parties at the festival have marked a shift in the culture of South by Southwest, and prompted a lot of soul searching by festival organizers. They're tasked with deciding what the future of Interactive will be in the face of more people, more programming and more interest in what is the festival's hot new tech. Both events were turning points for SXSW Interactive -- known to festival veterans as "South By" -- which at the time was still recovering from some lean years after the dot-com bust.
