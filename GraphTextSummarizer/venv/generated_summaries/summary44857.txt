His auction house, Bargain Hunt Auctions, sells everything from fridges to paintings, many from deceased estates, and mostly for less than $100. A torn page in a cheap, tatty frame has sold at auction for an eye-watering $68,000 (A$74,000), plus commission. On this sale alone, the company made about $22,000 (A$24,000) in commission, before tax. Sydney auctioneer Mark Owens confesses he still knows very little about lot 11, which appears to be a page of the Quran. A few months ago, he sold another page of the Quran -- which he says was in worse condition -- for $27,000 (A$29,000).
