Militant group claims responsibility for Iraq prison attacks The gunmen cut off the prison's power supply, then launched the attack from all sides, said Malik Qasim Khan, an adviser to the chief minister on prisons. Taliban gunmen wearing police uniforms attacked the largest jail in a northern Pakistani province early Tuesday, allowing about 200 inmates to escape, authorities said. Taliban spokesman Shahidaullah Shahid said the group freed around 300 prisoners, a claim that Pakistani army officials denied. There were 483 prisoners at the time of the attack, and a total of 200 have gone missing, according to Mushtaq Jadoon, the Dera Ismail Khan police commissioner. Around 35 of the escaped prisoners are high-profile militants, said Pervaiz Khattak, the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province where the attack took place.
