Karen and Jill Wielinski escaped and were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, but Doug Wielinski was killed. -- Hours after a plane slammed into her home Karen Wielinski gave an exclusive interview to Buffalo radio station WBEN. Just before the crash, Wielinski was sitting in the family room watching TV, her 22-year-old daughter Jill was watching TV in the front of the home and her husband Doug had just left the family room to work in the dining room, she said. Karen Wielinski was watching TV in her home when she heard a plane making an unusually loud noise. When she was asked early on if she had heard news about her husband, Wielinski said no, and she didn't know whom to ask. "But to me it looked like the plane just came down on the middle of the house, and unfortunately that's where Doug was," she said.
