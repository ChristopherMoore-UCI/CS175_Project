"What the study found was that in the next 10 to 50 years many countries are going to see impacts, particularly countries that are heavily reliant on clams and oysters and mussels, and will not be able to adapt by shifting to other foods or aquaculture methods," said Jackie Savitz, senior scientist and chief strategist for the international ocean conservation and advocacy organization Oceana. And when you look at those impacts, what you find is, in many cases, it's the developed countries, like the United States, the U.K. and other European countries that will be impacted." Even though this current study by Woods Hole found that ocean acidification is likely to have the worst impact on poor and developing nations first, it's a problem with widespread impact. Savitz and her organization Oceana are urging more support for a clean energy sector, something the Obama administration has been pushing and trying to develop for several years, and an end to taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuel industries. "Impacts on coral reefs, for example, that can affect tourism, that can affect fisheries because fish depend on coral reefs. " Savitz also said, "If all these countries are going to have food insecurities because their clams or oysters are no longer available or because their fisheries are no longer available as a result of climate change, that could put pressure on other countries and it can affect all of us."
