Many girls remain banned from schools. In Pakistan's combustible Swat Valley, some girls refuse to wear uniforms so they can make it to school without being harmed. The girls could not risk talking about Taliban harassment, because the militants' version of Islamic law lingers. Such Islamic law, or shariah, also keeps females from going to school or going outside without their husbands. School-age girls are among the victims in the fierce fighting between government soldiers and Taliban militants in the Swat Valley.
