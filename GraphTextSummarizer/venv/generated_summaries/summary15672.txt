Watch this: Ghana'a heart surgery pioneer Determined to make a difference, Godfrey approached doctors visiting the hospital, asking them to help him find a way to create a Tanzanian team that could do pediatric heart surgery. Following five years of intense training, Godfrey is now Tanzania's only pediatric heart surgeon capable of carrying out open heart surgeries on small children. "I realized children are the ones who are suffering most in Africa -- we have so many children with heart diseases dying without any care and those few lucky ones the government gets to send them abroad for surgery," he adds. Eventually, he got in touch with Save a Child's Heart, an Israeli organization providing heart surgeries and care to children from developing countries. "Working in Israel," says Godfrey, "one of the things that struck me most at the beginning was that we could spend six months and not even see one child dying, while here in a day, one pediatric admission, we could see even five, sometimes up to seven, children dying," he adds.
