" Archerd was president and founder of the Hollywood Press Club and received honors from that group and the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, as well as Newsman of the Year from the Publicists Association. Archerd's wife of 39 years, Selma, told Variety, "He didn't expose secrets about other people -- he wrote news.
