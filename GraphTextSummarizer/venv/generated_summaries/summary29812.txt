Amid the crush of migrant workers who gathered to see Aung San Suu Kyi in Bangkok Wednesday was Sein Htay, a Burmese worker who has been in Thailand for 17 years. Hall described walking about the streets in the suburb of Mahachai, home to the highest concentration of Burmese migrants in Thailand in the hours before Suu Kyi's arrival. Amid the sweltering heat, Suu Kyi said that it was up to Burmese migrants as well as the government to create a Myanmar that could welcome them back. In the past 17 years Sein said he had worked in just about every lowly-paid job open to migrants in Thailand: in construction, on fishing boats and at the factories back at port, where workers peel prawns and package seafood for export. [Burmese workers] have a responsibility and we too have a responsibility to create the kind of country to which all our people can return, whenever they wish too," she said.
