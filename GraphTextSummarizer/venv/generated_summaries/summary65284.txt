Putin brings with him to China a group of 160 business leaders, including the CEOs of Russian energy giants Gazprom, Rosneft and aluminum producer UC RUSAL. Among all the economic agendas, energy cooperation stands out as the main focus between Russia, a major energy exporter, and China, the world's biggest energy consumer, according to a 2010 report from the International Energy Agency. " Putin's arrival in Beijing comes less than three weeks after he announced his bid to reclaim the Russian presidency next year. Recent years have seen a steady increase in trade volume between the two countries. "Since this is mainly a meeting between the two premiers, this visit will be mainly about expanding the economic cooperation and improving trade structure," said Jiang Yi, vice director of Research Center for Russian Diplomacy at China Academy of Social Science, the country's top think tank.
