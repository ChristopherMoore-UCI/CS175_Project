LONDON, England -- Graffiti artist Banksy, famed for infiltrating museum collections without their knowledge and spray-painting public buildings around the world, is holding his first major exhibition in years. This time, however, the anonymous artist worked in tandem with the director of Bristol museum in the UK. The exhibition's range, while very varied, remained true to Banksy form with his usual unconventional take on art. Another piece, which at first glance, looks like a copy of an ancient classical statue, is in fact a woman over-loaded with countless shopping bags as she browses for yet another item. His work is hidden among the museum's usual exhibits and is split into different rooms, including installations, paintings and sculptures.
