The intruder or intruders also killed about a dozen birds, including a Tasmanian swift parrot, said Rochelle Penney, who co-owns Tasmania Zoo with her father, Richard Warren. " Penney said she hopes that many animals will not go far, allowing them to be recovered. Some of missing animals will die if not recaptured, Penney said. "We have over 80 species of birds," Penney said. Warren found an enclosure door open when he arrived at work the next morning, Penney said.
