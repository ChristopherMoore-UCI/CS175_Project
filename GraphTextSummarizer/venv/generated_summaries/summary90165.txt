Stiles' first stop: the City Creek Center mall in downtown Salt Lake City. "He talked about going out and procuring these weapons," Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill told CNN affiliate KSL. -- A 42-year-old Utah man planned to "randomly shoot and kill" at a Salt Lake City mall, then pick off moviegoers, and finally blow up a city bus -- a plot he detailed to a counselor who alerted police -- according to a court document. According to the charging document, police first became aware of the plot after an employee at Pioneer Valley Hospital in West Valley City told them August 12 how Stiles detailed plans to "kill as many people as possible." Having already gone there "observing people," Stiles said he planned to go back around lunch time September 25 and "just randomly shoot and kill people," the charging document says.
