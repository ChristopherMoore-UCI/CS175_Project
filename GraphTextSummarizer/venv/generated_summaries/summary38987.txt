The victory, which follows Nadal's shock early exit in Madrid on the now-infamous blue clay, also sees the Spaniard leapfrog Roger Federer into second place in the world rankings. Meanwhile world number one Djokovic must pick himself up after a frustrating display in Rome. The Spaniard won 7-5, 6-4 to help erase painful memories from last year's final when Nadal again faced Djokovic only for the Serb to come out on top. Rafael Nadal won a record sixth title at the Rome Masters to strike a psychological blow over Novak Djokovic ahead of the French Open. The victory also ends a run of seven defeats for Nadal against Djokovic.
