For American Girl book fans, the "Happy New Year, Julie" story is an ideal gift for holiday road trips. Buy them a subscription to National Geographic Kids (www.shopng.org) and for preschoolers, National Geographic Little Kids (subscriptions are just $15 a year.) Books on tape are also a great bet for families who prefer the road to the skies. Even better, the kids can take charge of creating family vacation Web pages. Those planning road trips or plane trips with their children will thank you every time they travel, if you slip a portable DVD player under the tree or next to the Hanukkah Menorah.
