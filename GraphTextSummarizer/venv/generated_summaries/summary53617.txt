Police have charged six sorority members with aggravated hazing, which a police spokesman Friday called a possible "indictable offense. According to Rutgers, the university "strictly prohibits all forms of hazing. Under the Code of Student Conduct, a student found to have engaged in hazing may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion."
