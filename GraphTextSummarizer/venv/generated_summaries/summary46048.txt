The defense is not arguing that mental illness played a role in Pistorius shooting and killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, so they opposed the motion. -- Oscar Pistorius needs to undergo mental health examinations, the judge in his murder trial ruled Wednesday, putting a halt to the proceedings after nearly two months of testimony. They could find that Pistorius was mentally incapacitated when he shot Steenkamp, which would end the trial immediately in a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness. The third possibility is that the experts could disagree with the defense psychiatrist and say that Pistorius' mental health is not an issue at all. The defense team put a psychiatrist, Dr. Merryll Vorster, on the stand to testify that Pistorius suffers from "generalized anxiety disorder."
