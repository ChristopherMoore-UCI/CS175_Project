Egypt, the most populous Arab country, has often engaged in "a subtle competition" with its Saudi counterparts "over this question of regional leadership," said Steven Cook, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. "What has happened in the recent days of repercussions in the relationship between the two countries is painful to every honorable Saudi and Egyptian citizen, and our decision to recall the ambassador and the closure of the embassy were only to protect its employees from other situations that could have developed with dire consequences," the Saudi Press Agency said, quoting King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. -- Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Egypt returned to Cairo on Saturday after tensions briefly spurred the kingdom to pull its envoys and shutter its missions, Saudi state media reported. The decision to pull out Saudi diplomats came after protesters' "attempts to storm and threaten the security and safety of its (embassy) employees," the Saudi Press Agency said. Saudi officials say el-Gezawi is accused of trying to smuggle thousands of pills into the country.
