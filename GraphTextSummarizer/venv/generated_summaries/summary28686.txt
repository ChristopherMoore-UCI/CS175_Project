Earlier, Manchester United kept their slim hopes of Champions League qualification alive with a 3-0 win over West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns. Samuel Eto'o scored the crucial opener in Chelsea's 4-0 rout of Tottenham Hotspur Saturday to take them seven points clear in the English Premier League -- then faked as if he was an old man with a bad back, using the corner flag as a walking stick. Perhaps it has acted as unintentional motivation, but Eto'o showed his old qualities as he latched on to Jan Vertonghen's clumsy back pass and calmly beat Hugo Lloris to put Chelsea ahead just after half time. Sherwood launched a post-match tirade against his team, whose chances of Champions League football have all but disappeared. Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood was left shaking his head in disbelief, Mourinho had a spring in his step after a victory which left them clear of second-placed Liverpool and nine points ahead of Manchester City, who have three games in hand.
