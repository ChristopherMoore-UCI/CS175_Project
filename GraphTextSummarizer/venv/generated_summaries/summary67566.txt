-- A New York hardware clerk who pleaded guilty to abducting, smothering and dismembering an 8-year-old boy was sentenced Wednesday to 40 years to life behind bars on charges of second degree murder and kidnapping in the second degree. The autopsy results for Leiby listed a cocktail of four prescription and over-the-counter drugs in the boy's system: cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant; quetiapine, an antipsychotic drug; hydrocodone, a pain medication; and acetaminophen, the drug in Tylenol. As part of a plea deal, Levi Aron will be eligible for parole after 40 years, though could serve life in prison. " The plea deal was announced in early August and at the time Aron's attorney, Jennifer L. McCann, said she was "glad we were able to come up with an amenable resolution that both sides agreed to. Aron was accused of snatching Leiby Kletzky last summer from the Brooklyn boy's neighborhood.
