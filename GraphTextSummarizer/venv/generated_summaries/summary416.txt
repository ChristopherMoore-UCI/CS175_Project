North Korea: Nuclear program not a bargaining chip But not all South Koreans are rallying behind the cause of developing South Korean nuclear weapons. U.S. lawmaker questions North Korean leader's 'stability' Earlier this month, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok responded to North Korea's threat to attack the South with a pre-emptive nuclear strike saying: "If North Korea is to attack the South with its nuclear weapons... Experts say that China, also a powerful economic partner with South Korea, will never agree with the idea of nuclear armed South Korea, because "it will affect Sino-U.S. ties," said Yang Zhaohui, a professor of international relations at Peking University. The barrage of threats from North Korea has sparked talk from within South Korea of the need to develop its own nuclear weapons. South Korea returned fire and also began responding to North Korea with its own strong words.
