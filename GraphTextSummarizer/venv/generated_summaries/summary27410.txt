The band had been one of the top university marching bands in the United States, but Robert Champion's death and other reports of hazing damaged its reputation. "We have made a thorough assessment of the students who have auditioned for the band and firmly believe that we are ready to return and positively represent Florida A&M University and its proud students, faculty, alumni and community," Sylvester Young, director of marching and pep bands, said in a statement. Champion was beaten on a bus after a November 2011 football game in Orlando, as part of a band hazing ritual. It created an anti-hazing plan that includes a revised student code of conduct, a new anti-hazing website, scheduled campus training and beefed-up procedures for reporting and investigating hazing allegations.
