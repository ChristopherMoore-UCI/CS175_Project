But wearing a poppy is a sensitive issue for many British Muslims. Their act angered Britons and polarized opinion among many British Muslims. In 2010, an extremist Muslim group set the paper flowers on fire in protest at British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. Online, the scarf has received a mixed reception, with some taking to Twitter to mock it as a test of British loyalty. The tradition dates back to World War I; the paper blooms -- reminiscent of those that grew over the battlefields of Flanders -- are sold by thousands of volunteers, at train stations, in shops, and in offices.
