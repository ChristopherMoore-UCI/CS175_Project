Burkina Faso skipper Moumouni Dagano managed a consolation goal moments before the end, but it couldn't stop Sudan recording a first win in the competition for 42 years to set up a meeting with Group A winners Zambia on February 4. Goals from Emmanuel Eboue in the 33rd minute and a Wilfried Bony strike midway through the second half ensured maximum points from the group and confirmed a meeting with co-hosts Equatorial Guinea at the same stadium next Saturday. Two goals in either half from Mudather Eltaib was enough to secure second place in Group B ahead of Angola, who lost 2-0 to Ivory Coast at the Estadio de Malabo. Eltaib gave Sudan the lead in the 33rd minute when he sidefooted past keeper Daouda Diakite.
