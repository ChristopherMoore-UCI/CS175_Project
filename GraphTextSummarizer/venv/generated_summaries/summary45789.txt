There were three children -- all cousins -- at the home at the time of the incident,  said Detroit Deputy Chief Rodney Johnson. A 4-year-old boy was shot and killed by his 4-year-old female cousin while they were playing with a gun, Detroit police said. Detroit Police Public Information Officer Adam Madera said the children found a "long gun" under a bed, pulled it out and began to play with it. "It's too early to say if charges will be filed in this case," Johnson said. A study of Colorado trauma center data found a surprising number of children were being injured, many of them seriously, by guns.
