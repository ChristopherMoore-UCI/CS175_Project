Gendarmes found the remains in the village of Villers-au-Tertre, south of Lille, some in a home and others in the garden of another home. When police searched the couple's home with sniffer dogs they found the bodies of six infants, they said. -- A woman has been charged over the discovery of the bodies of eight newborn babies at two locations in northern France, the French Interior Ministry said Thursday. The woman has admitted giving birth to and killing the babies and has been charged with voluntary manslaughter, prosecutor Eric Vaillant said. The woman is a nursing assistant while her husband is a member of the local council, a neighbor told AFP.
