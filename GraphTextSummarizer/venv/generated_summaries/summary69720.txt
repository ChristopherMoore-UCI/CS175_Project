Pistorius goes on trial on March 3, accused of murdering his girlfriend, model and law school graduate Reeva Steenkamp, just over a year ago. Judge Dunstan Mlambo in Pretoria High Court delivered his ruling -- which will put cameras in a criminal trial for the first time in South Africa -- in response to several local media broadcasters' applications to broadcast the trial live. In his ruling, Mlambo said the question of whether the trial should be televised shows the conflict between the right of the accused to a fair trial and the right to freedom of expression for the media and the principle of open justice. -- A South African high court ruled Tuesday that cameras will be allowed in court for part of athlete Oscar Pistorius' trial in the killing of his girlfriend. However, the prosecution and defense opening statements and closing arguments, police evidence and experts' testimony can be broadcast on TV, Mlambo said, and live audio recording for radio broadcast will be permitted for the whole trial.
