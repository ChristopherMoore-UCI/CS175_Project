But NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, citing a lack of evidence, "could not conclude that Favre violated league policies relating to workplace conduct," the league said in a statement. In the allegations involving Sterger, the NFL reviewed public reports, its interviews with several individuals including Sterger and Favre, communications between the two and an independent forensic analysis of electronically-stored material. The NFL was unable to establish whether Favre sent objectionable messages to New York Jets game-day hostess Jenn Sterger in 2008, when he played quarterback for the Jets. But Goodell determined that "Favre was not candid in several respects during the investigation, resulting in a longer review and additional negative public attention for Favre, Sterger, and the NFL," the league said. "Our new training program on workplace conduct will help all of us to promote the right kind of environment for all employees and I intend to dedicate the fine I have imposed on Favre to help fund that training program."
