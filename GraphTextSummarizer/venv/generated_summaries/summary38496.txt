" Silver's many roles included playing political consultant Bruno Gianelli in "The West Wing," and attorney Alan Dershowitz in the movie "Reversal of Fortune." --   Actor and political activist Ron Silver, who played a recurring role in TV's presidential drama "The West Wing," and who also let his political views play out in real life, died Sunday after a two-year battle with esophageal cancer, according to a colleague. One of Silver's final television appearances was on CNN's "Larry King Live" last October, when he was part of panel discussing Sen. John McCain's campaign against then-candidate Barack Obama. His contributions as an artist and activist will never be forgotten," said Bronk, who runs an organization founded in 1989 by Silver, actor Christopher Reeve and other prominent figures in the arts as a political advocacy organization for the entertainment industry. Robin L. Bronk, executive director of The Creative Coalition, said Silver, a New York native, died in his sleep with his family around him.
