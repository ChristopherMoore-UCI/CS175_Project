" Di Montezemolo first arrived at Ferrari in 1973, becoming assistant to the manufacturer's founder, Enzo Ferrari, before going on to manage the team from 1974. More than two decades after first taking up the post in 1991, Luca di Montezemolo will leave the Scuderia on October 13, with chief executive officer of parent company Fiat Sergio Marchionne is set to succeed him. Reports emerged ahead of Sunday's Italian Grand Prix in Monza about a Di Montezemolo exit, although the Italian was insistent afterwards about staying in the role despite Ferrari suffering their worst performance of the season -- Alonso was forced to retire, while Raikkonen had to settle for ninth. "I wish the shareholders, particularly Piero Ferrari who has always been by my side, and everyone in the Company the many more years of success that Ferrari deserves," Di Montezemolo added. "As chairman of Ferrari, he drove the company to a new level of technological and organizational excellence which also brought with it outstanding financial results." Since 2008, however, Ferrari have been starved of such successes, with the team having now gone nearly six years without either a Drivers' or Constructors' World Championship title.
