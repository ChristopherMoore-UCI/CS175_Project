The boat had a capacity of 1,500, but was overcrowded with about 2,000 people, said Nazrul Islam, the police chief of Bangladesh's southern Bhola district. -- A ferry crammed with people capsized late Friday night in Bangladesh, killing at least 28 passengers, police said. They were traveling from the capital, Dhaka, to their homes in Bhola for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. The boat toppled as passengers weighted down one side to disembark, Islam said. The number of people missing remained unclear and rescue teams feared the death toll would rise.
