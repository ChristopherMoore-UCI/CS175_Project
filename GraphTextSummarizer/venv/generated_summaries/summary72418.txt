Wild animals -- especially bats -- are by far the most common cause of rabies exposure in the U.S. Bat bites, which typically occur when a person finds a bat in his home and tries to shoo it out, are responsible for 80% of cases in which the vaccine is given, Willoughby says. Four doses of rabies vaccine are enough to prevent infection in most kids exposed to the deadly virus, according to a new policy statement from the nation's largest organization of pediatricians. The most recent such shortage, in 2009, required public health officials to ration rabies shots. A key strategy for protecting kids against rabies is to teach them a healthy fear of wild animals, he adds. The American Academy of Pediatrics is now recommending that children who have potentially been exposed to rabies receive four shots in two weeks.
