He also adds that recycled composite plastic provides a more sustainable alternative to existing bridge construction materials and not as likely to degrade as steel, timber and concrete. Yet it could be many years before more of us are driving on plastic roads and bridges. Lark believes that overcoming existing legislative hurdles may take time as current building standards have been written around existing materials and do not take into account newly developed ones. "There are currently significant bridge and river crossing needs in rural and countryside areas and there will only be more in years going forward," says William Mainwaring, CEO of Vertech Composites. "We see the potential for the same recycled plastics to be used in road signage, advertising hoardings, as a replacement for plywood on building sites ... and in agriculture, which currently uses a huge amount of timber on the inside of livestock buildings," says Mainwaring.
