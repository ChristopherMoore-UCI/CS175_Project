-- Rafael Nadal won his first European clay title of the season and 27th Masters tournament victory of his career at the Madrid Open after his opponent Kei Nishikori was forced to retire through injury. "Simona and I had played a couple of times before, but she's really on a different level now (having risen from 64th position in the world rankings this time last year).

Nishikori out-played Nadal for a set and a half with some aggressive shot making and big winners. Speaking on court after the match, the 27-year-old said: "Last year I lost in the finals and I really wanted to go one extra step this year, and it's just been such a fantastic week.
