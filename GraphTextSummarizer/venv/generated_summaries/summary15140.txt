-- U.S. and Japanese authorities were investigating two small explosions Thursday outside an American air base near Tokyo, officials said. At first, she said she thought they were fireworks being set off as part of a Thanksgiving Day celebration inside the base. No injuries were reported, and U.S. investigators combed the base for most of the night and into the early morning hours searching for possible impact points, said Capt. We take matters of security at our installation very seriously and we are assisting the Japanese National Police in their investigation into the matter." Investigators found two metal tubes and a simple timing device, which U.S. authorities described as an "improvised launch device," near the Yokota Air Base.
