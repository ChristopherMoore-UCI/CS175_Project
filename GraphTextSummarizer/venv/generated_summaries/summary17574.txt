While other singers have caught major flak for messing up the words to the national anthem at such events, Taylor did have an excuse: he was also performing "America the Beautiful" that same night during the seventh inning stretch. -- All future singers of the national anthem should pay close attention to James Taylor's performance at Game 2 of the World Series on October 24. He was joined by several survivos of April's Boston Marathon attack. But when he opened his mouth to sing, the words of "America the Beautiful" started pouring out. On Thursday, the musician was at Fenway Park in Boston to lead the stadium in a rendition of "The Star-Spangled Banner."
