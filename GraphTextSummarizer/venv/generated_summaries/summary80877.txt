-- A Syrian airstrike in Aleppo has killed at least 15 people, including nine children, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday. The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom. Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said 116 people were killed across the country Saturday, including 37 in Aleppo. Kurdish activists say the number of dead is expected to rise because there are many injured and in critical condition. Amateur video purporting to show the site of the bombing appeared on the Internet shortly after the attack, providing a glimpse of a panicked scene.
