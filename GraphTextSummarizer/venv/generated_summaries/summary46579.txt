"I felt that he was one of the best players in all of MLS last season and we could not have achieved the success that we did without him," said Bruce Arena, Galaxy general manager and head coach. "We have made great progress over the past five years in raising the profile of soccer domestically and the MLS on a worldwide stage, and we are encouraged by all the results," said Simon Fuller, Beckham's business partner and manager. -- Soccer superstar David Beckham has re-signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy, extending his stay with the team for another two years, the Major League Soccer team announced Wednesday. Beckham, 36, known just as much for being an international sex symbol as a sportsman, had the best season of his five-year MLS career in 2011, helping lead the club to its first championship since 2005. The two-time MLS all-star Beckham has tallied 31 assists and 11 goals for the Galaxy in 74 games.
