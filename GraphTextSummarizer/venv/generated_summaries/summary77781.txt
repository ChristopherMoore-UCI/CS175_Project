From here it's possible to walk to Avenida Paulista, São Paulo's financial district, and there you can mill past some of the most expensive real estate in South America with the Paulistano businessfolk on your way to take in some culture at MASP, also known as São Paulo Museum of Art. Look out for Clube Chocolate, where you can buy upscale designerwear in divine surroundings (Rua Oscar Freire 913) and Endossa, a collaborative shop filled with cubes of shelving where entrepreneurs can rent a cubby-hole to sell their wares. Check out the Buddhist temple (Rua São Joaquim), karaoke bars and sushi restaurants -- one of the best of which is Takô (Rua da Glória 746, Liberdade). São Paulo, the world's fifth-largest city, is the fashion capital of Brazil. True, São Paulo doesn't have a beach, nor does it go out of its way to cater to foreign visitors, but hidden in the sprawl is a trove of hip hotels and restaurants, modernist architecture and some of the best shopping south of the Equator.
