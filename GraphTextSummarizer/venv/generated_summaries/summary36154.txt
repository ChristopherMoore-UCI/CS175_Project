"The surge in the killing of elephants in Africa and the illegal taking of other listed species globally threatens not only wildlife populations but the livelihoods of millions who depend on tourism for a living," said Achim Steiner, executive director of the U.N. environment program. "When he was alive, his enormous tusks were easily identifiable, even from the air," said Tsavo Trust, a non-profit that protects wildlife. Armed groups are capitalizing on the increasing value of ivory by killing elephants and trading their tusks for arms and ammunition. Poachers killed one of Kenya's most beloved elephants -- a behemoth animal with tusks so large, they touched the ground. A great life lost so that someone far away can have a trinket on their mantlepiece," Tsavo Trust said in statement late Friday.
