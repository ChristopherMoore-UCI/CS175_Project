"Contrary to any popular notion, war memorials in the United States have not traditionally included or centered on the cross and, according to the parties' evidence, there is no comparable memorial on public land in which the cross holds such a pivotal and imposing stature, dwarfing by every measure the secular plaques and other symbols commemorating veterans." "This war memorial -- with its imposing Cross -- stands as an outlier among war memorials, even those incorporating crosses," the ruling says. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the notion that the cross -- since the late 1990s surrounded by plaques and paving stones honoring veterans and war dead -- was solely a memorial. By the late 1990s, with the association maintaining the property, the cross became a more extensive war memorial, with stone plaques and paving stones honoring veterans and other accoutrements of a memorial. Facing pressure from a new association formed to "save the Mount Soledad cross," the city reversed its decision and instead put the matter to a vote, which passed handily.
