Officials predicted that water will enter northern Bangkok Friday. "We need areas that water can be drained through so the water can flow out to the sea," the Bangkok Post newspaper quoted her as saying Bangkok Gov. Sukhumbhand Paribatra asked residents to remain vigilant, but said the situation is not at a crisis level. The decision to divert water through Bangkok means parts of the city will likely be flooded, Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra said. -- Residents in parts of Bangkok cleared stores of bottled water and sought high ground to park their cars Thursday as government workers fought to contain flooding inching towards the capital city. "The situation is very uncertain as people are rushing to their homes to protect their belongings," said Natasha Cheung, who works in northern Bangkok for the Christian aid organization World Vision.
