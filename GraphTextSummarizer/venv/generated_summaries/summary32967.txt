New research focusing on underage Mexican immigrants trying to cross the border illegally into the United States shows these minors don't put aside their American dream easily, even if caught multiple times by immigration authorities. U.S. immigration authorities notify Mexican consular officials of apprehensions per agreements between the two nations. Unlike Central American children, Mexican minors are deported almost immediately. Other Mexican states with large number of migrant children are Sonora, which is south of Arizona, 1,160; Oaxaca, 884; Guerrero, 750: Guanajuato, 716; and Michoac√°n, 645. Another big difference is that most Mexican underage migrants are males in their late teens, whereas Central Americans come in all ages, some younger than 12, and the number of girls tends to be higher," he said.
