At this point, Forbes says that "it would be incredibly difficult for Marvel to continue making 'Iron Man' and 'Avengers' films without him." Arriving in second place on Forbes' list is Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Rounding out the top five is Leonardo DiCaprio, with an estimated $39 million, and Downey's "Avengers" co-star Chris Hemsworth -- aka "Thor" -- who made around $37 million over the past 12 months. -- Robert Downey Jr. is once again the most highly paid actor in Hollywood, according to Forbes magazine. To compile its list of top-paid actors, Forbes speaks with producers, agents, lawyers and others close to the stars to get an estimate of earnings before taxes, agent fees and the other costs. Forbes says part of the reason for Downey's lucrative income is his "Iron Man" status.
