" Radio France International quoted prosecutor Andreas Brendel as saying he was "surprised" by the Cologne court's decision, despite evidence in such cases being "extremely thin." But the court said it was unlikely the case against the pensioner, named by local media only as Werner C., would have been provable. A German court has thrown out a case against a former SS member accused of participating in the massacre of 642 residents of a French village during World War II. There was no doubt that members of the man's Panzer regiment had killed the Oradour-sur-Glane residents and burned down the village, the Cologne Regional Court said in a statement Tuesday. The village's Centre de la Memoire, or Memory Center, says 300,000 people visit the "martyr village" annually.
