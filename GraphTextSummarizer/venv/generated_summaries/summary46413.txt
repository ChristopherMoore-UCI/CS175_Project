The assault weapon ban only prohibited the manufacture of new guns (it grandfathered in a huge cache of pre-existing weapons) and gun manufacturers easily redesigned their guns to circumvent the ban. National registration of guns was imposed and it became illegal to hold certain long guns that might be used in mass shootings. In 1996, then-Prime Minister John Howard stated that the "whole scheme is designed to reduce the number of guns in the community and make Australia a safer place to live." The gun ban was backed up by a mandatory buy-back program that substantially reduced gun possession in Australia. Gun policy in this country is made by the National Rifle Association, and no serious effort at gun control can currently get past its veto.
