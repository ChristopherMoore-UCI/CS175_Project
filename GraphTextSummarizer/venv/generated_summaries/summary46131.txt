" Opinion: Spanking isn't child abuse; it's common sense Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon said Peterson wasn't treated any differently because he is one of the NFL's marquee players. He was placed on the reserve/commissioner exempt list by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, which allows the Vikings to pay Peterson while he sorts out his legal issues. "His matter will now be reviewed for potential discipline under the NFL's personal conduct policy," said Brian McCarthy, the NFL's vice president of corporate communications. Peterson -- who in 2011 signed a seven-year contract worth more than $100 million and is considered one of the NFL's best running backs, if not the best -- took a leave of absence from the Minnesota Vikings in September after the team deactivated, then activated and then deactivated him again. The plea deal Peterson was accused in Texas of whipping his 4-year-old son with a "switch," or slender tree branch, and had originally been charged with felony child abuse.
