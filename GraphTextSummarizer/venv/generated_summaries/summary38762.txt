"Iraq, like many Arab cultures, is an intensely rich narrative culture," said Miranda Sissons, Iraq director of the International Center for Transitional Justice, which helps countries pursuing accountability for past mass atrocities and human rights abuses. She also said "the scale of violence" in Iraq and the "nature and complexity" of it "is so vast" that the German war crimes tribunals after World War II and the reparations to Holocaust victims come to mind. The U.S. Institute of Peace -- one of the independent agencies behind the all-important Iraq Study Group report in 2006 -- is backing an initiative in Iraq to generate understanding and "spark public dialogue on the usefulness of the truth commission process. They are bodies across the globe that have provided a forum for victims and perpetrators to give cathartic public testimony on human rights abuses and come up with policy recommendations to correct the root cause of the abuses. That's because it was the first one in the Arab world and it detailed human rights abuses from 1956 to 1999 under King Hassan II.
