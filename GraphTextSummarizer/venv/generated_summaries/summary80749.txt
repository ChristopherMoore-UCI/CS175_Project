Pirelli made only 20,000 of this year's calendar, and they're handed out as gifts to Pirelli's clients, certain members of the press and fashion and art societies, dal Pino said. Pirelli began speaking to McCurry in February, dal Pino said, and the photographer drove around Brazil before arriving at his blueprint for the project. Though McCurry has shot fashion models in the past, the bulk of his more-than-30-year-deep portfolio focuses on what he calls "conflict journalism": the ravages of war, refugees' desperation, a spate of "vanishing cultures," as he puts it. the idea was to find positive images and transformations in the world," said Paolo dal Pino, executive president of Pirelli Latin America. It's not that the Italian tire maker's executives haven't heard the adage, "If it ain't broke ...," but rather, they decided it was time for a change, dal Pino said.
