-- Former "Good Morning America" co-host Joan Lunden revealed on Tuesday that she has been diagnosed with breast cancer. The news hit home for the staff, as "GMA" co-host Amy Robach is currently being treated for breast cancer. "After a core biopsy was performed, I heard those words that every woman fears and that I never thought I'd hear: 'you have breast cancer.' Posting to fans via Twitter and a letter on her website JoanLunden.com, Lunden said she had received an all-clear two weeks ago after her annual mammogram, but "for women who have dense fibrous breast tissue, as I do, often our doctors will recommend an ultrasound as well." Lunden told Roberts that the form of cancer she has is particularly aggressive.
