Watch African-Americans react to Obama speech Â» Obama said that if he knew Wright only through clips played on television and YouTube, he also would see a reason to distance himself from the minister. Obama's recent move to distance himself from Wright has been lauded by some of his supporters -- and criticized by others, including black ministers who felt he had abandoned Wright. -- Sen. Barack Obama in a speech Tuesday addressed the controversy surrounding his former minister, using it as an opportunity to challenge Americans to take a closer look at race relations. His biggest challenge Tuesday was similar to that faced by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney when he gave a speech during his GOP presidential run to reach voters unfamiliar with his Mormon faith: Obama was looking to explain his church and its worldview to voters aware only of Wright's headline-grabbing comments. Obama insisted he was not trying to justify Wright's comments, but drew a parallel between the minister's remarks and those made by Clinton supporters such as Geraldine Ferraro.
