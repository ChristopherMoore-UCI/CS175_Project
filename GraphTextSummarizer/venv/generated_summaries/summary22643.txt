Zuma was re-elected to a second term last month despite economic woes, deadly mining protests and corruption allegations. -- South African President Jacob Zuma was discharged from the hospital Sunday and will rest at home for a few days, state media reported. "The President will continue to rest for a few days and will work mainly from home during the rest period," said Jeff Radebe, minister in the presidency. His party, the African National Congress, won the general election with 62% of the vote, which was lower than the previous election. Doctors hospitalized Zuma, 72, for a "thorough checkup following a demanding schedule" and "are happy with the results," the presidency said, according to the South African Press Association.
