Home means many different things to different people. Other images show "The Castle," a former five-story office block in central London that is now a home for more than 100 squatters -- and a site for raves. Having moved into her new home in a squat in Kentish Town, north London, Kern had to figure out how to coexist in one building with 30 people and three dogs. The result is a striking collection of photographs and text titled "A Place Called Home," in which she seeks to challenge common preconceptions about squatters -- and explore the idea that home is more a feeling than a physical place. "The unusualness of the different places, which may not comply with the idea of home in the common sense, intrigued me and shaped my project." All the squats Kern visited were in former commercial premises.
