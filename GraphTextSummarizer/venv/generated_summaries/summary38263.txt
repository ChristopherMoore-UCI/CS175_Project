Katrina also dealt a black eye to the government, which scrambled to launch a delayed relief effort after the storm as New Orleans residents suffered and reports of crime and looting were widespread. In New Orleans' Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood -- seen as ground zero for Katrina's wrath -- only 4,000 of 18,000 residents have returned. A number of events were planned in New Orleans, Louisiana, and elsewhere to commemorate the anniversary of the landfall of Katrina, the costliest and one of the five deadliest storms ever to strike the United States. After the storm, "We were a city that had no people in it," Ray Nagin, who was mayor of New Orleans when Katrina struck. Still, it is widely agreed that more work remains to bring New Orleans and the Gulf Coast back from Katrina's devastating blow.
