Though West did not grab Beck's microphone like he's done in the past, his brief stunt was similar to a 2009 incident when he stormed the stage during the VMAs and declared Beyonce should have won an award instead of Taylor Swift. I'm sorry Beck," West tweeted Thursday night. West and Swift appeared to put it behind them, hugging it out at this month's Grammys. West turned heads -- and not in a good way -- when he briefly  went on stage after Beck won a Grammy for Album of the Year. In a series of tweets, West  reached out to singers Beck and Bruno Mars to express remorse over his well-documented disses.
