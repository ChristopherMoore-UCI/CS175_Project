The standoff continued Monday morning as police moved in on the main Hong Kong pro-democracy protest site, cutting down banners on a pedestrian overpass above thousands of tents inside the "democracy village" in Hong Kong's Admiralty district. The tense standoff came at the end of a dramatic week in which Hong Kong authorities moved to dismantle protest camps in the city's working-class Mong Kok district, arresting dozens and drawing accusations of brutality in the process. Police clashed with activists at the main Hong Kong pro-democracy protest site Monday morning after a violent nighttime standoff when protesters surrounded government headquarters in the city's Admiralty district. This morning, a tweet from student leader group Hong Kong Federation of Students read "We need your support in Admiralty right now." Protesters want their occupations to pressure the Chinese government into giving Hong Kong open elections for its next leader in 2017.
