Barcelona started the match at Villarreal with top scorer Lionel Messi on the bench after missing Argentina's midweek friendly due to an injury worry, while captain Carles Puyol, key midfielder Xavi, winger Pedro were ruled out along with veteran French defender Eric Abidal. His injury-hit team took to the field without top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, in-form striker Karim Benzema, defender Marcelo and suspended key midfielder Xabi Alonso, though Argentina forward Gonzalo Higuain made a welcome return as a second-half substitute after back surgery. Valdes came to Barca's rescue with five minutes to play as he did well to block a goalbound shot from midfielder Santi Cazorla. The winning goal came, however, from an unlikely source in the 67th minute as central defender Gerard Pique showed good skills to chest down Sergio Busquets' header from Dani Alves' corner and volley into the net despite suspicions of handball. Stand-in skipper Victor Valdes kept his side in the match with some important first-half saves, but the match turned when coach Pep Guardiola brought on Messi for midfielder Seydou Keita seven minutes after the interval.
