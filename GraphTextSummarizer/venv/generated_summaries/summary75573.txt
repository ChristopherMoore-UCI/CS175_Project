A Cabinet minister between 1996 and 2004 under conservative Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, Rajoy twice lost to Socialist Party leader Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, in 2004 and 2008, in his first attempts to become prime minister. Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba made the concession before a somber audience of Socialist Party supporters -- a stark contrast to the raucous, celebratory crowd gathered outside the Popular Party headquarters in Madrid. -- Popular Party leader Mariano Rajoy is poised to become the next prime minister of economically embattled Spain, with his ascension assured after the ruling Socialist Party's candidate conceded Sunday's national election. The majority result, thus, paves the way for Rajoy's unfettered ascension to prime minister, giving him a free hand to set policy without having to first make deals with other parties. The 60-year-old served under former Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and most recently under Zapatero, rising to the positions of deputy prime minister and Interior minister.
