Jarrar, now 30, said he was attempting to travel on JetBlue flight 101 from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Oakland, California, when he was approached by TSA officers. Jarrar said he originally refused to cover up the shirt, first asking to speak to a supervisor, and asking if there was a law prohibiting Arabic shirts. "The settlement amount represents a fraction of the amount originally sought by Mr. Jarrar," spokesman Bryan Baldwin said. " Jarrar said they eventually bought him a "generic gray" T-shirt with the words "New York" on it. But Raed Jarrar, an Iraqi who immigrated to the United States three years ago, cast the settlement as a victory, saying the payout would discourage airlines and airport security officials from imposing restrictions in the future.
