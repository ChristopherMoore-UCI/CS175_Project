We need ways of helping gay and transgender youth who are cast out of their families and communities and youth dealing with sexual abuse and other sexual trauma that so often pave the way into commercial sex. We do need more law enforcement pressure on the pimps, on the sex sites and on the casinos, truck stops and motels where this crime occurs, and on the consumers who buy sex from underage youth. We need better ways of identifying and treating youth with drug addictions, so they don't start selling sex to feed their habit. We need vocational opportunities for marginal youth, so they don't see the sex trade as their only avenue to economic survival. Although this may not be typical of many cities, one recent massive effort to inventory the problem in New York City found nearly as many boys and girls.
