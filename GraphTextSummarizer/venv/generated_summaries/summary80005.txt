White House aides have said they expect the president to be in Washington on Election Day, though that could always change if Democratic officials calculate that a last-minute visit will have an impact in another key race. Vice President Joe Biden will join Obama at the Cleveland, Ohio, rally, according to Democratic officials, as the White House continues to very aggressively coordinate the travel of the president, vice president, and first lady for maximum benefit. As the president stumps across the West for several Senate incumbents, Democratic officials revealed Thursday he will shift his attention to the Midwest and Northeast in the final weekend before the midterm election. The state is also home to a close re-election battle for Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn. That same day she will also headline an event in Philadelphia, a sure sign that the White House believes that Joe Sestak, the Democratic candidate for Senate that many pundits had written off, has a legitimate shot of knocking off Republican Pat Toomey.
