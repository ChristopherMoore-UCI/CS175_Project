Jerome Mauderly, 71, and his wife, Carolyn, 66, were asleep when escaped inmate Rodney Long, 38, broke into their rural Bedford home a little after 10 p.m. on Monday, said Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation spokesman Mitch Mortvedt. Around 2 a.m. Tuesday, while Long was upstairs looking for supplies, Jerome Mauderly sneaked into the kitchen and recovered his shotgun, Mortvedt said. They were not the only people in the community that had loaded weapons that night," Mortvedt said. Long was found lying face down in the kitchen, Mortvedt said. "(Long) had a handgun but was described as non-confrontational," Mortvedt said.
