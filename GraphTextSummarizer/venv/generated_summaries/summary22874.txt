The Yankees star paid his cousin and former personal assistant Yuri Sucart $900,000 in 2013 and gave him and his family medical insurance, a 2009 Chevrolet Suburban and a 5-bedroom house, in return for Sucart keeping quiet on confidential matters, said documents filed in federal court in Miami. According to court documents, Sucart introduced and personally arranged meetings between Rodriguez and Tony Bosch, the founder of the Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in Miami that is alleged to be at the center of Major League Baseball's largest doping scandal. From 2003 to 2012, Rodriguez paid Sucart an annual salary ranging from $50,000 to over $110,000 for his services, according to court documents. Rodriguez employed Sucart beginning in 1996 and paid him through the third quarter of 2013, according to court documents. The payments were first reported by the New York Daily News, citing court documents filed last week in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.
