In July 2011, Ianuale officially began her weight loss journey, and what a journey it has been: In just over three years, she has lost a staggering amount of weight. She runs between 3 and 4 miles a night and does 30 to 40 minutes of weight training. After all of this weight loss, Ianuale feels amazing. Her drinks vary, but typically she juices frozen blueberries, lemons, kale, spinach, pineapple, flax seeds, broccoli and carrots. "I don't eat greasy foods or junk food -- my stomach can't handle that anymore," she said.
