A CNN investigation shows just how easy it is to purchase prescription drugs online without a legitimate prescription, revealing a growing new battle in the war on drug abuse. Carmen Catizone, the executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, which works to implement and enforce uniform pharmaceutical standards, said prescription drugs are the new crack and heroin, and Internet sites that sell them are the new drug dealers. Watch why 'I wanted to end it' Â» To prove it, a CNN investigative reporter went to linepharmacy.com, which advertises a long list of prescription drugs for sale. His group blames unscrupulous doctors for writing prescriptions without ever seeing the patients or even reviewing their medical records. While CNN cameras rolled, one of the workers emptied a large clear plastic trash bag filled with empty wholesale prescription drug bottles.
