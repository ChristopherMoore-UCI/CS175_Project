As Weinstein's security guards prepared for the meal before the Ramadan fast, three men knocked at the front gate and offered food for the meal -- a traditional practice among Muslims during the Ramadan holy month, according to senior Lahore police official Tajamal Hussain. -- Police have arrested three suspects in the kidnapping of Warren Weinstein, a development expert from the United States who was snatched this month from his home in Lahore, Pakistan, a police official said Tuesday. Weinstein was abducted August 13 when gunmen, posing as neighbors offering food, pistol-whipped him and his driver and tied up his guards, U.S. Embassy and Pakistani officials said. The site says he was heading what the company described as the "Pakistan Initiative for Strategic Development and Competitiveness." They pistol-whipped the driver and forced him to take them to Weinstein's room where the men hit Weinstein in the head with a pistol, and forced him out of the house and into a waiting car, Hussain said.
