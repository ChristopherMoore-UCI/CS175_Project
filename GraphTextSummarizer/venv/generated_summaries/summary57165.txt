The death toll climbed to 10 in Japan as the remnants of former Typhoon Roke raced into the northern Pacific on Thursday, government officials said. Plant officials said Thursday that they have not seen any major problems at the plant due to Roke. Some downpours came up to 50 millimeters (2 inches) an hour, and some regions received more than 450 millimeters (17 inches) over a day, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK. The storm hit as Japan is still recovering from the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck in March, killing more than 15,000 people. Ahead of the storm, there were fears that it would affect Tokyo Electric Power Co.'s Fukushima Daiichi plant, which went into a nuclear crisis after the March disaster.
