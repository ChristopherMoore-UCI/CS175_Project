-- Passengers have been rescued from a gondola dangling over a freezing creek after the tower snapped in half Tuesday at a ski resort near Whistler, British Columbia. No serious injuries were reported, but a spokeswoman for the Whistler Blackcomb resort said five people required medical attention. Tyler Noble, a reporter for CNNRadio affiliate CKNW in Vancouver, was on the scene at the Whistler Blackcomb resort about 110 miles north of Vancouver. "All we saw were other cars swinging sideways and we thought we were going to crash to the ground," she told CTV News by cell phone. Three were taken to a nearby clinic and two were taken to a hospital as a precaution, said spokeswoman Tabetha Boot.
