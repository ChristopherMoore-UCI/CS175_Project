Such reticence about rumors has been standard procedure for the power couple, whose "On the Run" tour opened in June under speculation of a pending divorce but ended last weekend in Paris with gossip of another pregnancy. Speaking to E!, which first reported the news, Dash Radio's vice president of pop programming, Karli Henriquez, called the reported collaboration "huge." The couple -- who wed in 2008 and are also parents to 2-year-old Blue Ivy Carter -- earned $100 million in ticket sales from their stadium trek, Billboard reported. In 2013, Forbes named Jay Z and Beyonce the highest-paid couple in entertainment. On Tuesday, Dash Radio's DJ Skee reported that the "Drunk in Love" duo have plans to collaborate on a joint album, according to sources close to the couple.
