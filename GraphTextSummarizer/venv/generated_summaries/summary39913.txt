Lugo fired the commanders of the country's army, air force and navy on Wednesday. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro took over the top post at the air force and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas, at the navy. The armed forces commander, Rear Adm. Cibar Benitez Caceres, had been the only top official to survive Wednesday's dismissals. Some opposition politicians said Friday that Lugo, a leftist, is trying to install military commanders more in tune with his political and ideological leanings. -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo continued to purge the top ranks of the nation's military Friday, removing the armed forces' commander.
