The participating hotels are the Howard Johnson Plaza Anaheim Resort and the Howard Johnson Inn San Diego Sea World in California; the Howard Johnson Inn Mystic in Mystic, Connecticut; the Howard Johnson Plaza Hotel -- Miami Airport in Florida; the Howard Johnson Plaza in Portland, Maine; the Howard Johnson Toms River in New Jersey; the Howard Johnson Rapid City in South Dakota and the Howard Johnson Express Inn near Arlington Ballpark and Six Flags in Arlington, Texas. "At Howard Johnson hotels, our owners strive to give each and every guest a great stay, one that creates the same happy-filled memories that the brand's legacy is built upon," said Senior Vice President Rui Barros in a statement. The Howard Johnson hotel chain is trying to make amends for fictionally failing the inscrutable ad man in this week's episode of "Mad Men." "To the Don Drapers of the world, the Howard Johnson hotel brand would like to say this: We're sorry and your next stay is on us," the company said in announcing a "Mad Men"-inspired promotion. Guests with the legal name Don Draper (ahem, the "real" Don Draper might not qualify) can book a free one-night stay now through May 8 for stays completed by August 31 at one of eight Howard Johnson locations.
