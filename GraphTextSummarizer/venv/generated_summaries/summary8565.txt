-- Six weeks after he was released from Taliban captivity, Sgt. Bergdahl has yet to be interviewed by the officer investigating his case, Lt. Colonel Alayne Conway said last week. On Monday, he began his job with a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. Bergdahl venturing off base, rubbing elbows with public Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while in captivity. The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but it quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity.
