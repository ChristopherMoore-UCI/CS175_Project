But last year, at the age of 50, Wolfram launched what may be his most ambitious effort -- Wolfram|Alpha, a knowledge engine that answers users' questions on the Web by computing answers in real time with the help of a vast collection of databases. "But people mostly thought that it'd happen by computers managing to emulate brains -- and pulling in knowledge and processing like we humans do. And at the time I concluded it'd require solving the whole problem of artificial intelligence -- and was way out of reach. But then I spent the next 25 years doing things that, as I'll explain, finally made me think: Maybe, just maybe this computable knowledge idea isn't so out of reach. "It was about 30 years ago when I first started thinking about making knowledge broadly computable.
