Two potential Republican presidential candidates criticized the White House for failing to send representatives to the unity rally in Paris, where world leaders were among at least 3.7 million people who marched in solidarity after last week's terror attacks. Sen. Ted Cruz stressed that President Obama should have been there to link arms with other heads of state, while Sen. Marco Rubio argued there were a "plethora of people" that could have gone for the United States. The official also pointed to Obama's visit to the French Embassy in Washington last week. Rubio, who's releasing a new book "American Dreams" as he considers a presidential bid, said he understands why President Barack Obama did not attend, arguing that his security detail could become "disruptive" at an event like the rally.
