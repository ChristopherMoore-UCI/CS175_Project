Meanwhile, Rick Santorum decries "cultural liberalism" and warns that the government is trying to destroy religious freedom by forcing Catholic organizations to insure birth control. Such fears diminished as Catholic immigrants assimilated in the 20th century, but many Protestants remained hostile toward Catholic politicians. And just as religious right leaders seldom extend their demands for religious freedom to Muslims and other non-Christian religions, Catholics might one day find the freedoms that they have come to take for granted are no longer assured. Many of the 13 colonies banned Catholics from public office and prohibited Catholic rituals. After independence, the Constitution protected Catholics from the worst persecutions of the Colonial period, but discrimination persisted, and anti-Catholic paranoia raged with an intensity that would have made Glenn Beck blush.
