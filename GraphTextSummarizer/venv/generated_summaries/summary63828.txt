In May 2012 the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) decided that windsurfing -- which made its Olympic debut in 1984 -- would not be included in the Rio 2016 Olympics. Gowers said that he thinks it is "unfortunate that there are only 10 sailing classes available in the Olympics" and that the IKA never wanted kiteboarding to replace windsurfing. "Kiteboarding has proven to us that it is ready to be included into the list of prestigious ISAF Events and it is a fantastic addition to the sailing program for the 2016 Olympic Games," he added.

I think board sports should have more of a presence in the Olympics because, at the end of the day, kiteboarding and windsurfing are far more available in developing countries because the entry cost is much less than it is for some of the sailing classes," he added.
