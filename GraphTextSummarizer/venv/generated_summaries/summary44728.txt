Williams said her mother said, "I will be there for you." Venus Williams, the No. 11 singles player, isn't playing in the tournament, but Serena Williams said her older sister was 100% behind her. Serena Williams announced her return to the event in a TIME magazine first-person piece in February, writing she would ended her boycott in the spirit of forgiveness. Many fans didn't buy it and thought it was orchestrated to give the younger Williams a chance for extra rest. The end of the boycott took a lot of conversations with a lot of people, Williams told reporters Thursday. That will end Friday when Serena Williams, the world No. 1, faces Monica Niculescu, the 68th-ranked player in a second-round match.
