Al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), has claimed to be behind the January 7 massacre by gunmen Said and Cherif Kouachi at the offices of Charlie Hebdo. " Paris prosecutor Fran√ßois Molins told a news conference that progress has been made in the investigation into the attack carried out by Coulibaly, but less so in the probe into the Kouachi brothers. Federal prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said last week that the alleged terror cell targeted in the countrywide raids was on the brink of an attack and planned to target police officers. New surveillance video obtained by CNN purportedly shows Coulibaly and Hayat Boumedienne -- believed currently to be in Syria -- outside a Jewish institution in Paris. An off-camera interviewer asked why attacks have abated in the United States.
