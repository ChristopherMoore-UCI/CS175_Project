He said he did not know why Duvalier returned to Haiti but many people have waited many years for an opportunity to prosecute him. They told him he had been arrested because his radio broadcasts were "subversive." Frank Blaise, a 70-year-old agronomist, returned home to Haiti from the United States in June 1983 and was arrested two months later and driven by jeep to the Casernes Dessalines army barracks, which the United Nations says was used by Duvalier to interrogate and detain people suspected of anti-government activity. Amnesty International researcher Gerardo Ducos gave Haitian authorities 100 documents that it says detail cases of detention without trial, systematic torture, disappearances and extrajudicial killings that took place in Haiti between 1971 and 1986. But human rights groups have mounted pressure on Haitian authorities to take Duvalier to court on abuse charges. In his first public statement since his unexpected return, Duvalier told reporters he wanted to be in Haiti to help with rebuilding the country after last year's devastating earthquake.
