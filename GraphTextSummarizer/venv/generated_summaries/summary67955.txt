Schori had testified that Peterson's fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, told him she woke up alone the night Savio died and Drew Peterson later coached her on how to talk to police about his whereabouts that night. On Wednesday, the jury also asked for Drew Peterson's and Stacy Peterson's phone records for the weekend Savio died. Peterson was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Cales, who became his fourth wife. Peterson, a former Chicago-area police sergeant, is accused of killing his ex-wife, Kathleen Savio, in 2004. -- The jury in the Drew Peterson murder trial deliberated for more than eight hours Wednesday before a judge sent them home for the night.
