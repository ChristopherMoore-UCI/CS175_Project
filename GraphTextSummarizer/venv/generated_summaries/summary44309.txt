Even former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, a North Korean ally, warned against conflict last week. It also fears a united Korea under the control of South Korea, a close U.S. ally. The meeting showed another side of a young man thrust into the seat of power with much to prove, according to Korea watchers. "I think there's a big element of domestic North Korean politics, if one can understand that concept, where clearly Kim Jong Un is not being well received," Hill told CNN recently. If the latest U.S. intelligence reports are true then North Korea is planning to test-fire not one but multiple missiles, the latest provocative act by its unpredictable young leader.
