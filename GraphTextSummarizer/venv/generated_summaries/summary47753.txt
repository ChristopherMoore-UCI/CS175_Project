Young appeared intoxicated when police arrived at the scene outside the Hilton New York hotel, and he was treated and released from a hospital Friday morning, police Detective Martin Speechley said. A criminal complaint states Young made an anti-Semitic remark, according to CNN affiliate WABC. The aggravated harassment charge is a misdemeanor, but Speechley said the case is being investigated as a possible hate crime because of "religious statements made" during the dispute. The other man, who was not identified, sustained minor injuries but refused treatment, Speechley said. "I sincerely regret what happened last night," Young said, according to WABC.
