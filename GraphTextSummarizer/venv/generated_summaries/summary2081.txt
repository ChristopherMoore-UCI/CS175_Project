-- A Peruvian police report leaked Monday says the alleged victim of Joran van der Sloot was found in his hotel room on the floor, half-dressed. Van der Sloot, who was twice arrested in connection with the disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba in 2005, is in Peruvian custody as a suspect in the killing of Flores, 21. About an hour later, according to the police report, the receptionist noticed that van der Sloot owed money for two nights and went up to his room, where her knocks went unanswered. The hotel worker assumed that van der Sloot was asleep because the room key was with him and not the front desk. According to the document, the Hotel Tac, where van der Sloot was staying, received a call from someone looking for him about 11 p.m. June 1.
