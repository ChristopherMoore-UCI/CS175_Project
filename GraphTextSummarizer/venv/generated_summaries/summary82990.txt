Talented people want to work for leaders and organizations that truly care about their employees and the communities in which they operate. The traits that make up a good leader can vary depending on the organization, team, manager and work environment. Leverage team strengths. Know where you're going and have a strong stated mission to lead people on. Not playing favorites with people and treating all people -- no matter what station in life, what class or what rank in the org chart -- the same.
