Two men, ages 29 and 18, and a 21-year-old woman were arrested in Manchester, northwest England, on suspicion of being involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, Greater Manchester Police said. "There are serious concerns that anyone traveling to Syria, whether for humanitarian reasons or because of a desire to support the Syrian opposition, may be targeted by extremist groups who want to recruit them. Detective Chief Superintendent Tony Mole, head of the counterterror unit, said there was no imminent threat to anyone in Manchester or Britain. Mole said even those who travel to the region with the intention of providing humanitarian aid are putting themselves in danger. -- UK police arrested four people Tuesday on suspicion of traveling to Syria or supporting the fighting there.
