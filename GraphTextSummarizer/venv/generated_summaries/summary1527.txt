In his new book, Yu returns to skewer more science fiction concepts, including the multiverse, time travel, video games and zombies. But other aspects reduce the need, and to some extent, desire, to talk to people face-to-face, and it's easy to understand how those aspects might be making some people feel more lonely than ever. Author Charles Yu hopes you like his new book, but if not, an apology is built right into the title. With that in mind, do you think new technology is making us more isolated? It doesn't change who we are, it just enables us to say things faster, and to more people -- but at some point that quantitative effect shades into a qualitative change in how we relate to each other.
