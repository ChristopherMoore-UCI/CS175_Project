The 738-foot Golden Seas was traveling from Vancouver, British Columbia, to the United Arab Emirates when it suffered engine trouble Friday morning off Alaska's remote Aleutian Islands. Chief Petty Officer Dana Warr said Monday the disabled Golden Seas and the tow vessel Tor Viking II had to travel about 150 nautical miles (172 miles) despite being just 30 miles south of the harbor as of Monday afternoon. According to a situation report released Monday from the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, several islands along the Golden Seas' route to Dutch Harbor "may be vulnerable to a potential spill," but no spill has occurred. -- A broken-down freighter and its tow ship finally reached safety in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, on Tuesday afternoon, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
