Strang said the stubborn nature of heroin addiction is proof that getting addicts into treatment is really a shallow achievement, because many will eventually turn to drugs again. -- If treating heroin addicts by giving them heroin seems counterintuitive, having the government fund that addiction to the tune of more than $22,000 per patient per year comes across as downright radical. "From the cost point of view, if you actually look at the bigger picture, cheap treatment isn't always good treatment. The use of street heroin was reduced by three quarters and the crimes committed trying to get drugs were cut by two-thirds, the study found. If cheap treatment doesn't deliver any benefit then it's particularity bad value," Strang said.
