-- A convicted murderer who escaped from a Michigan prison on Super Bowl Sunday used snow-white thermal underwear, hobby scissors, his belt and a dose of inattention from prison guards to sneak out, the state Department of Corrections has concluded in a newly released report. Michael David Elliot ducked away from other prisoners after dinner on February 2, slipped outside and took off an extra-large set of prison blues to reveal a head-to-toe outfit of white clothing he'd crafted from thermal underwear, according to the prison report. He used the white clothing to blend in with the snow cover at Ionia Correctional Facility in central Michigan as he crawled toward a pair of wire fences separating him from freedom, the report found. Elliott told the woman that he didn't want to hurt her, he just wanted to get away from Michigan and prison. Authorities later found Elliot nearby in LaPorte County, Indiana, where he remains awaiting extradition, according to the Michigan corrections department.
