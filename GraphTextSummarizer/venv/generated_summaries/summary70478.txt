Run by German carrier Lufthansa, animals range from domestic pets to more exotic specimens destined for zoos and animal reserves, explains Axel Heitman, director of the Animal Lounge. More than 100 million animals jetted in and out of Frankfurt's Animal Lounge last year including 2000 horses, 14,000 cats and dogs, 80 million ornamental fish and 300 tons of worms. Most animals can travel in the belly of passenger planes, but Lufthansa also has a fleet of 18 freight aircraft which can accommodate all shapes and size of animal -- be it hippopotamuses en route to the Philippines from Israel or rhinos and even crocodiles. -- With 56.4 million passengers, Frankfurt was the world's ninth busiest airport in 2011, according to airport trade organization, Airport Council International. "Every day we learn new things because, as you can imagine, there is a huge variety of animals," he said.
