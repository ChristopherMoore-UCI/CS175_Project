"Richardson is the oldest case among the dozen escapees and it is fitting that justice caught up with him first," said Florida Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner Gerald Bailey. Oscar Eugene Richardson, 61, was arrested Saturday in Ridgedale, Missouri, as a result of information received through a police hot line, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the state Department of Corrections said. The money is provided by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the Department of Corrections and the Florida Police Chiefs' Association. "The campaign is designed to reach the public during the holiday season, when investigators believe the wanted men are most likely to contact friends, family and loved ones," the Florida Department of Law Enforcement said. -- A man who escaped from a Florida work release center in 1979 while serving a sentence for armed robbery has been captured in Missouri, authorities said Monday.
