Hollywood celebrities are rightly outraged to discover that places like this exist, and they're showing it by boycotting the Beverly Hills Hotel, owned by an investment group of the Sultan of Brunei's, to protest his country's new Sharia laws against homosexuality and adultery. Whereas it's unlikely most Hollywood celebrities could locate Brunei on a map (it shares the huge island of Borneo with Malaysia and Indonesia), I bet many know their way to Dubai. It's unclear how far Brunei will go in enforcing its newly adopted Sharia lawâ€”and there are few instances in recent years of the UAE actually carrying out Sharia punishments, such as flogging. It was the United Arab Emirates, a favorite destination and filming location for wealthy Hollywood celebrities. Jennifer Lopez performed in Dubai in March.
