Another critically important principle when considering the ideal tax rate is something called "Hauser's Law," named after investment economist Kurt Hauser, which shows that over the last six decades tax revenue as a percent of GDP has been about 19%, regardless of fluctuations in tax rates. Republicans, on the other hand, have desecrated the limited-government legacies of Reagan, Goldwater, and our founders by embarking on spending orgies with borrowed money -- a form of deferred taxation and financial repression -- while hiding beyond false pledges of tax purity that have made tax reduction and simplification much more difficult to achieve. In other words, government has an extremely difficult time collecting more than 19% or 19.5% of revenue even if it increases tax rates considerably. President Obama's own deficit reduction commission, on which I served -- the Simpson-Bowles commission -- followed this template of lowering tax rates and broadening the base by getting rid of spending in the code. I would push rates even lower, but the commission report, which was supported by conservatives and liberals, showed that it is possible to lower rates, stimulate growth, generate additional revenue and reduce the deficit.
