Investigators are also looking into the neighbor's complaint that Bieber drove his sports car at high speeds through the otherwise quiet streets of his gated Calabasas, California, community, Whitmore said. Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies are investigating the neighbor's battery complaint against Bieber, spokesman Steve Whitmore said. The photographer said Bieber attacked him as he was taking photos of Bieber and his then-girlfriend, Selena Gomez. Bieber had just returned to his California home Tuesday morning after performing in Europe. The teen pop star went through similar brush with the law last May when a photographer filed a complaint with the sheriff accusing Bieber of misdemeanor battery.
