The United Nations itself said two months ago that its team had found no evidence supporting the claims, though the ultimate findings are "inconclusive and require further investigation." Violence in Darfur -- an arid region in western Sudan -- began raging in the early 2000s, with then-U.N. envoy Tom Eric Vraalsen at one point calling the humanitarian crisis there "one of the worst in the world." "Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that during (the) attacks, government soldiers went house-to-house in Tabit, searching houses, looting property, severely beating residents, and raping women and girls," the report stated. In December, Under-Secretary-General for U.N. Peacekeeping Operations Herve Ladsous briefed the Security Council about increased fighting, "deadly" internal conflicts and an alarming rise of crime in Darfur. The United Nations and African Union have a force in Darfur, but according to Human Rights Watch, the Sudanese government has "prevented (them) from carrying out a credible investigation." Citing 130 interviews with locals, the advocacy group said this week that in October, Sudanese soldiers raped more than 200 women and girls over a 36-hour period in the north Darfur town of Tabit.
