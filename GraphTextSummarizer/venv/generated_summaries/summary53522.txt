"I am the happiest man to announce that the World Cup in South Africa was a huge, huge financial success for everybody -- for Africa for South Africa, for FIFA," Blatter told reporters after a meeting of the executive committee of football's world governing body in Zurich on Thursday. -- FIFA have confirmed they made $3.655 billion from the World Cup in South Africa, after the organization announced buoyant financial figures between 2007 and 2010. President Sepp Blatter said that the figures proved it was the right decision to award the 2010 tournament to South Africa, despite fears that hosting the biggest event in football on the continent was a financial risk. Meanwhile, Blatter also said that he expected to be unchallenged for a fourth term as FIFA president when elections take place in June this year. Blatter has been president of FIFA since 1998 and was recently criticized over his handling over the World Cup cash-for-votes scandal.
