The CDC has linked six deaths to the outbreak; health officials in New York have connected a seventh death -- a school official -- to the disease. Frieden said Sunday that "with the virus spreading widely," closing affected schools "will make little difference in transmission throughout New York City, but we hope will help slow transmission within the individual school communities." Wiener's school is among a handful in New York that temporarily closed at the recommendation of the city's Health Department. In New York, medical investigators determined that the death of a 16-month-old boy in Queens was not linked to the flu. That death came a day after an assistant principal from New York died after contracting the H1N1 virus.
