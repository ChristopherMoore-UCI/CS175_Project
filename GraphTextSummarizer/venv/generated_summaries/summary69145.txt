The Humane Society of the United States is happy about the report's recommendations for chimpanzee retirement and for the standards of living conditions for the animals, although its ultimate goal is to end all animal use in research, said Kathleen Conlee, vice president for animal research issues. -- A movement away from using chimpanzees for research is gaining speed. But there are other chimpanzees that are part of research in the United States that do not fall into these categories. Chimpanzees should have a living space of at least 1,000 square feet per animal and should be able to climb at least 20 feet vertically, the report said. But newer technologies, other animals and non-animal systems have been "shown to address questions that we before may have only been able to address for chimpanzees," he said.
