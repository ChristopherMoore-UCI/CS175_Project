The other four blasts hit other sacred locations around Mahabodhi, said Bihar police official S.K. Bhardwaj. While no one took responsibility for the attack, suspicion fell on the home-grown Islamist group Indian Mujahideen, Bhardwaj said. Four of the eight explosions occurred at the Mahabodhi temple complex, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Bihar state that houses a tree where Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. A 50-year-old Tibetan and a 30-year-old Myanmar national were injured in the attack, Bhardwaj said. -- A series of small bombs went off in and around a world-famous Buddhist temple in eastern India Sunday, injuring two people, authorities said.
