Shirley Dermond's body was found in Lake Oconee, south of Athens, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills told reporters Friday. Dermond's family is in shock with the news of the discovery of her body, said the Rev. David Key of Lake Oconee Community Church. Investigators believe she was taken from her home after her husband, 88-year-old Russell Dermond, was decapitated sometime between May 2 and May 4. "We now, unfortunately, know that Shirley Dermond was murdered," Sills said. Her purse, cell phone and car were all at the couple's million-dollar waterfront home on Lake Oconee where her husband's headless body was found.
