Pop singer Britney Spears must submit to random drug tests, a judge has ordered after finding she engaged in "habitual, frequent, and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol. The ruling comes during Spears' custody battle with ex-husband Kevin Federline. The ruling by Superior Court Commissioner Scott Gordon provided no details and did not name any specific drugs, stating only that the findings were "based on the evidence presented." Spears must also spend eight hours a week working with a parenting coach who will observe her interactions with her children, according to the ruling released Tuesday. Tuesday's order comes amid a career freefall for Spears, who has a new album due in stores November 13. After a closed hearing Monday, Gordon ordered Spears, 25, to undergo random drug tests twice a week.
