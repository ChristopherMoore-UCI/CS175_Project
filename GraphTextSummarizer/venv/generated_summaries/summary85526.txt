" Swimming World magazine reported that Crippen fell unconscious during the event and deep-sea divers found him two hours later near the race's final buoy. Doctors determined that severe fatigue was behind Crippen's sudden death, UAE Swimming Federation Secretary Saeed Al Hamour told CNN on Sunday. U.S. Swimming Federation authorities said they expect to receive the body of the star open-water swimmer Monday. Crippen won bronze in the 10-kilometer event at the 2009 FINA World Championships and was the gold medalist in the same event at the 2007 Pan American Games, according to USA Swimming. The loss of Crippen hit hard in suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he grew up in a family of swimmers.
