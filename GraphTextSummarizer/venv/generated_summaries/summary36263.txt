For over six years, Ntaganda has been sought as a suspect for crimes under international law that include murder, rape and the use of child soldiers. Until a few days ago Bosco Ntaganda, wanted for war crimes and for crimes against humanity, was at large. He faces charges for 10 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for crimes allegedly committed in DRC's Ituri Province between 2002 and 2003. Ultimately, it remains the responsibility of the Congolese authorities to bring all suspected perpetrators of crimes against international human rights and humanitarian law to trial. From leader of an armed group to a general in the Congolese army, Ntaganda has appeared in eastern DRC in various incarnations over the years.
