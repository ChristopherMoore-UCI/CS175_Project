"Their importance is that based on them, we have been able to document the presence of pre-Hispanic groups in Burgos, where before it was believed there was nothing, when in reality it was inhabited by one or several cultures," she said. -- Nearly 5,000 cave paintings found in northeastern Mexico were made by at least three groups of hunter-gatherers who lived in an area previously thought to have been uninhabited, archeologists said. Drawings in one cave depicted an atlatl, a pre-Hispanic hunting tool that had not been previously found in other cave art in this part of Mexico, Garcia said. The ages of the cave paintings remain uncertain for now because archaeologists have not found any objects in the area that could help date them, said another archeologist, Gustavo Ramirez. The first findings about the red markings that depict people, shapes and designs were revealed this week at a conference in Mexico City.
