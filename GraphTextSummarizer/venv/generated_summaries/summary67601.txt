Similarly, there will be long-term consequences for the West Coast ports as shippers and those who rely on goods moving in and out of these ports find other ways to bring their cargo into North America -- either through Canada, Mexico or through the expanded Panama Canal to the Gulf and East Coast ports. West Coast dock workers and port management have been locked in heated labor negotiations since their contract expired in July of 2014 . When international customers can't get what they need from American suppliers -- both agricultural and manufactured -- there are plenty of competitors from other countries ready to step in. The situation is so urgent, and distress over the West Coast ports has become so widespread, that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle held a news conference at the Capitol last week to press for action. During these negotiations, port operations have gradually slowed as each side seeks to put pressure on the other.
