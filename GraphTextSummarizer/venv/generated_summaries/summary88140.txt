-- More than three weeks after seven California men went missing when the fishing vessel Erik sank in Mexico's Sea of Cortez, the families of the missing Americans are expressing anger with the U.S. and Mexican governments for not conducting a dive to find the sunken boat -- and possibly the bodies entombed beneath the sea. On Sunday, they will gather for the first time since the accident; at a hotel in northern California, Lee said. All were from northern California, relatives said. Most recently, they have pressed U.S. officials to ask the governor of Baja California to fund a dive -- or at least to grant permission for the American families to carry out a private dive. This should not have happened at all," said May Lee of San Ramon, California.
