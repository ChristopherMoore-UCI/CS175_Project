"Whenever I see her, I remember so many things." Marie Jeanne unscrews a plastic bottle containing anti-retroviral tablets (ARVs). At the AVEGA headquarters in Kigali, genocide survivors with HIV/AIDS line up to receive ARVs. To Marie Jeanne the end of the war also meant an end to the repeated, brutal rapes she had been forced to endure at the hands of many different men. And 20 years on, Marie Jeanne says her daughter's birthday is still a source of pain to her. The killings finally came to an end 100 days later, when Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) troops, led by Paul Kagame, defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the country.
