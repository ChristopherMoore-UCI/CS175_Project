-- Fierce battles between Yemeni government forces and Shiite Muslim rebels in the country's northwest have displaced tens of thousands of people, creating widespread humanitarian concerns, aid agencies said Thursday. Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh is also faced with a separatist movement in the country's south and a growing threat from al Qaeda. In mid-August, Yemen laid out cease-fire terms to the Houthi rebels, which included removing checkpoints, ending banditry and destructive acts, handing over all military equipment and weapons, and offering information on the fate of six kidnapped Europeans who disappeared in June, SABA, Yemen's official news agency reported. "Internally we are doing all we can to ensure that civilians are not hurt and to minimize the collateral damage." Yemen's government and Houthi rebels have been involved in intermittent fighting since 2004. UNICEF trucks carrying supplies to internally displaced families in Yemen.
