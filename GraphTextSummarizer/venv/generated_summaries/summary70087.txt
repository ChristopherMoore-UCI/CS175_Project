She brings the colors to life and manages to capture yachts and yachting in the right moment," said Jamie Edmiston, managing director at international superyacht charter company Edmiston. The extraordinary pictures, taken from masts up to 10 storeys-high, capture sailors the size of ants scuttling around on sleek white decks, surrounded by churning ocean and enormous rippling sails. Not content with aerial acrobatics, the ballsy Brit has also carved a name for herself as an accomplished underwater photographer, diving six meters below the surface to capture yachts silently slicing through the waves in the annual Maxi Yacht Rolex Cup. After graduating from the London College of Printing with a degree in photography, Evans landed a dream job taking pictures aboard British yacht Victory, during the 1982 America's Cup. Looking back at a career that now spans over three decades, Evans recalls the reaction to her first foray into masthead photography in the early 1980s.
