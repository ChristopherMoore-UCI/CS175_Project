-- A 2-year-old girl in Mali has been diagnosed with Ebola, making her the West African country's first confirmed case, health officials said Thursday. Ousmane Kone, Mali's minister for public health, called for people in Kayes, west of the capital city of Bamako, to "stay calm" and observe "hygiene measures. The girl was brought to Mali from neighboring Guinea, where the outbreak this year is believed to have started, World Health Organization spokeswoman Yvette Bivigou said. A test confirmed the girl has Ebola, Health Ministry spokeswoman Markatie Daou said. The girl, whose father died of Ebola, was taken to the hospital in Kayes after a nurse noticed she was suffering from what appeared to be Ebola-like symptoms.
