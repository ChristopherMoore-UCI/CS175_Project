At least 63 people have been killed in a series of attacks by tribal militants in India's remote northeastern state of Assam, a police official said Wednesday. The Bodo insurgents -- apparently angry over a recent police crackdown that led to several arrests and the seizure of weapons -- targeted members of another tribal community, said Khagen Sarma, the state police chief. Indian Home Minister Rajnath Singh is expected to visit Assam on Wednesday to review the situation, his spokesman K.S. Dhatwalia said. The attacks by fighters from the Bodo tribe took place Tuesday, Assam Police Inspector-General S.N. Singh told CNN. But in this case, they attacked members of another tribal community, police said.
