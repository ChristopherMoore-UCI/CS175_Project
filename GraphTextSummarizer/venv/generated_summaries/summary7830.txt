Streaming music service Songza launched apps for Android and iOS on Tuesday that are designed to make it easy for music fans to find and share digital playlists for practically any occasion. The one downside to Songza and its mobile app is that right now, users can only create playlists at the Songza.com website. Additionally, Songza doesn't focus on creating artist based radio stations -- although you can do that -- instead, it focuses on connecting users with curated or peer-created mix tapes. Songza's co-founder and CEO Elias Roman told us that the company is looking at either partnering with existing on-demand subscription services such as Spotify or working out its own on-demand licensing agreement so that users can listen to their own selections. If Songza can nail that last loop and provide users who are willing to pay with on-demand access to their own playlists, we could easily see Songza taking off in a huge way.
