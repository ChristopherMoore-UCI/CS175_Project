Witnesses saw the Santa Barbara Airlines plane go down, according to Antonio Rivero, Venezuela's national director of civil protection. Media reports said the Santa Barbara Airlines plane was supposed to land about 7 p.m. local time Thursday. -- Rescue teams on Friday found the wreckage of a plane that crashed Thursday night in the mountains of Venezuela, but none of the 46 people aboard survived, a searcher said. Nelson Marquez, chief of civil defense for Merida, said the plane was carrying 43 passengers and three crew members. Harsh weather and rough terrain in the Andes Mountains likely will make the job of emergency workers difficult, Rivero said on a state-run television station.
