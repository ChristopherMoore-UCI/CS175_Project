Obama said he will attempt to block bonuses for AIG, payments he described as an "outrage." They're also investigating possible legal avenues Congress can take to force the company to return money used for bonuses, a House Democratic leadership aide and a House Financial Services Committee aide said Monday. "My colleagues and I are sending a letter to [AIG CEO Edward] Liddy informing him that he can go right ahead and tell the employees that are scheduled to get bonuses that they should voluntarily return them," Sen. Charles Schumer said on the Senate floor. "You could write a tax provision that's narrowly crafted only to the people receiving bonuses." Watch Obama say he's outraged by bonuses Â»
