The suspect remained at large Sunday night, believed to be somewhere in the expansive park, Mount Rainier National Park spokeswoman Lee Taylor said. A ranger at Mount Rainier for the past four years, Anderson "was on the job not for money or for glory, but out of a love for wild places and the national parks," said Taylor. -- Authorities scoured the national park around Washington's Mount Rainier on Sunday for a man they say fatally shot a park ranger and fled into the woods, a park spokeswoman said. " Anderson was the mother of a 4-year-old and 1-year-old and the wife of a fellow park ranger, according to Taylor. Park ranger Margaret Anderson, 34, responded to that call and set up her patrol vehicle as a roadblock.
