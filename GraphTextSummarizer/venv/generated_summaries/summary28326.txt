The clinic is consistently among the country's best in quality ratings, and its costs are among the lowest -- which is why President Obama often cites the Cleveland Clinic as an example of how health care in America should be, and why Nissen and other leading doctors here are frequently consulted by lawmakers and administration officials pushing major reforms this year. So we have to do something as a nation to begin to deal with all those." Cosgrove, like Nissen, is an enthusiastic proponent of major national health care reforms that bring coverage to the estimated 45 to 50 million Americans who lack health insurance and that put an emphasis on primary and preventive care. " Again, Cosgrove is emphatic that there are substantial cost savings in federal health programs that can be achieved over time. In another cautionary note, Cosgrove, however, said over time he believes widespread electronic record keeping -- and sharing -- will lead to fewer duplicative tests and other cost savings, but that the jury is still out on that question. Obama's stimulus legislation included funding for an expansion of electronic record keeping, and he has held up the practice as a revolutionary way to improve quality and cut costs.
