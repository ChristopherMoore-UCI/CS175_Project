But he did say that under the Ryan plan, the rate of Medicare spending growth per person "is somewhat less than what is expected under current law." "It would reduce Medicare spending, and so it would improve Medicare solvency. When officials talk of Medicare insolvency, they're talking specifically about the trust fund for Medicare's hospital insurance, or Medicare Part A, which covers inpatient hospital stays, care at a nursing facility, hospice care and some home health care. As for the present situation, one of the trustees, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, said that without the health care reform, Medicare Part A would only be able to pay costs in full until 2016, CNNMoney reported. But the report also notes that the projected $716 billion increase in Medicare spending if the measure is repealed does not signal a $716 billion decrease if the measure stays in place -- which is Romney's argument. They point to a Congressional Budget Office report that shows spending would be between 35% and 42% lower for new enrollees under the Ryan plan versus traditional Medicare, CNNMoney reported.
