The saga began in 1997, when police found Brown's body along the Colorado River in Bullhead City, about 50 miles southeast of Las Vegas. So, according to police, in June the 55-year-old drove from his North Carolina home all the way to Arizona, where he walked into the Winslow, Arizona, police department and confessed. According to the Charlotte Observer, Gibson told police he had met Brown one night and the two went back to his trailer. "He could have gotten away with this," Bullhead City police Detective Mary Garcia said. A few months later, he moved from Bullhead City, according to police.
