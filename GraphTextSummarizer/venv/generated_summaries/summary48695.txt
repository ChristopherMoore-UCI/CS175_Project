Asked on CNN's "Starting Point" whether Santorum's comments reflected a lack of understanding about Puerto Rico, the territory's Republican Gov. Luis Fortuno, who has endorsed Romney, said, "Gov. Romney has shown respect for exactly our heritage and our history, understands it better. "Gov. Romney believes that English is the language of opportunity and supports efforts to expand English proficiency in Puerto Rico and across America. Minutes later, Santorum deputy communications director Matt Beynon tweeted, "So Romney once supported English as national language, then goes to Puerto Rico and says no language req on statehood. " Romney was also asked in Puerto Rico about his criticism of Puerto Rican Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, which has roiled some Puerto Rican voters. "Puerto Rico currently recognizes both English and Spanish as the official languages of the commonwealth," Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said.
