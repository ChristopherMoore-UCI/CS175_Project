"After the first fatwa (edict) a few months ago that stated that the praying direction is west, we have announced that the correct direction for praying is indeed northwest, and we have issued a new fatwa (edict) to correct it," said Ma'ruf Amin, the head of fatwa division in the Indonesian Ulema Council. The Indonesian Ulema Council told the country's Muslim populace in March to turn west when they offered their daily prayers. "I don't really worry about the praying direction," said Riza Irwansyah, an office worker in Jakarta. "This is important because facing west will mean that people were facing Africa when they pray," he said. Muslims are supposed to face the Kaaba, the religion's most sacred site in the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
