However, the Obama re-election team often points to Romney's father, the late George Romney, who released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968. -- President Barack Obama, who took his renewed pitch to cut taxes for the middle class to Iowa Tuesday, and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney ratcheted up the tense back and forth over outsourcing work overseas in an appeal to those hit hardest by the economic downturn. Obama's campaign has also been forcefully pushing a Washington Post report that calls Romney's former private equity firm, Bain Capital, a "pioneer" in outsourcing jobs overseas. Romney and the GOP have spent the past few days fighting back against the Obama campaign's line of attack that when the former Massachusetts governor was at Bain Capital he outsourced jobs overseas to the detriment of middle-class American workers. In addition to Priebus' event, Romney's campaign is also pointing to a new story in The Washington Post that details criticism of Obama for allowing domestic jobs to shift overseas.
