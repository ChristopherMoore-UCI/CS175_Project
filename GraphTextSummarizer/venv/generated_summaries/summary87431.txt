But what Pakistan really needs right now is more men like Ziauddin Yousafzai. I have met many who are, who defy the Taliban by going to school every day in the North West and tribal areas. Malala: "I want to become a prime minister of Pakistan" It is clearly the courage of his conviction that led Ziauddin to talk to me about his hopes for peace and the battle with Islamist militants for the right to be educated many years ago. Without men like Ziauddin, there will be no women like Malala. Children -- particularly girls -- were being stopped from going to school by the hardline Taliban but he had kept his own school open.
