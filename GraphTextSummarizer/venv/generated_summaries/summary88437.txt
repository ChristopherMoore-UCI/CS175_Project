Raising the sales age "will protect teens and may prevent many people from ever starting to smoke," Health Commissioner Thomas A. Farley, said in a statement after the vote. "You're an adult; you should be able to buy a pack of cigarettes," one New Yorker told CNN affiliate NY1. Neighboring states and counties have raised the tobacco sale age to 19, including New Jersey in 2005, the Department of Health said. "By increasing the smoking age to 21, we will help prevent another generation from the ill health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking," Bloomberg said in a statement on Wednesday. In September 2012, the Board of Health voted to ban the sale of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues, a measure Bloomberg spearheaded.
