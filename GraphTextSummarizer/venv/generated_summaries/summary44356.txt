Not only that, but it has made its designs open source, so that anyone with access to such printers can print out fingers, hands and now arms as well. Together, the pair developed a mechanical finger for van As, but their partnership has also gone on to benefit countless hand and arm amputees around the globe, through the birth of the company "Robohand." Officially launched in January 2012, Robohand creates affordable mechanical prosthetics through the use of 3D printers. "We had Dylan Laas in L.A. who received a Robohand and when his dad saw the impact he paid for Waldo, another person on our waiting list, to receive one as well," says van As. Because Robohand's manuals and 3-D printable files are available online, others are also using its designs to print prosthetics.
