Implants made by France's Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned in 2010, after it was discovered that they contained industrial-grade, which has more contaminants than the medical-grade gel they should have used. PIP was once the world's third largest supplier of implants -- 300,000 women in 65 countries around the world are thought to have had them fitted, both for cosmetic reasons and in reconstructive surgery following treatment for breast cancer. PIP silicone implants were never licensed for use in the United States. The advice given to women with PIP implants has varied widely from country to country. The British government says there is no evidence to recommend the routine removal of PIP implants, though it says women who are concerned should be able to have them removed.
