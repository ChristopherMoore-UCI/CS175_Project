The risks Brown has taken -- from adding celebrity culture to highbrow news magazines to ending the print run of Newsweek magazine -- have brought both success and failure throughout her career. "Great editors have great successes and great failures," says Ken Doctor, digital media analyst and author of Newsonomics, "[Brown] had remarkable success with Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, but Talk was a spectacular failure. While The Daily Beast is gaining a loyal digital readership -- with up to 16 million unique users a month and advertising up 30% year on year -- Brown's Midas touch has yet to work on Newsweek. In the 15 years Brown edited Vanity Fair, she took its monthly sales from 200,000 to 1.2 million and is credited with saving the magazine with her signature formula of mixing serious news with celebrity culture. Brown launched news website The Daily Beast -- named after the fictional newspaper in the Evelyn Waugh novel "Scoop" -- in 2008 and merged it with Newsweek in 2010.
