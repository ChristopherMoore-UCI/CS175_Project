"Dana is typical of a lot of fibromyalgia patients," said Dr. Jefrey Lieberman, an Atlanta, Georgia-based rheumatologist. "Those criteria are diffuse pain in three or more quadrants of the body and the presence of what are called tender points in the body," Lieberman explained. Lieberman believed it is related to a disordered sleep pattern and poor exercise. "We think that aerobic exercise helps to stimulate endorphins and enkephlins from the body which are your own natural pain relievers," Lieberman said. The doctor is quick to point out that even with proper medication and adequate exercise, fibromyalgia has no cure.
