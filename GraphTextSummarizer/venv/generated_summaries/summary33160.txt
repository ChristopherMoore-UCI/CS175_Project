Fisher, a Republican, also singled out three speeches made by Ronald Reagan and one by George W. Bush as important enough to U.S. history to be added to the new curriculum , but none from from Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, or Jimmy Carter -- the last three Democratic presidents. "In essence, we have a new emphasis on what is bad about America," said state representative Dan Fisher, the measure's chief sponsor. The bill doesn't totally avoid what Fisher called America's "blemishes":  He included Martin Luther King's "Letter from Birmingham Jail" essay and "I Have a Dream" speech, as well as the "Ballot or the Bullet" speech made by Malcolm X as part of the replacement curriculum. The course, which was redesigned by the College Board and implemented in high school classrooms last year, isn't quite pro-America enough. "(The new framework) trades an emphasis on America's founding principles of Constitutional government  in favor of robust analyses of gender and racial oppression and class ethnicity and the lives of marginalized people, where the emphasis on instruction is of America as a nation of oppressors and exploiters," Fisher lamented at a legislative committee hearing  Tuesday.
