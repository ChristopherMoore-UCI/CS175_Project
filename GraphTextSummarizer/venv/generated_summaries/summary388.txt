According to these manuals, most carriers require a court order to implement cell phone surveillance -- which can range from data about inbound and outbound calls and text messages, to a detailed report of location history based on cell phone tower data. For example, based on invoices from cell phone companies, it appears that Raleigh, N.C., tracks hundreds of cell phones a year. Requiring warrants for all instances of cell phone tracking and surveillance based on carrier data is one step that the ACLU advocates. They found that "virtually all" of these agencies track the location of cell phones with data supplied by wireless carriers. So tracing cell phone data isn't a guarantee that police will find the person or information they're seeking.
