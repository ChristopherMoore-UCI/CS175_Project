Safe drinking water and emergency shelter materials could run out within weeks, while agencies on the ground have enough food for a month for the hundreds of thousands affected. Roughly 660,000 people are living in refugee camps in the wake of high waters that have wrought havoc for several weeks, Pakistan's national disaster authority said in a statement. "These families worry their children will go hungry, and without access to safe drinking water, they fear they will become sick from drinking contaminated water." "It is tragic to see families displaced from the floods with no shelter and barely enough to survive on," said Fawad Hussein, a U.N. official focused on flood relief. The death toll continues to rise from devastating flooding in southeastern Pakistan, with authorities saying Friday that 107 children are among the 434 people killed.
