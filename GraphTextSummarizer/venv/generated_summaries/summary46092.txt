A baggage handler at Reagan National Airport in Washington was found locked in a US Airways plane's cargo hold before takeoff Monday, said Laura J. Brown with the Federal Aviation Administration. Republic Airlines Flight 3336, listed as a US Airways flight, had 29 passengers on board and very few checked bags, Brown said. Liz Landau, a spokeswoman for US Airways said, "The engines never started and (the plane) never left the gate. A lot gets carried in a plane's cargo hold, but US Airways is still against people, especially those still on the clock. An investigation by US Airways is under way.
