The queen greeted a lineup of past Wimbledon champions that included Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova, Venus and Serena Williams, Jelena Jankovic and Roger Federer. The last time the queen attended the championships was in 1977, when she watched British player Virginia Wade win the ladies' singles title. She then entered the royal box at Center Court, where she planned to watch Britain's fourth-seed Andy Murray play Finland's Jarkko Nieminen under mostly sunny skies. Organizers said poached salmon, new potatoes and the traditional Wimbledon treat of strawberries and cream were likely to be on the menu. The queen, wearing a teal outfit and matching hat and holding a small bouquet, was escorted through the grounds as tennis fans rushed to catch a glimpse of her.
