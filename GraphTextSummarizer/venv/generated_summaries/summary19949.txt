Even before last week's spill, coal ash contamination was a concern for North Carolina officials. In statements announcing the North Carolina spill last week, Duke Energy said up to 82,000 tons of ash had been released and up to 27 million gallons of basin water had flooded into the river. Environmental advocates say the spill is a reminder of a troubling problem that's widespread in the state: coal ash ponds storing large amounts of waste close to drinking water supplies. Concerns over drinking water, wildlife Duke Energy announced last week that it found the leak in a 48-inch stormwater pipe at the retired Dan River Steam Station in Eden, North Carolina, on February 2. Parrish said Sunday that the utility is in the midst of plans to close the sites where it stores coal ash in North Carolina.
