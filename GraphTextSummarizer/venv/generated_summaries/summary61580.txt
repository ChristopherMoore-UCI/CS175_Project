"Mr. Biya is the people's choice," Prof. Elvis Ngolle Ngolle, a senior cabinet minister, told CNN. As the political unrest simmered, many politicians voiced concerns that the so-called "Arab Spring" -- in which authoritarian governments in the Middle East and North Africa were being pushed out by popular uprisings -- was inching its way to sub-Saharan Africa, starting with Cameroon.

But critics charge that Biya has consistently bypassed the constitution and doctored poll results in his favor, still putting ELECAM under his control.
