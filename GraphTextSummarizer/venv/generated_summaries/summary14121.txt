Within 48 hours, Next Media Animation answered the comedian's response with another, more elaborate and very funny video alleging that "Conan's cheap knock-off" was produced by an oppressed gang of American child laborers who once worked for Michael Jackson at his Neverland Ranch. -- Who will fire the next salvo in the ongoing friendly feud between TV host Conan O'Brien and Next Media Animation, the Taiwan-based animation studio known for its sarcastic CGI re-enactments of American news? This was nothing unusual, as Next Media already had produced videos spoofing Apple's iPhone 4 antenna problems and JetBlue's escapee flight attendant Steven Slater. But this time O'Brien responded with a tongue-in-cheek parody of Next Media Animation, complete with exaggerated characters and cheesy visuals. It all started in November when Next Media marked O'Brien's debut on cable channel TBS with an animated clip poking fun at his awkward exit from NBC earlier this year.
