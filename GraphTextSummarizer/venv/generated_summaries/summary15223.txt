Brooks' father, Joseph Brooks, 73, committed suicide in May 2011, New York police said. A jury convicted Nicholas Brooks, son of "You Light Up My Life" composer Joseph Brooks, in New York Supreme Court for strangling and drowning Sylvie Cachay in December 2010, the office said in a statement. "Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke," said publicist Kate Godici. Authorities said they relied on interviews with hotel employees and surveillance videos from the location to charge Brooks. The Oscar-winning songwriter was facing 11 rape and sexual assault charges, New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN.
