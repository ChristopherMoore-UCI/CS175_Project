Ballesteros met with his close friend and former European Ryder Cup teammate Jose Maria Olazabal before it teed off this week, according to the UK Press Association. -- The health of legendary golfer Seve Ballesteros has taken a turn for the worse, his family revealed on Friday. His triumph at the 1979 British Open made him the youngest winner of the event that century and the first non-British European to do so since 1907. " Ballesteros made his name when he finished second at the British Open as a 19-year-old in 1976 and that year went on to win the European Tour's money list for the first of six times. "Seve's physical condition was not good when Jose Maria went to see him, but they talked about golf and everything," Olazabal's manager Sergio Gomez told PA on Friday.
