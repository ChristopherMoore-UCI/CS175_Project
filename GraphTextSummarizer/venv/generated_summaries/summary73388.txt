Specifically, prosecutors are accusing Youssef of using a name other than his legal one in December 2010; possessing a driver's license under the Nakoula name; possessing a fraudulent driver's license; using the name Sam Bacile on August 7, 2011, the name he allegedly used in making the controversial film; and falsely telling his probation officer last month that he hadn't used the Bacile name. The filmmaker was identified in initial news accounts last month as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the name used in the bank fraud case. A public records search showed an Abanob B. Nakoula residing at the same address as Nakoula Basseley Nakoula. But the probation revocation case lists the defendant as Mark Basseley Youssef, which the filmmaker stated in court last month is his legal name. His film was initially implicated in the violent demonstration last month in Libya that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead last month.
