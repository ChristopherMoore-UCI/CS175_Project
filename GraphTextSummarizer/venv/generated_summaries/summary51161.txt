-- U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is acknowledging publicly the key role a Pakistani doctor who assisted the United States ahead of the strike on Osama bin Laden's compound last May that killed the terrorism mastermind. And he was not in any way treasonous towards Pakistan." Dr. Shakeel Afridi helped the CIA use a vaccination campaign to collect DNA samples from residents of bin Laden's to verify the terror leader's presence there. He said there were intelligence reports of Pakistani helicopters passing over the bin Laden compound. Panetta also told CBS that he remains convinced that someone in authority in Pakistan knew that bin Laden was hiding in the city of Abbottabad, a largely military community outside the capital, Islamabad. "Pakistan and the United States have a common cause here against terrorism, have a common cause against al Qaeda," Panetta said.
