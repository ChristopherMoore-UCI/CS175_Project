Democratic Senate leaders reacted to Cruz's primary win with a warning: If he wins the general election in November, gridlock in the Senate will be even worse than it is now. Cruz claims victory in Texas runoff A 41-year-old, first-time candidate, Cruz walloped the well-funded Republican establishment candidate, Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, in Tuesday's GOP Senate primary runoff. Texas GOP upstart Ted Cruz claimed victory Tuesday with a familiar tea party rallying cry. Ron Bonjean was a Senate Republican leadership aide for years, and he said history shows leaders can never be sure what rank and file firebrands like Cruz will do. One thing is clear: if the GOP succeeds in winning back control of the Senate, expectations will be a lot higher and pressure on the Republican leadership will be a lot more intense not to give in on the "stick-to-our principles" sensibilities driving voters towards tea party-backed candidates like Cruz.
