Kejriwal's stint as New Delhi's chief minister lasted 49 days, when he resigned after New Delhi lawmakers from other parties rejected an anti-corruption bill his government proposed last year. Still, Kejriwal remains a darling of a large section of New Delhi voters divided along layers of economic classes facing day-to-day problems in the congested city, observers say. Now, the two stand as rivals to rule the state of New Delhi, the center of India's politics. In New Delhi, the BJP is faced with stiff competition not from career politicians but from Kejriwal's two-year-old Aam Aadmi (Common Man's) Party or AAP. Kejriwal and Bedi were two of the main strategists of the 2011 anti-corruption agitation that rattled the then federal government of India's oldest Congress party.
