Hite and Nutter had previously urged the City Council to extend a 1% sales tax to make up the difference but -- despite approval from the General Assembly and Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett -- City Council President Darrell L. Clarke said he would rather focus that money on the city's critical pension problem. Hite and Nutter are also negotiating a contract with the local teachers' union, hoping to save money by asking teachers to make concessions on certain benefits. " Nutter had called Hite's ultimatum one of "the most chilling" statements he had ever heard a school superintendent make, but promised he would stand "shoulder to shoulder" with Hite and would not allow schools to open with no more staff than he could afford without the extra money. If the city does not solve the retirement fund issues, Clarke said, Philadelphia could quickly follow in the footsteps of other major cities with significant financial problems. Hite said he plans to open the schools on time based on Nutter's assurance, even though Nutter has not yet cut a deal with City Council over how it will be funded.
