I asked Williams if he would be willing to sit down and meet with the NAACP, the National Urban League, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights and other civil rights organizations to find common ground on various civil rights issues. During a debate I participated in Wednesday night on CNN's Anderson Cooper 360, Tea Party Express spokesman Mark Williams -- who moonlights as a radio talk show host -- blasted the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People for not doing anything to fight crime in the inner city, as well as for advancing issues that go against the U.S. Constitution. Yet as Williams continued his tirade, I really did want to hear exactly what civil rights issues he and other Tea Party members are fighting for. So with my suggestion in mind, it would be great for Williams, Sarah Palin and other Tea Party leaders, advocates and supporters, especially those candidates receiving their backing in November, to clearly state their position on some of the civil rights issues of the day (The following are not in a particular order of importance). -- While Glenn Beck continues to pathetically assert that he is a modern day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his listeners and viewers are the rightful heirs to the Civil Rights Movement he spearheaded, it may catch some by surprise that Tea Party leaders claim their movement is also one that is about advancing the civil rights of Americans.
