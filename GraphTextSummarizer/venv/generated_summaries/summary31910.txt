Former Cronulla player Matthew Johns said he was unable to say "sorry enough" regarding the incident "Violence against women is abhorrent, and sexual assault and the degradation of women is just that," said David Gallop, the NRL's chief executive. The allegations of group sex involved NRL personality Matthew Johns, who played for Cronulla at the time of the alleged incident in Christchurch, New Zealand. "The fact is, whatever the arguments about the details of the New Zealand incident involving Cronulla players in 2002, the conduct and its aftermath was simply unacceptable, full stop," David Gyngell, Nine's chief executive officer, said in a statement on the network's Web site. -- Australia's National Rugby League apologized on Tuesday for the behavior of its players after ABC's "Four Corners" current-affairs program revealed allegations of group sex in 2002 between players and a New Zealand woman. In his statement, Gallop pointed to NRL initiatives put in place since 2002 to promote positive attitudes toward women, including programs developed with the help of a rape crisis center.
