Germany of course, Spain of course as a World Cup winner (in 2010) and the dark horse might be Belgium or Chile. "I was a baby in the goal," Illgner tells CNN's Human to Hero series of his heroics for West Germany at the 1990 World Cup in Italy. The man he replaced that day in February 1986, Toni Schumacher, was twice a losing World Cup finalist for West Germany -- but Illgner would not suffer such a fate. "I don't know how many million people were around the streets but it was exceptional." IIlgner had watched on television the last time West Germany won the World Cup back in 1974 but he never thought he would be able to replicate the feats of legends like Beckenbauer, Gerd Muller and Bertie Vogts. IIlgner regularly covers the Spanish, Italian and German leagues for his employer and he feels more qualified than most to offer predictions on who to watch out for in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil starting next month.
