-- Australian hurdler Jana Rawlinson has had her breast implants removed to boost her chances of winning a medal for her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. The 27-year-old Rawlinson, whose private life has often made headlines in Australia, said she enjoyed having larger breasts but did not want to "short-change Australia". "I don't want to short-change Australia either -- I want to feel the most athletic I can, to know that I'm standing on the track in London the fittest I can be." "I absolutely loved having bigger boobs, but finally I've grown up enough to know myself -- to be honest about who I am when I look in the mirror," Rawlinson told the Woman's Day magazine. " Rawlinson won the 400m hurdles at the 2003 Paris world championships and four years later in Osaka, Japan.
