He argues areas of the Nile where there are more crayfish, human bilharzia infection rates are low. "When they hatched into crayfish, they ate all the fish, then burrowed through mud partitions into neighboring fish containments and ate those fish too." "In the 1980's somebody came to me and said that there was a new creature in the river Nile," says Khalil. The Nile's warm waters and abundant food supply helped the crayfish evolve, Khalil says, to reproduce at twice the rate of other species. He's traveling from community to community along the river Nile, teaching Egyptian fishermen and farmers about the American crayfish.
