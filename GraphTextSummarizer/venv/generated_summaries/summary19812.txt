District Court Chief Judge Charles LaVerdiere said local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine, and ordered Hickox to submit to "direct active monitoring," coordinate travel with public health officials and immediately notify health authorities should symptoms appear. She blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of Ebola, including an elevated temperature, to be isolated. On Friday, a judge in Maine ruled in favor of Hickox, who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities. But Hickox, who recently returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, says she won't go into town where she lives or public places, even though she's allowed. It has no bearing for anyone else possibly returning from working with Ebola patients in West Africa, which is why Hickox believes more work must be done.
