Aside from providing a useful service for music-loving mobile users, Mdundo is also helping to raise the profile of East African artists. Two years after its launch, Mdundo, a Kenya-based online music distributor, has grown into a major provider of East African music with a 20,000 track strong library on its mobile web platform. "Within the past 12 months, Mdundo's library has been five-doubling and is now including music from more than 12 African countries," says Nielsen. "There are no central rights holders of music in Africa and it's therefore extremely hard to manage rights and offer a complete library to the consumers," says CEO and co-founder Martin Nielsen. In 2013, 1,000 East African artists signed up to the service and more than 1,000,000 Kenyan shillings (around $11,000) was paid to artists in royalties.
