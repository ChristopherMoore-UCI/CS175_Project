Opposition tribes shot down the aircraft as it was bombarding a residential compound in Arhab district, a number of eyewitnesses told CNN. The eyewitnesses said the government air raids Tuesday night on residential areas in Arhab and Nehm districts had killed two people and injured four. The violence comes as anti-government protests in Yemen continue, with tens of thousands taking to the streets of Sanaa on Monday. We have to fight back and we will do so," said Abdullah al-Shaleef, a resident of Arhab who has clashed with government forces. The plane came down in Bani Hareth, 7km (4 miles) south of Arhab, on the outskirts of the capital, Sanaa, they said.
