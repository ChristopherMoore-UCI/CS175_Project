A court in Ikeja in southwest Nigeria ruled that Lawal Adekunie Nurudeen will also have to pay back the 56-year-old woman, even if it meant selling the two plots of land and the Honda Prelude he bought with her money. Scammers in Nigeria have gained a reputation for using the Internet to con foreign nationals out of money. Nurudeen was an engineering student when he met the woman online in 2007, said the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nigeria's anti-corruption police. He told her that her fiance had been in an accident and needed money for treatment. He asked her for airfare, cash for customs clearance and other incidentals, police said.
