During the raid that ended with the killing of Osama bin Laden, a tension-filled Obama found Love, Marvin Nicholson, another aide, and White House photographer Pete Souza, in the private dining room. The book gives an inside look at the role Obama played as part mentor, part boss to Love, who served as his personal assistant for five years. Unlike the dreadful boss-personal assistant relationship many can attest to, Love became Obama's personal confidant and friend. Reggie Love, the guy partially responsible for transforming then-Sen. Barack Obama into the "president of cool," is opening up about his close relationship with the President in his new book, "Power Forward: My Presidential Education." Love first started working for Obama in the Senate back in 2006.
