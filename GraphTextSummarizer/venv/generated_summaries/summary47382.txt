"Despite the frenzy of media coverage surrounding the importance of Black Friday in the brick-and-mortar world, we continue to see this shopping day become more and more prominent in the e-commerce channel -- particularly among those who prefer to avoid crowds at the stores," said comScore Chairman Gian Fulgoni. U.S. consumers spent a record $1.042 billion online on Black Friday, a 26% increase over the same day last year, according to new figures from comScore, an Internet analytics firm. More than 57 million Americans visited online retail sites on Black Friday, an increase of 18% over a year ago, comScore said. In the holiday shopping season that began November 1, online spending is up 16% over 2011, according to comScore. While the Monday after Thanksgiving has traditionally been a heavy day for online shopping, some retailers offered Web-only deals last week in an effort to spur sales.
