And Microsoft seems to be serious about winning over lots more users from Gmail and other services: It's planning to advertise Outlook.com heavily in all sorts of media. While I'm favorably impressed by Outlook.com, I'm not considering dumping Gmail myself anytime soon; Google's service remains a much richer platform, with additional useful features, mobile apps and support from third-party apps and services. At the moment, Microsoft says, Outlook.com has 60 million active members, a third of which are Gmail users. Once the Hotmail transition is complete, Outlook.com will have hundreds of millions of users, giving it the same sort of massive scale as Gmail (425 million users as of June 2012) and Yahoo Mail (281 million users as of December 2012). Microsoft says to expect more Outlook.com features now that the service is out of preview mode, including Skype video calls and a calendar, both of which the company first promised when it announced the service last year.
