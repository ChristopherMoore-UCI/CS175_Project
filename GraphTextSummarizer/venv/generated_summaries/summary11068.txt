The slogans reflect a growing disgust in Turkey with the United States for what it sees as a lack of U.S. support concerning the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK, separatist rebels in northern Iraq launching attacks across the border into Turkey. The Iraq war was so unpopular in Turkey that parliament denied U.S. troops access to Iraq through Turkish soil. ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's visit to Turkey has a dual purpose: convince the Turkish leadership to hold off on a military intervention into northern Iraq and bolster Turkey's confidence in the United States. The United States is caught in the middle between Turkey, an important NATO ally, the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the Iraqi Kurds, which have provided relative stability in northern Iraq in an otherwise volatile country. This week, protesters in Ankara threw darts at a photograph of Rice and held signs that read, "Terrorist Rice, take your bloody hands from Turkey" and "Go home Rice."
