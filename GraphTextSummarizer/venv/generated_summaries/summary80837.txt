In Sunday's other matches, Liverpool beat Everton 2-0 and Birmingham won 1-0 at Wolves in local derbies. Just before half time and Arsenal were two down as another excellent Cole cross was accidentally deflected past his own goalkeeper by Belgian international Thomas Vermaelen. A own goal by Joseph Yobo, who deflected home a shot by Javier Mascherano in the 12th minute, and Dirk Kuyt's late strike sealed three points for Liverpool in the Merseyside clash at Goodison Park. Chelsea captain John Terry found his fellow England international Ashley Cole in space down the left and his crisp cross was met on the volley by Drogba to leave Manuel Almunia with no chance. Arsenal brought on Theo Walcott after the break and he sparked a brief home rally as they had the ball in the net from Andrei Arsnhavin only for it to be ruled out for an Eduardo foul on Petr Cech.
