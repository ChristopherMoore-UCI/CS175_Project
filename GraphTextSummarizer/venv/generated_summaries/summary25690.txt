The Sewol ferry departed from Incheon headed to Jeju island carrying 339 students and teachers when it sank. Three days after the Sewol ferry sank, the vice principal of Danwon High School, who had been rescued from the vessel, was found dead after apparently hanging himself. "I cannot reveal detailed reasons for his removal because it is personal information, but it is regarding the Sewol accident," said an official with the Gyeonggi Provincial Office of Education.
