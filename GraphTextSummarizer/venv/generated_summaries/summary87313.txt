In December, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy sent an alert to law enforcement, particularly along the Canadian border, warning that Canada had approved non-abuse-resistant generic versions of oxycodone, the active ingredient in OxyContin, Percocet and about 40 other painkillers. In an effort to curb prescription painkiller abuse, the Food and Drug Administration is banning generic versions of the original OxyContin formula. "The FDA has determined that the benefits of original OxyContin no longer outweigh its risks," the agency said in a statement. In 2009, about a half a million people visited emergency rooms as a result of abusing or misusing prescription drugs like Vicodin (hydrocodone), OxyContin (oxycodone), Opana (oxymorphone) and methadone, the CDC found. "ONDCP expects companies will begin offering these generics without the abuse-resistant features in Canadian pharmacies within the next month," according to the alert.
