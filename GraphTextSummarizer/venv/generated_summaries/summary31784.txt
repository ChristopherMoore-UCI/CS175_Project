-- Sixth seed Juan Martin del Potro suffered a shock third-round defeat at the Australian Open on Saturday losing in five sets to unseeded Frenchman Jeremy Chardy. World No.2 Roger Federer saw off home favorite Bernard Tomic in straight sets 6-4 7-6 6-1 to set up a fourth round clash with Milos Raonic. America's Sloane Stephens is through to the fourth round for the first time after beating Britain's Laura Robson in straight sets 7-5 6-3. The third seed made light work of Japan's Ayumi Morita 6-1 6-3 to set up a fourth round tie against 14th seed Maria Kirilenko from Russia who was also a straight sets winner (7-6 6-3) over Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer. The third was much closer, finally going del Potro's way in the tiebreak and when the Argentine took the fourth set, Chardy's chances of pulling off an upset looked to have gone.
