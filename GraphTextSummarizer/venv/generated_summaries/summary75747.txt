"I had what you might call current affairs rage, this kind of free floating anger directed at the faces of current events, politicians who can't get anything done," he said. Drawing inspiration from 'current affairs rage' Equally as fun and inventive is Charlie Huston's "Skinner," an espionage thriller for the information age with echoes of John Le Carre and William Gibson. He's part assassin, part bodyguard, part science experiment, having been raised by psychologist parents in a see-through plastic enclosure under 24-7 observation. Huston says the idea came to him after reading about scientists who used their children as part of their research and took it to an extreme in which parents raise their kids in a "Skinner box." Skinner grows up to become a cold, ruthless and detached killer toward enemies and targets. Watching 'the social dominoes fall' Marcus Sakey's "Brilliance" is part science fiction, part high-speed chase with a healthy dose of "Big Brother" paranoia.
