In the day's early La Liga fixtures, Athletic Bilbao ran out 2-1 winners away to mid-table Getafe while Espanyol had too much for Levante, running out 2-1 winners. Ligue 1 Zlatan Ibrahimovic struck early on at the Parc de Princes to give Paris Saint Germain a narrow 1-0 win over mid-table Nice. Isco was then sent for an early bath after earning a second booking for tripping up Samu Castillejo before Roque Santa Criz grabbed an injury-time consolation for Malaga with a looping header. Real Madrid notched up a club record 16th consecutive victory in all competitions -- a run that stretches all the way back to the middle of September -- by overcoming a gallant Malaga 2-1 away from home despite having midfield-star Isco sent off late on. Gareth Bale sealed the points late in the second half by racing clear of the Malaga defense and lofting the ball beyond Carlos Kameni.
