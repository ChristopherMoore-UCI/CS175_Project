Having her case transferred to juvenile court "is a precursor to the case ending," said Hasan of Human Rights Watch. The pursuit of the accusations against the cleric is significant in Pakistan because "never before has a false accuser been held accountable," according to Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistan director of Human Rights Watch Hasan. There have been 1,400 blasphemy cases since the laws were first enacted in 1986, according to Human Rights Watch. In addition to charges of tampering with evidence, Chishti could also face blasphemy charges as a result of the police investigation. There are more than 15 cases of people on death row for blasphemy in Pakistan, and 52 people have been killed while facing trial for the charge, he said.
