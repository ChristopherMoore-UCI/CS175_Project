"If Iran continues its program to develop nuclear weapons, we will attack it," Deputy Prime Minister Shaul Mofaz told Yediot Ahronot, Israel's largest mass-circulation daily. The West believes Iran's aim is to build nuclear weapons, while Iran says it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. It also has significant political resonance in Israel amid talk that Mofaz has begun jockeying to replace Olmert, who is embroiled in a corruption probe, as the ruling Kadima Party's leader and prime minister. Asked how he responds to the harsh statements of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Rome that Israel should be wiped off the map, Mofaz said: "He will disappear before Israel does. Israel will not tolerate the possibility of a nuclear Iran, and neither should any other country in the free world," Olmert said to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee convention.
