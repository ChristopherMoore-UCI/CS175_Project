The affected vehicles have naturally aspirated 3.8 liter V6 engines -- that is, engines that use atmospheric pressure rather than a mechanical blower to bring in air for combustion -- according to documents that GM filed with federal regulators last week. As a solution, the company recommends a change in the bracket that holds spark plug wires, which will be done free of charge. Oil that runs below the manifold's heat shield could ignite and spread to plastic channels that hold spark plug wires. -- The possibility of engine fires has prompted General Motors to recall nearly 1.5 million passenger sedans manufactured between 1997 and 2003, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Monday. The recall involves certain GM vehicles in which oil apparently can leak and ignite.
