The goal of the operation is to find and dismantle laboratories where illegal drugs are produced, and to root out traffickers, Defense Minister Gen. Henry Rangel Silva said. A statement from the Treasury Department at the time said the general "materially assisted the narcotics trafficking activities of the FARC" and pushed for more cooperation between the Venezuelan government and the leftist rebels. After coming to power, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ended his nation's cooperation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. Operation Sentinel, as it is called, will send troops to the frontiers with Colombia, Brazil and Guyana, the state-run AVN news agency reported Friday. "We will carry out intelligence work and patrols to detect the possible camps for processing drugs," he said, according to AVN.
