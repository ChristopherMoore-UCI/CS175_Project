The scandal has prompted calls for a public boycott of the paper -- and its parent company News International -- on social media sites including Facebook and Twitter. The loss of revenue for News of the World as a result of advertising being withdrawn this weekend would be in the realm of tens of thousands of dollars, he said. Ford was among the first to act to distance itself from News of the World, saying Tuesday that it was "concerned by the serious nature of the allegations of past activities against the News of the World, and the high level of public concern." However, analyst Douglas McCabe, of media research firm Enders Analysis, told CNN the cost of the advertisers' actions and any public boycott to News of the World and News International was likely to be limited in the long term. Vauxhall said it had suspended advertising in the News of the World and would "reconsider its position pending the outcome of investigations into the allegations of phone hacking."
