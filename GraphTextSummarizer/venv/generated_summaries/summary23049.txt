Harling pointed out that even during the height of the bloody Syrian government crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood in 1982, Hafez al Assad, the father of the current Syrian president, succeeded in preventing Damascus merchants from staging strikes. "In both places we've seen not just more armed clashes than ever in the past, but also a revival of the protest movement in its peaceful dimension," said Peter Harling, a Damascus-based analyst with the conflict-resolution organization International Crisis Group. The Syrian government blamed last Friday's rebel attack on an electric power station in downtown Damascus on "armed terrorist gangs" -- the same epithet it has used to describe the protest movement that erupted in the southern border city of Daraa more than a year ago. More than a dozen residents of Damascus and Aleppo interviewed by CNN complained of daily power outages and rising prices of commodities including sugar and cooking fuel. "They cut the electricity for two hours every morning, and of course it affects work a lot, because the whole company runs on computers," said the CEO of a Damascus-based media company, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity for fear of his life.
