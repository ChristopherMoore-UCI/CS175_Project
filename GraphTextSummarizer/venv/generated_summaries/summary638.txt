According to the institute, "the deep observations also demonstrate the progressive buildup of galaxies and provide further support for the hierarchical model of galaxy assembly, where small objects ... merge to form bigger objects over a smooth and steady but dramatic process of collision and agglomeration. "This makes Hubble a powerful 'time machine' that allows astronomers to see galaxies as they were 13 billion years ago -- just 600 million to 800 million years after the Big Bang," the institute said in a statement released Tuesday. -- NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has reached back 13.2 billion years -- farther than ever before in time and space -- to reveal a "primordial population" of galaxies never seen before. From the current cache of images, astronomers can see for the first time that "galaxies grew from small, bright clusters of stars to the big spiral cities of stars today," Villard said. It will allow astronomers to study the detailed nature of early galaxies and discover many more even farther away.
