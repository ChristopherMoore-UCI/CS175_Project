Roc Nation Sports signed New York Yankees all-star second baseman Robinson Cano as its first client. For Roc Nation Sports to function at its full potential, NBA rules stipulate that I relinquish my ownership in the Brooklyn Nets. The statement continued: "The Nets have made their mark on the NBA and as they enter a new era, Roc Nation does as well; as we embark on Roc Nation Sports. It's been an honor to work with Mikhail Prokhorov, Dmitry Razumov, Christophe Charlier, ONEXIM Sports and Entertainment, Brett Yormark and all the wonderful people involved in making the Nets first class. Earlier this month, the rapper and entrepreneur launched Roc Nation Sports, a joint-venture sports management agency with Creative Arts Agency.
