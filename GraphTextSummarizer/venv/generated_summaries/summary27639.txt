But even right-wing firebrand Cruz on Tuesday held his fire when given the opportunity to attack Bush on one of his primary vulnerabilities, immigration reform. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, also seen as a possible vice presidential pick, noted Bush has yet to stop by her state — which hosts the first primary in the nation — to meet with grassroots activists. She acknowledged that he'd have "the Bush name recognition," but said there's no substitute for hard retail politicking in the Granite State. "Immigration will be a critical issue in this next election because we have a President who has been unwilling to work with Congress on common sense immigration reform," Cruz said, when asked how Bush's position on immigration would play out in the primaries. But even though Bush is seen as one of the top establishment picks in the primary if he runs, it was clear Tuesday morning he'll still have some work to convince some party leaders.
