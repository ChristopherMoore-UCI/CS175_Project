"It's a piece of history and we tried to preserve it as best we could," said Police Deputy Chief William Aubry. No "potential human remains" have been found in the Manhattan location where a 9/11 aircraft part was recently discovered, New York's chief medical examiner said Wednesday. A Boeing Company technician confirmed that the piece is a support structure from a trailing edge flap on the wing of a Boeing 767 like the ones that were flown into the World Trade Center. The announcement followed an inspection at 51 Park Place, where a piece of one of the planes in the September 11, 2001, terror attack was found Friday. Police officers hoisted the 255-pound piece out of the location with a pulley and loaded it onto a truck bound for a police property facility in Brooklyn.
