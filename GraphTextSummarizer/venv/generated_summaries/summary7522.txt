"The Brookings report shows that Amtrak ridership has been growing faster than any other domestic mode of transportation, faster than GDP, and faster than population growth. During (fiscal year) 2013, Amtrak is experiencing solid revenue growth and we have been controlling our costs and managing our budget in anticipation of a possible reduction in federal funding," said Kimberly Woods, an Amtrak spokeswoman. These ridership numbers include our long-distance train passengers," Steve Kulm, Amtrak spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement.

Robert Puentes, a Brookings senior fellow and co-author of the report, said that Amtrak is "too often considered a big, bloated bureaucracy that depends heavily on federal subsidies and is no longer relevant to the technologically oriented metropolitan economies of today.
