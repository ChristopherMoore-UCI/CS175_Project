Mass festival Masses of people attended the annual electronica and techno music festival, but there is much disagreement on the size of the crowd. A stampede Faulty crowd flow planning led people both entering and exiting the festival to cram into the underpass from both ends, Michael Schwarz said in a prepared statement. NTV said about 1.4 million people showed up at the Love Parade festival, which featured dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so to accommodate more people, they opened an additional event site. But the numbers are disputed by police, who said that the area can hold between 250,000 and 350,000 people and that it was not filled to capacity.
