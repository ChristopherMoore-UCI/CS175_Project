Gallagher said in his statement that the construction company was "investigating the matter in full cooperation" with authorities including the New York fire department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the city's Department of Buildings. "Fortunately... nobody was hurt," New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at a news conference Thursday. "The cable of a crane broke, causing the steel it was lifting to fall approximately 40 stories back onto the flatbed truck that had transported the steel into the World Trade Center site," said a statement from John Gallagher, spokesman for Tishman Construction, which manages the site. -- Three 60-foot steel beams fell 40 stories at the World Trade Center construction site Thursday after a crane cable snapped. The 72-story building, which will face the World Trade Center memorial park honoring the victims of 9/11, is scheduled to officially open in the fall of 2013, according to the World Trade Center website.
