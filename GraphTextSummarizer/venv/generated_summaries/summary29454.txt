Authorities also accused Davud and Bujak of plotting to shoot cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, who drew an image of the Muslim prophet Mohammed wearing a bomb-shaped turban that was published in Jyllands-Posten in 2005. -- A Norwegian court sentenced three people Monday for their roles in a plot to attack a Danish newspaper that published cartoons depicting the Muslim prophet Mohammed. Mikael Davud, Shawan Sadek Saeed Bujak Bujak and David Jakobsen were convicted in connection with a plot to carry out explosions at offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. In July 2010, Norwegian officials said Davud, Bujak and Jakobsen were arrested in connection with an ongoing investigation into terrorist plots in New York and the United Kingdom. Norwegian authorities have said Davud, Bujak and Jakobsen were suspected of having connections to al Qaeda.
