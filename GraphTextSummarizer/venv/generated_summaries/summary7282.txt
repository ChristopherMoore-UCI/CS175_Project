No evidence exists so far of a link to the Columbine shootings, Jefferson County Sheriff Ted Mink said, but he acknowledged the possibility was on the minds of law enforcement officials. -- Investigators asked for help Thursday as they searched for a man seen in a mall in Littleton, Colorado, shortly before what they described as a possible attempt to bomb the shopping center on the 12th anniversary of the shooting at nearby Columbine High School. The incident happened Wednesday at the Southwest Plaza Mall, less than two miles from Columbine High School. Columbine High School was already closed Wednesday, for what its school calendar called a staff development day. "There's not a definite link that we have right now to anything at Columbine other than the date," Mink said, adding that the April 20th anniversary of the shootings "is fresh on everyone's mind." A security camera shows the man sought by authorities in the mall just minutes before a security guard noticed a fire.
