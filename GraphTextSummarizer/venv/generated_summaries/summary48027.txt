The issue has crystallized in recent weeks around different incidents involving the grounding of the vaunted 787 Dreamliner produced by the world's largest aircraft maker and deadly crashes involving buses owned by obscure private companies. The most recent federal government figures, in 2009, show roughly 300 people are killed annually in bus crashes, but the figures do not distinguish between mass transit and private motor coach accidents. Deborah Hersman, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, highlighted gaps in bus safety with a comparison to more rigorous rules for airlines. But key safety regulations and oversight for buses, especially for drivers behind the wheel of a coach with up to 80 people aboard, lag behind those for airlines and their pilots, according to a leading safety advocate and a trade group calling for action. The rapidly growing motor coach industry, which carries about as many passengers as domestic airlines annually -- 700 million -- has experienced several fatal accidents in recent years, including notable crashes in New York and Virginia.
