"We want to protect players as best we can," said Thad Ide, head of product development and management at Riddell, the United States' leading maker of football helmets, which has embraced these new head-impact systems. Riddell, whose helmets were worn by two-thirds of NFL players last season, was named as a defendant in many of these lawsuits. Thousands of former pro players -- many with dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and other brain disorders -- have sued the NFL, claiming the league knew about the long-term health risks associated with head trauma. Meanwhile, more parents are voicing concerns about letting their sons play football amid a study suggesting that high school athletes are more vulnerable to concussions than older players. A wave of new technology, embedded in football helmets, aims to measure the force of on-field collisions and send alerts when a player's health may be in danger.
