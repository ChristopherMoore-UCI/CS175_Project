-- A friend of Pippa Middleton's, the sister-in-law of Britain's Prince William, apologized Wednesday for an incident in which a friend of his brandished a toy gun at press photographers in Paris. The incident "will have embarrassed her sister, Kate, her brother-in-law Prince William and also the queen in her Diamond Jubilee year. Lawyers said Middleton was unlikely to face charges over the incident in Paris unless it could be proved that she encouraged the driver to point the gun on public streets, but the driver could face charges of threatening with a firearm. " Middleton has been a target for tabloid newspapers and paparazzi since her sister married Prince William in April 2011. William is second in line to the British throne behind his father, Prince Charles.
