A sage Los Angeles resident offered some excellent advice that's useful for anyone contemplating a move: Don't come to a conclusion about a place before you've lived there at least a year. The Hollywood Hills offers homes with little street appeal and amazing views. It has curves, sexy curves. Bougainvillea blooms year round, palm trees are everywhere dotting the skyline like enormous chrysanthemums and ficus trees reach the size of old growth oaks, reminding you that California is a very hospitable place to grow and bloom on many levels. -- If you told me eight years ago I'd end up writing an article extolling the virtues of Los Angeles, I would have laughed.
