Sumanda, and others like her, have no other choice but to eat pagpag, says Melissa Alipalo, a social development specialist and a volunteer at the Philippine Community Fund (PCF). PCF's school educates 450 of the most poverty-stricken children in Tondo, with the aim of freeing families from poverty. Maria Theresa Sarmiento, PCF's manager of health and nutrition, says that when the school first opened she was treating children with a range of illness and disease. Sarmiento says that parents know pagpag is not a good source of food for their children, but that they don't have any choice. After bagging up the chicken scraps she heads home to Tondo, a neighborhood infamous in the Philippines as one of the poorest slums in Manila.
