As of June last year, Google experiences more Google Maps traffic on mobile than on desktop. Mayer joined internet giant Google as a 24-year-old in 1999; one of the company's first 20 hires and its first female engineer. A proud "geek," for whom the word just means "for an area that you're passionate about, all the details matter," Mayer worries that stereotypes about computer scientists might hinder women from working in technology. Video has been the latest format to proliferate online, and Mayer predicts the next push will be into new search modes and personalization. "I'm a really shy person, yet at Google, my colleagues would never believe that; because here, I'm outspoken, because I feel like I can express my opinions and find my voice." Besides nurturing self belief, Mayer says it's also important to work for people who believe in you.
