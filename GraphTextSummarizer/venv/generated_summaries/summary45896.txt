-- As the first splinters of sunlight spread their warmth on the south bank of the River Thames on Thursday, it became clear that after more than a century, the vision of Victorian engineer Alexander Stanhope St. George had finally been realized. And all the credit goes to British artist Paul St. George. St. George is an artist in Britain who does have a grandfather -- minus the great prefix -- named Alexander. As for the Telectroscope, well, it was a fanciful idea that, according to St. George, came about from a typo made by a 19th-century reporter who misspelled Electroscope, a device used to measure electrostatic charges - as Telectroscope. But fortunately, St. George could not bear that thought and thus decided he should be the one to finish what his great-grandfather had started.
