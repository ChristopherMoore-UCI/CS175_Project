Fewer than 100 people were there when Roche collected the ball with her back to goal, flicked it over her head and crashed it home while playing for Peamount United against Wexford Youths in a National League game on a gray afternoon in Ireland. The 25-year-old Republic of Ireland international striker, currently playing for French club ASPTT Albi, said she was disappointed not to have scooped the ultimate prize. Rodriguez was gracious enough to say that Stephanie Roche's fabulous volley, which took second place at FIFA's glitzy ceremony Monday, just might have trumped his goal against Uruguay at the World Cup. Nevertheless, her brilliant goal -- filmed by chance -- beat Robin van Persie's flying header for Holland against Spain at the World Cup into third place. The award, voted for by the public, saw Roche take 33% of the vote, with winner Rodriguez on 42% and Van Persie some way back on 11%.
