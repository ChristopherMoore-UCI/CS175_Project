Staging revivals that he called "crusades" around the world, the founder of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association has reached untold millions of people in person. Graham, who lives in western North Carolina, has provided counsel to generations of U.S. presidents, beginning with Harry S. Truman. Franklin Graham said that his father, who turned 95 in November, is extremely weak, but his vitals are good. The elder Graham returned home late last month, two days after he was admitted to a hospital for pulmonary-related tests and observation. Five years later, he was holding a "crusade" in tents in downtown Los Angeles.
