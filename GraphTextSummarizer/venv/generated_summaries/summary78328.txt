Unless the practice of putting petitioners in "black jails" (informal detention facilities) is abolished, ending the labor camps will have limited effect in reducing human rights abuses. However, if the Communist Party were committed to tackle human rights abuses, it would have also outlawed other similar practices. President Xi Jinping made a splash by announcing that China will ease its one-child policy and end its notorious policy of re-education through labor camps. This is good news and represents an important step forward in reducing human rights abuses. Many of those jailed in labor camps are individuals who had grievances and tried to seek redress.
