-- Gabrielle Giffords, the Arizona congresswoman who was shot in the head during a shooting rampage in January, appeared in her first television interview late Monday night, clearly understanding the questions put to her but able to respond only in simple words. Giffords has clearly retained a sense of humor; her husband teases her when Sawyer asks what she loves by interjecting: "Football! Giffords also doesn't remember the next 13 days at a hospital in Tucson before she was flown to Houston. When Sawyer asked Giffords how she feels, the congresswoman responded, "Pretty good." Sawyer asked Giffords if it was painful to move her right arm.
