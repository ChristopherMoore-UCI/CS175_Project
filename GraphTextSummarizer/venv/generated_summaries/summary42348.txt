The Hugo Awards were being streamed live on video site Ustream when, at 10:43 p.m. ET, the feed went dark during an acceptance speech by fantasy writer Neil Gaiman. Ustream says automated software designed to detect the unauthorized posting of copyrighted material was triggered when, before Gaiman's speech, the ceremony showed clips of "The Doctor's Wife," an episode of the popular sci-fi series "Doctor Who," that Gaiman penned. The third-party system, Vobile, is used by video sites to detect unauthorized posts. Instead of Gaiman, text reading "Worldcon banned due to copyright infringement" appeared. Gaiman, whose "Doctor Who" episode explored the doctor's most longstanding relationship in an unprecedented way, is known for the groundbreaking "The Sandman" graphic novel series and books like "Neverwhere," "American Gods" and "Coraline," which was turned into an Academy Award-nominated animated film in 2009.
