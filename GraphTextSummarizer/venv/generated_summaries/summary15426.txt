By recommending a ban on full veils in public places such as hospitals and schools and by anyone receiving public services, the commission members said they wanted to assist those working with members of the public when asking that full veils be removed. She said she believes a law against full veils would take away fundamental rights of Muslim women. Any law directed at full veils is likely to be challenged in the courts both in France and at the European level. Those who advocate the ban say women are often forced to wear full veils by the men around them -- husbands, fathers or brothers -- and that it is a sign of subjugation. The commission also studied whether such full veils pose a threat to France's constitutionally mandated secularism.
