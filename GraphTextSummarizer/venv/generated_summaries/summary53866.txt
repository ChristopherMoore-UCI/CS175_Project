As practiced in Sudan, Sharia law prohibits the execution of pregnant women. "We call upon the government of Sudan to respect the right to freedom of religion, including one's right to change one's faith or beliefs, a right which is enshrined in international human rights law as well as in Sudan's own 2005 Interim Constitution," said a statement by the embassies of the United States, Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Human rights groups and Western governments are complaining about Ibrahim's case. A variety of factors -- Sudan's legal system, differences between its constitution and Sharia law imposed by the sentencing judge, her pregnancy -- ensure there will no execution any time soon. Since 1999, the State Department has called Sudan one of the worst offenders of religious rights.
