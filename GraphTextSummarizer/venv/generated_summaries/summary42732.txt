Police link Vancouver body parts to Montreal dismemberment suspect The Canadian government worked with Montreal police, the Quebec Prosecution Service and German officials to bring about Magnotta's extradition, officials said. Montreal police have said the video shows Magnotta engaged in sexual acts involving body parts and also included evidence of cannibalism. Authorities accuse Magnotta of dismembering Lin and mailing one of his hands and one of his feet to Canadian politicians. Luka Rocco Magnotta, 29, was in police custody when he flew back aboard a Canadian military plane. The same day, officials at Canada's Conservative Party headquarters received a package addressed to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper that contained a foot.
