"Security is very tight in the area and we believe those behind the attack were hoping the vehicle would be allowed to enter the ministry compound and explode inside," the official told CNN. The explosions happened near the rear entrance of the ministry, which is located in the capital, Sanaa, where security has been tightened in the last few weeks. "Security is always tight at the ministry, but if the vehicle had exploded inside the compound, there would have been dozens of deaths," said Sanaa resident Bakri al-Areqi, who lives near the ministry. An Oil Ministry official told CNN the bomb is believed to have been planted under a car belonging to an officer. Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, believed by many analysts to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror network.
