"This is groundbreaking science," Rosetta project scientist Matt Taylor told ESA television. The mission will give scientists unprecedented insight into the makeup and structure of these ancient residents of the solar system, ESA officials say. Cheers erupted in the ESA mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, when a signal from Rosetta arrived shortly after 7 p.m. (1 p.m. ET). "The spacecraft decided to make us suffer after two and half year," Paolo Ferri, head of ESA Mission Operations told CNN. The amount of sunlight reaching the solar-powered probe is only 4% that on Earth, according to ESA.
