Oscar Ramirez, 48, was arrested by Port Authority police on a weapons charge Wednesday after Transportation Security Administration checkpoint officers discovered the gun at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Passengers caught with guns at checkpoints may face criminal charges and penalties of up to $11,000, the TSA said. So far this year, the TSA has discovered 2,100 guns at airport checkpoints, a 16% increase from 2013. Presumably someone was planning to play after the weapon was unpacked from the PlayStation.
