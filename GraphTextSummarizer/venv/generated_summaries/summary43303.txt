CNN iReport: Photos of Operation Orange Fingers Minor marijuana possession has been the Seattle's police department's lowest priority since 2003, but voters last year cast ballots to make recreational use legal. But they did want to explain the new rules surrounding recreational marijuana use in the state -- and hit upon a novel distribution format: Doritos. Hempfest, which began Friday and runs through Sunday, says its goal is "to educate the public on the myriad of potential benefits offered by the cannabis plant, including the medicinal, industrial, agricultural, economic, environmental, and other benefits and applications." Initiative 502 says residents over 21 years old may possess up to an ounce of pot for personal use. The Seattle Police Foundation paid $260 for the Doritos, CNN affiliate KING said.
