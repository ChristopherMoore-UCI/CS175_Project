The regional airline involved in a fatal February plane crash outside Buffalo, New York, contested a report Monday alleging the pilot did not have the training to handle the emergency that brought the plane down, and that he might have been fatigued on the night of the crash. Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, on the night of February 12, killing all 49 on board as well as one man in the house. Debris is cleared from the scene of Flight 3407's crash near Buffalo, New York, in February. Renslow's history as well as pilot training broadly will be examined. They don't focus on the edges of the envelope," stall recovery expert Doug Moss told CNN.
