George Zimmerman -- who was acquitted earlier this month on murder charges tied to Trayvon Martin's death -- was stopped this weekend for speeding in northern Texas, according to police. Zimmerman helps family out of overturned SUV A Florida jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder on July 13 for fatally shooting the 17-year-old Martin in a Sanford, Florida, neighborhood. Forney City Manager Brian Brooks said he couldn't answer several questions about the incident, including about the type of gun that Zimmerman apparently had, in part because the incident was short and no citation was issued. In a statement released Wednesday, after news got out about the weekend traffic stop, Zimmerman's family made no mention of George carrying a gun then or at any time. The passions contributed to an "enormous amount of death threats" against Zimmerman and his family, his parents told ABC News earlier this month.
