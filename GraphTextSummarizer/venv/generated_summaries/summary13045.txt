The holiest day of the week for Muslims is Friday, but several Boston mosques were closed then because of the lockdown during the massive manhunt for one of the bombing suspects. There were other services Sunday in Boston. Instead, the Friday service was scheduled for Sunday morning at nearby Emmanuel Church. Central Reform Temple announced cancellation of Sabbath Eve service on its website, citing emergency conditions in Boston. Old South Church of Boston was closed Sunday for the first time since the city's colonial days.
