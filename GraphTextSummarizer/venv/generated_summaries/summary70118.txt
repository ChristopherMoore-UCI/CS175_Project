As I expected, she expressed her desire to be addressed as Mrs. MyDad'sFullName, but said that etiquette dictated that all married women who share their husband's last name be addressed as such, and that divorced women who retain their married names, like my aunt, should be addressed as Mrs. -- not Ms., as I assumed -- TheirFullName. Using no first names on mail addressed to married couples is the tradition I've adopted as an adult, never realizing that both my mother and grandmother find it disrespectful because it's not in keeping with traditional rules of etiquette. The book and almost every link I found said it was proper etiquette to address the envelope of a married couple as Mr. and Mrs. John S. Smith without any regard to the woman's first name at all. She says that addressing a woman as Mrs. Her First and Last Name would imply that she's divorced, and a card addressed without a title at all is just plain "impolite. My mother says the etiquette rule that trumps all others when it comes to names is to call a person what he or she wishes to be called, which is a rule that's surely timeless.
