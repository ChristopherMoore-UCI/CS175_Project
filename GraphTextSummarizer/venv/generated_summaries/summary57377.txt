In a new "Experimental Forum Build" of the app for Windows, Mac and Linux, photos and videos will be slurped up from any memory card or camera connected to the computer. This feature also adds complexity to the Dropbox application itself, when it's already pretty easy to have a third-party app store selected photos inside your Dropbox folder. And Dropbox has one big advantage over the current version of iCloud's Photo Stream: You can delete those embarrassing Christmas photos. On the other hand, anything that makes backing up photos easier can only be a good thing. Dropbox is trying out a neat new feature that will give it magical Photo Stream-like abilities.
