The Syrian government "is simply playing for time," said former U.S. ambassador to Syria Edward Djerejian. "It will talk the talk of cooperation with the international community, but not walk the walk on the actual requirements that are necessary, such as really ceasing the use of lethal force against its own people in the streets of Syria," said Djerejian, director of Rice University's James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy. Annan's six-point plan Elliott Abrams, a senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Syria's agreement to Annan's plan is a "fraud" aimed at buying time. Nations watching Syria after it accepts peace plan Timing was likely a key factor in the Syrian government's response this week to special envoy Kofi Annan's six-point plan, analysts said. Annan called Syria's agreement "an important initial step."
