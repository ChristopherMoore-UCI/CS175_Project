In Duck, North Carolina, the storm pushed water from the Currituck Sound inlet out to the sea, said resident Gregg Nigro. -- A furious Hurricane Irene exacted a heavy toll on North Carolina, claiming at least five lives, peeling siding off houses and plunging hundreds of thousands of homes in darkness. "All in all, the damage wasn't nearly as bad as we had expected," said Rear Adm. William Lee, who surveyed the coastline on a helicopter tour from Cape Lookout to Wilmington. Irene stomped across the state most of the day Saturday after a morning landfall near Cape Lookout at the southern end of the Outer Banks. The storm ripped shingles and siding off buildings in Atlantic Beach, knocked over a church steeple and flooded homes in low-lying areas.
