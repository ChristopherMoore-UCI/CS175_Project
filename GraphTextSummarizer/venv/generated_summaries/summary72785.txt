Thousands of AmeriCorps volunteers across the country felt the effects of the government shutdown on Friday as their modest living allowances were reduced by more than a third due to a lack of funding. Zach Maurin, executive director of Service Nation, a group that advocates on behalf of organizations like AmeriCorps, said, "Part of the culture of the organization is that to best understand people in poverty you have to live in poverty," said. The VISTA living allowance is based on the federal poverty level, and helps volunteers pay for basic living expenses during their service, meaning even a minor reduction can force them to make some tough decisions. The shortage affects more than 2,000 participants in the AmeriCorps VISTA program who make a year-long commitment to work at nonprofit organizations or public agencies on projects to fight poverty. "They've been asked to continue to serve, they're getting a partial payment this month, they don't know what's going to happen next month, so their future's really uncertain," said Ben Duda, executive director of AmeriCorps Alums.
