In the ABC interview, Edwards also acknowledged meeting with Hunter at a hotel in Beverly Hills, California, at the request of a friend of hers last month. In an interview Friday with ABC, Edwards confessed to having an affair with Rielle Hunter, but he denied the Enquirer's claim that he fathered her child. David Carr, a columnist for The New York Times, said many news organizations "tend to pick up stories from the National Enquirer with tongs. Edwards on Friday said he used the fact that the Enquirer story "contained many falsities" to deny it. -- Rumors about John Edwards' love affair had been circulating for months, but it wasn't until the former Democratic presidential candidate admitted to the affair that national news organizations jumped on the story.
