Caylee Anthony was last seen June 16, 2008. Holding back tears, George Anthony on Friday asked the judge not to release the report until Casey Anthony's trial. The tape was still attached to head hair, and the skull was separate from the other body parts, said Dr. Jan Garavaglia, chief medical examiner for Orange County. -- There was no trauma visible on the "completely skeletonized" remains of slain toddler Caylee Anthony, but there were overlapping pieces of duct tape over her mouth, according to the autopsy report released Friday. The remains were confirmed through DNA testing to be those of Caylee Anthony.
