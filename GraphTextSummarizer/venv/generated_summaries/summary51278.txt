Javier Hernandez's second-half strike gave United manager David Moyes a much-needed victory following his side's 4-1 Premier League defeat by neighbor Manchester City last Sunday. He is set to make his first Premier League start this season at bottom club Sunderland on Sunday. In his first competitive outing for Liverpool since last season, he looked short of match practice and wasted several opportunities during an uninspiring contest. It was a difficult match in all senses," PSG coach Blanc told reporters, referring to Sunday's 1-1 draw with the promoted principality club. The Uruguay striker, who was suspended by the English Football Association after biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic last April, played the full 90 minutes during Wednesday's 1-0 League Cup defeat by fierce rival Manchester United.
