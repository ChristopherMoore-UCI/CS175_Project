The deal, brokered by the Gulf Cooperation Council and signed in Saudi Arabia, allows Ali Abdullah Saleh to retain the title of president for three months but requires him to hand over executive powers to Yemen's vice president. The agreement cleared a key roadblock in the transition to a new era for Yemen, which has been the scene of violent protests for months as Saleh's opponents demanded that he leave power after 33 years in office. Clashes erupted in Yemen's capital of Sanaa on Wednesday, just hours after Saleh and opposition leaders headed to Saudi Arabia for the signing ceremony. After signing the deal, Saleh said that his country will "need decades to rebuild what the crisis left" and that the transfer of power should be "peaceful and democratic. Saleh had previously appeared to be on the verge of agreeing to hand over power several times, only to change course.
