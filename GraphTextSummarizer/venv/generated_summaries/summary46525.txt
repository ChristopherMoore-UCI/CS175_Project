In ski cross, it's actually completely that, it's who comes down first," Smith says. She strapped on her first set of skis at the age of two, growing up on the slopes of Gryon and Villars in the Swiss Alps, and tried ski cross for the first time when she was 12. With a total of six podiums from 10 starts, she cruised to her first ski cross World Cup title before capping her incredible comeback with gold at the world championships in Voss, Norway last March. A year later in 2009, she entered her first World Cup race. Switzerland had a ski cross team at that time but it was impossible for Smith to commit full time.
