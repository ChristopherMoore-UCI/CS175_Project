"After significant soul searching, I have decided to suspend operations." Based in Texas, Lavabit attracted attention last month when NSA leaker Edward Snowden used an e-mail account with the service to invite human rights workers and lawyers to a press conference in the Moscow airport where he was then confined. "I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly 10 years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit," owner Ladar Levison wrote in a statement. -- A pro-privacy e-mail service long used by NSA leaker Edward Snowden abruptly shut down Thursday, blaming a secret U.S. court battle it has been fighting for six weeks â€” one that it seems to be losing so far. Lavabit has 350,000 users who aren't Edward Snowden, and some are decidedly unhappy with Levison's decision, judging by a flood of angry comments posted to Lavabit's Facebook page Thursday afternoon. Levison posted this message Thursday announcing the shutdown: My Fellow Users, I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of hard work by shutting down Lavabit.
