It is no exaggeration to attribute Sony's evolution beyond audio and video products into music, movies and games, and subsequent transformation into a global entertainment leader to Ohga-san's foresight and vision," Sony Chief Executive Howard Stringer said in a statement. Ohga is also credited with launching Sony's game business and was head of Sony when it bought Columbia Pictures in 1989. "By redefining Sony as a company encompassing both hardware and software, Ohga-san succeeded where other Japanese companies failed. -- Norio Ohga, the former president and chairman of Sony Corporation who helped to develop the compact disc, died Saturday of multiple organ failure, the company said. Ohga worked for what is now Sony as a consultant and adviser while still a music student in Tokyo, before joining the company full time in 1959.
