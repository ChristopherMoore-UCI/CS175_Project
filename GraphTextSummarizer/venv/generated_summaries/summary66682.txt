"We congratulate the Afghan and ISAF forces for capturing the Haqqani network's senior commander in Afghanistan, Haji Mali Khan, a key Haqqani leader who facilitated cross-border attacks against our troops," White House National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said. "As a senior commander within the Haqqani network, his removal from the battlefield will deal a major blow to one of the most dangerous terrorist networks operating in Afghanistan," said Alistair Burt, foreign office minister for Middle East affairs. The senior Haqqani network leader in Afghanistan, Haji Mali Khan, was captured during a joint NATO-Afghan forces operation, the International Security Assistance Force said Saturday. Khan is the uncle of Siraj and Badruddin Haqqani -- the brothers who lead the network -- and worked directly under Siraj, managing bases and overseeing operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, ISAF said. "This is the arrest of a leading figure of the Haqqani clan," ISAF spokesman Gen. Carsten Jacobson said.
