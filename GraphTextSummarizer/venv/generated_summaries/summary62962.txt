INTERPOL and other law enforcement groups agree that the involvement of organized crime syndicates and rebel militias in wildlife crime to fund their activities and purchase weapons has increased. Trafficking in wildlife and its body parts is exploding in popularity among global crime syndicates. After China, the United States may be the second largest market for wildlife products in the world, a significant percentage of which is illegal, including illicit ivory trinkets being sold in Manhattan and international rhino horn trafficking rings operating out of Los Angeles. Across the world, we need to strengthen criminal investigation, prosecution and sentencing on wildlife crime. For a hardcore criminal, illicit wildlife trafficking is a low-risk, high-reward bonanza.
