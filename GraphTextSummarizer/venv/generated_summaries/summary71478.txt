-- Evangelist Billy Graham was admitted to a hospital overnight for treatment of a pulmonary infection believed to be bronchitis, a North Carolina hospital and his evangelistic association said. Graham, who Ross said had no fever by Sunday morning, ate lunch with daughter Gigi and one of his grandchildren at the hospital, where he had been chatting up the staff, said Ross. On Sunday, Graham was "resting comfortably" and in stable condition, Mission Hospital and the association said in their statement, citing pulmonologist David Pucci at the hospital. He is being treated with oral antibiotics and improving, at one point Sunday even sitting up in bed to remotely watch his grandson Will Graham give a guest sermon at First Baptist Church in Spartanburg, South Carolina, Ross later said. " "He's made farther progress than for previous hospitalizations (for pulmonary infections)," Ross said, adding that Graham is "in good hands" and "feels comfortable" at Mission Hospital, where he has previously been treated.
