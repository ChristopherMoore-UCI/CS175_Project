Most of the Syrian fighters waging a guerrilla war against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad are ill equipped -- short on guns, ammunition and with no heavy weapons. For now the men of the Free Syrian army smuggle fighters in and out of the neighborhood they control, evading government checkpoints. The people of this part of Homs are not afraid to take to the streets -- there are regular night-time rallies -- but after months of casualties, they have long lost their faith in non-violent protest. At night, they search everyone entering and leaving their area to stop government death squads, the so-called Shabiyah, from entering. But Baba Amr is surrounded by the Syrian military, and constantly shelled by tanks and artillery.
