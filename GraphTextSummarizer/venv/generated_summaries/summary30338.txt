Pentagon officials briefing reporters on the change also said the agency did not extend housing benefits to same sex-couples. Same-sex partners who sign a military "Declaration of Domestic Partnership" form will be eligible for several benefits, including military identification cards as dependents. The Pentagon believes there may be 5,600 troops on active duty seeking such benefits, as well as 3,400 National Guard troops and 8,000 retirees. The move had been expected for weeks and is widely seen as part of Panetta's effort to finish as much as he can in extending benefits to gays and lesbians before leaving the Pentagon. This was due in part to feedback from troops who felt they might have problems getting military housing, which is in short supply at times.
