Final calculations showed the unknown object passed the space station 1,100 feet away and its source remains a mystery, according to Kelly Humphries, a spokesman at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Officials at NASA are investigating what the debris was, NASA spokesman Joshua Buck said. -- Tuesday's space debris incident at the International Space Station was the "closest anything has come to the space station," NASA said Wednesday. When the unexpected space debris came flying close to the space station Tuesday, it prompted the station's six astronauts to take shelter inside two Soyuz capsules, NASA said. NASA does not expect any other close calls with this particular debris, said Humphries.
