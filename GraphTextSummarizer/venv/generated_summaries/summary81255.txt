Within 24 hours of the earthquake, Dr. David Helfet put together a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists and operating room nurses, with a massive amount of orthopedic operating room equipment, ready to be flown directly to Port-au-Prince on a private plane. These pieces of equipment, two of each, were urgently needed: portable anesthesiology machines; electrocautery machines to stop bleeding after amputations; portable monitors for the recovery room; autoclaves to sterilize equipment; and a lot of orthopedic equipment, which we were quickly using up. Yet our flight of critical medical equipment and personnel had been canceled, and the equipment that did get through was hijacked. We were unprepared for what we saw in Haiti -- the vast amount of human devastation, the complete lack of medical infrastructure,  the lack of support from the Haitian medical community, the lack of organization on the ground. We had the first hospital in the Port-au-Prince area with functioning operating rooms, yet no one came to the hospital to assess how we did it or offer help.
