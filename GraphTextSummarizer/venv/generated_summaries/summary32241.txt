Still, it's not like Cleveland last few season have been successful: There's a reason they had the No. 1 overall draft pick -- which typically goes to one of the NBA's worst team -- three of the last four years. Part of that may have to do with the fact he didn't have the same supporting cast as he had in Miami, where he suited up with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. Unlike what he'd done after joining Miami, the four-time league Most Valuable Player didn't promise he'd bring any titles to Cleveland. The NBA doormat-turned-upstart squad from northeastern Ohio officially got its second big jolt of excitement this offseason on Saturday, with the announcement that Kevin Love is coming its way in a trade. It was James' return to the Cavaliers -- the club he famously made "The Decision" to leave four years ago for the Miami Heat -- that was the NBA's biggest move, by far, since the San Antonio Spurs beat the Heat for the championship.
