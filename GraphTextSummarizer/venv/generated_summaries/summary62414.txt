The Dream Defenders began their occupation of the office of Florida Gov. Rick Scott in mid-July, just days after Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder in the death of Trayvon Martin. HLN's Grace Wong, Graham Winch, Amanda Sloane, Jonathan Anker and Anna Lanfreschi and CNN's Mariano Castillo, Michael Pearson, Faith Karimi, Chelsea J. Carter, John Couwels, Greg Botelho, Holly Yan and Mayra Cuevas contributed to this report. The deadly encounter between Zimmerman, 29, and Martin took place on February 26, 2012, as Martin, 17, walked back to his father's fiancee's house through the rain from a Sanford convenience store. Sometime after that, Zimmerman and Martin got into a physical altercation. Zimmerman shot Martin dead.
