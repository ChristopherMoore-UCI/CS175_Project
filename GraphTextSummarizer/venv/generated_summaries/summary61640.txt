Fulton said he wants to see changes in Florida's "stand your ground" laws, which allow people to use deadly force if they feel a reasonable threat of death or serious injury. Fulton recalled speaking with his mother, Sybrina Fulton, after learning of Martin's death. Attorney: Zimmerman 'stressed' about charges "I just paused because I didn't believe it," Fulton told HLN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. But Martin's life ended on February 26 in Sanford, Florida, during an encounter with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Martin, 17, was an honors student with his own college dreams, according to Jahvaris Fulton.
