How Grid started Sure, the idea of team functional fitness isn't exactly new. Taking cues from the NFL and NBA, in April 2014, Budding kicked things off with a football-esque Grid League Combine (athletes were selected via invite and application), which put hopefuls through every imaginable fitness test, from squats to handstand walks. If the CrossFit Games come to mind when watching Grid athletes clean, jerk and kip at lightning speeds, it's no coincidence. " Rhinos co-captain Mat Fraser, who also earned second place at the 2014 CrossFit Games, says the relentless speed is something Grid athletes, himself included, will need to adjust to. Once the teams were stacked, players were off to team training camp (albeit some no more than a week long), followed by pre-season scrimmages to get familiar with the ins and outs of league play, because no, it's not exactly intuitive.
