To be honest, as lesbians, neither Abbie nor I had spent a tremendous amount of time thinking about circumcision in the first place. As two women and a gay man raising children together, we did not feel particularly bound to social custom or tradition. "You have to circumcise him!" said my sister Melanie, an emergency room doctor who has seen her fair share of infected uncircumcised penises and urinary tract infections, and whom I trust immensely. We were finally persuaded when the World Health Organization and UNAIDS issued a joint statement in 2007 supporting the link between male circumcision and HIV prevention. He questioned, like me, if the procedure was outdated and based more on social customs than medical necessity.
