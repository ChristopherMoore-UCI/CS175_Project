The group lays out what it thinks happened next in its press release: Earhart "sent radio distress calls for at least five nights before the Electra was washed into the ocean by rising tides and surf leaving Earhart and Noonan cast away on the uninhabited atoll." The International Historic Aircraft Recovery Group says new testing of a piece of metal found in the vast waters of the Pacific Ocean in 1991 gives the group "increasing confidence" that it's a part of the Lockheed Electra. Now the groups says research on the aluminum "matches that fingerprint in many respects." Erhart's Lockheed Electra never made it back from an attempt to circle the globe in 1937. In a press release the group argues that the aluminum debris is likely a patch that Earhart had put on her plane in place of a window. Or even, Earhart secretly returned to the United States and the government gave her a new identity.
