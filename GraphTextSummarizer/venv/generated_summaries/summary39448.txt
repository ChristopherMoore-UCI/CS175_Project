The most affected departments are San Salvador, La Paz, Cuscatlan, Usulatan and San Vicente. At the 139-bed Hospital Santa Gertrudis in San Vicente, 33 patients sought help overnight in the emergency room, mostly for trauma, broken bones and abrasions, said Dr. Ana Luisa Velazquez, the hospital director. About 60 people were still missing Monday afternoon, said Carlos Alvarado, communications director for the government's rescue efforts. Laura Mata, communications manager for World Vision in El Salvador, said 40 percent of the dead were children. Though the hospital had fresh water from its own well, fresh water was in scarce supply in San Vicente, she said.
