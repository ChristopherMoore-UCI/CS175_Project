After the attacker finishes, he picks up his backpack and walks away, leaving the victim helpless on the ground with injuries to his head and face, police said. The victim was walking down the street around noon on October 2 when the attacker looked in his direction, police said. Mustafa Guyton, 29, is accused of aggravated assault after he allegedly kicked and stomped the 33-year-old man in Philadelphia's Southwest Germantown neighborhood, a police news release says. The victim told police he did not recognize his attacker's voice. Officer Tanya Little, a Philadelphia police spokeswoman, said it was not clear whether the attacker knew the victim was blind.
