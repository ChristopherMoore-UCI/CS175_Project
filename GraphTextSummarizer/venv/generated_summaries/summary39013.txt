His strongest barbs, however, were aimed at Romney, the early front-runner in Florida who has seen Gingrich close the gap in recent days in polls. "The fact is, Gov. Romney will have vastly more money than I will, but we will have many more people than he will. He'll give a nice speech, a lot of memorable phrases in it, but he won't give you the hard numbers like 9.9% unemployment here in Florida," former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney predicted at a campaign event in Tampa. "By the time President Obama lands in Chicago, we will have dismantled about 40% of his administration," Gingrich said to cheers. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose poll numbers have surged in the wake of his primary victory on Saturday in South Carolina, said at an event in St. Petersburg that change must occur at the White House, in Congress and in the bureaucracy of Washington.
