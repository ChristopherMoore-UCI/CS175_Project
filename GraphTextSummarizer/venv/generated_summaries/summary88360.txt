Safari's hold on 62.17% of mobile traffic has reduced IE's overall share of web browsing, despite still claiming 52.63% of desktop traffic, according to Netmarketshare.com. As of October, Firefox is the second most popular web browser, accounting for 21.20% of traffic, followed by Google Chrome and Safari, which account for 16.60% and 8.72% respectively. The Microsoft browser's diminishing share (49.6%) reflects its near absence from the realms of mobile and tablet, which now make up 6% of web traffic. Safari's share is increasing faster than the iPhone's, probably due to how much mobile traffic is now driven by iPads. Chrome, which recently celebrated its third birthday, experienced the most expansion in October, increasing its share of the desktop market 1.42%.
