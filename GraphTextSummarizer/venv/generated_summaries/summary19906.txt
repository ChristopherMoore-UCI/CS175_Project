"Today's supersonic success opens the way for rapid expansion of the spaceship's powered flight envelope, with a very realistic goal of full space flight by the year's end. Virgin Galactic said it will continue testing this year and plans to reach full space flight by the end of 2013. "For the first time, we were able to prove the key components of the system," said Virgin Galactic founder Sir Richard Branson in a statement. -- Virgin Galactic is one flight closer to becoming a commercial "spaceline." During the 16-second engine burn, the spaceship broke the sound barrier, according to a statement from Virgin Galactic.
