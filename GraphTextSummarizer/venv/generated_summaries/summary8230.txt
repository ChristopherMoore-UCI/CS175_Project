"It's hard to estimate exactly how much is going out of Afghanistan, but I can tell you in 2011, 4.5 billion was (flown) out of Afghanistan," said Khan Afzal Hadawal, deputy governor of the bank of Afghanistan. The government is trying to stop the outflow of money to other countries and encourage investment in Afghanistan. People will try to use other channels but we will not let anybody take the physical cash out of Afghanistan," Hadawal said. There is need for construction in Afghanistan and the amount of housing that is needed is not being fulfilled," Caravan said. We want a stable system here in Afghanistan after foreign troops' withdrawal.
