Iced-over vehicles can limit driver visibility, and ice flying off cars can be hazardous to fellow drivers. When you do brake, don't remove your foot from the brake or pump the pedal if you have antilock brakes, AAA advises. If you have to drive in conditions with low visibility, go slowly, with your headlights on low beam, AAA advises. -- A driver's best bet is to stay home when wintry weather coats the roads in snow and ice, particularly in areas such as the Southeast where motorists and road crews aren't in the habit of dealing with icy conditions. Drivers of cars that don't have antilock brakes should keep their heel on the floor and apply firm pressure to the brake pedal to the threshold of locking.
