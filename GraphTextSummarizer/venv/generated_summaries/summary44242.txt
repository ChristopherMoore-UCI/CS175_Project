"We find that EHPD engages in discriminatory policing against Latinos, including but not limited to targeting Latinos for discriminatory traffic enforcement, treating Latino drivers more harshly than non-Latino drivers after a traffic stop, and intentionally and woefully failing to design and implement internal systems of control that would identify, track, and prevent such misconduct," Assistant Attorney General Thomas J. Perez wrote in a 23-page letter to the East Haven mayor, detailing the results of a two-year investigation. Overall, the investigation found that 19.9% of traffic stops made by the EHPD were of Latino drivers, concluding it "shows pervasive discrimination against Latinos on every level of EHPD traffic enforcement activity." The report also said officers were able to target Latinos by focusing on customers leaving Latino businesses. The report mentioned "numerous incident reports" where EHPD officers contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to check on the status or seek an immigration detention of a Latino person. In addition to the high rate of traffic stops, the report accused some EHPD officers of conducting unauthorized immigration investigations.
