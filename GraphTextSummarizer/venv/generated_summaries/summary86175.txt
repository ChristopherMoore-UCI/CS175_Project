-- Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was called in for questioning Tuesday as part of a corruption investigation in connection with an inquiry into alleged abuse of power. Sarkozy left office in May 2012 after he lost in the presidential election to Socialist rival Francois Hollande. They are trying to establish whether the former President, who led the country from 2007 to 2012, obtained confidential information on legal cases concerning him from top magistrates in exchange for the offer of a prestigious post, the channel said. CNN's Jim Bittermann reported from Paris and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. His lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and two high-ranking magistrates were called in for questioning in the Paris area Monday, according to BFMTV.
