From my previous experience in telling long stories on Instagram, I realized people read through the long captions based on the comments they left. One of the best things about Instagram is that because of the challenges of shooting on mobile, people look to tell stories differently than they would with a traditional photo outlet. "During Hurricane Sandy, we saw people along the Atlantic Coast using Instagram to document how the storm was affecting their communities, and to let loved ones know they were OK," Instagram founder Kevin Systrom told CNN this week. You only get one photo or video to tell a story per Instagram post. Lampe: Instagram is a great spot for everyday stories.
