AirTran is also accused of misusing the Minimum Equipment List when it decided to continue flights without addressing the needed repair, the statement said. The FAA wants to fine AirTran Airways of Orlando, Florida, $250,000 for allegedly operating a Boeing 737 on four passenger flights without testing the sensor that indicates potential loss of lift on the aircraft. Repairing a damaged AOA sensor cannot be deferred, said the statement. The angle-of-attack sensor was damaged by lightning during a March 20, 2009 flight, said the statement. -- The Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday proposed fining AirTran Airways for allegedly operating an airplane not in compliance with regulations, the agency said.
