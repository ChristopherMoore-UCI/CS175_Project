Having won prizes at film festivals in Abu Dhabi, Oran, Cairo and Berlin, the film will have its UK premiere next month in London at the Bird's Eye View Film Festival, an event devoted to championing women filmmakers and which is this year focusing on Arab cinema. "They say nobody wants to see local films, they want to see Hollywood films," said Jacir Despite a positive reception at festivals, her first feature film did not gain theatrical release throughout the Arab world, leading her team to distribute the film themselves throughout the Palestinian Territories. The Jordanian-Palestinian director's second feature film, "When I Saw You," has been winning awards at film festivals around the world, part of a wave of Arab women filmmakers recently gaining critical acclaim worldwide. "Young people dreamed of a better world and had agency in their own lives." Jacir said that aside from funding possibly being harder to come by for women, she did not believe she encountered any particular obstacles related to her gender because, as a Jordanian-Palestinian director, she was creating films in a place without an established industry. it's just that the film industry, whether for women or men, is one that is difficult because there's no funding and you have to figure out your own manner of making films," she said.
