Los Angeles police issued an emergency protective order effective for five days starting Thursday, but the actor's lawyer can ask a judge to extend it. Ukrainian TV reporter Vitalii Sediuk is infamous for red carpet pranks around the world, including kissing Will Smith in Moscow and hugging Leonardo DiCaprio and Bradley Cooper around the knees at separate events earlier this year. Prosecutors are now preparing new charges for his Hollywood arrest Wednesday, spokesman Rob Wilcox said. Sediuk was held in the LAPD's Hollywood jail on suspicion of battery, pending $20,000 bond, according to online jail records. Attorney Willoughby said he had not yet been called by Sediuk for help getting out of jail, but he planned to send another lawyer to the jail to check on him.
