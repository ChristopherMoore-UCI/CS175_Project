This would represent the largest regional free trade and investment agreement in history, with the U.S. and Europe accounting for more than 50% of global GDP, and embed Washington's role as guardian of the "rules of the road" for international commerce, as an administration trade official put it recently. Washington hopes that this will embed U.S. influence in Asia-Pacific and is part of the so-called U.S. pivot to the region. To be sure, the post-Cold War world contains multiple opportunities as well as risks for Washington, including the potential forthcoming agreement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership with around a dozen countries in the Americas and Asia-Pacific that collectively account for about 40% of world GDP. The vision of a universal order of liberal, capitalist, democratic states living in peace and contentment -- as painted by Francis Fukuyama and others -- has been replaced by a reality in which authoritarian states such as Russia and China appear to many to be in the ascendancy, so-called Islamic terrorism has become a significant international concern, and several unstable countries, including North Korea, have acquired nuclear weaponry. However, U.S. success in managing the complexity of global affairs will also increasingly depend upon the cooperation of others, both competitors and allies.
