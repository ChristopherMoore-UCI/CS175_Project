Amanda Knox judge explains murder acquittal The case began in 2007, after Knox moved to Perugia to study at the University for Foreigners of Perugia for one year Knox, then 20, shared a room with British student Kercher, 21. Knox's family said last year the appeal was unwelcome, but no cause for concern. Knox spent four years in jail before an appellate court overturned her murder conviction in the 2007 death of Meredith Kercher. Prosecutors say that despite the appellate decision, they still believe Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, are responsible for the death.
