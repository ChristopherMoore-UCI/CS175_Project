Introverts are not always the kids with thick glasses, ugly braces and narrow shoulders, who spend all their time in the library or science lab. But here's the thing: stage fright isn't so much the fear of the limelight as the consciousness of the presence of other people. I'd forced myself to get out of my shell, and speak to people -- I'd even chosen a career in journalism that involved interacting with strangers. These are not people I dislike; I'm even fond of many of the people I've evaded. Why did people have to know me when I was playing somebody else?
