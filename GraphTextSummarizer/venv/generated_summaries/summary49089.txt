Filmmaker James Cameron to visit deepest ocean depths With the help of Alfred S. McLaren, a retired U.S. Navy captain, honorary director of the Explorers Club and deep ocean pilot with more than 30 years experience, CNN takes a look at the most exciting deep ocean adventures on offer to paying tourists. Swedish treasure hunters mysterious deep sea find Only a handful of people, including McLaren, have glimpsed Bismarck since its demise, but Deep Ocean Expeditions is planning a trip to the wreck site this year. Several companies around the world offer midrange dives of between 1,500 and 3,000 feet, but only specialist tour operator Deep Ocean Expeditions takes paying customers to depths of 10,000 feet and beyond. Although there are currently only a handful of sites where tourists can pay to delve into the darkest ocean abysses, McLaren believes that deep sea tourism has the potential to become a major industry in years to come. For Titanic enthusiasts, however, witnessing the mythical vessel in its final resting place is a priceless if slightly morbid experience, says McLaren, who has piloted several expeditions.
