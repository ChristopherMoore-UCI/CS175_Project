Meeks, a convicted felon who's served years in prison, was arraigned Friday on counts related to firearm possession, gang membership and probation violation. The 30-year-old  stirred a collective swoon nationwide after authorities in Stockton, California, posted his arrest mugshot on social media this week. Meeks' prior brushes with the law include resisting arrest and admitted ties to the Crips gang, authorities said. Katherine Angier, who said she's his mother, has launched a fundraiser for his defense at crowdsourcing website GoFundMe. "With his past history, he got out of being incarcerated and put his mind on focus to his family and started doing what he had to do," his brother, Bryan Varela, told CNN affiliate KOVR.
