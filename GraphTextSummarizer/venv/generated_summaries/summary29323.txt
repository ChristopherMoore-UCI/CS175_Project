Ray McDonald Three days after Goodell created a new NFL policy against domestic violence on August 28, San Francisco 49ers defensive tackle Ray McDonald was arrested on an accusation of felony domestic violence. Hardy played one game then was deactivated as the outrage against the NFL grew over how it was dealing with domestic violence issues. Adrian Peterson One of the top players in the NFL, he left the Minnesota Vikings on Wednesday to deal with child abuse accusations in Texas. Peterson then took a leave of absence and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell placed him on the exempt list, which gives the team the opportunity to continue to pay him while he deals with his legal issues. Hardy was convicted by a judge in July on misdemeanor assault charges.
