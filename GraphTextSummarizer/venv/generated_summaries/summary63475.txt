Rivera married longtime friend and fellow actor Ryan Dorsey last summer, a scant three months after she and rapper Big Sean called off their engagement. Rivera became something of a sexy lesbian icon for her generation when Santana, her character on Glee, finally came out about her relationship with fellow student Brittany (played by Heather Morris). "I think that white people shower a lot more than ethnic," said Rivera, who was a guest host on the Tuesday edition of "The View." Rivera apologized for any offense she caused the next day on "The View." Kim Kardashian: Lay off the nude photo shoots! But... you're someone's mother..." said Rivera, posting on Instagram.
