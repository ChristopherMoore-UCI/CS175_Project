-- County coroner's officials in Los Angeles, California, hope to release results Thursday morning of their examination of skeletal remains found in a remote area of Malibu Canyon. "I've been praying that we would find him because it's our anniversary this Saturday," Perryman told CNN iReporter Julie Ellerton. The family of missing Mitrice Richardson have been waiting to hear whether the remains are those of their loved one. The remains, which included a human skull, were found Monday by park rangers searching the area for marijuana groves, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. Richardson, who would be 25 now, is a former beauty pageant contestant who was last seen leaving a Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Malibu during the early morning hours of September 17, 2009.
