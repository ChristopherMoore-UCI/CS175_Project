What reporters don't have worry about, though, as they once did, is government officials charging them with libel as a way of silencing their criticism. In a front page story, Times Supreme Court reporter Anthony Lewis, who would later write the definitive book on the Sullivan case, pointed out the Supreme Court had established a new "constitutional landmark for freedom of the press and speech. Under Alabama law, a resident could sue for libel when untruths that he believed defamatory were said about him. Soon after Sullivan filed his suit, Alabama Gov. John Patterson filed a $500,000 suit of his own, also claiming libel. If liberal, Northern papers could be silenced in their criticism of the South as a result of libel suits, the civil rights movement faced tough going.
