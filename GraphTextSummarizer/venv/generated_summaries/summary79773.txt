Why the Titanic fascinates more than other disasters "This is very emotional for me to be here," said Diane Lind of Blaine, Washington. Earlier in the night, an announcement was made to let passengers know they were passing over the point where the Titanic put out its distress signal, alerting others that they needed help. The 450 passengers gathered on the Azamara Journey, a ship chartered for a "Titanic Memorial Cruise," began their evening of remembrance by sitting in silence as 1,503 names of those who perished aboard the Titanic were displayed on a projection screen. "We pray for the relatives of all those who died in Titanic." Descendants of the dead, as well as Titanic enthusiasts, were among the crowd that had gathered for the occasion. The Journey is one of two ships chartered by Miles Morgan Travel for the Titanic event.
