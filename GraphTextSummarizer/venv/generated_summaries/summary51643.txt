Analysis: Why gun controls are off the agenda in America Contemporary gun rights ideology makes a mockery of the Enlightenment ideals of the Framers of the Second Amendment. For the adherents of this ideology, the solution to the problem of gun violence is not better regulations but more guns. The Founders obviously supported gun ownership, but they favored strong gun regulation. The key legal concept here is reasonable cause for fear, precisely the standard that gun rights advocates wish to overturn and a federal court in New York recently upheld. The American Revolution did not usher in a new era of expansive gun rights.
