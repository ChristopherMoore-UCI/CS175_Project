Even before the September night of shootouts in Iguala, Mexico -- which left several students dead and the group of 43 missing -- she'd been worried about his safety studying at Escuela Normal Rural de Ayotzinapa. The teachers' college in Guerrero state is known for its political activism in addition to training teachers, and police have been known to spar with student protesters in the past. Mexico's attorney general says they were captured by police on the orders of the Iguala mayor, Jose Luis Abarca, handed over to a drug gang and executed. "When I came home, my wife found me and told me something horrible had happened in Iguala." Since then, √Ålvarez says he hasn't stopped searching for his son -- and he won't, until he finds him. Back in Mexico's Guerrero state, where the students disappeared, the teen's mother has marched in demonstrations, carrying a large photo of her missing son.
