Relations between Pakistan and the United States have been increasingly strained since bin Laden was killed in a Navy SEAL raid in early May. U.S. officials believe Pakistan is not doing enough to go after al Qaeda and other extremists, while the Pakistanis are upset with what they consider to be unilateral steps taken by the United States within their borders. -- Pakistan was aware of increased U.S. intelligence activity in the country weeks before the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May, an Arab diplomat with direct knowledge of the events and a senior Pakistani official told CNN Saturday. Senior U.S. officials also suspect that some in Pakistan helped bin Laden live there. The Arab diplomat said he is sure officials in Pakistan "had no idea where bin Laden was." Washington did not give advance notice to Pakistani officials about the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad.
