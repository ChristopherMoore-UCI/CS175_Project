-- Federal agents have arrested a California man who allegedly attempted to export a U.S. military fighter jet to Iran, authorities announced Friday. Over the course of their interaction, Knapp provided the agent with various lists containing items for sale, including fighter jet emergency manuals, survival radios and antigravity suits, according to court documents. Knapp allegedly told the agent that the "Iranians" might be interested in the fighter jet and other items, and allegedly said he wlould not be concerned if the jet or the other items ended up in Iran. Knapp was arrested in Delaware in July while negotiating plans to fly the aircraft from California to the East Coast, where it subsequently was to be crated and shipped to Hungary and eventually Iran, the documents state. Marc Knapp, 35, also was charged in a criminal complaint with two felony counts of attempting to export other aircraft parts and controlled technology.
