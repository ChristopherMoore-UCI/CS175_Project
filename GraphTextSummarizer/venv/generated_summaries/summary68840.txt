" Vogel started learning, at age 9, the secrets of running a movie theater from his father, Jack Vogel. the integrity and the innocence of that age," says Bengies owner D. Edward Vogel, who claims to have the largest outdoor movie screen in the country at 52 feet by 120 feet. Vogel estimates that Bengies makes 60 percent of its revenue from ticket sales, and the rest comes from concession purchases. Vogel wants moviegoers to have the same experience as he did when he went to his family's outdoor theater as a child, although he knows that people today have many more entertainment options. "Sometimes I'm actually taken aback with the amount of children that are fascinated with this," says Vogel.
