-- British Prime Minister David Cameron, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall will join hundreds of veterans Sunday to commemorate the 65th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, or VJ Day, which was Saturday. "The service will remember the efforts of hundreds of thousands of veterans operating in the harshest of conditions, and pay tribute to nearly 30,000 British losses suffered during the Far East campaign, (including) some 12,500 who died while prisoners of war," Britain's Ministry of Defence said in a statement. Cameron will lay a wreath on behalf of the British government, the statement said. VJ Day, the day the Second World War ended, is a time for this generation to reflect and show its gratitude to our veterans for their bravery, dedication and sacrifice. On August 14, 1945, Japan surrendered to Allied forces, effectively ending World War II.
