Felix Magath's Schalke side travel to Mainz next Saturday knowing they cannot be overtaken in second place by Bremen, who hold the third and final Champions League place for next season by a margin of two points from Bayer Leverkusen. Leaders Bayern beat second-bottom Bochum 3-1 to move three points clear of Schalke, and now have a 17-goal better for-and-against differential ahead of the final match against relegated Hertha Berlin. Sixth-placed Stuttgart failed to take advantage of Dortmund's slip, drawing 2-2 at home to Mainz to be three points adrift in the race for the second Europa League berth. Bayern Munich were left tantalizingly close to a 22nd German Bundesliga title after closest rivals Schalke suffered a 2-0 defeat at home to third-placed Werder Bremen in the penultimate round of the league season on Saturday. Bayer Leverkusen's hopes of playing in the Champions League suffered a big blow with a 1-1 draw that condemned Hertha Berlin to the second division.
