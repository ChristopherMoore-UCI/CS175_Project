Majorities of Latinos support strong environmental protections, especially since many communities happen to be in historically unsafe and polluted environs. Installing solar panels cannot be outsourced and fits the bill for many construction workers struggling to get by, and is a tremendous opportunity for many Latino entrepreneurs, who already have a strong foothold in the construction industry. This is another big reason environmental issues are registering on the minds of many Latino families, especially Latina mothers, a key swing vote group in the upcoming elections. Obama's call for greater income equality on taxes, his focus on job creation, including focusing on key elements of his American Jobs Act (supported by 78% of Latinos), his renewed call for DREAM Act legislation in the State of the Union, and yes, his commitment to environmental and public health protections, as well as for the expansion of a clean energy economy. The president has also spoken of jobs that Latinos might get on farms -- wind farms, that is - thanks to the growth of wind power, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics says now employs 85,000 Americans.
