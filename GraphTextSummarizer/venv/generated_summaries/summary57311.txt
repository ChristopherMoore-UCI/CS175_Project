Joining Still in the chat were Dave Wellman of Myriad Genetics, who has worked with and managed employees with autism as well as having a son with Asperger's, and Becky Ketts of Nobis Works, which provides job training for those with disabilities and other barriers. Many (people with autism) are extremely sensitive and it gets to us much more than regular people. We try to focus on finding a job for each person based on what they would like to do rather than trying to fit people into certain jobs/employers. You can read the full transcript of the chat on Facebook, or scan through the highlights below to find out how people with autism can confront the challenges they face when finding a job. Ketts: Employers need to be flexible when working with people with all disabilities.
