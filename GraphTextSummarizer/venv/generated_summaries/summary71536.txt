However a transplant surgeon has told CNN that smokers organs will continue to be used as long as medical services face a severe shortage of organs. Those time constraints mean medics have to make quick judgments about the suitability of donated organs, even if it that means using imperfect organs. -- News that a British soldier died after he received the cancerous lungs of a heavy smoker has sparked intense debate as to whether organs from people with unhealthy lifestyles should be used in transplants. "We're not in the luxurious position in transplantation to turn down organs because they're not absolutely perfect -- there are very few perfect organs," he said. In the case of lung transplants, the donor will have a chest x-ray and broncoscopy, where an endoscope is used to examine lungs from the inside.
