That's why restricting freedom of expression, especially media freedoms, is the favorite sport of authoritarian governments that want to preserve the appearance of democratic legitimacy. If they lose the battle to pry open the flow of ideas, they will lose the struggle for democracy, because even when a president is elected, if the people are not free to criticize him and his policies, then democracy is a mirage -- and so is freedom. The encouraging news in all of this is that the efforts of authoritarian regimes to silence their critics highlight the power of words, the power of free expression and the importance even they place on having democratic legitimacy. The government now says it plans to stop using the Internet by 2013 because it is "untrustworthy." Sadly, restrictions on freedom of expression, one of the most fundamental of all human rights, are much more widespread than most people realize. Like others in Russia, they were taking on the increasingly authoritative rule of President Vladimir Putin.
