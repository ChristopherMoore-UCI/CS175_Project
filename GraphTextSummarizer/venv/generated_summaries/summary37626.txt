American Express members who sign up will be able to buy products by mentioning the appropriate hashtag in a tweet. The first discounted products American Express will sell are an Amazon Kindle Fire, a Sony Action cam, a Donna Karan-designed bracelet and an Xbox 360. The service will only work with compatible American Express cards (no prepaid or corporate cards) and a public Twitter account. To start Twitter shopping you'll need to first sync your American Express card with Twitter. If it takes off, we could see hashtags for products in commercials and print ads.
