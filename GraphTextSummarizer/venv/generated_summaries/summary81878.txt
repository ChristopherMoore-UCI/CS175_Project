The Beach Boys: Chuck Berry: Not so fine: One of the most famous copyright disputes in music history targeted former Beatle George Harrison's song "My Sweet Lord," which was found to have copied "He's So Fine" by the girl group the Chiffons. Innes later winked at the incident in the opening notes of the song "Shangri-La." Oasis: Neil Innes, 14 years earlier: If everybody had their own tune: There's some controversy about how the Beach Boys' first big hit, "Surfin' U.S.A.," came to be written since the melody seems to be lifted straight from the Chuck Berry single "Sweet Little Sixteen." Reports say the two settled out of court, and the official credits now list Petty as a co-writer of the Smith song. Reports at the time said a lawsuit was settled out of court. Their song: Marvin Gaye's: Tom Petty stands his ground: Young British pop sensation Sam Smith's 2014 tune "Stay With Me" has a riff in the chorus similar to that of the 1989 Tom Petty hit "I Won't Back Down."
