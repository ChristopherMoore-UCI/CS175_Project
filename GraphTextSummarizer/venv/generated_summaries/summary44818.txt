Working as a guidance counselor five years ago in Palm Beach County, Estella Pyfrom noticed that fewer students had access to a computer after school. Pyfrom is determined to help poor children get the same educational opportunities as other children. Freddy and Brianna Rodriguez are two students benefiting from Pyfrom's bus. For older students, the bus brings GED and college preparatory assistance, anti-bullying and peer mediation classes, and student leadership training. According to the Institute of the Study of Labor, students who lack access to a home computer are less likely to graduate high school.
