"The Kingdom is proud and cherishes Islamic law and its constitutional curriculum, where justice and the preservation of rights is ensured for all beings made by the Almighty Creator," Mohammed al-Muadi, of the government backed Saudi Human Rights Commission told CNN. Al-Rasheed said: "The United States adopts double standards when it deals with a country like Saudi Arabia because of the importance of Saudi Arabia for U.S. interests and for European interest." " Madawi al-Rasheed, a Professor at the Middle East Center of the London School of Economics, told CNN's Becky Anderson this week: "None of those countries are willing to challenge Saudi Arabia as they challenge other countries deemed as opposed to the West." "The case of Raif al Badawi tells us a great deal about the polarization in Saudi society between the Islamists and the liberals," Professor Madawi al-Rasheed explained. Prison for female driving, death for dissent, lashes for liberalism - these are some of the punishments, human rights groups say, Saudi Arabia has handed down in recent months.
