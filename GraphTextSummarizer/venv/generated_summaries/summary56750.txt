According to the statement, all pilots, engineers and ground crew will need to undertake hazardous situation and extra safety training. -- Hot air balloon rides at Egypt's popular tourist destination of Luxor are set to resume Wednesday, according to a statement on the Egyptian Civil Aviation Regulatory Commission's (CARC) website (Arabic). In addition, hot air balloons in operation will be subject to inspection and companies will have to follow new mandatory regulations. Hot air balloon rides were banned in Luxor after a February 26 accident that killed 19 tourists. Balloon rides offering panoramic aerial views of the Nile River and the ancient temples of Karnak and Hatshepsut are a popular tourist attraction in Luxor, about a nine-hour drive southeast of Cairo.
