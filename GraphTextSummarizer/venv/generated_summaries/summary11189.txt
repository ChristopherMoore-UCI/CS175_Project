-- This year's Fuji Rock Festival in Japan could be the most difficult for Masahiro Hidaka. " "Jishuku" (self-restraint) has been added to the collective somber mood across the county and like many businesses in Japan, public events and festivals have suffered as a result. Hidaka says he had to reassure many international bands that it would be safe for them to play at the festival, yet many of them responded really positively to the crisis with some joining the "Benefit for Nippon" charity concert that took place in London last month. He's the festival's organizer who over 15 years has faced down typhoons and musicians' monstrous egos to successfully host the annual three day music festival in the picturesque mountains of western Japan. However he admitted that ticket sales over the past couple of months had been much slower than in previous years.
