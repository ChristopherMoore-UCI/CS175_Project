Boko Haram (which according to the group means "Western civilization is forbidden") has claimed responsibility for a series of attacks on churches in central and northern Nigeria on Christmas Day, including one near the capital, Abuja, which killed nearly 30 people. It's not clear whether it was intended as revenge, but such sectarian attacks are rare in Delta state. The last two months have seen widespread bloodshed in northern Nigeria, with churches and police stations among the targets. Nigeria's president has declared a state of emergency in parts of the country afflicted by violence from the militant Islamist group Boko Haram. Two days later, a bomb attack at an Islamic school -- or madrassa -- in the southern Delta state injured several children.
