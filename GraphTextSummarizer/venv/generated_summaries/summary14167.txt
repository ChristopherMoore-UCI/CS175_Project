Strong doesn't currently have an official involvement with "Girl Meets World," but he believes that Shawn Hunter will probably show up at some point. Strong couldn't resist taking the item -- as crucial to Shawn's character as his long hair -- when he moved to New York after "Boy Meets World" ended. -- ABC's '90s sitcom "Boy Meets World" had one of the best TV bromances of our time, but the bond between Ben Savage's Cory Matthews and Rider Strong's Shawn Hunter wasn't part of the original plan. " Strong, of course, had already been cast as the mischievous, lady-loving underachiever that became a teen heartthrob, a part that "Boy Meets World" co-creator Michael Jacobs knew was destined to be the actor's from his first read. Had the production team behind the '90s coming-of-age comedy had their way, Savage's Cory, the precocious middle child of a loving middle-class family, would've had more male friends instead of his singular BFF, Strong's floppy-haired Shawn.
