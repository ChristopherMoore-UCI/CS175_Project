Mega Millions estimates Friday's jackpot will be the fifth-largest in North America. The Mega Millions jackpot numbers will be drawn Friday at 11 p.m. ET. And while it is a whopping big pile of money, Friday's projected jackpot wouldn't qualify to move into the ultra-tony neighborhood occupied by the record draw. That $656 million jackpot, won on March 30, 2012, was split by winning tickets in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. Although five tickets in Tuesday's drawing matched the first five numbers, netting $1 million each, none of the tickets purchased for Tuesday's measly $344 million jackpot matched all six numbers.
