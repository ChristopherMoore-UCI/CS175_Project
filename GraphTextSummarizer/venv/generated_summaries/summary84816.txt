Comparing Sarkozy and Hollande on their economic policy is not unlike comparing Republicans and Democrats in the United States. Opinion polls continue to favor Francois Hollande, a candidate from the center-left Socialist Party, over center-right incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in the upcoming French presidential election. "Hollande is in favor of more government action to stimulate the economy, stimulate spending ... whereas Sarkozy wants to improve the climate for business by lowering some taxes, by talking about repealing the law establishing the 35-hour work week -- a Socialist measure from the late '90s -- to make it possible to work more," Leruth said. While there are actually 10 candidates taking part in the presidential race, spanning the entire political spectrum, polls show that only two candidates -- Sarkozy and Hollande -- have a realistic chance of winning the French presidency. Sarkozy has worked closely with German Chancellor Angela Merkel throughout the European debt crisis, leading the way for strict austerity measures in Greece and other troubled countries.
