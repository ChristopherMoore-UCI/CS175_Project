At that time, Haynes was the newly minted principal with this dilemma on her desk: In New Jersey, bus service isn't required if students live within 2Â½ miles of school and all Van Derveer's students fall within that range. In Somerville, New Jersey, there's a different school bus making the rounds and picking up students near Van Derveer Elementary School. Forty-five years ago, nearly 48% of students walked to school. Five years ago, barely 13% of students walked or biked to school, according to the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Parents, teachers and volunteers -- all on foot -- pick up students along a designated route on their way to school.
