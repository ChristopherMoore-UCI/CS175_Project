"Everything at Syfy Channel is run by robots, actually," said Karen O'Hara, vice president of original movies at Syfy. Thomas Vitale, the executive vice president of programming and original movies at Syfy, said the movie "Sharktopus" made everyone on his team smile. "Within the bandwith of the campy sci-fi movie, you can go from completely self-aware, with something like [classic sci-fi movie] 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,' and then in the middle you have something like [the Syfy movie] 'Sharktopus,' where the creature is just way over the top, sort of on purpose," Ferguson said. "Triassic Attack," is Ferguson's Syfy original movie directorial debut and will air Saturday, November 27, at 9 p.m. ET. With a reputation for being delightfully campy, Syfy's original movies are a guilty pleasure, said Colin Ferguson, star of Syfy's original series, "Eureka."
