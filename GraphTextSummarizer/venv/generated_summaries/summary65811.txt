As the row over the near seven minutes of added time accorded to United to win the Manchester derby with a last-gasp Michael Owen goal continues, the Guardian newspaper probed the official injury-time statistics. They looked at league matches at United's Old Trafford ground since the start of the 2006-07 season and revealed  that, on average, there has been over a minute of extra time added by referees when the English champions do not have the lead. In mitigation, the study revealed that the average stoppage time added at Old Trafford is below that at the home grounds of top four rivals Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea. In the two matches United have led they have played an average 304 seconds of injury time. This is compared to when they are in front, but United have a reputation for scoring late goals on their ways to claiming three straight Premier League crowns.
