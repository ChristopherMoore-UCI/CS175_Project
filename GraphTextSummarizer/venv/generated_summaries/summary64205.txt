-- A 14-year-old boy who allegedly fired a gun at another fleeing male on a New York street early Sunday morning was shot and killed by a uniformed police officer, the New York City Police Department said. A man who lives in the neighborhood where the shooting occurred told CNN affiliate New York 1 that his son alerted him to the shooting early Sunday morning. "Most likely, this gun has been purchased from out of state or somehow was obtained from out of state, was stolen and brought to New York City." The area is designated an "impact" neighborhood, which means it has high crime rates and is flooded with police officers to reduce that crime. In May, Shaaliver was arrested and was facing charges of attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon, according to Bronx District Attorney's Office spokesman Steven Reed.
