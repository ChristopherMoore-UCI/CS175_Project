The artist who designed the cake, Makode Linde, is of African descent himself and said the piece was aimed at condemning the practice of female genital mutilation. A group representing Swedes of African descent has called for Lena Adelsohn Liljeroth to resign over that it called a racist caricature. The museum was closed by a bomb threat Tuesday afternoon, but reopened Wednesday after no explosives were found, spokeswoman Kristin Ek said. "But we're talking about female genital mutilation -- is there any comfortable or cozy way to talk about it? But Liljeroth defended her participation, saying the cake was designed to "challenge the traditional image of racism."
