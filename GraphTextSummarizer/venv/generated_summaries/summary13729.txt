-- U.S. ski queen Lindsey Vonn damaged the same knee that underwent major surgery in February when she crashed Tuesday on a training run at Copper Mountain in Colorado. On Wednesday, Vonn's spokesperson Lewis Kay revealed that the Olympic downhill champion had damaged the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her troublesome right knee during the fall. She planned to return at the World Cup event in Beaver Creek, Colorado on November 29. Vonn was airlifted to a hospital in February after she landed heavily on her right knee on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria. Tiger Woods and Lindsey Vonn dating Vonn was crowned America's snow queen when she became the first American woman to win the Olympic downhill title at the Vancouver Games in 2010.
