If Iran needs nuclear energy and has the capacity to produce the fuel, then an agreement that allows it to enrich nuclear fuel is not only necessary, but also reduces the chance of a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. Tehran de-linked the nuclear talks from other regional issues including Syria, but remained open to discussing them with the P5+1. The nuclear talks with the P5+1 -- that's France, Britain, Russia, China, the United States and Germany -- this past week in Geneva left much to be desired for Iran in terms of final outcomes. That is why Interior Minister Abdul Reza Rahmani Fazli told Mehr news agency that the chant means Iran supports talks. The head of Iran's Foreign Policy and National Security Commission Alaadin Boroujerdi told ISNA news agency the country will stick with talks until all sanctions are lifted, which the joint plan promises to do through a later comprehensive solution.
