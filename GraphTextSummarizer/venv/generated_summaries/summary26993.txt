"This means that using Tylenol or similar products might have broader consequences than previously thought," said Geoffrey Durso, a doctoral student in social psychology at Ohio State University and the lead author of the study. "In other words, positive photos were not seen as positively under the influence of acetaminophen and negative photos were not seen as negatively," the authors reported. The authors said it was not known whether other pain relievers, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, have the same effect. But people who participated in the study did not appear to know they were acting differently, said Baldwin Way, an assistant professor of psychology who was another of the study's authors. But their new research led them to the conclusion that it also blunted joy -- in other words, that it narrowed the range of feelings experienced.
