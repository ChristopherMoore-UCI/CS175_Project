By Saturday evening, five were still in the hospital, while one person was injured critically, said Onondaga County Sheriff Kevin Walsh. "Obviously the driver didn't see the signs or didn't realize the height of his bus, that the double-decker bus wouldn't fit under that bridge," Walsh told CNN affiliate YNN. " The dead were people from India, Malaysia, New York and a Midwestern state, Walsh said. -- Four people were killed early Saturday when a double-decker Megabus slammed into a railroad overpass and turned on its side in Salina, New York. Walsh said authorities suspect the driver missed a turn when a road split.
