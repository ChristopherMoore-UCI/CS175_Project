You're people like Darren Palm, who sent in black-and-white photos of his grandfather catching salmon on California's Kings River; like Julee Khoo, who wrote that her trip on the Yangtze River "will forever link me to my grandmother who was born and raised in China"; like Maureen Moore, who's photographed the Hudson River in New York when it's covered in ice and when it's teeming with boats; and Sandi Kubbs, a Polio survivor, who wrote that, "who I became is intrinsically tied up with my life rowing up and down the Little Wabash." When I put out a request for readers to send in photos and stories about their favorite rivers, I wondered if anyone would respond -- if anyone still took photos of rivers, still cared about them. As rivers have become invisible, they've started to dry up -- and without much public alarm. -- Leave it to an old naturalist to make rivers sound sexy. Today, rivers aren't thrilling much of anybody.
