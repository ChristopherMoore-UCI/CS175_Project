U.S. aircraft have concluded a third round of strikes against an al Qaeda cell inside Syria, two U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the just-completed mission told CNN on Thursday. Khorasan is a group of hard-core al Qaeda operatives, many of whom moved to Syria from Pakistan in the last few years. Those attacks came amid intelligence that suggested the group was plotting against a target in the U.S. homeland, as well as other Western targets, a senior U.S. official told CNN at the time. It targeted the Khorasan Group with a series of strikes in Syria in September. At the same time, some of the Khorasan leadership is still believed to be alive and the group continues to pose a threat, according to the officials, who say some are still in Syria, actively plotting against the United States.
