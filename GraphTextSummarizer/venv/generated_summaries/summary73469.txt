A rarely seen portrait of Michael Jackson is on display inside a Harlem luxury car dealership. Dancy said the painting's owner chose the showroom because it's near the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where the Jackson 5 won their first taste of fame by winning Amateur Night in 1967. The painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership. The oil painting titled "The Book" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York. Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled "The Book" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat.
