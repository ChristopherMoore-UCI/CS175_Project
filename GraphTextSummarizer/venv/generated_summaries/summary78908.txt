I also want to limit the number of ministries at the center of government in Islamabad. Article 140 (a) of our constitution prescribes to put in place a system of local government -- developing power at the grass-roots level. Turkey has a population of 76 million, has 81 provinces, has developed 957 districts governments, 3,216 municipal governments and has set up 34,495 rural governments. Similarly, I want to see 150 districts and 800 sub-division governments consisting of 400 city governments and 400 rural governments. I have developed a model of modern systems and true democracy for the future prosperity of Pakistan.
