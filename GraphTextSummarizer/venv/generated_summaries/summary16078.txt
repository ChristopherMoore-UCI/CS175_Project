Students return to the Virginia Tech campus Monday for the first day of fall classes. -- Erin Sheehan is one of the almost 28,000 students making the bittersweet return to the Virginia Tech campus for fall classes, a journey she was afforded only because of some quick thinking in April. Though she is heading back to class, Sheehan is admittedly still shaken. "When classes started again in the spring I didn't come back," Sheehan said. Four months after the tragedy, Sheehan is haunted by memories of the massacre, and she still jumps when she hears a loud noise in her Virginia Tech dorm room.
