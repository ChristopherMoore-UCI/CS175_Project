On camera, Xiao Chen denies knowing anyone who has targetted U.S. government Web sites. Private computer experts in the United States from iDefense Security Intelligence, which provides cybersecurity advice to governments and Fortune 500 companies, say the group's site "appears to be an important site in the broader Chinese hacking community." There are Web sites with high-level security, but there is always a weakness," says Xiao Chen, the leader of this group. The three belong to what some Western experts say is a civilian cyber militia in China, launching attacks on government and private Web sites around the world. This week, the Pentagon said computer networks in the United States, Germany, Britain and France were hit last year by what they call "multiple intrusions," many of them originating from China.
