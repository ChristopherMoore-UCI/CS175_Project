Officials: 5 suspected al Qaeda killed in Yemen drone strike Residents in the Hadramawt Valley said that Yemeni Air Force planes and U.S. drones have been roaming the skies for four days. In December 2009, Yemen said it thought al-Shihri was at the site of an aerial assault against senior al Qaeda operatives. If confirmed, the death "would be a deeply significant blow against AQAP," CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. -- Yemeni forces have killed Said al-Shihri, second in command of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Yemeni Defense Ministry said Monday. White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan in April described AQAP as "very, very dangerous" and "the most active operational franchise" of al Qaeda.
