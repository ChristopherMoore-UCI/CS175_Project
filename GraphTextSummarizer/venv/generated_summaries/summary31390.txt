The three teens -- Bent, Denver Jarvis and Jesus Mendez -- were accused of pouring alcohol over Michael Brewer and setting him on fire, after a dispute over $40. Mendez has admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a "bad decision," according to an arrest transcript. Both testified during Bent's trial, according to CNN affiliate WBFS in Miami. Police say witnesses told them his attackers called Brewer a "snitch." Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that then-15-year-old Jarvis poured alcohol over Brewer and then-16-year-old Mendez used a lighter to start the fire. " Detectives say Bent demanded $40 he said Brewer owed him and, when he didn't pay, Bent allegedly stole Brewer's father's bicycle.
