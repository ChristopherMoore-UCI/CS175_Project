Previously, Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America, Inc. (TEMA), had said it would suspend production on Mondays and Fridays between April 15 and April 25. " "We are trying to continue production as much as possible and keep our workforce intact in order to facilitate a smooth transition back to full production when all parts are available," said Steve St. Angelo, executive vice president of TEMA, in the statement. In addition, Canadian production will be suspended for the week beginning May 23, and U.S. production for the week starting May 30. -- Toyota Motor Corporation on Tuesday announced dramatic production cuts in North America because of difficulty in supplying parts following the massive 9.0-magnitude March 11 earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan. "During the same period, production will run at 50% on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday," the statement said.
