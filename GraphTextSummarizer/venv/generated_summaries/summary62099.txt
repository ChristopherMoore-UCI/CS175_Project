-- Leading figures in the world of soccer, including superstar David Beckham, on Thursday blasted FIFA President Sepp Blatter for controversial remarks he made on racism in an interview with CNN World Sport. The "Kick It Out" group, who campaign against racism in football, said Blatter's comments were worryingly out of touch. "White players feel racism has been conquered but there remains a feeling of discrimination in the game which is why black players have reacted with outrage at Blatter's comments. " In an exclusive interview with CNN, Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said racism was still prevalent in football, but the top tier in the English game was fighting hard to eradicate it. London's Metropolitan Police are also investigating allegations of racism against Chelsea and England captain John Terry.
