"We have requested the national government to declare the Eastern Cape a national disaster," said Provincial Minister of Social Services Pemmy Majodina. -- Heavy flooding has left at least 50 people dead and hundreds homeless in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province as residents continue to battle adverse weather conditions that have plagued the country since mid-December, authorities said Friday. Eighteen others have died during recent electrical storms, Majodina added. Authorities continue to search for at least two flood victims, Majodina said. Many rural residents in the Eastern Cape live in mud hits that are unable to withstand heavy flooding.
