Amina Filali, 16, died suddenly last week in Larache, a city in northwestern Morocco along the Atlantic coast. "This girl was (in essence) raped twice, the last when she was married," government spokesman Mustapha El Khalfi said Thursday, referring to the initial reported rape and the fact she was forced to marry her alleged attacker. That fact has stirred anger and action in Morocco, including Saturday's demonstration in Rabat, which is about 170 kilometers (105 miles) south of Larache. " Under Moroccan law, rape is punishable by five to 10 years of prison, with a sentence as long as 20 years if the victim is a minor, pregnant or disabled. Moroccan law defends "family morals, but does not take into account the right of women as a person," Assouli told CNN.
