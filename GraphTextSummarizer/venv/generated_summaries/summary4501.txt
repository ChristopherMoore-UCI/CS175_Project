Barroso's call for a federal Europe is the latest in a long line of measures taken by European politicians to forge closer financial ties. "We are saying that in some areas, like the common currency, like the supervision of the banks, like the common supervision of the budgets, we need this sharing of sovereignty," he added. This raised concerns, particularly by Germany, over sovereignty and banking supervision. The European Commission's president Jose Manuel Barroso says a federation of Europe is "unavoidable" if Europe's embattled common currency is to survive the financial crisis. " Barroso said he had "no doubts" about the determination of Greece -- at the center of the eurozone debt crisis -- to implement reform and retain its place in the common currency.
