The practice of Wall Street executives cashing out early when they take government jobs drew criticism during last year's confirmation hearings for the man who might be Weiss' new boss, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. Smallberg authored a report last year that found a number of major corporations financially reward employees who go through the revolving door. The disclosures are likely to add fuel to the fire being stoked by liberal Senate Democrats who are bucking President Barack Obama by opposing Weiss' nomination -- a charge led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. The financial services firm Lazard, where Weiss is the global head of investment banking, has agreed to pay him about $16 million in unvested income early and give him between $1 million and $5 million in deferred compensation, according to financial disclosure records he filed with the government ethics office. But to watchdogs like Smallberg these policies "show how the revolving door is literally written into the pay plans of big companies that already have an advantage over public interest groups when it comes to lobbying and making their voices heard."
