Actress Elizabeth Peña died partly because of alcohol abuse, according to her death certificate, obtained by CNN. Peña is known for her recurring guest role as the mother of a character played by Sofia Vergara in the ABC sitcom "Modern Family." Peña was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to parents who were from Cuba, and she graduated from New York's High School of Performing Arts in 1977. In a report released earlier this year, the CDC says one in 10 deaths among adults between age 20 and 64 is due to excessive alcohol consumption. She also starred in films such as "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," "La Bamba," "Rush Hour," and "The Incredibles."
