We as a nation saw greater acts of heroism than we could have imagined: First responders from all over New York and all over the country came to ground zero to save lives, provide proper burial for lives that were lost and assist in the enormous effort to clean up and recover from that devastating attack on our nation. The legislation would establish the World Trade Center Health Program within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to provide permanent medical monitoring and treatment for WTC-related conditions to responders and community members. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act would finally provide monitoring and treatment for World Trade Center responders and community members who are suffering, and for those who traveled to ground zero from all across America. My favorite things in life are slowly being taken away from me. The program administrator will establish a nationwide network of providers so that eligible individuals who live outside of the New York area can reasonably access monitoring and treatment benefits where they live.
