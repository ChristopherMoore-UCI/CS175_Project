Such uncertainty raises questions about whether Republicans who have alleged the targeting order came from political higher-ups, even the White House, can win a legal battle to compel Lerner to provide testimony. "Without that, it may dead end with Ms. Lerner," Issa said of the probe. There is absolutely something wrong with that." Afterward, Issa told reporters that the purpose of the hearing was to see if Lerner would waive her Fifth Amendment rights and answer questions. " "It may well be that we have gotten to the bottom of it," Issa told reporters after former IRS manager Lois Lerner again refused to testify before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee by invoking her Fifth Amendment rights. How about a public shouting match at a committee hearing, with Republican Chairman Darrell Issa then cutting off the microphones while the top Democrat sought to make a statement. An aide to Issa said the committee chairman had yet to decide on whether to pursue contempt charges against Lerner.
