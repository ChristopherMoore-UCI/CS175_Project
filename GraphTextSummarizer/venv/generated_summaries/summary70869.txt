" Most people launch mobile boutiques as faster and cheaper alternatives to traditional brick and mortar retail, said Jeanine Romo, who launched Le Fashion Truck with business partner Stacey Steffe in Los Angeles in 2010. When she couldn't find a location that fit her budget, she went into business with Nashville fashion designer Kyah Hillis. Drawn to the opportunity to keep startup costs low, they decided to take a chance on mobile retail, which was catching on in Nashville after starting a few years earlier on the West Coast. Romo and Steffe started the West Coast Mobile Retail Association in 2011 to unite and support mobile boutique owners. Unlike its West Coast counterparts, who enjoy mobile retail-friendly weather most of the year, "The Trunk" had to hibernate for winter; it gets cold in Nashville, after all.
