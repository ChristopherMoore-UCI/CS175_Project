Terrorism experts say they have seen an increase in Greek acts of terror since the 2008 shooting death of a Greek teenager by police in Athens. That incident sparked angry riots and a wave of small bomb attacks on banks and Greek police. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou denounced the bombers Wednesday, accusing them of trying to destabilize his government's efforts to rescue the Greek economy. Greek officials said it was the 14th explosive device to be discovered originating from Greece in the past four days. Both suspects have so far refused to cooperate with authorities, Greek officials said.
