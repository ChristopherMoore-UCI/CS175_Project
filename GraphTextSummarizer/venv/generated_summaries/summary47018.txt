Ford was shot by Los Angeles police on August 11 -- two days after Brown was killed. But "there is nothing in the coroner's report that is inconsistent with the statements given to us by the officers," Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said. The Los Angeles County coroner's office released the autopsy Monday after the Los Angeles police removed its security hold on it. But like Brown, Ezell Ford was an unarmed black man shot and killed by police in August. "The officer drew his backup gun and reached over Mr. Ford's back and shot Mr. Ford in very close proximity -- possibly, probably the cause of the muzzle imprint that's mentioned in the coroner's report," Beck said.
