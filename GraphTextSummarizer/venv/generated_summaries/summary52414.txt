"I've made a lot of errors in my life, and that's something I'm going to have to live with," Woods said in Paramus, New Jersey, where he was practicing for The Barclays tournament, this weekend's first round of playoffs for the FedEx Cup. -- Golf superstar Tiger Woods said Wednesday that he wishes ex-wife Elin Nordegren "the best in everything" after their divorce, acknowledging that "My actions led us to this decision." Woods and Nordegren were officially divorced Monday, nine months after a Thanksgiving-weekend incident outside the couple's home in Florida. It set in motion the crash of the golfer's once tightly controlled image, ultimately leading to his admission that he had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs during his nearly six-year marriage. Under their settlement, Woods and Nordegren will share custody of their children.
