-- Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama is in Afghanistan on a multistop overseas trip for meetings with international leaders but with an eye on the U.S. presidential race back home. But the trip would also offer a more critical opportunity to gauge Obama's suitability for statesmanship, Oakley said: "People have been saying to me, 'Look, this guy has only been in national politics for three years, let alone international politics.' Sen. Barack Obama is expected to visit several world leaders over the next few weeks. " In addition to Merkel, Obama is slated to meet with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Conservative Party Leader David Cameron as well as French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Obama's trip, which includes visits to Iraq, Jordan, Israel, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, is intended to bolster his foreign policy credentials before U.S. voters.
