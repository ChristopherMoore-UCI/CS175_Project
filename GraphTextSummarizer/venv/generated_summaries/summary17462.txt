Federal Aviation Administration officials said Wednesday that pilots are allowed to have beverages in the cockpit, noting that many aircraft cockpits have cup holders. But they pointed to a rule prohibiting pilots from "any activity ... such as eating meals" that could distract them during a "critical phase of flight," typically meaning takeoffs and landings. The crew advised controllers they had communication problems and subsequently reported they were experiencing navigation problems, the officials said. At issue: Did United Airlines warn pilots not to hold beverages over the plane's electronics-laden console? But pilots contacted by CNN said the signal could have been sent if one of the pilots inadvertently hit the transponder knob while cleaning up the spill.
