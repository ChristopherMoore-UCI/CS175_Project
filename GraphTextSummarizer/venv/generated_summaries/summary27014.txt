Perhaps contract law should intervene to prevent the mega-corporation from sneaking or forcing contract terms upon an unsuspecting public. Capital One was quick to release a statement saying that it does not visit cardholders, nor does it send debt collectors to homes or offices. Historically, contracts have been paper,  detailed in a reasonable number of pages. Modern contract law is on a collision course with technology. Under the act, debt collectors are prohibited from making repeated phone calls, calling before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., or even calling at times the collector should have known are inconvenient.
