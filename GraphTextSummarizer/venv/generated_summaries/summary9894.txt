Creative proposal earns kudos from Bruno Mars But even with that intention, there are moments when Mars' own work catches him off guard. When GQ magazine, which hosts Mars on the cover of its April "Style Bible" issue, asked the singer why he was grinning upon his arrest, Mars couldn't quite say. I was really drunk," Mars recalled to GQ. Mars just notched his first No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with his 2012 album, "Unorthodox Jukebox" - not an easy task, he said. Instead of doing the stoic face of someone in trouble with the law, Mars smiled like he was at the Grammy Awards.
