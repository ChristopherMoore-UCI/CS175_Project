Last week Boyle, who is known by her fanbase as SuBo, set a new record in the U.S. for the most albums sold by any artist in a single week, with the largest ever sales debut for a female artist. On the program, Jones is seen stepping onto the stage in impressively high heels, arm-in-arm with the local dance school instructor, Nico. From there, the routine becomes even more physical and ends when Nico flips Jones upside down and over his shoulder, drawing a standing ovation from the judges and the crowd. Jones, who is originally from Stourbridge in the West Midlands, England, appeared on stage in front of a studio audience with a partner 40 years her junior. Jones' triumphant confounding of expectations echoes that of "Britain's Got Talent" winner Susan Boyle who soared to international stardom with her unexpectedly tuneful rendition of "I Dreamed a Dream."
