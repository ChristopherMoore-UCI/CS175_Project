-- A Flock of Seagulls' friends and fans are watching Craigslist, eBay and pawn shops for band leader Mike Score's stolen amps and instruments. "The word, though, is out and we have lots of other band members scouring eBay and Craigslist for signs of the equipment," Score said. A reconstituted version of the 1980s English New Wave band has been playing gigs with co-founder Score as the only original member. While the singer's signature floppy hair was lost years ago, Score's keyboards, guitars, drums, mics and clothing disappeared last weekend when a thief took the band's van from in front of a hotel in Downey, California, Score said. While equipment is replaceable, Score is especially anxious about a hard drive that contained songs for his upcoming solo album.
