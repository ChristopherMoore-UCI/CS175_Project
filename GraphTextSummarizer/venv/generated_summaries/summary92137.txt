A Somali Islamist militant movement on Monday claimed responsibility for the trio of bombings. He also said that the United States has diplomatic security agents on the ground in Uganda, along with a small number of FBI agents. "I think the FBI is going to send a significant team... that will depart the United States this afternoon for Uganda at the request of Uganda authorities to assist in the investigation," Crowley said. "We are behind the attack because we are at war with them," Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamoud Rage told reporters at a news conference in Mogadishu, Somalia. He said Uganda is no stranger to bombings -- "for decades, we have been fighting."
