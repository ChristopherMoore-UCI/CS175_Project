The funds will go to military personnel and veterans who were harmed by the loss of personal data, either through emotional distress or through costs incurred in monitoring credit records. The names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers of about 26.5 million active duty troops and veterans were on the laptop and external drive, which disappeared while in the custody of a Veterans Affairs data analyst in 2006. We want to assure veterans there is no evidence that the information involved in this incident was used to harm a single veteran." -- The Department of Veterans Affairs has agreed to pay $20 million to current and former military personnel to settle a class action lawsuit on behalf of the men and women whose personal data was on a laptop computer stolen during a burglary. The settlement, announced in U.S. District Court in Washington, was reached "in the interests of avoiding the expense, delay, and inconvenience of further litigation of the issues raised in the class complaints," the agreement says.
