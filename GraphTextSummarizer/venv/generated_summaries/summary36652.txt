Nearly 4 million of those calls were made to the city's emergency call centers in 2010, according to a recent Winbourne Consulting report, commissioned by the city after a massive blizzard delayed first responders and left Mayor Michael Bloomberg open to criticism. The consulting firm recommended implementing a citywide information campaign to alert the public of the issue and to streamline systems between the police and fire departments, among other recommendations. But a new study found a staggering number of those apparently accidental calls in New York City are made to emergency responders, jamming up 911 lines in a city that has prided itself on its ability to respond in a crisis. Authorities determined that they were likely accidental and say unnecessary communications add an increased burden on emergency response systems. That's more than one-third of some 11 million emergency calls made in New York each year, the study found, which was released Friday.
