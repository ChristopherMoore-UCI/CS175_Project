The band has a treasure trove of outright classics, and they performed what felt like all of them during their Sunday afternoon set. Across the vicinity, it seemed like every single attendee -- from festivalgoers to vendors and event staffers -- was singing along to the rousing, undeniable anthem with the same life-affirming gusto as fun.'s lead singer, Nate Ruess. Bon Iver's music is well-matched for a mellow Sunday afternoon, and the band delivered a main stage set that was just relaxed enough while still managing to capture the audience. Taken together with the afternoon's balmy weather and the day-in-the-park vibe of festivalgoers knocking around beach balls and splaying out on towels, the group's sublime set was just the thing for a lazy, hungover Sunday. "Every time we play here we get to play with people we admire," said guitarist Trey Anastasio, referencing the band's only other proper appearance at Bonnaroo in 2009, when they brought out Bruce Springsteen.
