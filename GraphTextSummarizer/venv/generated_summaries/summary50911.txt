Watch Marc Davis at the track Â» Davis formed his own two-car team to compete in this year's Nationwide Series, with his first entry set for Bristol, Tennessee, on March 21. " Davis plans to compete in a number of Nationwide Series races before moving on to the Sprint Cup Series. Several NASCAR teams have scaled back on their budgets, and Davis feels that it actually levels the playing field a bit. "I want to progress through the Nationwide Series and enter the Sprint Cup Series and win championships and hopefully be a full-time owner years down the road, so I think everything's going in the right direction," Davis said. Started out when I was 6 years old," said Davis, who is set to race this month as NASCAR's only current African-American driver/owner.
