In closing arguments, Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas told jurors that Ramos bore responsibility for Thomas's death because he issued a threat to the uncooperative homeless man. Former officer Manuel Ramos was charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter. The surveillance camera footage shows Thomas being beaten, clubbed and stunned with a Taser by police. Ramos can be seen on the surveillance video putting on gloves and shaking his fist in Thomas' face. A second former Fullerton officer, Jay Cicinelli, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force.
