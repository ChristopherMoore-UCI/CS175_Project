-- A man accused of planning to attack Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall during their week-long trip to New Zealand was released on bail Tuesday. The 74-year old man, a known anti-Royalist, was arrested in Auckland on Monday at one of the venues Charles and Camilla were due to visit during their tour, according to a statement from the New Zealand Police. The royals are on a two-week tour of Australia and New Zealand as part of celebrations to celebrate Queen Elizabeth II's 60-year reign. Bracanov had planned to throw a bucket of horse manure at Prince Charles, the New Zealand Herald reported. Sam Bracanov pleaded not guilty at a hearing at the Auckland District Court and was ordered to re-appear on November 27, said Brian Reid, the court's criminal case flow manager.
