This is nonsense, of course, but you have to give Cruz points for trying to conflate the unpopular Obamacare -- which, by the way is so loathed that it has exceeded its goal and has signed up 7.3 million people for health insurance -- with net neutrality. On Friday, "Funny or Die," the comedy website co-created by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, released a video titled "Porn stars explain net neutrality." Yes, I know some political pundits will tell you that these types of comedy videos only reach young people and younger people tend not to vote. " Cruz responded, via Twitter, that "net neutrality is Obamacare for the Internet." Although on the other hand, I'm surprised Cruz didn't claim that net neutrality is something supported by ISIS.
