They immediately sparked speculation by Democrats that the action amounted to political retaliation against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. That caused days of massive traffic jams in Fort Lee, where the Democratic mayor had declined to endorse Christie. Critics call him a bully -- an allegation Christie denied in his news conference Thursday, but one Gergen said the Fort Lee scandal reinforces. Back in September, two months before Christie's re-election, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey closed two of the three lanes that lead to the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, across the Hudson from Manhattan. Then came Wednesday's revelation that a top Christie aide had e-mailed Wildstein before the closures, telling him, "Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."
