A year on, Arsenal once again walked into the cauldron facing a two-goal deficit against a Bayern team 20 points clear at the top of the Bundesliga and determined to become the first club to successfully defend the Champions League title. In the night's other game, Atletico Madrid sealed its place in the quarterfinals for the first time in 17 years following a 5-1 aggregate victory over seven-time champion AC Milan. Arsenal went out, Bayern went through -- same story, different season. On that occasion, written off by every football expert on the planet, it produced one of its finest performances of recent times to win 2-0 only to exit the competition on away goals. Lukas Podolski, once of Bayern, chased down Philipp Lahm and after the defender stumbled under pressure, the Arsenal forward took possession and rifled the ball past Manuel Neuer.
