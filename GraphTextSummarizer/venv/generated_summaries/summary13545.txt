-- Former NFL star Darren Sharper has been fired by the NFL Network, the channel's vice president of communications told CNN. The Orleans Parish district attorney's office in Louisiana said Sharper, 38, and Erik Nunez, 26, each face two counts of aggravated rape. Sharper had been suspended without pay after being accused of rape. Sharper is wanted in New Orleans in connection with the alleged rapes of two women. If convicted, the two men face a possible sentence of life in prison without parole.
