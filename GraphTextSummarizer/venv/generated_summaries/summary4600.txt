"I realize not everything in this world is an instrument of oppression," wrote New Zealand journalist Lynda Brendish. The post attracted a massive online backlash from Lorde's fans and compatriots as well as other writers, with many claiming that Bayetti Flores, by interpreting the song through the prism of American race relations, was guilty of the kind of cultural arrogance she was attributing to the singer. " Vice.com writer Dave Schilling said Bayetti Flores' reading of the song "couldn't be more simplistic" and asked: "Why should anyone be surprised that the proliferation of pop songs about conspicuous consumption would get tiresome eventually?" A commenter on feministing.com, Amelia Harris, called the post "a dreadfully done piece of deconstruction." In a post on the prominent feminist blog feministing.com, writer Veronica Bayetti Flores took issue with the song's lyrics, in which Yelich-O'Connor sings that "every song" is about gold teeth and Maybach luxury cars -- both fixtures of hip-hop music videos -- before concluding "we don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams. She took exception to how the song directs "a critique of excessive consumption to a genre both created and currently dominated by Black Americans, particularly when the vast majority of excess consumption is done by white people - not to mention the fact that Black people bear the brunt of the ill effects of wealth inequality, both in this country and globally," Bayetti Flores said.
