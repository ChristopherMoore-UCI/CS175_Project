Antivirus software has been adjusted to recognize the malware, but Symantec warns on its blog: "As always, be aware of any unsolicited e-mails containing attachments, which might take advantage of current events like the recent election result in Russia." The spam e-mails began circulating sometime around March 5, according to an entry Wednesday on Symantec's official blog. These messages average 500 KB in size -- 50 times the usual size of junk e-mails. -- A computer virus campaign is targeting opponents of Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin, according to anti-virus software maker Symantec. The body of the e-mail pushes the recipient to open an attachment, purporting that it contains need-to-know information.
