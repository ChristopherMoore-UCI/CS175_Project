A lawsuit filed Tuesday by the two residents charges the area's main electricity providers -- Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) and its partner National Grid -- committed "gross negligence, breach of contract, and fraud," according to attorney Ken Mollins, who is representing the plaintiffs. Long Island resident Mitch Gerson also believes LIPA failed to appropriately communicate with customers. " CNN Legal Analyst Paul Callan who has experience in class-action lawsuits, does not believe this will be an easy win for Long Island residents because they will have to prove that the utility companies were negligent in planning for the storm. Although the suit, which does not seeks specific damages but calls on the court to award "a sum to be determined at trial," was filed by two individuals, Mollins entered the claim as a class-action, which would allow other residents to join as plaintiffs. " In the midst of heavy criticism for the company, the chief operating officer of Long Island Power Authority, Mike Hervey, announced his resignation on Tuesday, effective at the end of 2012, according to a statement from LIPA.
