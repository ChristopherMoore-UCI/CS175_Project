" His victory in the Tour Championship is worth $1.4m in prize money with a further $10m bonus for the FedEx Cup triumph, relegating Furyk to second place with McIlroy in third. -- Billy Horschel is $11.4m richer after getting the better of world number one Rory McIlroy and fellow American Jim Furyk to win the Tour Championship Sunday and clinch the FedEx Cup. Horschel's remarkable late season form has lifted him into golfing superstar status, but it has come too late to earn him a place in the United States team for Ryder Cup against Europe later this month. Furyk bogeyed the closing par-three 18th to slip back to a tie for second with McIlroy, but there was no doubt about the winner, who closed with a solid 68 for 11-under 269. His three-shot victory at East Lake has capped a remarkable three weeks for the 27-year-old, who won the preceding BMW Championship after finishing second in the Deutsche Bank Championship.
