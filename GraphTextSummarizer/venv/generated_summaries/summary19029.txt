"What the [U.S. Supreme Court] made clear in 'Caperton' was that judges are different, that campaign donations need to be thought of in a different way when those donations are going to fund a judicial campaign," Kourlis said. "The amount of money poured into judicial campaigns has skyrocketed, intensifying the need to re-examine how we choose judges in America. Many states that choose judges by merit also have accountability systems that include independent performance evaluations and retention votes. Twenty-one states have some sort of contested system for top judges. "Studies show that roughly 70 percent of the public believe judges are influenced by campaign contributions, and more than one quarter of judges agree," O'Connor said in an exclusive interview with CNN.
