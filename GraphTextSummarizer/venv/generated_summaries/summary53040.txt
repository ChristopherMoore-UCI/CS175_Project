Yahoo's mission creep is a useful case study in why web companies like Google and Facebook continue to grow their functionality and why startups keep selling to the seemingly bloated leviathans, even though tech advances have made it cheaper and easier than ever for software companies and web services to go it alone, and despite the fact that consumers are migrating to highly specialized mobile apps. So why is Yahoo in the midst of purposely transforming itself into an Ã¼ber portal even as computer users are migrating to super-focused mobile apps and even when its leader made her name touting simplicity and minimalism? It has to cobble together information about you from various sources, like information you've attached to your Flickr photo account, in your Yahoo Mail signup, within your Yahoo Finance portfolio tracker, via your Yahoo search history, and so on. -- Since Marissa Mayer took over as CEO of Yahoo last year, there's been a lot of talk about how the famously detail-oriented ex-Googler will "refocus" the company. The way of the future was going to be focused sites, like Google.com, whose ultra-bare homepage was about nothing but search (and whose guardian angel of minimalism was reportedly named Marissa Mayer).
