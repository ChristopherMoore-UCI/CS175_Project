Earlier, England won the toss and elected to bat and got off to a steady start as Ian Bell joined captain Andrew Strauss at the top of the order. New Zealand shock South Africa Matt Prior tried to swing the willow at the death but could only muster one boundary in the final over -- England only scored 12 fours in the entire innings -- to give England a score of 229, and an outside chance of victory. I thought if we took early wickets we'd be in with a chance but fair play to Sri Lanka, the opening batsmen were outstanding," Strauss said. Strauss bowled by Dilshan for five with the score on 29, while Bell fell two runs later for 25, caught by Thilan Samaraweera off the bowling of Angelo Mathews. Afterwards, England captain, Andrew Strauss conceded his team's total was always going to be difficult to defend.
