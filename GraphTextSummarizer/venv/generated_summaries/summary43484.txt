According to California's official voter guide, the health groups behind Prop. 29 said it would "save lives, stop kids from smoking, and fund cancer research," while those opposed said the initiative "doesn't require revenue be spent in California to create jobs or fund schools. "The money is going to be invested in cancer research here in California and on tobacco prevention and cessation programs to protect kids and reduce smoking here in California. John Seffrin, CEO of the American Cancer Society, said if the bill passed, "It would make California the second-largest funder of cancer research after the (National Cancer Institute) in the entire country." "What we're seeing in the state of California is a lot of frustration on the part of our citizenry that it's just another tax," said Dr. Marcy Zwelling, a general practitioner. The opposition in California was fueled by a huge influx of cash from big tobacco companies.
