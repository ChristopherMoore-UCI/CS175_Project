This year, we have a real horse race with no clear leader -- polls say establishment candidate Mitt Romney is in pole position, followed closely by libertarian Ron Paul and the surging social conservative Rick Santorum. If the deck is shuffled just right, with a number of other candidates in the mid-teens, Romney can win Iowa in this crowded conservative field. Newt Gingrich's once commanding lead has been shrunk by more than $2 million in negative ads, most from a Romney-affiliated PAC. The countdown to the Iowa caucus can now be measured in hours, instead of weeks or months. The Iowa caucuses are low-turnout, high-intensity elections.
