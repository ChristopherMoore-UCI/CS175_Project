On Wednesday night, I hosted a town hall-style debate on guns in America, talking to lawmakers, mass shooting survivors, lawyers, gun lobbyists -- anyone, basically, who has a strong opinion about what I consider to be the single biggest issue facing America today. Some 12,000 people are murdered in the United States with guns every year, compared with just 35 in Britain, where there are strong gun laws. Analysis: Guns and the law Sandy Hook should, and must, be a tipping point for real action to bring this number down. And background checks on anyone buying guns in America should be comprehensive and stringently enforced. Since I joined CNN two years ago, there have been a series of gun-related tragedies, including the attack on U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and the Aurora, Colorado, movie theater massacre.
