"As Taco Bell has stated before, the allegations in the lawsuit and in public statements about Taco Bell's seasoned beef, food quality and advertising were absolutely wrong," the company said in a statement. Attorneys have dropped a lawsuit alleging that Taco Bell's beef was mostly not beef, both sides in the legal battle said. In a full-page ad in major newspapers, Taco Bell proclaimed, "Thank you for suing us." "Our reputation's been falsely tarnished," Greg Creed, Taco Bell's president, said in January. Taco Bell, however, said the company "is not making any changes to its products or advertising." The plaintiffs said they wanted the fast-food restaurant to stop referring to its products as beef.
