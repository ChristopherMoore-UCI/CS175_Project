Discount carriers such as MetroPCS and third-party retailers such as Wal-Mart generally don't yet offer feature phones pre-installed with better proxy browsers. Back in March 2010, the Nielsen Company proclaimed that smartphones would overtake feature phones by 2011. Most feature phones come with some kind of Web browser, and users can opt to pay a little extra for a data plan that allows them to access the mobile Internet. At some point, a majority of U.S. mobile users will indeed own smartphones. Specifically, they predicted that by the end of Q3 2011 (about a month from now), most U.S. mobile users would own smartphones.
