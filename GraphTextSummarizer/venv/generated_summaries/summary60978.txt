Elsewhere, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce says he wants to sign defender Sol Campbell from Arsenal, and Portsmouth manager Steve Cotterill has revealed that Nigeria striker John Utaka is set to leave the club following their relegation to the Championship. -- English Premier League side Liverpool are waiting to find out the extent of the injury suffered by Spain striker Fernando Torres during the closing stages of the World Cup final. Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Nemanja Vidic have all been left at home to recover from the World Cup, while Gary Neville, Michael Owen, Antonio Valencia, Anderson and Owen Hargreaves are all recovering from injuries. The 26-year-old, a late substitute in Spain's 1-0 extra-time victory over the Netherlands, pulled up as he chased a long ball, before collapsing to the ground and thumping his fist on the ground. He has been linked with a big-money move away from the Reds, who slumped to a disappointing seventh-place finish last season.
