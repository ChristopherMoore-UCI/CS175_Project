" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said it is unlikely investigators will be able to find a genetic clue for what motivated Lanza, who fatally shot 26 people, including 20 children, in the attack on Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14. -- Geneticists have begun studying the DNA of Connecticut gunman Adam Lanza, a spokeswoman for the University of Connecticut Health Center said Thursday. Although there are genetic components to many mental illnesses, there are hundreds, perhaps thousands, of genes involved. Newtown: No more gifts, please "There's no clear-cut sort of ... genes identified with the types of illnesses, mental illnesses, that may cause this sort of behavior," says Gupta. The geneticists were asked to join the investigation by the state medical examiner's office, spokeswoman Carolyn Pennington told CNN.
