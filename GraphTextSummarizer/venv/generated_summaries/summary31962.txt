Rice told Karzai that delaying the deal -- which would allow for the presence of a limited number of U.S. troops beyond next year -- until after Afghanistan's 2014 elections "is not viable," the White House said. "These negotiations between Afghanistan and the United States are being delayed not because of the content of the Bilateral Security Agreement," Abdullah said, "but primarily because of the personal feelings or personal interests of President Karzai. His last-minute decision to delay signing the pact was both classic Karzai -- a tricky negotiator to the last -- and a breakaway move that provides political cover for any U.S. officials who prefer the so-called zero option of leaving no U.S. troops in Afghanistan. "If U.S. military forces conduct military operations on Afghan homes even one more time, then there will be no BSA and we won't sign it," Karzai said on Sunday. Karzai had said he would follow their recommendation under one condition -- that U.S. forces do not conduct house raids.
