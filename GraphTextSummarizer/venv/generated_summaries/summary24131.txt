While cell phone ownership overall has risen sharply among seniors (69% now have a cell phone, up from 57% a year ago), Pew notes that just 10% of U.S. seniors own a smartphone. Looked at differently, those numbers mean that nearly two-thirds of seniors still either don't go online at all or don't do so on most days. For example, transit is a crucial concern for many seniors -- especially those on a limited income, or who have visual or mobility impairments. But when seniors have to get to a location that's off their regular transit routes, they can face enormous challenges in simply figuring out whether they can get to that destination via transit. This means a substantial number of seniors access the Internet only from shared or public computers (such as at libraries, Internet cafes or senior centers), or by bringing a laptop to a location with open Wi-Fi.
