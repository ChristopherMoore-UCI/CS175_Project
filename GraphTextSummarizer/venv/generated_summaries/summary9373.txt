-- First lady Michelle Obama stepped into the fashion world on Wednesday by helping those pursuing fashion careers have face time with some high-profile fashion icons. The students represented more than a dozen schools from the East Coast and participated in five workshops, where they heard from dozens of experts on the topics of construction in fashion, entrepreneurship, and fashion journalism. They also heard from a panel that included several top designers like von Furstenberg, Jenna Lyons of J. Crew, and Wu, all whose creations have been worn by Obama. "I know that many of you are hoping to one day pursue a career in fashion, and that's why we invited you here today, because we want you to really understand what it's going to take to be successful," Obama said. More than 150 students attended the first White House Fashion Education Workshop with some of the nation's most famous designers and magazine editors, such as Anna Wintour of Vogue Magazine, Jason Wu, Diane von Furstenberg and Narciso Rodriguez.
