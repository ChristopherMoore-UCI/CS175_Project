In the last months local authorities in various parts of Colombia have reported increased FARC activities, targeting mainly civilians and local communities. -- Colombian Minister of Defense Rodrigo Rivera resigned Wednesday amid growing concern in the country over increased activity by the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Rivera's departure marks the first resignation of a cabinet minister in the 13 months that Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has been in office. While severely weakened in recent years, the leftist guerrilla group has continued to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces in the South American nation. The FARC has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s.
