..." "It was an absolute surprise," said David Argueta, vice president of operations at Hillcrest. On April 18, Dr. Christopher Kabrhel had pizza delivered to the emergency department of Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco, Texas, which was treating patients from the deadly explosion the day before that damaged homes in a five-block area in nearby West. She told Arnold about the pizzas that had been sent from the Mass General emergency department team to Hillcrest. The next day Hillcrest received a lithograph of Mass General, which is now displayed in the administrative area of the emergency department. A lot of nurses at Hillcrest were personally affected by the explosion and had relatives who were injured or lost their homes, so gestures such as this gift "really show the human spirit," Argueta said.
