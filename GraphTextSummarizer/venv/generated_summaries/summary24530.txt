"China and India are both emerging countries, we are not rivals but cooperation partners," said Liu Weimin, China's foreign ministry spokesman, on Thursday. China downplayed India's successful missile launch this week, saying that the two sides are not rivals but cooperating partners. "This launch has given a message to the entire world that India has the capability to design, develop, build and manufacture missiles of this class, and we are today a missile power," VK Saraswat, chief of the Defence Research and Development Organisation, told India's Economic Times. But China's state-backed Global Times newspaper reported in an editorial that, "India shouldn't overestimate its strength. " "India should be clear that China's nuclear power is stronger and more reliable," the editorial said.
