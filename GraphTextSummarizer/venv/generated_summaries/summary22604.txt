Watch President Bush talk about his regrets Â» Bush was also criticized in 2003 for his answer addressing insurgents in Iraq. " Bush expressed regret that Republican presidential nominee John McCain did not win the presidency but called the election of Obama "good for our country." "The election of Barack Obama is an historic moment for our country. It is good for our country that people have hope in the system and feel vested in the future and President-elect Obama has a great opportunity," Bush said. -- As his presidency nears its end, a reflective President Bush suggested Tuesday that he regrets some of his more blunt statements on the war on terrorism over the last eight years and said he wishes he had not spoken in front of a "Mission Accomplished" banner only a month after U.S. troops in Iraq were deployed. " In the wide-ranging interview, the president also discussed his Monday meeting with President-elect Barack Obama and said he consulted former President Clinton before his meeting with the future commander in chief.
