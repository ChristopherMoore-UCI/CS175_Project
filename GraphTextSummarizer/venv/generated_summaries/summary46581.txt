There is no single answer to preventing land grabs but at the heart of any solution is the need to improve land rights. In the worst cases, local communities and farmers have been evicted from land they long regarded as their own. While bad investors can get away with riding roughshod over the rights of smallholders and communities, the present free-for-all makes it difficult for good investors who want to farm in a way which is beneficial to local people and the environment from accessing land. With smallholder farmers still producing 80% of the food and supporting 65% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, they are central to any successful sustainable solution. It is no coincidence that many of the most questionable acquisitions have taken place in countries with the weakest system of land rights in place.
