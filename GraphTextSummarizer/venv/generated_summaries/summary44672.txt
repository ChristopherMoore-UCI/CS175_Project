Stine isn't the first young-adult author to venture into adult fiction. Beloved "Sweet Valley" creator Francine Pascal has also moved into the adult world with her characters; Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield grew up in "Sweet Valley Confidential" and started their 30s in this summer's novella e-series "The Sweet Life. " Curiosity seems to have outweighed outrage for the millions of Sweet Valley readers. Is this what happens when you grow up?" Pascal's "Sweet Valley Confidential" ended up on best-seller lists as well, but fans were outraged at the experiences Pascal crafted for her once-innocent teen characters. Pascal's idea for an adult novel came in a similar way to Stine's.
