Getting there takes time and, in my case, a lot of prayer and a lot of research. I have been struggling for weeks with how to tell my co-workers and viewers that I have breast cancer and have chosen to have a double mastectomy. For years, I've had biopsies and two years ago, prior to starting at CNN, I had a lumpectomy to remove abnormal tissue that doctors thought was cancer. I was diagnosed with breast cancer five weeks ago, on April 9. Luckily, I have a very early form of breast cancer called DCIS.
