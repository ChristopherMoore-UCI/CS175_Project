According to the country's Public Ministry, only five cases relating to journalist killings are being processed, and no one has been convicted. "This is serious, especially the degree of impunity ... in these cases of death and threats against journalists and the media. But according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Lobo's government has minimized crimes against journalists and has been slow in bringing the killers to justice. Danilo Izaguirre, who was Villatoro's companion at National Radio Honduras (HRN by its Spanish initials), said journalists will continue their work, despite the message the killers are sending. According to the media freedom organization, an atmosphere of violence and impunity has made Honduras one of the most dangerous countries for journalists. President Lobo, who took office in 2010, urged journalists not to be intimidated and said the government will continue to fight crime.
