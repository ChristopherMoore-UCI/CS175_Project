To sustain that level of training, sprinters need to eat around 5g of carbs per kg of body weight every day, whereas endurance athletes need at least 7g per kg. Because "strength-and-speed" athletes do less training than endurance athletes, they have to watch their weight. "In general, endurance athletes are better about getting a variety of carbs, just because they have to eat so many they get bored. For Jamaican sprint sensation Usain Bolt, that means consuming some 450g of carbs a day, whereas, while Ethiopian distance demon Haile Gebrselassie would need at least 380g. Despite doing less training, Bolt would have to eat more carbs simply because he weighs more. Stear says it's essential that athletes refuel between training sessions, otherwise they risk fatigue, which can weaken their immune system and make injury more likely.
