Photographs of him bare-chested with his arms around female students at an Oxford college party and urinating against a college fence have gone down badly in China, where his father, Bo Xilai, has been accused of corruption and stripped of his political post. "Many Chinese admire and support Bo Xilai, but few like Bo Guagua," the source said. While there has been speculation that Bo Guagua may seek asylum in the U.S. in the light of his parents' problems, the US agency that oversees asylum requests, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, "can neither confirm nor deny that someone has filed a request," according to spokesman Chris Bentley. -- With a father who is a toppled Communist leader and a mother accused of murder, the son, Bo Guagua, is now under scrutiny over reports of a lavish student lifestyle that have raised questions about where China's top cadres find their money. "He (Bo Guagua) had tried to explain himself, saying the pictures showed him attending school parties which encouraged students to socialize and let their hair down," the source said.
