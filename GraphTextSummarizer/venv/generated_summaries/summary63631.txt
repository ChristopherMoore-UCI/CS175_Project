It will be a long, hard slog for Huckabee, a second-tier candidate, who — if he enters the race — is likely to find himself battling former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas for the votes of evangelical Christians. In the process of making the press rounds for his new book, "God, Guns, Grits and Gravy," Huckabee has already said a few things — about the first family and pop star Beyonce Knowles — that are hostile, hurtful, hateful and harmful. Second, if you want to come across to the rest of America as a serious candidate, try talking about serious things and avoid these Dan Quayle-Murphy Brown moments where you try to score points off something in popular culture. Concerning the Obamas, Huckabee is shocked that the President and first lady Michelle Obama allow their daughters, Malia and Sasha, to be part of Beyonce's fan base. The Republican sees a conflict between how conscientious the Obamas are about most things concerning their daughters, and this one area where the girls have the freedom to idolize one of their favorite entertainers.
