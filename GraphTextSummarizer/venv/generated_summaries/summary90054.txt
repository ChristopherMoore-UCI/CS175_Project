Italian Interior Minister Anna Maria Cancellieri said in a statement that she was "particularly glad that the operation was conducted thanks to the information from our intelligence office and foreign intelligence." Italian police said they had arrested a 20-year-old Moroccan-born man early Thursday in northern Italy on suspicion of planning an attack on a synagogue in Milan. Police found detailed plans of the synagogue on Via della Guastella in Milan on Mohamed's computer as well as information on the security measures at the site, he said. Galzerano said the suspect had allegedly createdsecret discussion groups on social networks such as Facebook in which he discussed making explosive devices. Mohamed's activities had led police to place him under 24-hour surveillance, he said.
