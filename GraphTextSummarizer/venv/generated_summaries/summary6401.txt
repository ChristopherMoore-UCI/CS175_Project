The bruised body of Sylvie Cachay, 33, was discovered at the Soho House club and hotel on December 9, police said. According to court documents, police said the only person in the hotel room with Cachay, besides Brooks, was a hotel employee who delivered ice and was inside for about one minute. A guest staying on a lower floor of the hotel reported to hotel management that water was leaking through the ceiling of that guest's room, according to court documents. Nicholas Brooks, son of "You Light Up My Life" composer Joseph Brooks, pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday afternoon to one charge of second-degree murder, and is next expected in court February 8, according to Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman Joan Vollero. "Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke," said publicist Kate Godici.
