Zanuck was born December 13, 1934, to Darryl F. Zanuck and actress Virginia Fox, said publicists Jeff Sanderson and Dan Barry. Earlier, Zanuck and his wife, Lili Fini Zanuck, won an Oscar as producers of "Driving Miss Daisy," which was named Best Picture of 1989, his representatives said. The summer of "Jaws" Zanuck is the only second-generation recipient of the award, which also was given to his father, Darryl F. Zanuck. At age 28, Zanuck rose to president in charge of production of 20th Century Fox and was then the youngest corporate head in Hollywood, his publicists said. The two men formed the Zanuck/Brown Co. in 1971 and produced "Jaws," a triple-Oscar winner and Best Picture nominee, as well as "Jaws II," "The Sugarland Express," "The Sting," "The Verdict," "Cocoon" and its sequel "Cocoon: The Return."
