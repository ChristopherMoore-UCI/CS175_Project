McTear is facing additional charges of burglary with battery, felony battery, aggravated child abuse and kidnapping, the sheriff's department said. The photographer, WTVT's Jason Bird, said he stopped when he spotted something by the roadside "It had to be a baby doll but it was too big to be a doll," Bird told CNN affiliate WFTS in Tampa. Video on CNN affiliate WFLA TV showed McTear being led out of a Tampa police squad car after his arrest. Police say infant Emanuel Murray died after his mother's ex-boyfriend threw him from a car on a Florida interstate. " McTear is not related to the child, said sheriff's spokeswoman Debbie Carter.
