Prior administrations used similar discretion in vetting cases, Obama administration officials have said. The Obama administration has touted the use of "prosecutorial discretion" as "smart and effective immigration enforcement," saying it will allow undocumented aliens to stay in the United States in special cases. How can the Obama administration justify granting work authorization to illegal immigrants when so many American citizens don't have jobs?" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. The administration said the new policy gives immigration officials guidelines on which immigration cases to pursue, with the highest priority being on people who pose a danger to public safety or national security, or who are egregious immigration law violators. Immigration officials who make the decisions must consider a long list of factors, such as whether the undocumented immigrant served in the U.S. military, has roots in the community or serves as care provider for a person in need.
