Fierce fighting occurred near the shrines in Karbala in August 2007 between Shiite rivals -- members of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's Mehdi Army Mehdi Army and security officers affiliated with the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq. The bombing of the Askariya Mosque, a Shiite shrine in the northern Iraqi city of Samarra in February 2006, sparked sectarian violence that led to thousands of deaths and caused people to flee their homes for other parts of Iraq and other countries. The battles spread to other Shiite communities in Iraq, and eventually died down and led to al-Sadr's call for a cessation of activities by the militia. Bomb attacks near other religious shrines in Iraq have happened several times in the past. -- Two bombings overnight near major shrines in the holy Shiite city of Karbala left at least three people dead and 15 others wounded, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said Thursday.
