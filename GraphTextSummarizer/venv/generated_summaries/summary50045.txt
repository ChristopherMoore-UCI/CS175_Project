These are not people steeped in Islam -- people for whom the religion has shaped their worldview over decades, people who were motivated by their immersion in the religion. The man who ran over the soldiers in Canada last week reportedly converted to Islam only a year ago. -- When the news flashed last week that a man had shot and killed a Canadian soldier in front of the National War Memorial in Canada, what most people were wondering -- but not saying out loud -- was, "Is it another radical Muslim?" They also need to make sure that Muslim countries and societies do not in any way condone extremism, anti-modern attitudes and intolerance towards other faiths. As was Zale Thompson, who attacked four police officers in Queens, New York, also last week.
