-- South Korea's Ji Dong-Won grabbed a dramatic injury-time winner as Sunderland stunned English Premier League leaders Manchester City 1-0 at the Stadium of Light Sunday. In Sunday's other game, Nigerian international Victor Anichebe came off the bench to score the only goal of the game in Everton's 1-0 win away to West Bromwich Albion. The upset result left City ahead of champions Manchester United on goal difference, having gone into the match hoping to open up a three-point lead after their neighbors were beaten 3-2 by Blackburn 24 hours earlier. Moments before City substitute Micah Richards had thumped the crossbar after Simon Mignolet parried a David Silva shot. "We missed a big opportunity today because we had a chance to go three points on Manchester United."
