George McGavin, a Research Associate at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History and The Department of Zoology of Oxford University told CNN: "It's hard to be sure exactly how many new species we have found, but it is more than 30. "To find new species of insects in this region isn't uncommon, but we found sixteen new frog species, one new bat species and at least three new fish, and this giant bloody rat -- the size of a cat. -- Scientists have discovered a new species of giant rat in a remote rainforest in Papua New Guinea. In 2007, a similar species of giant rat was found in the Foja Mountains in the Papua province of Indonesia in New Guinea Island. The team of scientists which made the new discovery included experts on bats, birds, mammals and reptiles found a number of new species. Next March, the team is traveling to Bhutan in search of more new species.
