Iglesias became available to join the show last week, having just finished his latest world tour where he partnered with former Idol judge Jennifer Lopez. If the current panel plan comes together it will give Idol a four-quadrant strategy, with judges representing pop, rap, country and Latin music (sorry rock-and-roll, but have you looked at the charts lately?). Longtime Idol judge Randy Jackson is set to move to a mentor role. EW.com reported last week that rapper Nicki Minaj and Aussie country artist Keith Urban were poised to join pop diva Mariah Carey on the show, and that Iglesias (or, if he passes, Adam Lambert) could fill a fourth spot. Fox and producers have only confirmed Carey at this point and have no comment on any of the other names or the number of judges.
