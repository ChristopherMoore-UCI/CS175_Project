-- A man who paraded his cloaked 16-year-old nephew around a busy Phoenix intersection with a fake rocket-propelled grenade launcher was found guilty Monday on endangerment and terrorism hoax charges. " When asked if he thought 911 callers were actually scared, the attorney responded, "If someone comes to your front door with a samurai sword on Halloween, you would still be scared even though it is Halloween." Michael David Turley, 40, posted a video on YouTube last year showing the teen walking around the streets covered in a sheet and pointing the fake weapon at cars. In the video, a man says he and an actor are trying to test how police would respond to such a scene at a busy intersection. Turley's attorney, Brad Rideout, said the ordeal stemmed from some simple horseplay.
