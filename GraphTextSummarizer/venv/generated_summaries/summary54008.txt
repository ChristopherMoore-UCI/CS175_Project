Previous attempts were thwarted by dehydration, ocean currents and excruciating jellyfish stings to her tongue. Were Nyad to swim the 103 miles from Havana to the Florida Keys, she would be the first person to do so without the benefits of a shark cage, flippers or wet suit. "There's the fine line between seeing that things are bigger than you and letting your ego go," Nyad said at a news conference in Havana Friday. Cuban authorities said that after her latest attempt was announced in state media, they received a barrage of suggestions from across the island on how she could ward off the stinging jellyfish that ended previous attempts. The Key West, Florida, resident says she feels a special bond with Cubans and hopes her repeated efforts to swim between the two countries will help improve the still-tense relations between Havana and Washington.
