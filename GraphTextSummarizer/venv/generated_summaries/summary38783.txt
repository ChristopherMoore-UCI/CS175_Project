Scholar Danah Boyd writes about the importance of nuance in addressing online bullying in her book "It's Complicated: The Social Lives of Networked Teens. Having a dialogue with kids around acceptable online behavior can begin by talking about events in the news, such as #iamJada, or at school. It's about knowing what to say and do when your kid is at risk, monitoring (without spying), and knowing the difference between bullying and behavior that is 'kids being kids.' Social media users are adopting the #IamJada hashtag and posting photos of themselves with a fist raised in solidarity. Even as public support for Jada is swelling, it's clear that online abuse isn't going away anytime soon.
