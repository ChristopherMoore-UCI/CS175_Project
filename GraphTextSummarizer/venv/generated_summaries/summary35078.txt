The company that owns "American Idol" is restructuring in light of the show's ratings drop and developing projects for its other assets, including the creative exploitation of Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali, the New York Times reports. Core is also in talks with Sony about a potential duets album, which would pair contemporary singers with Presley in much the same way that past duets albums have done with Frank Sinatra. "It's very viable, but it definitely needs to be refreshed and it will be." Graboff says the company will reteam with original "Idol" creator Simon Fuller to help make the changes, which include a likely overhaul of "Idol's" voting system. The drop coincides with the rise of newer singing competitions, like NBC's "The Voice" and Fox's "The X Factor." "'Idol' is still the gold standard," Core's new president Marc Graboff told the Times. It's possible that the judges panel (currently Steven Tyler, Jennifer Lopez and Randy Jackson) will see a change, too, said Graboff -- but that decision falls under the purview of Fox, which broadcasts "Idol."
