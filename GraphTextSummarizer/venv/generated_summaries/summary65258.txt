A study at the Essen University's women's clinic, Germany, concluded that MTUs found more and smaller tumors than doctors in 450 cases. Using these strips blind women are trained to become Medical Tactile Examiners (MTUs) because they are more able to detect smaller lumps than sighted doctors. The blind assistants use tape strips with braille coordinates to accurately locate cancerous lumps The program, called "Discovering Hands," is the brainchild of German gynecologist Dr. Frank Hoffmann. Two years ago, he created Braille strips as a system of orientation, allowing the blind to carry out breast examinations. -- Blind women are being trained to use their sensitive touch to help detect breast cancer earlier and more precisely than doctors.
