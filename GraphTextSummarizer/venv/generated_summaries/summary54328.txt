African Union delegates join an international conference on Libya's future on Wednesday. Outside Africa, Campbell said, many countries and international groups have a favorable opinion of the African Union. "But remember, we're talking here about something like motherhood and apple pie -- in other words, everybody favors regional organizations, particularly regional organizations in Africa, that try to deal with peace and security questions," he said. "The general perception of the African Union is that it has been considerably more effective than its predecessor, particularly on peace and security questions," said John Campbell, the Ralph Bunche senior fellow for Africa policy studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. Downie agrees that the African Union has been more successful, but that's not saying much considering the Organization for African Unity "had a pretty awful reputation. The African Union was formed in 2002, replacing the Organization for African Unity, which had been in place since 1963.
