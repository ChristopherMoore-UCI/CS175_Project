A movie that takes three minutes to download on the current Galaxy S4 would take one minute on the new phone, Samsung told Reuters Shin said Samsung is in talks with carriers in other countries about the phone. As the high-end market tightens up, Apple, Samsung and other phone makers are eyeing developing countries, where interest in smartphones is still growing. Shin told Reuters the new model would be "slightly more expensive" than the current S4, which sells for $199 and up, depending on the carrier and which service plan the customer signs up for. The South Korean electronics company plans to release a quicker version of the Galaxy S4, says CEO J.K. Shin. The phones, which will be powered by a new Qualcomm processor, use what's being called LTE-advanced technology, which will reportedly deliver data at speeds up to twice those of current 4G LTE connections.
