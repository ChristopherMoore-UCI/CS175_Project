Also starring Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and Jeremy Irons as Alfred, "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" will open May 6, 2016. Although "Batman v Superman" is still in production, those present did get a taste of what's to come. For the character's big-screen debut in Zack Snyder's "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," the familiar red, blue and gold costume has been traded in for a bronzed ensemble with matching thigh-high boots. That criticism didn't stem the excitement at Comic-Con on Saturday when Affleck arrived at the "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" panel along with Gadot and Henry Cavill, who plays Superman. Gadot hasn't been the only "Batman v Superman" star to suffer critics.
