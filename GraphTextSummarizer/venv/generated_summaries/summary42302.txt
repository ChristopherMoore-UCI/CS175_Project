Chanel's president of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, said such exclusivity is the best way to ensure customers keep coming back for more. -- Shanghai may be a target for many luxury brands but Chanel, famous for its simple and elegant designs, is keeping its footprint on the city light. Pavlovsky said customers in China are "experts of the fashion world, they know everything, every detail and at the end of the day what they want is the same product that we are selling here in Paris or London. Its growth comes as consumer spending in Europe and the U.S. dwindles. But it has been careful not to overwhelm markets, choosing instead to focus on brand exclusivity.
