I have no statistics to back this up, but my guess is that Rin Tin Tin had more boy fans and Lassie more girl fans; after all, Lassie was female, supposedly, and the setting of her story was more domestic, including a mother, whereas Rin Tin Tin was definitely male, living in an all-male world. When Orlean told people she was planning to write a biography of Rin Tin Tin, the German shepherd portrayed in movies and on TV, even her friends were puzzled. Lassie was about love and nurture, Rin Tin Tin about loyalty and bravery. My dirty secret is that I did truly love Lassie -- but I feel I'm being unfaithful to Rin Tin Tin by confessing that. What's the biggest misconception people have about Rin Tin Tin?
