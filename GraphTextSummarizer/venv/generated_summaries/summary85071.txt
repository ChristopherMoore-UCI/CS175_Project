In early 2010, ATF agents working with Mexican counterparts attempted a sting operation to nab Kingery as he allegedly transported grenade parts across the border from the United States to Mexico. Mexican authorities and ATF technicians noticed a new fusing system in grenades allegedly tied to Kingery after they began turning up in late 2010 and early 2011, two sources close to the case say. "I want to ensure the public that at no time while under ATF surveillance did Jean Baptiste Kingery possess or transport live hand grenades," Forcelli said in a statement. Kingery was arrested in 2011 and is facing charges in Mexico for allegedly importing grenade hulls and other parts, and making them into improvised explosives sold to drug cartels. Mexican authorities have been finding grenade hulls allegedly tied to Kingery for years, sources close to the investigation say.
