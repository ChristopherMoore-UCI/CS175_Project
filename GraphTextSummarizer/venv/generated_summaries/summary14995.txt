Queen Elizabeth chose to commence her weekend of celebrations with a visit to Epsom Downs. Trainer's date with Epsom destiny? It continued the O'Briens' domination of the English flat racing season, having already captured the 1,000 Guineas with Homecoming Queen, the 2,000 Guineas with Camelot and the Oaks (for fillies) with Was at Epsom on Friday. Before a capacity crowd of more than 100,000 people, the 86-year-old and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, were driven on to the course as opera singer Katherine Jenkins sang the national anthem. With Camelot trained by Aiden O'Brien and ridden by his 19-year-old son Joseph, history was made on the weekend of Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.
