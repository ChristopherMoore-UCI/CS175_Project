World rich list shows emerging Asian power Liam Bailey, global head of residential research at Knight Frank noted "in the next decade we will see the biggest increase in ultra-wealthy individuals in cities such as Sao Paulo, Beijing, and Mumbai." Key Chinese cities such as Guangzhou and Shanghai have also seen a marked increase in property prices with Hong Kong real estate rising by 8.7% following an influx of wealth from mainland China. He added: "Wealth creation has not been dented by the global economy slowing, nor has this affected the demand for prime property as the search for safe haven investments has continued." For much of the world's wealthy elite, classic cars are the most popular collectible asset with prices surging 395% over 10 years, beating other alternative investments such as fine wine and art. The bright lights of New York and London will lure the world's wealthy until at least 2023, the report shows, but Asia and Latin America will spawn the highest number of ultra-rich individuals over the next decade.
