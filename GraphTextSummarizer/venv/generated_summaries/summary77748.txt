"Governor Nixon must veto this bill and stand firmly with a woman's right to make her own private medical decisions, including the decision of whether to have an abortion, in consultation with her doctor," said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. " Abortion rights advocates slammed the bill, describing it as an intrusion on personal lives. "Currently, Missouri requires a 24-hour waiting period between the time a woman seeks her first consultation and exam from a physician and the time she returns to undergo an abortion procedure," state Rep. Kevin Elmer said in a statement. It "will save babies and protect all women, both adults and minors, from abortion clinics seeking to make a profit on an abortion," it said in a statement. Elmer, who sponsored the bill known as HB1307, said the legislation would give the woman more time to review her decision.
