If they contract Ebola, the Cubans have been told they will not be brought back to Cuba for treatment, said Dr. Jose Luis Di Fabio, who represents the WHO and Pan American Health Organization in Cuba. Despite the limitations and shortages that the island nation's socialist health care system faces, Cuba was one of the first governments to send health care workers to combat Ebola. In the coming days, Rodriguez will join colleagues in West Africa and, after more training there, go to the front line of the fight against Ebola. A veteran of Cuban medical missions to Venezuela and Zimbabwe, Rodriguez said nothing he has faced in those countries compares to the task of fighting Ebola. In a mock field hospital, the Cuban health workers run through mass triage of Ebola patients.
