In the last few years I've watched many videos, either from cell phones or police cameras, and read even more incident reports describing encounters between law enforcement and people with psychiatric disabilities. The best known victims of police violence while in mental health crisis are black men. When police misread the circumstances of encounter with an individual with mental health crisis, the possibility for violence rapidly escalates. Her death demonstrates that the ongoing crisis of violent police encounters with people with mental health transcends race, class and gender. The only solution is for law enforcement to try to stabilize every encounter, to the extent possible, as if it involved psychiatric disability.
