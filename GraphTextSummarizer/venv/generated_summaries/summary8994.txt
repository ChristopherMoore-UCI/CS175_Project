After the legions of Apple fans and early adopters slip them on, will regular people swap out their Casio for an Apple Watch? Apple employees put them on people's wrists and removed them. In the large white showroom Apple custom built for the event, rows of iPhone 6s and Apple Watches were on display. Apple CEO Tim Cook and other Apple employees repeatedly used the word "intimate" to describe the watch's communication features. To communicate from your wrist, you dictate messages to the watch or use it as a walkie-talkie to chat with another Apple Watch wearer.
