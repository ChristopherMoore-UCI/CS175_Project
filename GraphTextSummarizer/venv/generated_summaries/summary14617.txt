Although just 10 of more than 500 members of the new parliament are women, the signal we received is that Egyptian women are committed to expanding their influence and their ranks, and to ensuring that the constitution under development will fully protect the rights of women in Egypt. In Cairo, Egypt; Tunis, Tunisia; and Tripoli, Libya, we held discussions with women who are committed to ensuring that women have a seat at the table and are able to succeed in this rapidly changing and strategically important region. Women already hold 26% of the seats in the Constituent Assembly, which is responsible for drafting Tunisia's Constitution. Some are already serving in government but spoke about a need for more women to serve and to lead in forming new democracies in the Middle East.
