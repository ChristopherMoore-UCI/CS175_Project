"The most idiotic example I've heard of has been Mr. Nigel Farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the M40," Zylinksi said. " Zylinski pointed to Polish contributions to Britain including  those made by Polish RAF pilots during the Battle of Britain, what he said was a "wonderful work ethic" and easy integration into the community. In a video posted on YouTube, Prince Jan Zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against Poles living in Britain. "We are often more loyal to Britain than many British people I know," he said. A Polish Prince has challenged populist British politician Nigel Farage to a duel  in London's Hyde Park over his immigration policy.
