In the other Group H match, Scottish champions Celtic had a disappointing night at Celtic Park going down 3-0 to AC Milan. Last year's beaten finalists Borussia Dortmund kept their hopes of qualification alive with a 3-1 win against Napoli at Signal Iduna Park. Goals from Kaka, Cristian Zapata and Mario Balotelli means that Milan remain in second with nine points but Ajax are now one point behind on eight and will qualify if they can beat the Rossoneri at the San Siro in the final round of Group H matches on December 11. Two goals from Jack Wilshere in the first minute and 65th minute mean the current English Premier League leaders are on 12 points and only need to draw their final group match against Napoli to qualify top of the group. -- Ten-man Ajax beat Barcelona 2-1 at the Amsterdam Arena in the Champions League on Tuesday evening to hand the Catalans their first defeat under coach Gerardo Martino.
