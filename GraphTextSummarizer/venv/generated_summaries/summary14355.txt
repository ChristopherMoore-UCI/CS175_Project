The survivors included 12-year-old twins, a girl and a boy, whose parents are a Spanish Catalan father and a Belgian mother, the Barcelona newspaper La Vanguardia reported Wednesday, citing family sources. Christian Varone, police chief for Valais Canton, said investigators were still working to confirm the identities of the 28 people killed. Pierre-Martin Moulin, assistant to the chief of police in Valais, earlier said authorities would need time to understand what had led the bus to hit the curb on the right side of the tunnel, then crash headlong into the wall of an emergency stopping point. "This is a tragic day for Belgium," Belgian Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said. "It was a difficult night for all the people engaged on the scene," Moulin said, expressing his condolences to families.
