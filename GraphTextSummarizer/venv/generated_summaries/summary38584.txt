Despite the victory, Barcelona remain behind bitter rivals Real Madrid on goal difference after Manuel Pellegrino's side recovered well from their Champions League exit to Lyon in midweek by thrashing Valladolid. Lionel Messi scored a sensational second-half hat-trick as Barcelona beat 10-man Valencia 3-0 on Sunday, but they remain behind Spanish Primera Liga leaders Real Madrid, who beat Valladolid 4-1 in the late match. Valencia then missed a golden opportunity to level when giant striker Nikola Zigic was foiled by goalkeeper Victor Valdes after being put clean through. Messi curled home his second goal with nine minutes remaining and just a minute later Valencia's defence parted again to allow Messi to chip home a delightful third goal. After a goalless opening 45 minutes at the Nou Camp, the introduction of substitute Thierry Henry turned the game, with the Frenchman's pace and guile causing chaos in the Valencia defence, allowing Messi to take full advantage with three superb goals.
