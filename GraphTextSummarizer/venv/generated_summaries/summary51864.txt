According to the human rights organization, protests have taken place at the following universities in Tehran: Amir Kabir, Tehran, Sharif, Elm va Sanaat, Honar, Tehran Markaz, Sureh, and Tehran Shomal. Security forces fired plastic bullets at students and protesters outside the Amir Kabir campus, said the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran. In September, demonstrators took to the streets in protest on Quds Day, an annual event that is meant to show Iran's solidarity with Palestinians. In central Tehran, plumes of smoke rose from a large garbage bin that had been set on fire, witnesses told CNN. The holiday commemorates three university students killed in 1953 by security forces of the Western-backed Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the shah of Iran.
