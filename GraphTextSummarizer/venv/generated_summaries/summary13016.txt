In the al Jihad and al Kadhimya neighborhoods in the east and in the north, respectively, car bombs exploded near commercial markets. The line of succession following Mohammed is one of the core disagreements between Shiite and Sunni Muslims. Car bombs tore through four Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad on Saturday, killing 16 people and wounding dozens, police said. Two people were killed in a bombing in al Bayaa, a southeastern district, when a suicide car bomb exploded near the Musa al Kadhim mosque. One bomb exploded near a mosque and two were placed near commercial markets.
