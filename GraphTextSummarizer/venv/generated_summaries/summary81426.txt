-- A barrage of attacks struck Monday across Iraq, killing at least 84 people and wounding more than 200, said officials, who likened the attacks to another outbreak last year. Funaro said Iraq forces requested U.S. assistance only in Tikrit, and added that U.S. forces "are prepared to assist in any capacity" in line with the security agreement in place. While violence in Iraq has fallen off in recent years, there has been an increase in attacks targeting civilians and U.S. and Iraqi security forces in recent months. Ministry of Interior officials called on security forces to ban people from parking their vehicles on the streets of cities targeted in the attacks, saying they feared more violence. "Today's attacks are eerily similar to the stream of large-scale, complex attacks that occurred here last year during Ramadan on August 25," said Maj. Angela Funaro, spokeswoman for United States Forces-Iraq.
