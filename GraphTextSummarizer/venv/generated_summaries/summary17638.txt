Watch analyst's view on missile tests, nuclear tensions Â» The United States and Israel believe that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear energy program. But I see it as a significant step forward in terms of Iran's capacity to deliver weapons," said Gary Samore, special assistant to the president on nonproliferation. -- Iran tested a missile-launching system and several types of short- and medium-range missiles Sunday, the state-run Press TV said. Earlier, the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had said it would stage missile exercises beginning Sunday to promote the armed forces' defense capabilities. In May, Iran said it tested a surface-to-surface missile that is capable of reaching parts of Europe.
