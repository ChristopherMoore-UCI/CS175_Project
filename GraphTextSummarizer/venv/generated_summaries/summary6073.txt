Pakistan will hold parliamentary elections Monday, with political parties competing for 272 seats in the National Assembly. Outlined below are the main contenders: PPP The assassination of leader Benazir Bhutto looms large over the PPP, which had been banking on the charismatic leader to rally supporters to its cause and shake off the charges of corruption that have dogged the party since Bhutto fled prosecution after two terms as prime minister. PML-N The PML-N is the largest faction of the Pakistan Muslim League and is led by Nawaz Sharif, who has re-emerged as a political player in Pakistan in the past few months after returning from Saudi Arabia where he was exiled after being ousted from power in a 1999 coup led by Pervez Musharraf. Permitted by Musharraf to return to Pakistan last year, Sharif is now banking  the PML-N's fortunes on a platform of renewing the country's top judiciary -- removed by Musharraf during a state of emergency. While the PPP has lost touch with its socialist roots, it remains popular among Pakistan's oppressed and underprivileged, particularly in the southern province of Sindh, from where the Bhutto family hails.
