The conservative wing of the party has resisted Obama at nearly every move, so much so that the White House has kept meetings between House Speaker John Boehner and Obama secret. Obama is "anxious to get back to work" and put the midterms behind him, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, adding the president regards the final two years of his term as a "fourth quarter" with the potential for real action. Comprehensive immigration reform, a longtime goal of Obama's that was blocked last year by the GOP controlled House, will likely arise again in the new Congress as Republicans seek to boost their popularity among Latino voters. Republicans have likewise expressed some willingness to find common ground with Obama, though if four years of rancorous relations with the House GOP are any indication, that willingness may be fleeting. Asked whether the president will be looking to compromise and take a more conciliatory tone with a GOP Senate, a White House official said the "better question is whether the GOP wants to work with us."
