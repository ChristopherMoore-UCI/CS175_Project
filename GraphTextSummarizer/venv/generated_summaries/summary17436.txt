-- Secret Service agents arrested a Washington man Tuesday for making threats against President Barack Obama, a spokesman with the agency said. Leary said the FBI notified the Secret Service about "alarming e-mails." Caluori will make his first appearance in court on Wednesday afternoon. Agents found two weapons in the apartment, said Emily Langlie of the U.S. Attorney's Office. Caluori was charged with making threats against the president and assault on a federal officer.
