India may not be the first place to spring to mind when it comes to fine wine, but the country's tradition of viticulture stretches back for centuries. "I just noticed that Nashik was full of grapes, and no one was making wine in this beautiful place," he says. However, he left it all behind to return to his father's birthplace, Nashik, a city in western India, and started experimenting with different vines.

Initially, Samant had a modest goal --  to merely produce wine that was pleasant and drinkable.
