An aide to French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the Elysee, or presidential palace, would not comment on the verdict, according to the French newspaper Le Monde. -- Former French President Jacques Chirac was found guilty Thursday on corruption charges stemming from his time as mayor of Paris and given a two-year suspended sentence, a court in the French capital announced. Chirac and other former French presidents automatically serve on the council. Francois Hollande, the presidential candidate from the Socialist party, said Thursday that "justice has been done, and it had to be done, so that there would be no sense of impunity." However, he said, he did have some sympathy for Chirac. Chirac was mayor of Paris, from 1977 to 1995, before he became president.
