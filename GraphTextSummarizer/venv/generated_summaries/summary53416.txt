Prop stylist Elizabeth Press traces her gift-wrapping prowess to her mother, whose creative, budget-conscious ideas -- like wrapping boxes with painted newspaper comics, pasting gift certificates inside hollowed-out books, and making decorative stamps out of eraser carvings -- proved that a little thoughtfulness goes a long way. "You don't need wrapping paper if you have pretty fabric or containers," Press says. Think outside the white cardboard box Pick up colorful, inexpensive containers from stores like Pier 1, or use Chinese-takeout cartons from a party store (perfect for cookies and candy,) tea towels or scarves (ideal for wine bottles and other odd-shaped offerings,) and ID-badge sleeves (fun holders for gift cards.) For about $50 at stores like Staples, you can buy hundreds of feet (years' worth!) of kraft paper. If you have lime-colored ribbon from Easter, use green paper.
