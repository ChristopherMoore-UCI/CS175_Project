To start delivering on the promise of a second-chance economy, policy efforts must focus on four key principles: -- Employers must stop discriminating against applicants without a job That means removing employment status as a requirement in job postings and making sure human resources representatives aren't discarding the resumes of unemployed applicants on sight. With the click of a button, information from employment histories and civil and criminal records to credit reports and foreclosures can be summoned and used to deny access to employment, housing, or the public assistance needed just to put food on the table. Entering the criminal justice system shouldn't be a one-way street out of the economy Through "ban the box" laws (in other words, prohibiting the use of boxes applicants must check to indicate they're unemployed), states and cities across the country are already limiting the impact of past incarceration on employment prospects. In startling research, Rand Ghayad, a labor economist at Northeastern University, found that prospective employers consistently threw out resumes of applicants with a recent stint of unemployment in favor of applicants with consistent work histories -- even applicants with less education or no relevant work experience. These are just a few examples of how we can begin to replace our policies and practices that double down on disadvantage with ones that restore second chances.
