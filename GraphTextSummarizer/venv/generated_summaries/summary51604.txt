In addition, the administration's point man on the spill response, Coast Guard Commandant Thad Allen, said Monday that BP's strategies were endorsed by other top oil company executives and he would advise against any shift from BP's continued involvement. However, officials of oil giant BP, while acknowledging their failure so far to stop the leak, say no one -- not even the U.S. government -- can match their company's know-how and technology in such a crisis. Since the April 20 explosion and fire destroyed the Deepwater Horizon offshore rig, setting off the deep-sea gusher, oil giant BP has led the effort to stop the leak. "There are areas where BP and the private sector are the ones who must continue to lead the efforts with government oversight, such as a deployment of private sector technology 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to kill the well," Salazar said Monday. -- Legally, President Obama can effectively fire BP and have the federal government take over efforts to stop the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
