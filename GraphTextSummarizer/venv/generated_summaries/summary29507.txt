-- The cost of college tuition will continue to rise as long as federal student aid programs continue to increase with little or no accountability. Why should taxpayers continue to increase funding for federal aid programs that do little to control soaring college costs and rein in student debt? While increased federal aid does not cause college price inflation, it can be a considerable factor. I had noticed an interesting phenomenon: Increases in federal financial aid were not improving college affordability. Higher tuition, of course, reduces college affordability, leading to calls for more financial aid, setting the vicious cycle in motion all over again.
