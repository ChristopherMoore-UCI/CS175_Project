Some of the shells fired by Libyan government forces fell inside Tunisia, TAP said, citing a security source. Libyan state television reported late Tuesday that government forces had exchanged fire with NATO vessels that were shelling west of Misrata, striking one of them directly. Abdallah Mahmoud al-Hijazi, the former adviser to the Foreign Affairs General Secretariat and deputy-director of Libyan military intelligence, entered Tunisia on Tuesday through the Ras Jedir border crossing, said TAP. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim denied Monday that Ghanem had defected, and said he was still on the job. Meanwhile, the government spokesman said four Western journalists detained by Libyan authorities were to appear Tuesday in court.
