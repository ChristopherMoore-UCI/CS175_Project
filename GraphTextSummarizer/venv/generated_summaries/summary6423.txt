Aron claims he took Kletzky to a wedding Monday night in Monsey, New York, and then brought him back, Kelly said. Surveillance video showed Aron entering a dentist's office Monday while Kletzky waited for him across the street for seven minutes, Kelly said. According to Kelly, police showed up at Aron's residence at 2:40 a.m. Wednesday and asked him about Kletzky's whereabouts. Aron, a clerk at a maintenance supply company, did not appear to have known Kletzky, Kelly said. He said earlier in a statement that he was sorry for the trouble he has caused, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly.
