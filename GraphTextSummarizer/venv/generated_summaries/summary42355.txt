-- Juan Roma won the third stage of the Dakar Rally in Argentina Tuesday as Mini teammate Krzysztof Holowczyc of Poland took the lead in the overall standings. Despres, who made a poor start to the 14-day race, took more than 13 minutes off KTM teammate and defending champion Marc Coma of Spain, who trailed home seventh. It was the second stage win on the endurance rally for the team, with Roma coming home one minute and nine seconds ahead of the race leader at the end of the 208km leg from San Rafael to San Juan. But another French rider, Sebastien Coue, was admitted to hospital in San Rafael after he suffered a broken shoulder and heat stroke. Dutch rider Frans Verhoeven took second with Portugal's Paulo Goncalves in third.
