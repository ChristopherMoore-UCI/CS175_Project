-- Police in New York are aware of child molestation allegations by a former relative against actor Stephen Collins, but due to the statute of limitations, he cannot face charges in that case, a senior law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday evening. Accusations from court documents According to divorce documents filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Grant says she learned Collins had "been engaging in a long-term pattern of sexually molesting children." TMZ audio recording Earlier Tuesday, celebrity gossip website TMZ released an audio recording that purports to have been recorded during a November 2012 therapy session involving Collins and his estranged second wife, Faye Grant. Following the revelation, Collins, who is involved in a contentious divorce with Grant, was fired from his job on the movie "Ted 2." Grant said in the court documents that she was unaware of Collins' behavior until he told her in January 2012.
