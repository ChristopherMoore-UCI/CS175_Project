Hibel says the application process is exactly the same as going through KittyKind's shelter: There's an application, interview, home visit and adoption fee of $125 to cover medical costs. KittyKind currently takes in between 500 and 600 cats a year, with 27 cages in a Manhattan branch of a pet store and a network of foster homes. Hibel says KittyKind is particularly committed to helping cats with special needs, whether disease, old age or disability. "It brings tears to my eyes to see Lucky Lemon there," says Miriam Hibel, who serves on KittyKind's board of directors and is an adoption counselor. For a cat to be placed in the cafe, it has to have a clean bill of health, get along with other cats and be nonaggressive.
