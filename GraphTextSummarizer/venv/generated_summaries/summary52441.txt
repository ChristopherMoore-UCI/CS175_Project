-- Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Hillary Clinton on Friday accused the camp of rival Sen. Barack Obama of politicizing the death of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Obama thought that the war would have a negative impact in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and that seems relevant right now." He also said he "certainly wasn't suggesting Sen. Clinton was complicit. Watch what Clinton says about Obama Â» Clinton also called for an independent, international investigation into Bhutto's death, "perhaps along the lines of what the United Nations have been doing with respect to the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri in Lebanon. The latest battle between the two Democratic front-runners began Thursday when Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, seemed to link Clinton's vote on the Iraq war and Bhutto's death. " Obama called that assertion "silly" and said the Clinton campaign thought that the unrest in Pakistan would work to its benefit.
