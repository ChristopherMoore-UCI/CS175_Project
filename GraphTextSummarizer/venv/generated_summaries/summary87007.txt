Also in Yemen on Sunday, a foreign national working for UNICEF was kidnapped by gunmen, three Interior Ministry officials told CNN. -- Gunmen killed a German national who was a member of the security detail of the German Embassy in Sanaa on Sunday, according to a Yemeni diplomat with knowledge of the situation. If this continues at this rate, we'll be heading toward a complete collapse of the security apparatus in Yemen," the Yemeni diplomat told CNN.
