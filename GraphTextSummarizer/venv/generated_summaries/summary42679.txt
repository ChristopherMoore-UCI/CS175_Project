Finally, Wired.com's Erik Malinowski tried a PlayBook tablet at CES and reported that Flash performance proved to be a "choppy and (ironically) limiting experience. Last year RIM drummed up Flash support for the upcoming PlayBook, saying that it was going to deliver the full internet experience. Without great Flash support, a PlayBook tablet would practically have nothing to do. Second, sluggish performance and battery drainage have been problems for Flash before, and they're the reason Apple CEO Steve Jobs gave for nixing Flash support on Apple's mobile products. The PlayBook also lacks a finished software development kit for making apps, and won't have native mail, messaging and contacts apps.
