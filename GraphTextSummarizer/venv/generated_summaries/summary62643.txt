Gergel, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, issued a permanent injunction against enforcement of provisions of the state constitution or state laws or policy "to the extent that they seek to prohibit the marriage of same sex couples." Same-sex marriage is under court review in Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana and Texas. The ruling, by Judge Richard M. Gergel in Charleston, does not mean an immediate issuance of marriage licenses for same-sex couples, however. If the judge's ruling stands and same-sex marriage becomes legal, South Carolina would become the 33rd state in which same-sex marriage has become legal. -- A U.S. District Court judge has overturned South Carolina's ban on same-sex marriage.
