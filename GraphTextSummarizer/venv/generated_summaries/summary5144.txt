" Schettino, who was the captain of the Costa Concordia cruise ship when it crashed into the rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio, in January 2012, is facing 26 years in prison for charges of causing a maritime disaster, abandoning ship and multiple counts of manslaughter for the 32 people who lost their lives in the accident. Pepe defended Schettino's decision to delay the call to abandon ship by nearly an hour. Pepe  then addressed the famous exchange between Gregorio De Falco -- commander of the Livorno Port Authority the night of the accident -- and Schettino, during which De Falco told Schettino to "get back on board for f**k's sake." Pepe suggested it was De Falco's stern manner, rather than Schettino's apparent ineptitude, that damaged Italy's reputation. "He's not superman or a spider," he told the court, before asking them to  "absolve Schettino of abandoning ship."
