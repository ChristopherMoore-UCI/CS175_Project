-- Michael D. Higgins, a 70-year-old poet and politician, was elected Ireland's new president on Saturday. The other six candidates -- including former Irish Republican Army commander Martin McGuinness -- have all conceded defeat. He had been consistently third in opinion polls, while businessman and reality TV star Sean Gallagher had been vying alongside Higgins for the top spot. He is to be Ireland's ninth head of state and is scheduled to be inaugurated on November 11, one day after President Mary McAleese leaves office. McGuinness's campaign had been dogged by questions about his past ties to the IRA, an armed group that fought against British authorities in Northern Ireland but has since renounced violence.
