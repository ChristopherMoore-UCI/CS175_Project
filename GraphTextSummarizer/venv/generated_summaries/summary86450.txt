Russia's president shares "political responsibility" for the assassination of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, the late politician's daughter said Friday in her first TV interview since his death in central Moscow last week. The Kremlin has suggested Nemtsov may have been killed by enemies of Russia intent on creating political discord, but many Nemtsov supporters suspect Putin's administration of involvement. How Boris Nemtsov's murder serves notice to Vladimir Putin's enemies Putin this week called the killing a "disgrace" and a tragedy, and he promised to bring those responsible to justice. He served as deputy prime minister in the late 1990s under President Boris Yeltsin. I would say that our authorities, including the president of Russia, have political responsibility as the head of state," Nemtsova told CNN's Matthew Chance.
