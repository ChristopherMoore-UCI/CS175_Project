In this age of overstuffed planes, where we squeeze our bodies into cramped seats and jockey for overhead bin space, it sounds like a dream -- one that would never happen. But it did -- sort of -- on Monday for a man who boarded a long-delayed Delta Airlines flight from Cleveland to New York to find that all his fellow passengers had been rebooked on other flights. But Delta Airlines told KABC, a CNN affliliate, that it needed to get O'Leary's plane to New York's La Guardia Airport for flights later in the day. The man, Chris O'Leary of New York City, did what most of us would probably do. The rare situation was caused by bad weather, which caused several flight delays in the Northeast.
