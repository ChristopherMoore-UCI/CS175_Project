It's handpicking the early advertisers, choosing big names that already have Instagram accounts including Levi's, Ben & Jerry's, General Electric and PayPal. Instagram is easing users into ads with a first look at what the paid posts will look like. This is the first time ads have appeared in Instagram feeds. Instagram will also only show ads to people 18 and older (anyone over 13 can open an Instagram account). The ads will look almost exactly like regular Instagram posts, but in the top right corner a blue arrow icon and the word "sponsored" will replace the old time-stamp.
