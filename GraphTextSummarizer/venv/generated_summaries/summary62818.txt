-- Seven-year-old Timmy "Mini" Tyrrell gets a high-five as he steps out of his go-kart at the King George Speedway in King George, Virginia. Now he races for a greater cause, to raise money for families of children with cancer. One-hundred percent of the money raised goes directly to helping families of children with cancer. Dressed in a red fire suit and standing just under 4 feet tall, Timmy has been racing go-karts for fun since he was 4 years old. At the races, Timmy collects donations for the Jeffrey Virostek Fund to help families with children with disease.
