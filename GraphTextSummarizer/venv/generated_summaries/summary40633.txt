A driver of a commercial van ran over pedestrians at a train stop in eastern Jerusalem on Wednesday, killing an Israeli border police officer and injuring 13 other people before getting out of his vehicle and attacking people with a metal bar, Israeli police said. Police shot and killed the attacker, identified by Israeli authorities as a member of the Islamist Hamas movement and a resident of the Shuafat Palestinian refugee camp in eastern Jerusalem, Israeli police spokeswoman Luba Samri said. On October 22, a Palestinian man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in Jerusalem, killing a baby and wounding several other people, Israeli police said. The attack came on another day of tension between Israelis and Palestinians over Jerusalem's Temple Mount -- one of the holiest sites in Judaism and Islam -- where Israeli police clashed with Palestinians on Wednesday. Husseini said he saw Israeli police officers lying on the road after being hit by the van.
