Lee Daniels' "Monster's Ball" and "Precious" contained the wrong message (white people saving black people) and "For Colored Girls" was tainted by Tyler Perry, a gifted director and storyteller given to more commercial fare, whom some saw as the wrong messenger. Some say they want more black people telling black stories, which would be reasonable, if it were true. It is odious that the nominating committee gravitates to black people playing into conventional stereotypes. If you believe what you read on blogs, black women long to be represented on screens large and small as rounded, complex characters, rather than wise, downtrodden burden-bearers and hot-blooded angry sex machines. Films outside the comfort zone of mainstream black audiences seem to attract mainstream patronage en masse.
