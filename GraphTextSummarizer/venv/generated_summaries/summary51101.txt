" World No. 18 Woods, who slipped out of the top 50 last year, will also line up at next week's WGC Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona next week -- an event he has won three times. The American has shown signs of returning to form in recent times, finishing tied for third at the Abu Dhabi Golf Championship last month and winning the Chevron World Challenge event he hosts in December. The tournament is held in Palm Beach Gardens, which is near the 14-time major champion's home on Jupiter Island -- where he moved last year after his 2010 breakup with ex-wife Elin Nordegren following the scandal about his extramarital affairs. Woods will be in illustrious company at Doral, with world No. 1 Luke Donald and 2011 U.S. Open winner Rory McIlroy both confirming their attendance on Tuesday. "I've made great strides from last year and hopefully all my hard work will pay off with a victory soon."
