The switch came partly because Truman, like Bush, had a gentle, honest personality that voters looked back on with fondness. In foreign affairs, Bush defined the War on Terror in much the way that Truman shaped thinking about the struggle against communism for decades. To be fair, Bush himself faced some events beyond his control: a recession in 2001 and the global collapse of financial institutions in 2007-2008. For good or bad, we'll be living by the Bush model of international relations for many years to come. John Bolton, Bush's ambassador to the UN, admitted this week that his former employer had left Obama "a mess" to clean up.
