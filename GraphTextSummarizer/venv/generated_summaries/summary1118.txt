A sergeant wipes away a tear while kneeling before a battlefield cross at a Memorial Day ceremony for fallen service members at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti. The contest is part of the Defense Department's Visual Information Awards Program, designed to recognize and promote excellence among military photographers, videographers, journalists, mass communication specialists and graphic artists. An Air Force captain jumps rope in a Texas gym despite missing her left leg, which was amputated after being diagnosed with cancer. Seven Air Force recruits plunge into the deep end of a swimming pool, their hands and feet bound, in a training exercise meant to prepare them for stressful real-world operations. These striking images are among the winning entries in the 2014 Military Photographer of the Year competition, open to photography by U.S. service members only.
