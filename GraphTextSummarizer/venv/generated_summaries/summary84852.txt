Berger told jurors that al Qaeda leaders assigned the mission to Medunjanin in 2008, while he was in Pakistan's tribal belt with two high school friends, Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay. Co-conspirators Zazi, an immigrant from Pakistan, and Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan, have pleaded guilty to planning the attack with him and are awaiting sentencing. Medunjanin's attorney Robert Gottlieb denied the prosecution's account in his own closing arguments, insisting his client traveled to Pakistan "not to join al Qaeda, but to join the Taliban in fighting foreign troops in Afghanistan. Prosecutors say Adis Medunjanin, a Bosnian-born American, conspired with admitted terrorists Najubullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay in the terrorist plot planned, but never executed, in 2009. In closing arguments late last week at a federal court in Brooklyn, Assistant U.S. Attorney Berit Berger said that Medunjanin was willing "to strap a suicide bomb to himself, walk into a New York City subway and blow it up.
