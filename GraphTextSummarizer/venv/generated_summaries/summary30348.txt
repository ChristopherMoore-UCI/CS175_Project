She is one of nine aides to Rwandan President Paul Kagame that Europe is seeking to arrest on charges of plotting the assassination of the then-Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana in April 1994. Rwanda's government issued a statement saying Kabuye is innocent of the charges, and that she is ready to face trial in France. Rose Kabuye is suspected of participating in downing of a plane carrying President Juvenal Habyarimana. Habyarimana and Burundi's former leader Cyprien Ntaryamira were killed when their plane was shot down in April 1994, a move that fueled the genocide in Rwanda by Hutu extremists against mostly Tutsis. A French judge ruled in 2006 that legal proceedings could proceed against Kagame and his nine aides, which prompted Rwanda to break its diplomatic ties with France.
