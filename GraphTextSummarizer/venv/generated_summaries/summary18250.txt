Italian jury clears Amanda Knox of murder The Knox case was a pop culture obsession, and that's not going to stop now that the jury has decided to set her free. Those are the sensational words that have captured mainstream headlines in the United States, Great Britain and Italy during the Amanda Knox saga. In 2007, images on Knox's Facebook page were taken by media in the United States, Great Britain and elsewhere and used in stories. Burleigh answered that the Italian police investigating Kercher's murder made mistakes and that heavy media attention after Knox and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, who was also convicted, made it hard for the police to admit their mistakes and put their investigation back on a fair and correct path. The nickname Foxy Knoxy didn't come from the press; it was given to Knox by her schoolmates and was an innocent gesture made long before Kercher's death.
