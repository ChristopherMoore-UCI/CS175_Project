It was Inter's fourth trophy of the year, with Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o netting two goals to join Alessandro Del Piero and Andrei Shevchenko at the top of the all-time list of Super Cup scorers with three goals following last year's effort against Lazio in Beijing. Hodgson also ruled out any move for Netherlands World Cup star Dirk Kuyt, who has been linked with a move to Inter. -- Rafael Benitez made a winning start to his career as Inter Milan coach as the European champions beat last season's domestic rivals Roma 3-1 in the Italian Super Cup at the San Siro on Saturday. Benitez, who replace treble winner Jose Mourinho after leaving English club Liverpool, saw his new team maintain their dominance over the capital outfit, who finished second in both Serie A and the Italian Cup in 2009-10. "I am very happy because we showed character after going behind," Benitez told the Inter website after his side equaled city rivals AC Milan's record of five Super Cup wins.
