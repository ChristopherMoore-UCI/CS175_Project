The committee called on officials in the interim government and National Transitional Council "to fulfill their duty in finding out the fate of this man and free him from the kidnappers by taking all necessary measures to achieve that, and to put an end to such irresponsible acts that only mean chaos, an attack on public freedoms and extrajudicial detention." Al-Alam is supposed to head the Libyan delegation in London for the Olympic games, which begin next week. It described al-Alam as a "man who greatly contributed to the" revolution that led to strongman Moammar Gadhafi's ouster last year. The committee issued a statement saying the "Libyan sports family" condemns "this heinous crime." Ahmad Nabil al-Alam was taken in central Tripoli on Sunday, the organization said.
