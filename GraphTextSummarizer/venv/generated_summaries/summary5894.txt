"However, children from Chernobyl disaster regions in Ukraine and Belarus have received an invitation, extended by UEFA President Michel Platini, to attend one of the Euro 2012 matches. -- UEFA has decided not to make a charitable donation to the victims of the Chernobyl disaster as part of the social projects it has opted to support during Euro 2012, which is being co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland. A botched reactor safety test at Chernobyl in Ukraine -- then part of the Soviet Union -- set off the worst nuclear accident in history, with the radiation effects of the 1986 explosion about 400 times more potent than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II, and nearly 14 times greater than the disaster last year at the Fukushima plant in Japan. The chairman of the Chernobyl Children's Trust Simon Walsh described UEFA's decision as paying 'lip-service' to the victims of Chernobyl. "This could have been a golden opportunity to raise both awareness and funds for the 'Children of Chernobyl' while simultaneously giving much-needed credibility and kudos to UEFA and Michel Platini."
