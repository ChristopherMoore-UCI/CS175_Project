"The storms are just amazingly explosive and they're covering a very large area," said Greg Carbin with the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. A storm system that brought severe weather to parts of the South Plains earlier this week headed east, a cold front was moving across the Deep South and upper levels of the atmosphere were conducive for severe storms. -- A widespread outbreak of severe weather across the Deep South may be one for the record books, as the National Weather Service received reports of more than 150 tornadoes. The same system continued to spin off tornadoes early Thursday. With the latest outbreak, April may turn out to be a historic month for tornadoes, he said.
