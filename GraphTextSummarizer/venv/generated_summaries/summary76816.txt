Starting August 22, Star Trek fans and those who are fluent in Klingon can visit the Jenolan Caves National Park and take a self-guided audio tour in Klingon through the "Nettle Cave." -- A popular sightseeing destination in Australia is boldly going where no tourist attraction has gone before -- by offering audio tours in the Klingon language. Star Trek producers later consulted linguist Mark Okrand to develop the language for "Star Trek III: The Search for Spock" and subsequent other films. Currently offering audio tours in eight languages, Nettle Cave is part of one of the oldest cave systems in the world and has about 150,000 to 200,000 visitors annually, making it one of the most visited caves in Australia. "We thought it would be neat to add another language, perhaps a fictional one," says David Hay in charge of Cultural Initiatives at Jenolan Caves.
