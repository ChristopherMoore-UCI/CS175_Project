But the system is more effective than current security measures, claims Liberman, who believes a terrorist currently can pass through airport security with explosive material "that can take down any plane." "The archaic system of an X-ray machine and metal detector cannot pick up other potential threats posed by passengers," Baum says. Although traditional security profiling can discriminate by race and religion, security experts say behavioral profiling is more fair, more effective and less expensive. In fact, many experts express little confidence in the current state of airport security. For example, passengers could use an automated check-in system or gaze at a screen with departures information without realizing they've just been exposed to the words "Islamic jihad" written in Arabic.
