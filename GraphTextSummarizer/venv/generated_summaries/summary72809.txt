"Six in 10 Democrats say that the tax system is fair," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. "In 1985, only 27 percent were angry about the amount of taxes they had to pay, possibly a reflection of the tax cuts that Ronald Reagan instituted in his first year in office. The poll indicates growing public frustration with taxes over the past couple of decades. "Republicans are split down the middle, with 49 percent calling it fair and 51 percent thinking it is unfair." Four in 10 questioned say that they are angry about the amount of taxes they pay; 36 percent say they're satisfied and just under one in four say they don't have particular feelings on the issue. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday also indicates that roughly half the public believes the tax system is unfair, and as a result, four in 10 say they're angry about the amount of taxes that they pay.
