"Too many telemarketers, aided by autodialers and prerecorded messages, have continued to call consumers who don't want to hear from them," said FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski in a statement read at the meeting. -- The Federal Communications Commission approved new rules Wednesday to further limit automatically dialed or prerecorded calls know as "robocalls" and automated text messages. "Any type of phone call or text to a wireless device needs written consent," the FCC official added. Text messages and calls to cell phones are subject to stricter rules. The new rules "strictly" limit the number of such calls telemarketers can make "within each calling campaign," the FCC said.
