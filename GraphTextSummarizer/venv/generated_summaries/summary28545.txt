The return of "Duck Dynasty" benefited from an unexpected gift-from-the-PR-gods when British singer and animal rights activist Morrissey cancelled his planned Feb. 26 performance on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" at the last minute in protest of the "Duck Dynasty" stars appearing the same episode. A&E's breakout pro-hunting hit "Duck Dynasty" returned Wednesday night to record ratings. He also promoted his special guests "Duck Dynasty" -- who kill beings for fun. " Kimmel followed that up by tweeting yestrerday, "Note to Morrissey â€” if you have more dumb statements to make, I invite you to make them where I do, on my show." It's not only the most-watched "Duck Dynasty" episode ever, it's A&E's most-watched telecast ever and ranks as cable's biggest reality show telecast so far this year.
