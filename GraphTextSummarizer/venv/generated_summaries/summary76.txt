Two sheriff's deputies responding to a domestic dispute between a pair of brothers Monday night were shot and badly injured in the same Washington county where four officers were killed last month, authorities said. Troyer said it was "surreal" to be responding to another shooting that involved officers. Pierce County prosecutor Mark Lindquist said Crable had a history of protection orders sought by family members. " Crable went to his brother's house Monday night and there was a domestic dispute, said Sheriff's detective Ed Troyer. Earlier this year, Crable pleaded guilty to malicious mischief and brandishing a knife in an incident involving his brother, Lindquist said, and protection orders were imposed afterward, telling him to stay away from his brother and a female minor.
