Crist's decision to place a fan on stage during a separate debate Wednesday night triggered what the moderator described as "the most unique beginning to any debate not only in Florida, but anywhere in the country." Related: Fan delays Florida debate Florida's Republican governor, Rick Scott, was seven minutes late walking onto the stage -- while moderators tried to explain during the live broadcast that he had decided not to participate because Crist had placed a small electronic fan under his own podium to keep cool. Each campaign was sent a letter ahead of time explaining that "candidates may not bring electronic devices (including fans), visual aids or notes to the debate," the two groups that hosted the debate Wednesday, Leadership Florida and the Florida Press Association, said Thursday. His campaign said later that it was actually Crist who was in the midst of intense behind-the-scenes conversations with debate organizers over whether his fan would be allowed -- and that Scott was just waiting to see what happened. "In the minutes before airtime, the communication among the campaigns, the producing television station and the debate partners was chaotic and there undoubtedly was some confusion, but Gov. Scott never told Ridings or Wendy Walker, president, Leadership Florida, that he would not join the debate," the organizers said. Scott said on CNN's "The Situation Room" with Wolf Blitzer on Thursday that he had been waiting in a trailer for debate officials to tell him to head to the stage.
