Scores of women have posted pictures of themselves in lacy underwear on social networks and compared the photos to images of Soviet-era style brown, shapeless underwear. -- Lacy underwear has effectively been "banned" by new regulations in Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, opponents say. The regulations say this is designed to protect consumers against synthetic garments which don't absorb enough moisture. From July, underwear that does not meet this requirement will not be available in stores in the economic area. Technical regulations are "not a dogma" and can change, the statement said.
