Obama, however, made clear Monday that he was talking about all kinds of higher education, including community colleges and specialized training programs to help young people prepare to enter the modern work force. "I think that we all realize that everybody's not going to be headed to college, that we have to have ... community colleges and good job training," said Brewer, who has repeatedly clashed with Obama on immigration policy. President Barack Obama told U.S. governors attending a luncheon Monday that they are cutting too much funding for education and need to make reforms while continuing to invest in the future of America's students. "Americans now owe more in student loan debt than they do in credit card debt," Obama said, adding that "state budget cuts have been a major factor in rising tuition costs at state universities." "When I speak about higher education, we're not just talking about a four-year degree," Obama said.
