Opinion: Romney's radical economic plan for U.S. Romney makes a similar mistake for military spending. Romney will likely accept cuts to domestic spending while opposing those to the defense budget. Obama's and Romney's economic visions differ, therefore, on three fundamental issues: how much government should redistribute income; what kind of federal spending is worth its costs; and whether governments or markets allocate resources more efficiently. The IPAB will have the power to restrict Medicare expenditure, chiefly by controlling health care prices and limiting reimbursement for care deemed unnecessary or not cost-effective. Under current policy, substantial tax hikes and spending cuts kick in on January 1, 2013.
