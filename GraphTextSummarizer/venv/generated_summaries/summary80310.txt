Then the first video came in from CNN affiliate WABC with the Trade Center's North Tower ablaze. A national desk editor had received a call from a CNN affiliate in Oklahoma City. One of my most memorable days at CNN was a day of tragedy, April 19, 1995. This week, more than 32 years after I joined CNN -- after being a part of thousands of stories, working with thousands of people, and forming friendships that have lasted a lifetime -- I will sign off of my computer for the last time and retire. On the day of Ted Turner's last visit to his office in the CNN Center, my old friend and colleague Will King, who like me was there on day one, happened to ride the elevator down with Turner.
