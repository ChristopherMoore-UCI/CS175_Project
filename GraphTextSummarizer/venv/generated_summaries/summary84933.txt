Such a spike in violence is to be expected, Morrell told reporters Wednesday, "based upon the pattern of behavior that we've seen over the past few weeks, and, frankly, historically in Iraq, leading up to seminal dates, whether it be elections or other significant dates, of an uptick in the operational tempo of terrorists and insurgents." Violent attacks are at an "all-time" low according to Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell, but there continue to be sporadic high-profile attacks by insurgents, including a blast that killed 62 people and injured 150 others at a Baghdad market on Wednesday. The U.S. expects the level of violence in Iraq to rise as it goes ahead with its planned withdrawal of troops from Iraqi cities by June 30, the Pentagon said Wednesday. The notion of declaring victory is controversial since former President Bush's declaration in May 2003 that major combat operations in Iraq were over while he was standing under a sign reading "Mission Accomplished." In a letter to U.S. troops, the top U.S. commander insisted the withdrawal was appropriate.
