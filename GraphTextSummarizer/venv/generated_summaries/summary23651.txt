If and when the remaining 600 million pieces of Stasi files will be puzzled back together, Jahn cannot tell. When the Berlin Wall fell in November 1989, Stasi agents were given the order to cover their tracks and destroy any evidence that would reveal names of secret informants, documentation of dealings with the West, protocols and recordings of trial proceedings -- none of it was ever meant to be seen by the public. Over 45 Million pages of Stasi files had been torn apart and what the shredder could not handle had been simply torn apart by hand. Stasi Records Agency Commissioner Roland Jahn sees the confrontation with the past as vital for the future. Frunder spent months in a Stasi prison before eventually being deported to Western Germany in the fall of 1970.
