While his background is in track and field, Foucan is a keen rock climber, plays football and ice skates -- even appearing in a British TV show, "Dancing on Ice." Rather than "Die Another Day," the career of Foucan -- known as the founder of free running and a developer of its close relative Parkour -- has taken off in a way he never dreamed of. Foucan has come a long way since running around Paris as a teenager with the likes of Parkour founder David Belle. Foucan, while a keen student of Parkour in his teens, believed that the discipline was far too narrow and lacked a spiritual aspect. In 2003, Foucan finally decided to break away from Parkour after performing in London, where he now resides.
