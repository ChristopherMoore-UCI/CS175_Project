He loved musicals and Cole Porter, and was primed to like "At Long Last Love," Bogdanovich's Porter-infused musical. Bogdanovich, who's preparing a new film produced by Noah Baumbach and Wes Anderson, took a few minutes to talk to CNN about "At Long Last Love," the value of previews and his thoughts on today's Hollywood. CNN: Burt Reynolds was unusual casting. I was thinking of Elliott Gould, who was a song and dance man, and then Sue Mengers became Burt Reynolds' agent, and she was my agent, and she said, "Why don't you use Burt?" Bogdanovich: I didn't have Burt Reynolds in mind.
