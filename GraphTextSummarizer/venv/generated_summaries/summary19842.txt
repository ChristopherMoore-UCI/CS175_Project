"Republicans tried to peddle these scurrilous allegations during my last congressional race and authorities and reputable news outlets rejected these false allegations," Kildee said in a statement issued Sunday night. " Rep. Dale Kildee, a Democrat who has held his Flint-area district since 1976, said he once went to the FBI after one relative threatened to go public with the claims if he didn't get federal benefits for the cousin, now an adult with a history of mental illness. Family members recounted the claims -- which Kildee said date back 50 years -- in audio recordings posted online and published by The Washington Times. But the woman also says the man's wife once called Kildee's office to try to get federal benefits for her husband. He also released a copy of what he said was the last letter he had received from the cousin, in 1988, in which the man asks for Kildee's help in establishing a "global telethon" to end hunger in Africa.
