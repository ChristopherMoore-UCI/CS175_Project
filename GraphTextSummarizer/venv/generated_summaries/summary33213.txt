Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Lebanon and the Palestinians Wednesday that Israel would react with force to what he called violent provocation against its citizens. Israel has accused Lebanon-based Hezbollah, considered a terrorist group by the United States, of violating the resolution by smuggling arms into southern Lebanon. That led the Lebanese army to open fire, with Israeli forces returning artillery fire and hitting a house in the village of Odaise. Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said Israel violated U.N. Resolution 1701 in crossing the Blue Line and by bombing a Lebanese army checkpoint in Odaise. Asarta said both parties were committed to ending hostilities and to complying with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, the agreement that ended a five-week war between the Lebanese group Hezbollah and Israel in 2006.
