The bodies were found Tuesday morning, hours before Donna Fairchild was to attend a City Council meeting and face possible sanctions over a travel expense voucher and public comments. She said Donna Fairchild wanted to continue her mayoral campaign and deal with the issues, but Giarratana was unaware that the councilwoman had apparently planned to resign Tuesday. "At 4:33 a.m., Police Dispatch received a 911 call from Donna Fairchild which gave her address, said her door was unlocked and that she would be 'post-suicide.' The city released the audio of the 911 call, in which Donna Fairchild gave the address, said the couple was in the bedroom, the front door was unlocked and "I am post-suicide." Donna Fairchild forwarded her an e-mail joke around 8 p.m. Monday.
