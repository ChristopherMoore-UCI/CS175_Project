Jump on the Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong, head straight for domestic departures, where I would then board a flight to Tacloban -- a flight of little more than an hour. Three of the world's leading weather agencies came up with three different paths for the storm as it slowly, but relentlessly, bore down on the Philippines packing winds in excess of 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph). I knew I was in good hands when I met my pilot, retired military man Col. Andy Largo. For me, that unpredictability turned traveling from Manila to Tacloban from a routine 90-minute flight into a 31-hour slog. More than an hour later we learned that all flights were canceled because of the weather conditions in Tacloban.
