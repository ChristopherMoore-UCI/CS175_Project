Some programs under the initiative would expand summer science camps for girls, allow more students to take part in robotics competitions, increase teacher training, and help students take advanced placement courses in math and science, the White House statement said. Ride told CNN on Thursday that American students need new inspiration to learn the so-called STEM subjects -- science, technology, engineering and math -- to compete in the global workforce and help restore the United States as a leader in innovative research and development. -- President Barack Obama on Thursday announced a new initiative led by the top executives of major U.S. corporations that seeks to improve education in science, technology, engineering and math. "For the last 20 to 25 years, our society really hasn't put a focus on the importance of math and science education. The initiative was founded by former astronaut Sally Ride, former Intel Chairman Craig Barrett, Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt, and Eastman Kodak CEO Antonio Perez, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation of New York, according to the White House statement.
