While the words Nugent used regrettably contribute to the growing lack of civility in American political discourse, it was still political speech. Our courts have uniformly held that no form of speech is entitled to greater constitutional protection than political speech. There's little doubt Nugent's statement would be considered by the courts as nothing more than "political hyperbole," not a crime. Rocker Ted Nugent found himself being investigated by the U.S. Secret Service after making this statement last weekend at the NRA Convention: "If Barack Obama becomes the president in November, I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year." Nugent should not be prosecuted for two equally important reasons: He did not break the law, and we must be vigilant in protecting freedom of expression when it involves political subject matter.
