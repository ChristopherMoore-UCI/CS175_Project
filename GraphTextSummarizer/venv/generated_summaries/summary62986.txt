-- Divers are recovering bottles of champagne that have been lying at the bottom of the Baltic Sea for about two centuries, an autonomous Finnish island official said Wednesday. The island chain is at the entrance of the Gulf of Bothnia, in the Baltic Sea, and is an island of Swedish speaking people, though the island itself falls under Finnish control. "The first bottle was brought to the surface in mid-July," Rainer Juslin, permanent secretary of the island's ministry of education, science and culture, told CNN via telephone from Mariehamn, the capital of the Aland islands. "We believe this is the oldest champagne in the world." Juslin said that the cargo was aboard a ship believed to be heading from Copenhagen, Denmark, to St Petersburg, Russia, between 1800 and 1830. " Juslin speculated the ship carrying the cargo may have been Finnish or another Scandinavian ship.
