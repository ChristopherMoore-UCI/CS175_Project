-- An online fundraiser for a New York bus monitor taunted by middle school students ends Friday after a month and hundreds of thousands of dollars beyond expectations. The video showed giggling students from the upstate New York community of Greece heaping insults onto her and jabbing her with a book. A 10-minute video of Karen Klein enduring verbal harassment from four students went viral last month, sparking international outrage that grew into a call to raise "vacation" funds for her. Indiegogo said Klein will get 93% of the funds while the website will keep 4% and 3% will go toward credit card processing fees. They will also be required to complete 50 hours of community service with senior citizens and take part in a formal bullying prevention program.
