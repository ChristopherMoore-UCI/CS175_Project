The piece of history Bachmann says fascinates her is that the current ladies room room was where former President, Rep. John Quincy Adams died in February of 1848. But she knew the whole story of how even the original women's restroom came to be - thanks to former female Rep Lindy Boggs, wife of famous former Rep Hale Boggs , for making it happen. So it's quite a ways," said Bachmann, motioning all the way across Statuary Hall towards the House floor, which you can't even see from the ladies lounge. (Note: Another ladies room was placed closer to the House floor at the order of House Speaker John Boehner in 2011.) The women have to walk off the House floor, through what is usually a sea of tourists in Statuary Hall to reach the ladies' restroom.
