It marks the fourth snub by the Oscars for Leo, who was nominated this year for "Wolf of Wall Street" but has previously lost with nominations for "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," "The Aviator" and "Blood Diamond." "Poor Leo you could see he is trying to hold back the tears," tweeted one fan with a pic of what looked to be a dejected Leo responding to his name not being called. No love for Leo Once again Leonardo DiCaprio was passed over for an Academy Award, and once again fans roared. Better luck next year? Kudos to John Ridley for winning the Oscar for best adapted screenplay for "12 Years a Slave." Things like: 1) John Travolta, learn to pronounce Idina Menzel, please Perhaps he is not a Broadway fan or missed all of the hubbub about "Frozen."
