If you would like to help promote the inspiring words of women and have your work seen by CNN's global audience, please email leading.women@cnn.com by Wednesday, February 4. We've been inundated with quotes -- and now we need your help to bring them to life by creating beautiful illustrations. If so, CNN International is looking for your help with a voluntary project for International Women's Day on March 8. Your work could appear in a gallery on CNN.com and on a CNN International Women's Day Pinterest board. We asked our audience, our journalists and our partners around the world to select the quotes by women that inspire them.
