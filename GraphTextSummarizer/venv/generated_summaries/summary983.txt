When Polish team Lechia Gdansk faced off against Italian club Juventus in the 1983 UEFA Cup Winner's Cup, Gdansk's stadium was packed with Polish supporters. Not many may know what a football match in Gdansk did for democracy in Europe, but Lechia Gdansk fans will never forget. At half-time, the thousands-strong crowd began chanting the name of revolutionary Polish trade union Solidarity, which, in trying to activate social change, had been banned under martial law. This paved the way for semi-free parliamentary elections in Poland, a Solidarity-led government, and inspired a wave of revolutions that brought down communist regimes in Eastern Europe. " That Gdansk would rally behind this revolution should come as no surprise: the Solidarity movement began in the city's shipyards.
