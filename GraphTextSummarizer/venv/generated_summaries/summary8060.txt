"The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren't treated the way I was, they're treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights," she wrote on Tumblr hours before stepping in front of a tractor-trailer on Interstate 71. Consider what happened earlier this month, when Kathleen McCartney, president of Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, sent a campuswide email in support of students protesting grand jury decisions not to charge the police officers who killed Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner in Staten Island. "All lives matter" does not note the discrimination and ostracization of transgender people that apparently led to the torment felt by Leelah Alcorn -- discrimination and ostracization that even occurs within the larger lesbian, gay and bisexual community. You see, because she didn't specifically say "black lives matter," she was accused of minimizing the pain and experience that was specific to the black community. Over my 20-plus years as a journalist, I have covered numerous deaths.
