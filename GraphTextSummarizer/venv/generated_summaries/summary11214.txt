CNN invited families to share their successes and struggles at balancing work and family. " Sandberg talks about the need for women to "lean in" to greater leadership roles at work and insist on equal partnerships at home. Can women -- or for that matter, anyone -- be high-fliers at home and work? " "There are times I ruminate on why I'm not the kind of mom that can stay home and make homemade hummus with organically grown crinkle cut cucumbers, then I stop thinking about that because there is laundry to be done, hugs to give, dinner to cook, homework to check and inevitably something to pull out of the dog's mouth," she wrote. At work, she said, "leaning in" to bigger opportunities -- as Facebook's Sandberg advises women -- doesn't feel realistic, either.
