"Atlanta Hawks GM Danny Ferry should step down after making racist statements about NBA player Luol Deng," Johnson said in a Twitter post Tuesday. A letter obtained by CNN affiliate WSB details comments Danny Ferry, the team's general manager, allegedly made about player Luol Deng during a June conference call about free agents. Ferry, who remains the team's general manager, apologized for the comments in a statement Tuesday, describing them as "insensitive remarks. In the letter, Gearon called for Bruce Levenson, the team's controlling owner, to ask for Ferry's resignation and fire him if he refused. The e-mail bemoaned the high percentage of black cheerleaders and said that white fans may have been scared away by black fans.
