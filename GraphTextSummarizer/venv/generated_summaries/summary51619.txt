Workers at a trash- and recyclables-sorting facility in San Francisco found the poodle mix in a trash bag among other discarded material Friday evening -- just in time, because it was about to drop into a pile bound for a landfill, CNN affiliate KTVU reported. It had wounds to the neck, head and ears, CNN affiliate KGO reported. The dog, believed to be a few months old, apparently was put in a bin of trash that Recology collected and drove to the facility. "We could tell the puppy was still moving, and it was trying to crawl out of the bag itself," Gregory Foster, a material handler at the Recology facility, told KTVU. It was then put on the conveyor belt, where workers separate recyclables from landfill-bound trash, KTVU reported.
