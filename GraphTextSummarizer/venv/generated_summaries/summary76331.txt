We must make sure there is no manipulation of the dialogue of human rights to try to crush countries who fight for their independence," Porras Ponce de Leon said. Among the recommendations offered by other countries and rejected by Venezuela were: --"Respect the independence of the judiciary" (United States) --"Ensure independent, open and transparent selection procedures based on merit for judges and prosecutors" (United Kingdom) --"Step up its efforts to guarantee freedom of expression as well as the safety of journalists in the country" (Indonesia) Porras Ponce de Leon called these "marginal" recommendations made by "old empires. -- Venezuela on Tuesday rejected a number of recommendations made by U.N. member countries as part of a human rights evaluation by the world body. Venezuela's vice minister of foreign affairs, Temir Porras Ponce de Leon, said that the country rejected these recommendations because they were not legitimate. For instance, it agreed to "support the activities of human rights defenders and independent nongovernmental organizations," as suggested by Canada.
