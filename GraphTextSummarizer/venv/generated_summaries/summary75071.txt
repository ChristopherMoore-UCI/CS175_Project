-- Disciplinary proceedings were launched Friday against Croatia international Josip Simunic for alleged pro-Nazi chants after his country had sealed qualification for the 2014 World Cup, FIFA confirmed. According to reports in Croatia, the 35-year-old Simunic has been fined 25,000 kunas ($4,400) by prosecutors in Zagreb for inciting racial unrest. Dinamo Zagreb captain Simunic has denied any political intent behind his impromptu celebration. Its football federation also reacted to Simunic's actions, with chief Davor Suker describing them as "an inappropriate gesture" and hinting at further action. In September, Simunic was the center of further controversy during Croatia's qualifying match against bitter rivals Serbia.
