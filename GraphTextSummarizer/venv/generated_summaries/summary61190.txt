Garar was responsible for "coordinating the terror group's external operations, which target U.S. persons and other Western interests in order to further al Qaeda's goals and objectives," the Pentagon said in the statement. Al-Shabaab has been blamed and taken responsibility for attacks on city streets, at markets, at prisons and a U.N. compound in Mogadishu. Adan Garar, a member of Al-Shabaab's intelligence and security wing, was killed Thursday in southwestern Somalia as he traveled in a vehicle, according to Pentagon news release. A key Al-Shabaab operative, who was connected to the Westgate mall attack in Kenya, was killed recently by a U.S. drone strike, the Pentagon announced Wednesday. In September, Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Abdi Godane was also killed in a U.S. airstrike near Barawe city.
