In concert, the similarity became almost eerie: The band kicked off its set by nailing the first three tracks from 1992's "Dirt," ("Them Bones," "Dam That River" and "Rain When I Die"), with Duvall recreating Staley's vocal lines with the same studiousness of guitarist Jerry Cantrell, who delivered his solos note-for-note. So do fans who know every word to the new songs, but shuffle off to buy a t-shirt during classic tracks like "Down in a Hole" and the ever-creepy "Love, Hate, Love." One question loomed large before Friday's Alice in Chains concert at Madison Square Garden: How would new singer William Duvall measure up to Layne Staley, the band's original front man, who died in 2002? On "Black Gives Way to Blue," the album Alice in Chains released last year with Duvall (ending a fourteen-year hiatus for the group), the new guy sounds remarkably like Staley. In that sense, Alice in Chains have changed: The show felt more like a recital than an exorcism, as it would have with Staley.
