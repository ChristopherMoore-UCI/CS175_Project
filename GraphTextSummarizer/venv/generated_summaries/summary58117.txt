Guangzhou, China's reigning champions, started the spending spree last year by signing Argentine playmaker Dario Conca from Brazilian side Fluminense for a national record transfer fee. Conca has since been joined in China by former France striker Nicolas Anelka, who, after a prolific career across Europe, swapped Chelsea for Shanghai Shenhua in January. "There are things happening in Chinese football but there is still a long way to go," Asian football expert John Duerden told CNN. " Duerden said the surge in football spending in China has been financed by powerful political figures, but that it may be detrimental to the future of the sport in the country. The next generation of China's leaders, including the next president are fans of football, and it is a great way for business leaders to get close to the decision-makers.
