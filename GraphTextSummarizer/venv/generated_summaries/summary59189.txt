But Sharapova hurt her hip in a second-round defeat to qualifier Michelle Larcher de Brito at Wimbledon and lost to highly touted American Sloane Stephens in Cincinnati with Connors in the stands. In announcing her association with Groeneveld -- who has worked with Ana Ivanovic, Andy Murray and Caroline Wozniacki -- Sharapova also revealed she returned to practice after a worrying shoulder injury that has kept the 25-year-old off the tour since the summer. "I'm happy to announce my official partnership with Sven Groeneveld," Sharapova told her website. Sharapova has been without a coach since dumping former No. 1 Jimmy Connors in August -- they lasted one match together. No, the Russian hasn't split up with tennis playing boyfriend Grigor Dimitrov.
