Chief engineer Matt Denton spent three years designing and testing the machine before completing a successful test drive last year. Weighing in at 1,900 kilograms (4,190 pounds) and measuring 2.8 meters (9.1 feet) tall, Mantis is the biggest all-terrain operational hexapod in the world, according to Winchester-based animatronics and robotics company Micromagic Systems. "Seeing the imposing images of an AT-AT (All Terrain Armored Transport) walking across a snowscape really got me fascinated with the concept of using legged locomotion on vehicles. "My fascination with walking machines started at a young age watching sci-fi films such as 'The Empire Strikes Back,'" he explains. Denton started building hexapods in 2001 -- his smaller robots have even featured in the "Harry Potter" film series.
