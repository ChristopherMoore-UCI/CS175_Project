Launching in early 2015, the first-ever Chinese version of Big Brother will air for ten weeks, with production in China set to begin shortly, according to Endemol China -- part of the Asian arm of one of the world's leading multi-platform program makers -- who will partner with Chinese digital video platform Youku Tudou Inc. to produce the show. "In a market that annually generates hundreds of billions of video views, partnering with the number one digital video platform will allow us to bring Big Brother to a young audience and deliver the most immersive, interactive and unique experience to fans across the nation," said Endemol's CEO of Asian Operations Arjen van Mierlo. Fifteen years after its launch, Big Brother continues to be a worldwide hit that engages passionate young fans across multiple platforms. Victor Koo, Chairman and CEO of Youku Tudou Inc. said: "We are delighted to be joining forces with Endemol to finally bring this groundbreaking format to China. The announcement comes at a time when authorities are concerned about the lack of originality and diversity of Chinese programs, as well as "excessive" and "vulgar" entertainment -- with foreign content in their crosshairs.
