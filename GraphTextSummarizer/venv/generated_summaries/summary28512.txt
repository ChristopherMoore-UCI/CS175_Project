" Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda, has launched a series of attacks in Kenya since Kenyan forces went into neighboring Somalia in 2011 to battle the extremists. "Our Mujhahideen forces are always ready to launch frequent deadly cross-border attacks against Kenya as a revenge," group spokesman Sheikh Ali Dheere said in a statement read on a pro-Al-Shabaab radio station in Somalia. Al-Shabaab militants raided a quarry in Kenya, separating non-Muslim workers from their Muslim counterparts and executing them, a spokesman for the group said Tuesday. Kenyan soldiers have targeted militants' hideouts across Somalia, prompting retaliatory attacks from the terror group. National police chief resigns After news of the quarry attack surfaced, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said he accepted the resignation of the country's national police chief, David Kimaiyo.
