-- A handwritten letter thought to have been penned by the suspect in last month's ambush of two Pennsylvania State Police troopers details how he shot the officers and then escaped, two senior law enforcement officials in Pennsylvania told CNN on Monday. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. State police spokesman Trooper Tom Kelly issued a statement Monday saying that he could not confirm any information provided by unnamed sources. Frein has been described as a survivalist and military reenactment enthusiast with a hatred for law enforcement, authorities say. Authorities previously said that a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein showed that he had planned the attack for years.
