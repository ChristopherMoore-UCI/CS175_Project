-- Engine trouble during takeoff forced a Delta plane headed to the Bahamas to return to Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport on Thursday morning. Delta Flight 717, bound for Nassau, departed about 10:40 a.m. with 182 passengers and six crew members on board, according to Delta spokesman Anthony Black. In the meantime, the plane will be swapped with another aircraft, and passengers were scheduled to take off about 1:45 p.m. Passenger Angela Havely said flames emerged from the left engine on takeoff. The plane turned around and landed at Hartsfield after problems with the engine, he said.
