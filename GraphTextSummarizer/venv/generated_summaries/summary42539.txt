And CNN obtained tapes of American terrorists recruiting friends in the United States to join terror groups like ISIS. In the 55-minute video titled "Flames of War," the jihadist switches from classical Arabic to perfect English with a North American accent, and appears to orchestrate a mass execution of Syrian soldiers. The FBI on Tuesday asked for the public's help in identifying an English-speaking militant who appeared to help execute Syrian soldiers in an ISIS recruitment video released last month. The jihadist, whose face is covered except for his eyes, claims they are Syrian soldiers assigned to a 17th Division military base near the Syrian city of Raqqa, and who, after an ISIS attack, were "digging their own graves in the very place where they were stationed. It was not immediately clear how many had joined ISIS and how many were with other groups opposed to the Syrian government.
