Lohan, who was not required to attend Tuesday's arraignment, must be in court January 30 when the judge and lawyers prepare for next month's trial. "Do you still represent Ms. Lohan?" The Santa Monica city attorney filed four misdemeanor charges against her, prompting a Los Angeles County Superior Court commissioner to revoke Lohan's probation last month. But confusion surrounds the question of who will defend Lohan, 26, when she goes on trial February 27 after her longtime lawyer received a letter saying she was fired. In the Santa Monica case, Lohan is accused of telling police her assistant was driving the Porsche, while witnesses told investigators they saw Lohan behind the wheel.
