-- Three church bombings and retaliatory attacks in northern Nigeria killed at least 50 people Sunday and injured more than 130 others, the Nigerian Red Cross Society said. The series of attacks began when a suicide bomber drove at high speed through a barricade at the EWCA Goodnews Wusasa Zaria church around 9 a.m., congregation member Lucy Bello said. Boko Haram has previously carried out attacks, including at churches. Later, at least 10 people were killed in a bombing at a church in the city of Kaduna, Red Cross spokesman Andronicus Adeyemo said. No one immediately took responsibility for Sunday's attacks, though Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan suggested they were the work of Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group.
