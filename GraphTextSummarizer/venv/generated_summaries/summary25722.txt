Anti-rape activists complained when the Indian government restricted the showing of a BBC documentary about rape that included comments from one of those men. A series of rape cases involving girls, foreign tourists and a physiology student who died following a brutal gang rape in 2012 has hurt India's international reputation. The investigation into the burglary and rape is ongoing, and no arrests have yet been made, Salim told CNN. Experts say the causes of the high number of rapes include the nation's patriarchy, widespread poverty and lack of law enforcement in rural areas. " Official data in India show that rape cases have jumped almost 875% over the past 40 years -- from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011.
