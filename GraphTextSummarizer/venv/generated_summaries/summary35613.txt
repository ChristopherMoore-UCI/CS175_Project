Libyan Justice Minister Salah Marghani said the United States is still a friend of Libya's, but he called for U.S. officials to loop his government in before carrying out such operations. Aspiring Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad, the so-called underwear bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, radical cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri and al Qaeda propagandist Sulaiman Abu Ghaith -- all were convicted and sentenced in U.S. courts. Taking Abu Khatallah by sea, rather than by air, is giving them "maximum time to question him," U.S. officials said. About that trial Once the USS New York has neared U.S. shores, officials will put Abu Khatallah into a helicopter and fly him onto land. But U.S. investigators have collected evidence against him for two years, and the accused will be tried on three charges in federal court that include killing while attacking a federal facility and material support of terrorism.
