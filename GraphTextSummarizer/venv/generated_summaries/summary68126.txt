-- On this week's Tech Check podcast, Doug Gross, John Sutter and Stephanie Goldberg discuss some pretty big advances in car technology that could be just a few years away from becoming a reality. Our Reader Comments of the Week come from our stories this week about internet privacy -- most notably concerns by lawmakers and state attorneys about Google's upcoming changes to its privacy policy. The tech, which is being tested now, lets automobiles, in effect, talk to each other -- for safety and other reasons. You can also download the podcast on iTunes or using mobile apps like Stitcher. In other news we talk about a billboard in London that shows you a different ad based on your gender.
