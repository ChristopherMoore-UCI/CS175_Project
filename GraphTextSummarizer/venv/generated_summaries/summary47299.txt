The FARC has been waging war against the government since the 1960s and has major strongholds in the jungles of southwest Colombia, near the 366-mile (590-kilometer) border with Ecuador. Many refugees end up in Ecuador because it's the nearest country to the killing fields of southwestern Colombia. "More and more citizens in southern Colombia have been forced out and had nowhere else to go but Ecuador." Beattie, the aid agency official, has noticed the same phenomena. That's what happened earlier this year to the Awa tribe in southwest Colombia. Her father was a politician in Palmira, in southwest Colombia about 17 miles east of Cali.
