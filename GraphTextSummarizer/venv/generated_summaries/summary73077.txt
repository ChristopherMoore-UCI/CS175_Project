The case is under investigation by Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within ICE. Authorities were called Tuesday afternoon to an upscale neighborhood in McLean, Virginia, where they "removed two potential trafficking victims," U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Brandon Montgomery told CNN. The official also pointed out these allegations are similar to several other cases they heard from domestic workers who work for diplomats from the Persian Gulf. -- Federal authorities are investigating a potential case of human trafficking at the suburban Washington home of a Saudi diplomat, officials said Wednesday. According to ICE, cases like this are very "victim-centric," meaning that once there is "confirmation of suspicions," authorities immediately go in and remove the victim and then begin the investigation.
