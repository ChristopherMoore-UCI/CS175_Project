She was, after all, not physically barricaded against her will in the House of Horrors, like the three women held captive by Ariel Castro for years in Cleveland, nor was she chained in the wilderness and disguised in a wig, sunglasses and a veil the way Elizabeth Smart was when she was rescued after nine months of absolute hell. Most victims are terrified to come forward fearing no one will believe them because neighbors and friends never witness the abuse. In an interview with The Associated Press, Elizabeth Smart cautioned people to not question why a victim might not have escaped sooner: "We don't know what these evil people are holding over them -- whether it's their families' lives, their lives, whatever it is. The reason: In recent years, the victim has been living in plain sight with her kidnapper. With no network of friends or extended family, no education, no roots and no papers, she was allegedly completely under her captor's control.
