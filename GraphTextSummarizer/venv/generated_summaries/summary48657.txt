A recent search of the home of George Zimmerman's girlfriend uncovered five weapons, including an AR-15, and more than 100 rounds of ammunition, court documents filed Monday show. The Florida judge that set his bail put numerous conditions on it: -- Zimmerman cannot go to two Florida addresses.-- Zimmerman fatally shot Martin in the Sanford neighborhood where Zimmerman and Martin's father lived in February 2012. A search of the home turned up three handguns, a 12-gauge shotgun, a rifle and 106 rounds of ammunition, including two AR-15 magazines, according to a search warrant. Zimmerman, acquitted in the death of Trayvon Martin this year, was arrested last week at the home, which he shares with his girlfriend, on suspicion of his having pointed a shotgun at her.
