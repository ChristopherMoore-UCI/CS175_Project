He was present for the first Veterans Day in 1918 -- though it was originally called Armistice Day -- that marked the end of WWI. -- Frank Buckles considered it his duty to represent his fellow soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery on Veterans Day. Buckles was an officer's escort in France before joining a detail transporting German prisoners of war. Buckles, 107, who is the sole living U.S. World War I veteran, attended ceremonies Tuesday at the grave of Gen. John Pershing, the top U.S. commander in that war. "I can see what they're honoring, the veterans of World War I." "Time has passed very quickly to me," he said after a wreath-laying.
