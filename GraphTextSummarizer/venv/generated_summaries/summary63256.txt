The boys had been removed from the care of Joshua Michael Hakken and his wife, Sharyn Patricia Hakken, last year, and on Tuesday the couple's parental rights were terminated in Louisiana, investigators say. Authorities said the abducted children are Chase Hakken, 2, and Cole Hakken, 4. Sheriff's investigators say Hakken entered Hauser's home at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday. At some point over the past few months, the children were sent to Tampa to live with their grandmother, Patricia Hauser, the mother of Sharyn Hakken. The sheriff's office told CNN there have been ongoing issues with Hakken since he attended an anti-government rally somewhere in Louisiana in June of last year.
