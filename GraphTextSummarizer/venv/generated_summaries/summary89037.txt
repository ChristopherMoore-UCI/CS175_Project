That might be why Team Aniston shirts sold faster than Team Jolie shirts, Ross said, adding, "It was 25 to one at the beginning." As Pitt set to wed Angelina Jolie, ex-wife Jennifer Aniston announces her engagement..." are any indication, the media has no intention of giving up on the love triangle. "My guess is that most people on Team Jolie would not be focusing on the fact that Brad Pitt left Jennifer Aniston for her," said James C. Kaufman, a professor of psychology at California State University at San Bernardino and editor of the APA journal of Psychology of Popular Media Culture. "We like to take sides on everything," said Fraser Ross, who owns Kitson, a boutique that sold Team Aniston and Team Jolie shirts back in 2005. It's been seven years since "Team Aniston" and "Team Jolie" T-shirts were flying off the shelves.
