Huntsman himself has also battled cancer, and has survived prostate cancer, mouth cancer and two types of skin cancer. The new laboratories will be used to further study genetic childhood cancers and cancers that affect families, including the three leading causes of disease death in children: leukemia, sarcoma and brain cancer. The 220,000-square-foot addition will be used to find cures for childhood cancers, and will double the Huntsman Cancer Institute's research space, said the 76-year-old businessman and philanthropist, father of former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr. Patients who are treated at the cancer center are teamed up with cancer specialists as well as researchers who are trying to find better ways to treat and, hopefully, cure them. "The only way to make progress on cancer is to keep delving deeper and deeper in the research technology." says Huntsman. Huntsman's mother, who taught him about the importance of giving, died from cancer, as did his father and stepmother.
