Some of the designers that come to mind are Holly Stalder, Elizabeth Dye, Anna Korte, Kate Towers, Nom & Ada, as well as Project Runway's Leanne Marshall, Gretchen Jones, Seth Aaron (Henderson) and Janeane Marie (Ceccanti). Besides owning a good coat and boots ("a must") to combat Portland's long cold, rainy season, the locals are jazzing up their style with splashes of color, designer finds and thrifty picks. Warninger: A lot of people like to support local fashion designers here, so what I find is people will invest in a designer piece and the rest of the outfit will be thrifted. Lisa Warninger,  Portland street style blogger for Urban Weeds, came to Oregon's largest city five years ago and has been captivated by the unique city vibe ever since. It may be emerging in other cities, but Portland is doing it to an extreme.
