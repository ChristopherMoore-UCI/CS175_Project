Under the Bush administration, more than 2 million people infected with HIV -- most of them in Africa -- have received lifesaving anti-retroviral treatment as part of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. "I salute President Bush for his leadership in crafting a plan for AIDS relief in Africa and backing it up with funding dedicated to saving lives and preventing the spread of the disease," Obama said in taped remarks to the Saddleback Civil Forum on Global Health. Afterward, first lady Laura Bush said, "That's sweet, so sweet." Bush, who was awarded the first "International Medal of Peace" by Saddleback Church Pastor Rick Warren, said Monday the program had beaten its goal of getting anti-retroviral medicines to 2 million people infected with HIV within five years. Even with Bush's effort, WHO reports that only 31 percent of people in low- to middle-income countries who needed treatment received it last year, and the number of new cases is increasing 2.7 times faster than the number of new people getting treatment. PEPFAR was launched in 2003, when just 50,000 people in all of sub-Saharan Africa were receiving anti-retroviral treatment.
