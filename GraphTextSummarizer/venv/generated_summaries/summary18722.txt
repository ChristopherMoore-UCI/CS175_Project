A 2003 Brookings Institution report observed that, though most Iraqi Sunni tribes were loyal to Saddam Hussein in the days when he ran the country, the Albu Nimr tribe had mounted a protest against the former Iraqi strongman in 1995 after the execution of a noted member. They have been fighting ISIS but say they haven't received much support from the Iraqi government and international coalition members. Albu Nimr tribesmen were among those who fought them until they began running of out weapons and supplies. Al-Ga'oud said an attack is "imminent," adding that "we are getting the support we need," in an apparent reference to backing by Iraq's central government. Some of the 322 people executed were women and children, Iraq's Ministry of Human Rights said.
