"They immediately hugged," said Jim Waldron, an attorney who arranged the meeting at the request of Deprill's birth mother told CNN affiliate WFMZ. 'She had no other means' Waldron said Deprill's birth mother had been raped while traveling in another country and become pregnant. Deprill declined to identify her birth mom, saying "she did not want to be in the limelight." Deprill told the affiliate that her birth mother wants to be involved  her life, and she hopes they'll meet again soon.
