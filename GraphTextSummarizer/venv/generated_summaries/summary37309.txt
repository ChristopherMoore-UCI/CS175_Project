For the world's two largest economies -- and largest emitters of greenhouse gas -- to announce a sustained commitment to reducing carbon emissions by almost a third by the year 2030 is a watershed moment for climate politics on so many fronts. The increased global spotlight on China's climate policies will change international despair on climate. Australia has become a pariah state on climate since the election of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government last year. With so many meetings of world leaders in quick succession, the opportunity for building momentum on global climate solutions has never been better. Secondly, it provides a new benchmark for international negotiations to break the lethargy we have seen at climate summits over the past decade.
