Prosecutors said Vineberg, who was arrested on a felony charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance, had just under 50 small bags of heroin as well as packaging paraphernalia in his apartment during the raid. The judge, however, appeared to doubt that assertion, saying that the amount of heroin in Vineberg's possession was "off the charts. Asked if his client sold heroin to Hoffman, Kratt said: "I really can't comment on that. Vineberg is due back in court Tuesday. I know that he did have a relationship with Mr. Hoffman as a friend, how that translated into other aspects of their behavior, I really can't comment.
