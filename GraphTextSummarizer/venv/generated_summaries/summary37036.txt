Robot technology has exploded in the past six years, said Army scientist John Parmentola. Of course, to apply this technology, the Army needs a way to safely remove injured soldiers from combat zones. Scientists say the scaffold allows the body to regrow its own natural tissue, bone and veins so it can support itself. Army scientists also have developed an engineered skin substitute made in a laboratory from patients' own cells. With the regrown bone, scientists could avoid placing titanium or other medical devices in the body.
