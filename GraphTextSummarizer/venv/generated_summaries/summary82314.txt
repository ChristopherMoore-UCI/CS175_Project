-- Japan's robust economic recovery this year could put an end to a deflationary spiral that has sapped growth for some 14 years, says the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). However, the OECD warned that Japan's economic recovery was "surrounded by uncertainty" given the country's high debt levels, which amount to more than 200% of gross domestic product (GDP). In its annual economic outlook, the OECD projects Japanese consumer prices will begin rising modestly by the end of this year, with the inflation rate reaching 2.4% by the end of 2014. The moves have led to a rally in the Nikkei stock index and a slide in the yen that has made corporate Japan more competitive overseas. In recession as recently as last year, Japan's economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5% in the first three months of 2013, much quicker than the 2.7% expected by analysts.
