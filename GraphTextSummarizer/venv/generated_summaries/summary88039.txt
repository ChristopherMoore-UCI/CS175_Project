Clinic officials say House Bill 1390, which was signed into law in April, imposes unnecessary guidelines and requires abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The owners of Mississippi's only abortion clinic are headed back to federal court in another attempt to stop a new state law which could close its doors -- effectively banning abortion in the state. "A lot of facilities and hospitals, no doubt, don't want to... be labeled as the one facility that's hospitable to providing abortions," said Prof. W. Martin Wiseman, director of the Stennis Institute of Government at Mississippi State University. But the law's sponsor, state Rep. Sam Mims, told CNN the measure's purpose was not to eliminate abortion. Opinion: Mississippi's end run around abortion "Hopefully we'll get a federal judge to see that the state of Mississippi has effectively banned abortion in the state and we hope the judge declares it unconstitutional," she told CNN.
