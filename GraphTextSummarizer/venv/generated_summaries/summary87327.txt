The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. It marks the largest in Powerball history, surpassing a $587.6 million jackpot split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November. That mark will be dwarfed if no one wins the Powerball jackpot Saturday. The winning numbers for the largest multistate Powerball jackpot are: 22, 10,13,14, 52 and the Powerball number is 11. But that didn't stop hundreds from driving to the Trex Mart in Dearborn, Missouri, store where one of two winning tickets sold in last year's $587 million Powerball drawing.
