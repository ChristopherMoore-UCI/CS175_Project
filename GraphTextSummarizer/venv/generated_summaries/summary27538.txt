At the men's Rogers Cup tournament, the Masters 1000 event in Toronto, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga continued his fine run with a three-set victory over former Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. 13th seed Tsonga had won the first set on a tiebreak, but after Murray had leveled at one set all, the Frenchman trailed 0-3 in the decider and looked set to go out. It was to set up a semifinal match with her elder sister Venus, who later also came from a set down to beat Carla Suarez Navarro. Tsonga, who beat top seed Novak Djokovic in the previous round, will take Bulgaria's rising your star Grigor Dimitrov for a place in the final. She won 10 of the next 11 games to go 4-1 up in the decider and although Navarro briefly rallied she was always trailing.
