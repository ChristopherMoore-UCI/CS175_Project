She joins returning "Flowers" cast members Heather Graham and Ellen Burstyn, who will reprise their roles Cathy's wicked mother and grandmother, respectively. The novel on which Petals is based picks up immediately where Flowers leaves off, covering a sequence of events that take place over the course of 12 years; Lifetime's movie version will take a different approach, beginning a decade after the events of the first movie. McIver will inherit the role from Kiernan Shipka, who played Cathy from ages 12 through 15 in the first film. EW can confirm that 26-year-old Rose McIver will star as Cathy in "Petals on the Wind," the network's upcoming sequel to its hit adaptation of V.C. Andrews's "Flowers in the Attic."
