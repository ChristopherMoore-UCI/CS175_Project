-- Four years ago, lobster fisherman Gary Nichols had never laid eyes on a lionfish, but today his traps are full of them. Not only are lionfish causing grief for lobster fishermen like Nichols, they are also threatening to upset the balance of the fragile reef ecosystem. "What we've found through stomach analysis and working with fish that have been collected is that they are consuming a wide variety of prey," said Lad Akins, director of special projects for REEF, a marine conservation group. By encouraging more people to eat lionfish, Kosiek hopes to entice fishermen to get them out of the ocean. Lionfish are causing a huge strain on his business and the wider commercial fishing industry in Florida, devouring other fish populations -- in some cases reducing them by up to 90%.
