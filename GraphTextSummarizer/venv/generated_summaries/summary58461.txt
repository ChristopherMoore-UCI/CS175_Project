At the Principalist Front rally on Friday, where candidates took turns addressing several hundred people seated on the floor of a mosque, candidate Zohreh Elahian sought to downplay previous divisions between pro- and anti-Ahmadinejad conservative factions. But at a campaign rally for candidates from the conservative Principalist Front on Wednesday, one lawmaker running for re-election offered a decidedly different account of the aftermath of the 2009 vote. Instead, Iranian political analysts describe Friday's vote as a contest between rival conservative factions within the government. " In Iran, elections are traditionally heralded by the revolutionary regime as a popular demonstration that it enjoys the overwhelming support of the population. But this Friday's contest will also mark the first time Iranians go to the polls since allegations of vote-rigging during presidential elections in 2009 triggered mass street demonstrations against the regime.
