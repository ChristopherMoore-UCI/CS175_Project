Galbraith reportedly angered Karzai by calling for a complete recount after widespread allegations of election fraud and was abruptly recalled as Eide's deputy on September 30. U.N. representative to Afghanistan Kai Eide is under fire by critics who say he did not address election fraud. " Karzai called for the immediate release of election results "so the people of Afghanistan know their future and come out of uncertainty caused by the Western media and some elements in Western countries. Galbraith blamed Eide for "denying or playing down the fraud" in the election because "he was concerned that even discussing the fraud might inflame tensions in the country." "But in my view, the fraud was a fact that the United Nations had to acknowledge or risk losing its credibility with the many Afghans who did not support President Hamid Karzai," Galbraith wrote. In his October 4 op-ed, Galbraith said the disagreement was not about "how" UNAMA would respond to electoral fraud, but "whether" it would respond.
