Putting an end to bullying will require a consistent message from adults, including lawmakers, that young people can make a real difference in their lives and the lives of others when they speak up about bullying and harassment. Recently, I reintroduced bipartisan legislation to help prevent bullying and harassment -- the Safe Schools Improvement Act. My bill, which I'm proposing with co-sponsor Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, will require school districts that receive federal funding to develop codes of conduct that specifically ban bullying and harassment. I am particularly disturbed by stories of bullied youth who feel powerless to change their situation and who choose not to seek help from adults. -- CNN and the Cartoon Network's presentation of the AC360Â° special feature, "The Bully Effect," spotlight a serious issue affecting children across our nation.
