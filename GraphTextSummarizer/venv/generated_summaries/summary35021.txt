-- Officials monitoring the River Tiber in Rome fear it could break its banks as early as Friday evening after a spate of bad weather in Italy -- but do not expect major flooding. A rescue boat patrols the swollen River Tiber in central Rome early Friday. Because of the intense rain, the streets of some northern Rome neighborhoods were already flooded by water and covered in thick brown mud. Guido Bertolaso, the head of the Italian Civil Protection Department said that there is a 20 to 30 percent chance the river could break its banks and cause disruption in some neighborhoods in northern Rome, but not in the historic city center. Police have blocked access to some pedestrian bridges and river banks, while residents are being urged to use their vehicles only if necessary.
