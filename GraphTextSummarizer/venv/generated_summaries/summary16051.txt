Xu Caihou, a retired PLA general and former vice-chairman of the powerful Central Military Commission (CMC), was taken from his sick bed at 301 Military Hospital in Beijing on Saturday by dozens of armed policemen, the South China Morning Post reported, quoting unidentified sources. More than 20 minister-level officials have been "taken down" since the major Communist Party meeting last November, various Chinese media reported. He has not been seen in public for several months until January 20, when the Chinese media showed him with President Xi greeting a group of retired military officials on the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year. He has pushed big anti-graft campaigns, pledging to target not just "mosquitoes" (minor officials) but also "tigers" (top officials). Several days ago, he issued a call to add "chili pepper" to the anti-graft campaign, as the hunt for corrupt officials heats up.
