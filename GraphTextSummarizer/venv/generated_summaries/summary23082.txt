A ghetto of dark alleyways crammed with tiny ramshackle bars, Golden Gai evokes a bygone bohemian Tokyo of the 1960s. At once kitsch, cozy and classy, it's a truly unique space by Tokyo design gurus Wonderwall. You'll find it tucked away on the seventh floor of the Shin-Marunouchi Building (1-5-1 Marunouchi) right across the street from Tokyo Station. If you manage to locate it, you'll discover that Kita Aoyama Salon (Yamahazi Building, B1F, 2-7-18 Kita Aoyama, Minato-ku) is one of the city's coolest bars. Propaganda (Yua Roppongi Building 2F 3-14-9 Roppongi, Minato-ku) is an unfussy, affable shot bar with a good-value happy hour.
