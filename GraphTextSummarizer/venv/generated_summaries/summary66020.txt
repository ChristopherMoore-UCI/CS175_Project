"There is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man's inhumanity to man. During World War II, about 117,000 people of Japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps. The lots have been packed away for now, said auction house partner David Rago in an email. The items are crafts and artifacts made by Japanese-Americans confined to World War II internment camps. "Once the dust settles from this auction weekend (1,200 lots in three days) we will work with a small group of people from the Japanese-American community who have identified themselves through this process as generous, informed, voices of reason," he wrote.
