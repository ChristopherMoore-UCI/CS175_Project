While the U.S. sanctioned itself out of playing a role in resource-rich Myanmar over the past few decades, China has been aggressively pursuing its commercial interests, and today China is the country's main trading partner and arms supplier. The pace of change in Myanmar over recent months has stunned even the most skeptical observers. So far, the U.S. government has responded by lifting travel restrictions on some officials -- including Wunna Maung Lwin, Myanmar's foreign minister, who met with U.S. officials in Washington and New York in September and on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Hawaii earlier in November. Re-engaging Myanmar is part of this strategic reorientation. re-engagement could open the way to clarifying the military's nuclear ambitions, which have become all the more disturbing in light of U.S. Sen. Richard Lugar's recent disclosure that he received information several years ago that Myanmar's government planned to develop nuclear weapons with North Korea's assistance.
