But some Democrats say there may be a silver lining: It could motivate younger women and unmarried women to show up at the polls. -- Monday's Supreme Court ruling giving certain companies a right to raise religious objections to providing some types of birth control insurance to their employees leaves a number of important questions in its wake. The White House says women employed by companies like the two firms at the center of the appeal -- arts-and-crafts retail giant Hobby Lobby and the much smaller Conestoga Wood Specialties -- have been hurt. In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called the decision "sweeping." Jonathan Turley, law professor at George Washington University, agreed. So giving corporations religious rights opens a legal "minefield," she argued.
