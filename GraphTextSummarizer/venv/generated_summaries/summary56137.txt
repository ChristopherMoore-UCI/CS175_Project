(See him challenge a buffalo on YouTube) Today, Brock said, people still come up to him and say "I grew up watching you on 'Wild Kingdom' " or "I became a wildlife biologist or a marine biologist because of watching you on 'Wild Kingdom.' Brock's forte was the lasso, and he was eventually discovered and brought on as a co-host of Mutual of Omaha's "Wild Kingdom," an educational television series that aired in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. Brock took the initiative, getting his pilot's license and a small plane to bring medical care to the people that he worked with -- and even the animals for which he cared. But Brock said most people -- as many as 85% of the people on a clinic's first day -- are there to see a dentist or an eye doctor. "We took care of them, (and) it wasn't more than another week before I got the same request from the next county over." Soon, Brock said, they were so busy in the United States that the group had to cut back on overseas commitments to meet obligations at home.
