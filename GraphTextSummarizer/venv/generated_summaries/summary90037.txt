The musician, who plans to marry his partner David Furnish next year, talked to Sky News on Sunday about how pleased he is with Pope Francis and how he wishes the Church of England would show greater support for his message. "These are old and stupid things, and the church hierarchy might be up in arms about it -- the traditionalists -- but times have changed," John said. So when it comes to issues such as vows of celibacy for Catholic priests and gay clergymen being able to marry, John said the church needs to catch up with the times. As far as coming together for John's nuptials, fans shouldn't expect a large affair. "The new Pope has excited me so much by his humanity," John said.
