A "no" vote threatens to unravel the deal, which was greeted last week with fanfare as a way to keep debt woes in Greece and other European nations from spilling across other borders, threatening the 17 nations united under the euro currency. The deal reached last week would see the country's sky-high debts cut in half, but it comes with strings attached, which have led to angry demonstrations in the streets of Greece. A weekend survey in Greece found nearly 60% opposed the debt deal reached last week in Brussels. " White House spokesman Jay Carney struck a similar note, saying Papandreou's move reinforced the need for Europe "to elaborate further and implement rapidly the decisions they made last week. He suggested Papandreou would have to call elections or stand down as leader, as Greece was "not governable" with him as prime minister.
