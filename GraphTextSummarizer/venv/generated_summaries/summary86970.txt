"For those states that are choosing a path other than Common Core, I say this: That's fine, except you should be aiming even higher and be bolder and raise standards and ask more for our students and our system," he said at a summit in Washington hosted by his education group, Foundation for Excellence in Education, a major backer of Common Core standards. "The rigor of the Common Core state standards must be the new minimum in classrooms," â€‹he added, stressing the need to embrace challenging standards. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush swung back at critics of Common Core on Thursday, challenging those who refuse to adopt the controversial testing standards, which have made him a target by conservatives, to come up with something better. On Common Core, Bush squarely hit back at critics who say the testing standards are too high. But if states want a share of President Barack Obama's Race to the Top education grants, one of the ways to get it is by adopting Common Core.
