On Saturday, Justin DiPietro and Ayla's mother, Trista Reynolds, appeared together publicly for the first time since their daughter's disappearance to thank those who have tried to help locate Ayla, CNN affiliate WCSH reported. Trista Reynolds had told HLN's Nancy Grace last month that she raised Ayla for 18 months, and that DiPietro had become involved after she "needed to go and get a little bit of help for myself." Justin DiPietro -- the father of Ayla, who was 20 months old when authorities began looking for her last month -- sleeps in the basement of the home, which is owned by his mother. Maine police revealed Saturday that blood was found in missing toddler Ayla Reynolds' basement and, for the first time, cast doubt on the accounts of adults who were in the home when she was last seen -- saying they don't "pass the 'straight-face' test in Maine. Two days before Ayla was reported missing, Reynolds filed court documents seeking custody of the girl.
