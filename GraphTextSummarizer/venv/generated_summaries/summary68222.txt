But how likely will Malala's work and physical sacrifice actually lead to greater access to quality education for girls in Pakistan? This year, Pakistan will observe Malala's 16th birthday as "Malala Day." Brown met with Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari, who had visited Malala in the hospital in the U.K. and vowed to stand up for girls' education and fight extremism. "I was there in Pakistan at the time [of Malala's shooting]," Brown said. It's unlikely for her own safety that Malala will ever be able to return there, and unlikely for her father as well, say observers who know Pakistan well.
