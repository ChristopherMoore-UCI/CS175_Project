The judge's order is the latest development in a feud between King's daughter and two sons -- Dexter King and Martin Luther King III -- over control of the Bible and Nobel prize. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting "substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America" for his own use. According to the complaint, King's heirs agreed in 1995 to give up their inheritance to the Estate of Martin Luther King Jr. Inc., but Bernice King has "secreted and sequestered" the items in question. Bernice King, who was 5 when her father was assassinated, is acting as "the gatekeeper" to her father's property, said attorney William Hill, who represents the King estate. The Bible used to be on display at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta.
