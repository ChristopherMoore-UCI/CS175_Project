"Health officials designed a rigorous process for vetting applicants," said the statement, citing a process that included a selection committee that determined the ability of each applicant to "meet overall health needs to registered patients while ensuring public safety." Medical marijuana dispensaries serve clients who suffer ills ranging from cancer to AIDS to chronic pain. Proponents say the drug's pain-relieving properties offer an alternative for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatments. Patients who have a written certification from a physician for medical marijuana will be registered in an online system, according to the department. Fourteen states allow dispensaries, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
