-- British police said Sunday they would examine evidence suggesting that celebrity chef Nigella Lawson took cocaine. On Friday Lawson spoke out angrily against what she said were false claims of habitual drug use made against her in the trial of sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo. At the trial, both sisters claimed to have seen signs of repeated cocaine and cannabis use by Lawson. The news came days after Lawson's two former personal assistants were cleared of fraud in a trial that saw the chef admit to occasionally using drugs including cocaine. The case gripped UK media, thanks to revelations of drug use by Lawson and insights into her troubled marriage to Saatchi, a millionaire art collector.
