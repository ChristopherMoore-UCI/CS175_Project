Erected in 1922 to honor Nebraska vets who fought in World War I, the Spanish American War, and the Civil War, the stadium is awash in red on game days as fans flood the stadium to cheer on their beloved Huskers and watch replays on one of the largest jumbotrons in college football. Every Saturday, millions of fans across the U.S. stream into college football stadiums like Michigan's Big House to chant, cheer, and stomp for the home teams. While winning helps, the best places to watch college football are based on more than any record. College football drew a combined 49.6 million fans in 2010 -- nearly three times as many as the NFL (17.4 million). There's also a sense -- despite a few recent scandals -- that college football is much "purer" than the pro game.
