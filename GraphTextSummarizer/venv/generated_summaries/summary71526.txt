-- Rep. Ron Barber, one of the last remaining lawmakers whose reelection fate has yet to be decided, has filed suit in federal court asking for 133 disqualified ballots to be counted as his contest with Republican Martha McSally heads to a recount. Barber's campaign tried unsuccessfully last week to delay the canvass of votes in the two counties that make up the district, Pima and Cochise, hoping to buy time to continue to root out other votes that may have been wrongfully discarded. The reasons their votes were discarded range from signatures not lining up with their registrations to election officials failing to direct voters to their proper polling places. "We are talking about 133 Southern Arizona voters who lived up to their responsibility â€” they registered to vote and then showed up to vote," Barber attorney Kevin Hamilton said in a statement out Monday. But his campaign has been working feverishly over the past few weeks to find and gather evidence of ballots they say were illegitimately thrown out.
