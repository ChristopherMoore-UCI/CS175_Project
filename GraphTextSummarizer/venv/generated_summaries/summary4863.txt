Sen. John McCain says comments made by Rep. John Lewis were "unacceptable." Lewis, a Georgia representative and veteran of the civil rights movement, on Saturday compared the feeling at recent Republican rallies to those of segregationist George Wallace. "I will reject that kind of language, and again, I'm so disappointed in Congressman John Lewis." Some McCain supporters have yelled "treason," "kill him" and "terrorist" at recent campaign events. -- Sen. John McCain said Monday that Rep. John Lewis' controversial remarks were "so disturbing" that they "stopped me in my tracks." The Obama campaign said that Obama "does not believe that John McCain or any policy criticism is in any way comparable to George Wallace or his segregationist policies" but said Lewis was "right to condemn some of the hateful rhetoric. He later said a "careful review" of his comments "would reveal that I did not compare Sen. John McCain or Gov. Sarah Palin to George Wallace."
