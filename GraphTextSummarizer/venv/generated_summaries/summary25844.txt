A few hours after her memoirs of her relationship with President François Hollande, called "Merci pour ce moment" (Thanks for the moment) hit the bookstands in France, a new poll showed that the President's approval ratings were in free fall, reaching the historical low of 13%. The greatest casualty however in this affair, is President Hollande and his image, which is now damaged beyond repair. They may have been amused back in January 2014 to learn of their President's gallivanting in the streets of Paris, on a scooter driven by a bodyguard, en route to his belle, actress Julie Gayet, but today, they are not impressed. In fact, Trierweiler was hoping for "a scenario à la Clinton" with Hollande "apologizing in public and committing to never see Julie Gayet again." Trierweiler herself comes out very badly: by dishing the dirt in public, she appears as she is, a scorned woman who can't get over it, full of revenge and full of herself.
