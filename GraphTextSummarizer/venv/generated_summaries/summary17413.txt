-- Most New Yorkers and visitors to Times Square know of The Naked Cowboy. The video ad depicts an M&M frolicking around New York, in what kind of looks like Times Square, in what kind of looks like The Naked Cowboy's outfit -- briefs and nothing more than a smile. His character is part of the USA Network's "Characters Welcome" campaign; he appeared in a music video for the song "Rockstar" by the multiplatinum artist Nickelback; and he's featured singing in the video game "True Crime: New York City at Times Square." The allegations: trademark infringement under the Lanham Act and violation of his right of publicity under New York Civil Rights Law ยง51, arising from a video billboard for M&Ms. As a native New Yorker, I will admit that at times, it has been my guilty pleasure to walk or drive by The Cowboy to see if he can bear the elements.
