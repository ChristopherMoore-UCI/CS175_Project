" Brooks Brothers started selling seersucker suits in the 1920s, said Nickel. Recently worn by the likes of Jay Z, Kanye West, and Leonardo DiCaprio (as designed by Brooks Brothers in the movie "The Great Gatsby"), seersucker has jumped out of its humble beginnings and into the modern dandy's closet. But an interesting social phenomenon happened in the 1920s, thanks to the advent of the seersucker suit, as popularized by Ivy Leaguers and high society men outfitted in Haspel and Brooks Brothers. The 1980s helped develop the association of seersucker with Northeastern preppies, said Nickel. In America, seersucker started out as a blue-collar fabric, used by service staff and factory workers to cope with soaring temperatures in and out of pre-air conditioned buildings.
