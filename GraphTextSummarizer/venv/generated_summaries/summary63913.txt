UK authorities accuse Abu Qatada of raising funds for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and say he has publicly supported the violent activities of those groups. The Court of Appeal in London denied the government's attempt to overturn a different panel's decision to keep Abu Qatada -- accused of raising money for terrorist groups and inspiring one of the 9/11 hijackers -- in Britain. -- Try as it might, the British government just can't seem to get radical cleric Abu Qatada out of the UK. A Jordanian national, Abu Qatada is wanted in his home country and has been been tried and convicted in absentia on two charges of conspiracy to cause explosions, court documents say. Britain has been trying to deport Abu Qatada since 2005, but his legal appeals have kept him in the country.
