Jackson lawyers argue AEG Live executives were negligent because they failed to check Murray's background, which they contend would have revealed his debts and misrepresentations about his successful practices. AEG Live executives testified that they relied on assurances by Jackson that Murray was his "longtime personal doctor," concluding that he was competent for the tour position. Berman testified that AEG Live executives should have recognized there could be a problem with Murray when he initially asked for $5 million for one year as Jackson's doctor. "The fact that if the tour is even just postponed that AEG Live has the ability to cease any further compensation for Dr. Murray, giving Dr. Murray even greater conflict of interest since he was in financial dire straits. Michael Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, contending the concert promoter was liable in his death because it negligently hired, retained or supervised Murray.
