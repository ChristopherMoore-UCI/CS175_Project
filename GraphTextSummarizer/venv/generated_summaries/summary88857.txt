How Superman, Wonder Woman and Batman have changed their looks through the years The profile of the 1960s Batman series has been raised considerably in recent years, with Warner Bros. Consumer Products and DC Entertainment releasing a line of merchandise and comic books based on the series under the brand Batman '66, leading up to last year's release of the full series on DVD and Blu-ray. (The Hollywood Reporter)The skies over Gotham City might become bright once again in 2016, with Adam West and Burt Ward promising a return to their career-high roles of Batman and Robin as part of an upcoming animated project next year. Batman through the years Warner Bros. declined to comment about a potential 50th anniversary animated project when contacted by THR. (That would be the 50th anniversary of the 1960s Batman TV series, which launched Jan. 12, 1966.) The comments took place at the Mad Monster Party in Charlotte, NC this weekend, with Ward somewhat uncertainly telling the crowd that they "can look forward to a new animated "Batman" full length, 90-minute feature, coming out on the 50th anniversary."
