-- The judge in Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's trial on charges of sex with a minor rejected all defense motions Monday and scheduled the next hearing for October 3. Berlusconi at one point passed a law shielding top government officials from prosecution while they're in office, and then saw it struck down by judges. How is this possible?" Berlusconi also faced a second hearing Monday in another case involving accusations of corruption. Berlusconi did not appear at the Ruby trial on Monday. Separately, he is also fighting charges of bribing British lawyer David Mills to secure favorable testimony in legal cases.
