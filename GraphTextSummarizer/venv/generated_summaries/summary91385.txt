And while the traction for Democrats comes in the wake of an expanded military campaign ordered by Obama, roughly two out of three Americans said the economy is more important than military action against ISIS in determining who they'll vote for in the midterms. "That may be a sign that some men wanted to see aggressive action taken against ISIS and are rewarding the President's party -- or simply that the President's actions have convinced men that they don't need to send more Republicans to Washington in order to get action that they are looking for," Holland said. In a generic ballot among likely voters, Democrats edged out Republicans 47-45%, a 6-point swing from a CNN poll three weeks ago when likely voters favored the Republicans by a 4-point margin. The "generic ballot" question which asks Americans to choose between an unnamed Democrat and an unnamed Republican in their vote for U.S. House, suggests a shift toward the Democrats nationally, if not in key races in key states. "That may explain why the Democrats have gained strength on the national "generic ballot" question," CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said.
