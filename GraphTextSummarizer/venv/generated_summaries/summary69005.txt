Namibia was the first African country to incorporate protection of the environment into its constitution, and said its conservation program has contributed to it having the largest free-roaming population of black rhinos in the world 5 white rhinos left in the world Dr. Michael Knight, chairman of the International Union for Conservation of Nature African and Asian Rhino Specialist Groups, said the Namibian black rhino populations have been performing very well, growing at a very healthy 7% per year, thanks to conservation efforts. Marcia Fargnoli, chief executive officer of the Save the Rhino Trust in Namibia, which works with the government to fight poachers, said the group has tried to persuade the Namibian government to stop issuing hunting permits. But a poor African country like Namibia, where the World Bank estimates the gross per capita income to be less than $6,000, struggles to fund conservation efforts, Fargnoli said. That's why they had the auction here, in the hopes that it would bring more money to conservation than the previous permits they have sold in Namibia."
