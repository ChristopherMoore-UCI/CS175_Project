The Senate Intelligence Committee's report on the CIA's "enhanced interrogation" techniques to be released Tuesday concludes that the CIA tortured detainees and that torture did not yield actionable intelligence, Sen. Angus King said Tuesday. President Barack Obama signed an executive order when he came into office in 2009 officially barring U.S. officials from using torture practices, such as waterboarding, that were called "enhanced interrogation" techniques under the Bush administration. But King said releasing the report is key to ensuring the U.S. government is never again involved in torture.

King, who is a member of the committee, called the extensive report "chilling" and said it will show the world that the U.S. is repudiating those practices used in the post-9/11 era under President George W. Bush's tenure.
