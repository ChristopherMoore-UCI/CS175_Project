-- Serena Williams powered to her first Madrid Masters title, hitting 14 aces in a comfortable win over Victoria Azarenka in Sunday's final. Williams hit 26 winners past the Belorussian, taking four of her five break-point chances and denying Azarenka's single break-point opportunity. Williams took just over an hour to take the 41st WTA singles title of her career in a 6-1 6-3 win over the world No. 1. Australian Open champion Azarenka had been looking for her fifth title this year, but was steamrollered by Williams. The in-form Williams, who has won all 13 of her matches on clay this year, set the tone for a dominant performance by winning the first four games against an opponent that had lost just one set in the tournament before the final.
