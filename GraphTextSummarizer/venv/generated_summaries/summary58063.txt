Etan disappeared on May 25, roughly a month before Hernandez left New York to resume living at his mother's South Jersey home, according to family members and police. Police said Hernandez confessed to killing Etan, who disappeared on his way to a New York school bus stop, after passing by the bodega where Hernandez once worked. Hernandez -- who was a stock clerk in Lower Manhattan in May of 1979 -- admitted that he choked the boy after luring him into the basement of the grocery store, police said. The man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz pleaded not guilty Wednesday to two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping in the iconic missing child case that has gripped New York City and the nation for more than three decades. Pedro Hernandez was indicted last month by a grand jury after he confessed in May to killing the child in 1979.
