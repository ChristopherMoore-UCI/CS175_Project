David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group investment company, said, "it is my privilege as an American to be able to give this back to the Archives and let them preserve it, as they have done, and to let them display it as they are going to do." After an initial presentation to the public in 2008, when Rubenstein got the document at a Sotheby's auction for more than $20 million, it was taken off display for replacement of the old, unappealing box made out of aluminum and glass, with a green fabric liner. The only original copy of the Magna Carta in private hands worldwide has a fancy new display case at the National Archives, where the document goes on display next month. The document seems to float above the floor of the display case, just below special glass that blocks damaging ultraviolet light and minimizes glare from subdued external lighting that will be used to illuminate the display. He also owns a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation, on display in the Oval Office of the White House, "and I've lent a copy of the Declaration of Independence to the State Department," he said. She said they were able to repair damaged sections of the parchment and have confirmed certain letters in the text by using special photography and lighting.
