" Facing pressure from farmers, Argentina President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced emergency measures this week that will exempt the worst-hit farmers from paying most taxes for one year. Argentine farmers profited in years past from selling beef to the world, but some now struggle to feed their cattle. As she yanks dead soy plant vines from a dusty field in San Miguel del Monte, Lorena del Rios of the Argentina Rural Society says she expects the drought to affect both Argentine and overseas consumers, especially when it comes to Argentina's world-famous beef. " Kirchner has had a contentious relationship with farmers, who staged noisy protests and strikes last year over an increase in export taxes. The worst drought in half a century has turned Argentina's once-fertile soil to dust and pushed the country into a state of emergency.
