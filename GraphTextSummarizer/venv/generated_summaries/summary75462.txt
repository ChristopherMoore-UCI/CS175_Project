On Friday, shots rang out in the streets of Myanmar's biggest city of Yangon, marking the third straight day of violence at the hands of the ruling military junta to suppress citizen protests. The Internet has also spawned other Myanmar pages. "We didn't do any terrorism, but they sharp-shoot us," one woman said by phone inside Myanmar Thursday. On the popular online community of Facebook, several Myanmar support pages were set up with links keeping a close eye on the latest developments. The Internet connection in Myanmar was cut Friday, limiting the free flow of information the nation's citizens were sharing with the world depicting the violent crackdown on monks and other peaceful demonstrators.
