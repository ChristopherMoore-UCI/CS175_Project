I believe that the use of graphene in solar cells, displays and so on is probably going to be in the marketplace in a couple of years. We need to be patient but things seem to be moving faster than with other materials. TP: If you look at how long it traditionally takes new materials to make an impact in the market, it typically takes around 20 years. TP: The very first application where graphene is going to be used is probably as a replacement for (the relatively expensive metal) indium selenide in solar cells. CNN Labs asked the head of MIT's graphene research department, Tomas Palacios, to explain why graphene is such a special material and what we can expect it to do for us in the future.
