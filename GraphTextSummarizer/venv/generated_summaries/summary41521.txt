"In music, you usually give about four or five commands per sentence, but for children with autism, you just can't do that. "There are so many things just to get a note, all this coordination, which is very important in Mano's case," he said, explaining that it's sometimes difficult for children with autism to perform several tasks at the same time. Barry had taught clarinet to other kids Mano's age but never someone with autism. Her father thought it would help Mano "channel her frustration through music."
