A jury on Saturday night convicted a Florida man on four charges related to his shooting into an SUV full of teenagers during an argument over loud music, but could not decide on the most serious charge -- murder. " Confrontation at a gas station It was November 23, 2012, when Michael Dunn pulled into a gas station in Jacksonville, parking next to a red Dodge Durango full of teenagers. " Echoes of Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman Some were quick to compare Dunn to George Zimmerman, who ultimately was acquitted of murder for the shooting of Martin. Dunn claimed Davis threatened him, and he decided to take matter into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango. " "It's sad for Mr. Dunn that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment, and I will pray for him," McBath said.
