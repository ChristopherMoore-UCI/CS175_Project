"We are fighting armed Islamic extremists groups in Sinai like Takfir-Wal-Higra who were resurrected after the revolution and are clearly responsible for the bombings of the pipeline exporting gas to Israel," Imam told CNN "There is increasing evidence that al Qaeda cells are present in Sinai and we are tracking them with all our security capabilities " Imam added. Gen. Saleh Al Masry, the head of North Sinai Security, told CNN that it is possible the rockets may have been fired from Sinai by Bedouin but the involvement of the Muslim Brotherhood was far-fetched. After the revolution in Egypt and the subsequent increase of instability in the nation's Sinai peninsula, the Israeli government has accelerated the pace of construction of a steel border fence that will run along the 260 kilometers (about 160 miles) of shared border. The Haaretz newspaper in Israel quoted an unnamed Israeli official as saying the Saturday attack was carried out at the behest of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood by Bedouin in the Sinai who had been supplied by Hamas. Originally proposed as a method of stemming the flow of illegal immigration into Israel, the $350 million fence is increasingly being regarded in Israel as a necessary defense against lawlessness and what Israel says is the growing influence of radical Islamist groups operating in the Sinai Peninsula.
