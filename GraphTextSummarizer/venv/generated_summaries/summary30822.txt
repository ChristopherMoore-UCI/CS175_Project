Regardless of where you stand on health care, gun laws, big government, the minimum wage or other divisive issues, we should all be able to, for just one night, applaud Remsburg and our troops in harm's way. I bet Remsburg, the Army Ranger, may have felt the same way in front of all those cameras Tuesday night. I understood that thousands of other troops have sacrificed as well, along with our nation's firefighters, police and other first responders. At the All-American Bowl in San Antonio in 2011, I stood in front of thousands of people in a packed football stadium full of cheering fans, on a field with other wounded warriors and heroes. As I watched the address Tuesday night, I could feel the emotions of Remsburg.
