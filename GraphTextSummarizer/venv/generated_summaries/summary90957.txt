Meanwhile, utility crews restored power to a Washington-area nursing home that has been forced to brave the elements since Sunday afternoon. By Monday afternoon, damage had been reported across the region from 270 downed trees or very large limbs, including approximately 20 full large trees, according to the District Department of Transportation. A 6-year-old boy was fatally injured while walking with his family Sunday afternoon in Sterling, Virginia, when heavy wind caused a large section of a tree to fall, according to Kraig Troxell, a spokesman for the Loudoun County sheriff. July's brutal onslaught of record heat continued in the eastern United States, with temperature records set Sunday in Baltimore, Maryland, where it hit 100 degrees, and Washington, where it was 98. Electricity provider Pepco said Monday that about 220,000 residences across the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia were still in the dark -- and without air-conditioning -- following one of the hottest days of the year.
