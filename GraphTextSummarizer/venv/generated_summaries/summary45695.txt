-- Federal prosecutors' decision not to file charges against Bernard "Bernie" Fine means that the former basketball coach may have escaped ever facing criminal charges stemming from sexual abuse allegations. Man says his allegations were lies William Fitzpatrick, district attorney for Onondaga County, New York, said last year that despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct with minors, he could not bring charges against Fine because the statute of limitations had expired. Last year, the state of New York said it couldn't seek criminal charges because the statute of limitations had passed. Bernie Fine was fired from his position as assistant basketball coach the same day as those reports. The university had investigated the allegations in 2005 and never sought criminal charges.
