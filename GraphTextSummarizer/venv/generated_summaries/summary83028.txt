The change was announced the same day a report from Amnesty International detailed claims of abuse against prisoners by anti-Gadhafi forces. As a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Libya has an obligation to prevent torture and abuse, Amnesty International said. In issuing the report, Amnesty International called on Libya's National Transitional Council to put end such human rights violations. He denied the scope and gravity of the abuses depicted in the Amnesty International report. Nooh also spoke Thursday against foreign security companies coming into Libya.
