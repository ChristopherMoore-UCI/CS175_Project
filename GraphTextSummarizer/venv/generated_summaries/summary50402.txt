BBC television, for example, pays £43.89 ($72.40) per minute in royalties each time it plays the four-minute song, according to PRS for Music, which collects royalties on behalf of music writers, composers and publishers BBC Radio 2 pays £19.35 ($31.92) per minute. Fisher -- whose organ chords open the anthemic song and carry the psychedelic tune through its final swells -- says on his Web site that the song is the most-played ever on the books of Phonographic Performance Ltd. Lord David Neuberger of Abbotsbury said the organist had played a key role in the success of the song. Writers and composers receive royalties until 70 years after their death in the British system. Another court partly overturned the ruling in 2008, giving Fisher co-writing credit but no money. A lower court had ruled in his favor in 2006, granting him co-writing credits and a share of the royalties.
