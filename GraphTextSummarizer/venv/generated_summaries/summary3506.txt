I am fighting to make sure that families and adoptive families know the truth about the possibilities of fraud and human trafficking in adoption. Supporters of international adoption frequently mention the enormous numbers of orphans in the world -- UNICEF estimates there are 151 million orphans. Little did my father know that his "friends" were being paid to recruit children for an American adoption agency. What most people don't realize is that when the United Nations determines the figures for orphans, they include children who have lost just one parent (the U.N. estimates only 18 million have lost both parents). A 2010 study by Caltech, the London School of Economics, and New York University showed that parents are willing to pay an average of $38,000 more for a non-African American baby.
