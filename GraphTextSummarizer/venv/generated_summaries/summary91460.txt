Having cast film adaptations of popular books like "The Firm" and "The English Patient," Rubin added, "It's impossible to be slavish to the way characters are described in a novel because those characters exist in the readers' mind in a purely subjective way. ... It seems some present-day moviegoers, however, are a bit less "post-racial." Earlier this week, some "Hunger Games" fans tweeted their discontent because the characters of Cinna, Thresh and Rue are played by black actors in the big screen adaptation. Usually fans are angry when a film adaptation strays too far from a novel, said casting director David Rubin. Despite certain character descriptions being spelled out in the book, Benshoff said, people typically project themselves onto a character in order to empathize with that person. Similarly, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both changed their hair color for "The Hunger Games." "As a casting director," Rubin said, "I'm concerned about the quality of performance much more than hair color, and if an audience leaves a film overly concerned about the color of a character's hair, something might be missing from the storytelling."
