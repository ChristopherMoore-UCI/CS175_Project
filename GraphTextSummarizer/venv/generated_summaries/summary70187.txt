Here's a quick look at the new product: Asking a question When asking a question, users have an option to create a poll with restricted answers or one that allows anybody to add answers. When we last checked in on the product in July, wall posts about Questions merely referenced isolated pages where friends could respond. The new version of Questions takes the focus off public inquiries (a service already dominated by Q&A sites like Quora) and instead focuses on soliciting recommendations from friends. Now questions can be answered and commented on within newsfeeds and profile pages.
