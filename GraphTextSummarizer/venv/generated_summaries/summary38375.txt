Angela Merkel: Europe's Mrs. Nein Journalists from across Europe have posed a series of tough questions via 15-second Instagram video clips, challenging representatives from the parties to respond to them -- and to each other -- in the same short, sharp and shareable way. Peter Bale, vice president of digital at CNN International said the innovative debate format reflected the fresh new ways in which information and conversations were being shared online: "Short video is the medium of the moment, as Instagram and Vine are demonstrating. Christoph Teuner, of German television channel n-tv, asked whether German taxpayers would get the short end of the stick from costly attempts to fight the crisis in the Eurozone. While Roland Klaus of the new anti-euro party Alternatives for Germany (AfD) offered a prediction -- and a potential solution: "After the election, Greece as well as Ireland and Portugal will need further billions, without this being of any help to people in those countries. We're always keen to innovate in story-telling and this was a great opportunity to try something new. "And just as the decisions made by German voters on Sunday could have a lasting impact on the future of the eurozone, so CNN's 15 Second Debates could offer a glimpse of the way political discussions are carried out in the years to come.
