The FX television series "Sons of Anarchy" is known for its brutal depiction of biker life in the fictional town of Charming, California, but another hallmark of the series is its clever use of independent music. "I think sometimes of the music as a character in and of itself," music supervisor Bob Thiele, Jr. tells Rolling Stone. Rolling Stone. Thiele is a member of what he calls the Sons' "house band," the Forest Rangers, who play on the majority of "Songs of Anarchy" and have appeared in a few episodes. "Sons" actress Katey Sagal sings on four of the album's tracks, and Kills singer and "SoA" fan Alison Mosshart joins the Forest Rangers on a cover of Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World." Despite music's major presence on the show, producers have waited four seasons to release a soundtrack.
