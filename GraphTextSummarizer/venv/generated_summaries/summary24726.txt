While AKB48 may seemed to be pitched at Japanese teens, the audience is usually made up of Japanese salarymen -- a phenomenon not lost on Akimoto who has been criticized for sexualizing young women. With American Idol style auditions that continually renew the ranks of the teams, the girls aged from14 to 20 either "graduate" to become solo artists within Akimoto's swelling stable of performers, or they simply take early retirement. The brainchild of the group's Yasushi Akimoto, the bands have been a goldmine, grossing 16.28 billion yen ($212 million) in 2011 in CD and DVD sales alone, according to compiler Oricon. The bubblegum empire even has foreign territorial ambitions, with a base set to be established in Singapore and sister groups now located in Indonesia, Taiwan and China. I'm picturing their private lives partly based on my imagination or newspaper articles or TV news reports.
