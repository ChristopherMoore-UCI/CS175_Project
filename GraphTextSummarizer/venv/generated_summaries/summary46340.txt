As previously mentioned, many states have decriminalized marijuana; it is still against federal law, but generally speaking, you won't get prison time or a criminal record on first offenses for carrying small amounts for personal use. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have either legalized medical marijuana or decriminalized marijuana possession -- or both. "This is of paramount importance when marijuana-based products are used in patients with underlying neurologic disorders, or in children whose developing brains may be more vulnerable to the toxic effects of marijuana." As restrictions loosen, the evidence for the legalization of medicinal marijuana is growing. Researchers have also found that the reward center in the brains of 18 to 25 year olds who smoke marijuana at least once a week is different than the reward center in those who have no history of cannabis use. D.C.'s proposal, while more reserved than others, allows for people 21 or older to possess up to 2 ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants in their home.
