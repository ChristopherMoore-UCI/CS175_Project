Before the scandal broke, Broadwell said in numerous interviews to plug her book about him, titled "All In: The Education of General David Petraeus," that she spent hours with Petraeus in Afghanistan. FBI investigators, whose investigation began with Kelley's complaint, eventually found explicit e-mail exchanges between Petraeus and Broadwell that revealed the affair. Top military brass have been guests at the Kelley home, but it's unclear if Allen or Petraeus were aware of the Kelleys' financial difficulties or the unusual background of a charity they founded. A senior official close to another military superstar ensnared in the controversy -- the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen -- called Kelley a "bored, rich socialite involved with every single senior commander" because she did unpaid work as a military "honorary ambassador. A picture of Kelley walking out of her home wearing a smart canary yellow dress and carrying a hot pink handbag has led stories on major news outlets with headlines such as Family: Scandal will 'brand' Jill Kelley 'for life' and Jill Kelley: Five Facts About the Petraeus Affair's Mystery Woman.
