While shark attacks are rare, they have increased at a steady rate since 1900 "with each decade having more attacks than the previous," according to the International Shark Attack File based in Gainesville, Florida. The group emphasized that an increasing number of shark attacks doesn't mean the rate of attacks is increasing. Human remains found in search for woman 'taken' by large shark Police closed down the Manhattan Beach Pier, and it will remain closed until Tuesday. But the ISAF says there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks on humans in 2013 -- the lowest number of global attacks since 2009, when 67 attacks occurred. ISAF research shows people are spending more time at sea, which increases the interactions between humans and sharks.
