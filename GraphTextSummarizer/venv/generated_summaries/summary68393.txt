That would be Danish agent provocateur Mads Brugger, who greases several palms in a bid to get himself appointed the Liberian ambassador to the Central African Republic.

Central Africa can be a dangerous place at the best of times. This is the story of an ambitious European entrepreneur who buys himself diplomatic immunity for less than $200,000.
