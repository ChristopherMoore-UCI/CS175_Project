Mustafa Tamimi, 28, was among dozens of protesters who gathered in the West Bank village of Nabi Saleh on Friday for a weekly protest against the encroachment of a nearby Israeli settlement. In the statement, the military described the gathering in Nabih Saleh as a "violent and illegal riot" where protesters hurled rocks at Israeli security personnel who in turn responded with "riot dispersal means." During the fighting, an Israeli soldier shot him from a close range with a tear gas projectile in the face, according to protest organizer Jonathan Pollak. The protest turned violent when minor clashes erupted between Israeli military personnel and the protesters. Pollak, who serves as the spokesman for the Popular Struggle Coordination Committee that organizes the weekly protest, accused the Israeli military of acting "in complete disregard" of its own open fire regulations.
