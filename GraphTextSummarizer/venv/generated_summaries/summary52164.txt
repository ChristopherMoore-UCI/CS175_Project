Only a handful of laps into Sunday's 300-mile race, I was following a couple of car lengths back from Dan. I saw cars fly up into the air and drivers pile up into one another. Dan was a friend to all, a kind, charismatic man who could instantly light up a room with his beaming smile and charm. It was a challenge that garnered much media attention, and Dan had spent the past month or so heavily promoting the event and describing how excited he was to take part in this challenge. Now is the time to remember Dan, the great champion he was -- a two-time Indy 500 winner, the great husband, father and friend to so many of us.
