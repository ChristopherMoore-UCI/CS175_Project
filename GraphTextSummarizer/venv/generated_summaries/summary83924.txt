Because if you're worried about a shark interaction, you should be scared to death to get in the car," says Chris Fischer, founder and expedition leader of Ocearch, the research and educational nonprofit that tagged and tracks Mary Lee and other sharks. Skomal has been researching sharks for more than 25 years and has teamed up with Fischer and Ocearch three times in the past few years to tag great whites along the East Coast. So, if the recent shark-kayaker encounter or shark sightings in Massachusetts have you worried, your best bet is to look at the stats, shark trackers say. The trackers only ping when the animals surface, and sharks don't have to surface to breathe. "If you're the kind of person who's scared of sharks and wants to know if there's one around you, there's no technology for that," says Gregory Skomal, a biologist with Massachusetts' Division of Marine Fisheries who has tagged sharks with Ocearch.
