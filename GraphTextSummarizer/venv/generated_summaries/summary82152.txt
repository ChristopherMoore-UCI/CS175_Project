It is highly likely that the 15-member commission will abandon the option to store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. The search for future uses of Yucca only came into question, according to Voegele and others, when the Department of Energy filed a petition to withdraw its Nuclear Regulatory Commission license application for Yucca Mountain earlier this month, effectively killing the project. The Department of Energy's Blue Ribbon Commission has been given the task of finding an alternative to the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada, which President Obama has vowed to close. "For years, there's never been a fallback, there's never been a plan B," says Michael Voegele, who's been involved with the Yucca Mountain project for decades. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada has fought hard to end the Yucca Mountain project, which is unpopular with many Nevadans.
