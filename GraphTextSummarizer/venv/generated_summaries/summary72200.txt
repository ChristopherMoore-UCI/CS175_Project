And before every flight, pilots do a walk around the plane, and they kept seeing the section repair and pointing it out and kept filing a report saying, 'you need to fix it,' " said airline spokesman Paul McElroy. That's what one passenger on a July 28 Alaska Airlines flight from Burbank, California, to Seattle saw, snapping a photo of the rather unorthodox note that generated criticism on social media. Maintenance workers wrote the note to head off further reports, which was "not the best approach," McElroy said. The photo appeared on the popular website reddit.com and was shared and discussed on social media. Egan said a passenger shared the photo with Alaska Airlines seeking an explanation for the note.
