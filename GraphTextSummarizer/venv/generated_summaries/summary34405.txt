Whatever the reason, the fact that he had the benefit of higher education (and had picked up state of the art IT skills) once again  highlights how our education system fails to protect either us, the citizens of a free country, or the students themselves from the violent horrors of Islamism. Finally, it must surely be clear to Western leaders that as long as President Barack Obama refuses to dismantle ISIS as a political entity in the only way possible -- by putting boots on the ground --  Islamism will continue to present us in the West with a monumental threat. Instead, we also need effective intelligence-led security policies that must include letting our intelligence agencies access electronic data in their search of jihadi recruitment campaigns. Obviously, they continue to communicate, but either they are doing so in ways we find increasingly hard to track, or our security agencies are so fearful of being tarred as "snoopers" that they have become far too cautious about investigating those who want to do us grave harm. It appears clear that security authorities have known for some time who he is, but kept this fact hidden, either, one assumes, because they were attempting to capture him or because they were trying to protect his family from vigilantes.
