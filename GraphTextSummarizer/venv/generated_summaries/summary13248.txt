Two of England's three clubs face tough ties, with Chelsea drawn against Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City paired with Spanish giants Barcelona. -- Champions League holders and arguably Europe's most in-form team Real Madrid were drawn against German side Schalke 04 in the last 16 of Europe's most prestigious competition. On Friday Real Madrid extended their winning streak in all competitions to a remarkable 20 games with a 4-1 away win over Almeria. Last season's finalists Atletico will meet Bayer Leverkusen, while Italy's Juventus drew Borussia Dortmund, with Bayern Munich -- Germany's fourth club in the last 16 -- handed a tie against Shakhtar Donetsk.
