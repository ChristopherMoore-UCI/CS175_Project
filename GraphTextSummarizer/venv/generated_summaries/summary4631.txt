All previous attempts to eliminate the mention of God in the pledge recited in classrooms across the country have failed, but the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts considered arguments seeking removal of the reference based on discrimination. "The plaintiffs here did not successfully allege that their children receive negative treatment because they opt not to recite the words 'under God,' or that the inclusion of that phrase in the pledge has occasioned 'the creation of second-class citizens,' " the decision said. But he said the group felt confident about a similar case filed in New Jersey last week that  seeks to show that the pledge engendered a climate of discrimination. Massachusetts' highest court ruled Friday that the Pledge of Allegiance does not discriminate against atheists, saying that the words "under God" represent a patriotic, not a religious, exercise. The decision said the plaintiffs failed to prove that reciting the pledge resulted in negative treatment.
