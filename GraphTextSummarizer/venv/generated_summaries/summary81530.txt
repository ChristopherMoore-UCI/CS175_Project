Investigators found two fully functional pipe bombs and believe that a three-week manhunt may be taking a toll on suspected cop killer Eric Matthew Frein, Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Tuesday. The hard drive which Frein had access to indicated extensive Internet research on topics such as "how to avoid police manhunts, use of various law enforcement technologies and skills related to survival," Bivens said. Those items include a pair of pipe bombs found in the last two days that could be detonated via trip wire or fuse -- consistent with what Bivens called "Frein's non-confrontational and gutless efforts to kill or injure law enforcement from a distance." "Over the last few days we have found several items that undoubtedly confirm Eric Frein is hiding in our search area," Bivens told reporters. Bivens said Frein may have placed other explosive devices in the area and warned people to be very careful, especially since archery hunting season is about to begin.
