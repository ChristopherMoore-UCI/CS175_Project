For example, studies have found that children with names that linguistically sound like they come from a lower socioeconomic status are less likely to be recommended by school officials for gifted classes and actually more likely to be labeled as learning disabled. And even today in looking at the list of baby names for 2012, I was actually happy that Dean was not in the top 100. In addition to the offbeat names above, 2011 saw babies sporting such names as: Moo, Draper, Graceland and Tequila. So, parents, keep in mind that your choice of name will have a lasting impact on your child -- both for good and bad. These are baby names.
