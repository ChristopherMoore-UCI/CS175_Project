China links Islamic terrorist group to Tiananmen Square crash 'Only the beginning' It was unclear from the SITE report if Mansour was claiming responsibility for the Tiananmen attack or just commenting on it. "Jiangdu groups have supposedly claimed responsibility for attacks outside of Xinjiang in the past, but such claims have never been verified," he said. "It has been referred to as one of the many jiangdu (or, Xinjiang independence) groups for many years, yet no one is quite sure whether or not they exist - at least in their own right." Frequent outbreaks of unrest have hit the resource-rich region, where the arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. But he warned that "such operations are only the beginning," according to SITE, and that Uyghur fighters will target the Great Hall of the People, a grand building next to Tiananman Square where the Chinese parliament meets and ceremonial events are held.
