The House had passed a repeal of the ban as part of a larger defense policy bill, but the measure stalled last week in the Senate. The four senators' support for the "don't ask, don't tell" repeal would ensure the 60 votes needed to clear the way for the bill to advance even if Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, votes against it, as is expected. The aides said Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe, Lisa Murkowski and Scott Brown will vote Saturday to end debate on the ban on openly gay and lesbian people in the military, regardless of whether the Senate passes a stopgap spending bill, a continuing resolution to keep the government funded. The four have previously said that bill must be approved first. Conservative Republicans have argued that, among other things, a repeal would place an unreasonable burden on the military at a time when it is facing severe strains in Afghanistan and elsewhere.
