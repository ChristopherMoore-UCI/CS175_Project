The social networking site CaringBridge helped cancer survivor Ken Gehle stay positive during treatment. Other popular sites include CarePages, Planet Cancer for young adults, and Group Loop, where teens with cancer can chat with other teens. Support networks can also be good for family members, who are at higher risk for depression during a crisis. And there's a guestbook area where friends and family members can leave messages of comfort and support. Tamara Gehle invited about 200 friends, family and co-workers to visit the site.
