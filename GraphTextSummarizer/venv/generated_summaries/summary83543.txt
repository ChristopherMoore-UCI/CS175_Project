" But results of a massive, 15-year-long study released earlier this month showed absolutely no link between cellphone use and cancer, echoing the findings of numerous other studies. Judge William Alsup found that the ordinance failed the sniff test on both scientific and First Amendment grounds. " The World Health Organization issued a report that seemingly butressed San Francisco's position in May when it labeled cellphones "possibly carcinogenic," meaning that there is "limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and less than sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. Even a watered-down version of the law couldn't pass muster: San Francisco's ordinance requiring retail outlets to inform consumers about the (alleged) effects of cell phone radiation has been blocked by a federal judge. The overall impression left is that cell phones are dangerous and that they have somehow escaped the regulatory process.
