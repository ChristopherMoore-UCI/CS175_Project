Mogadishu, the Afgooye corridor and the Shabelle regions west of the capital are the latest that "have slipped into famine," U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters Wednesday afternoon. Amid the crisis, a senior U.N. official urged Somali expatriates to support peace efforts and contribute to relief efforts Wednesday. Relief efforts in Somalia have been hindered by the ongoing battle between Islamist rebels and Somalia's transitional government, which holds little sway beyond Mogadishu. -- Three more regions of Somalia have now been struck by famine, including the capital, Mogadishu, the United Nations announced Wednesday. "In the midst of a famine seizing Somalia, the extremists are choosing to focus on killing, not saving life," said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, a spokesman for the peacekeeping mission.
