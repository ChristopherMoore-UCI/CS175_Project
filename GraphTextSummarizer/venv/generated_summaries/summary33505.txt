Continuing the pattern of a free-scoring World Cup, both sides created a flurry of chances in an open and attacking match despite the stifling heat and humidity of the Amazon jungle and a pitch of questionable quality. Japan took a 16th-minute lead through a superb strike by AC Milan midfielder Keisuke Honda, but the second-half introduction of veteran striker Didier Drogba helped inspire the African side to victory. Uruguay, which kept recovering star player Luis Suarez on the bench in Fortaleza, ended the Group D opener with 10 men when Maxi Pereira was sent off for an ugly challenge in injury time. "We were strong going forward, we had a nice style of play and we created several chances," said the 64-year-old Argentine. He is nicknamed the "new kid" as he is seen as the natural successor to former Colombian legend Carlos Valderrama, whose nickname was 'the kid" and starred for the national side at three straight World Cups until 1998.
