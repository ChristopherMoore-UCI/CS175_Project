It marks the latest in a series of privacy tweaks Facebook has made in recent months as it works to make users more comfortable about sharing their information on the site. And in the coming weeks, returning users will be prompted to take a close look at their privacy settings and other account information when they log in. Today's announcement is a step in the right direction for strengthening online privacy protections, and I urge other online companies to follow suit. Last month, Facebook rolled out the ability to log in "anonymously," preventing other websites and third-party apps from collecting data about you. The Privacy Checkup feature for existing users -- which comes with its own cuddly dinosaur mascot -- was announced last month but is being implemented now.
