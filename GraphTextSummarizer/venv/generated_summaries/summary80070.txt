-- Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank took to the streets in mass demonstrations Tuesday demanding an end to the inter-Palestinian political division and an end to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. The Hamas prime minister, Ismail Haniyeh, publicly called on Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to join his Fatah party in an urgent meeting to renew efforts at achieving political reconciliation. The largest protest took place in the coastal enclave of Gaza, where tens of thousands waved Palestinian flags and chanted, "The people want to end the political division" in imitation of the chants made by Tunisian and Egyptian protesters earlier this year. Najwan Baricdar, a youth activist and event organizer, told CNN the rally was inspired by the recent revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt and that many of the youth participants in the rally are fed up with the state of Palestinian politics. In the West Bank city of Ramallah, thousands of demonstrators representing a varied cross-section of Palestinian society called on the government to do more to bridge the political divide.
