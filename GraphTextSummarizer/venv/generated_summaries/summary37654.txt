NFL player Benjamin Watson wants to tackle race. The cure for the Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner tragedies is not education or exposure. However, in his Facebook post, he felt encouraged because he feels the Gospel provides hope: "I'M ENCOURAGED, because ultimately the problem is not a SKIN problem, it is a SIN problem. Watson shared his Christian beliefs while expressing how upset he was about the fatal shooting of Michael Brown. I was born in Norfolk, Virginia, but we moved to South Carolina when I was in high school," says Watson.
