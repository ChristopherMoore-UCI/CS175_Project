Six world powers and Iran have reached a deal on the framework for comprehensive negotiations over Tehran's nuclear program, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Thursday. Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi insisted Tuesday that the "halting of Iran's (nuclear) program and dismantling Iran's nuclear facilities are not on the agenda," the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. "We have identified all of the issues we need to address in reaching a comprehensive and final agreement," Ashton said, speaking alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in Vienna, Austria. In addition to political discussions, the two sides have started technical work, Ashton said, and have set a timetable for meetings over the next four months, with a framework for further deliberations. Technical experts will meet in early March, she said, and the next round of talks between the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- and Iran will start March 17.
