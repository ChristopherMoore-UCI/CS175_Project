Not only is the extreme 19th hole at Legend Golf Resort in north South Africa 430 meters from tee to pin, it also 430 meters in height. For those who believe in the old adage that golf is the perfect way to spoil a good walk, there are endless areas to explore on safari as John Dixon, public relations manager for the Legend group, and former park ranger, explains. You are in the middle of wild Africa, getting off a helicopter to hit a tee shot!" "It's very difficult to explain to people the drama of playing the world's highest and longest par three," Pete Richardson, head of PR and marketing at Legend, told CNN. Legend opened in 2009, and its unique 19-hole course has helped generate prosperity for an area that also benefited from the influx of tourists who flocked to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup.
