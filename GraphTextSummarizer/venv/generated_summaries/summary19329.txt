In other words, grab a cup of coffee and let's talk about race. Of course, we cannot pretend that having a talk about race over coffee will solve America's problems, just as President Obama's "beer summit" over the racial profiling of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates fell short of fully capitalizing on one of those "teachable moments. "We have problems in this country with regard to race and racial inequality," Schultz said in a video to corporate employees. What we are witnessing as a society is a new movement led by black women and spurred by the killing of black people such as Michael Brown and Trayvon Martin, Renisha McBride and Eric Garner, John Crawford and Tamir Rice, and many more, whether by police or by armed vigilantes. It only makes sense that actors and players in society, including corporations such as Starbucks, would want to become part of that new dynamic.
