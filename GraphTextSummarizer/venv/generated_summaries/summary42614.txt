According to his court filing, Moton claims that Fenton "learned of Mr. Holmes' dangerous propensities and intentions" but, after bringing her concerns to the university, "neither the (university) team nor the (university) police took action to prevent Mr. Holmes from causing ... harm to Mr. Moton, which harm could have been prevented from but for their failure to so act. The university psychiatrist who treated the accused gunman in last year's deadly Colorado theater rampage could face more than a dozen lawsuits that blame her and the school for not properly handling James Holmes' treatment. " Chantel Blunk -- whose 26-year-old husband, Jonathan, was one of 12 people slain in the theater -- has already filed a civil lawsuit in federal court accusing Fenton of knowing "that James Holmes was dangerous" and having "a duty to use reasonable care to protect the public at large from James Holmes." At least 14 people have filed legal documents indicating they are planning to sue the University of Colorado Denver and Dr. Lynne Fenton for negligence. Fenton has testified that her contact with Holmes ended on June 11, more than a month before he allegedly walked into a crowded movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, and opened fire, killing 12 people and wounding 58 others during a screening of the new Batman film.
