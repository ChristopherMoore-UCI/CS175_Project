Optimize your career-life fit by asking yourself what you most need -- and what trade-offs you are willing to accept -- to be fulfilled in your profession, family, community and other pursuits at any point in time, and over time. How employee freedom delivers better business With this so-called mass customization of careers, individuals can co-design with their managers a zigzag sequence of jobs that are skill-developing opportunities. Individuals wonder if they should abandon current career paths to pursue high-demand opportunities where they must start from scratch. For employees, it means building a sustainable career with varied skillsets, more future career options, and an ability to build and enhance their personal brand. Maximize option value by actively seeking out those opportunities to build new skills -- either in your current role or by taking on a new role at your organization.
