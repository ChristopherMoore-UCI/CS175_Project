A British banker is facing murder charges in Hong Kong over the killing of two women in an upscale apartment in the city's central district of Wan Chai -- where one of the victims was discovered stuffed inside a suitcase on the apartment balcony. The suspect, a 29-year-old man identified as Rurik Jutting, appeared before a magistrates' court in Hong Kong on Monday facing two charges of murder. The British Foreign Office confirmed that a British citizen was arrested in Hong Kong on suspicion of murder, but did not release the name, citing regulations. Court documents gave his occupation as a "banker" for Bank of America in Hong Kong. Paul Scanlon, a spokesman for Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, said that a person named Rurik Jutting had worked there but left the bank recently.
