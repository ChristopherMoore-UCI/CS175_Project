-- Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara equaled a landmark cricket record but his side are in deep trouble after the opening action in the traditional Boxing Day Test against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Sangakkara's 58 saw him past 10,000 runs, reaching it in his 195th Test innings to equal greats Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. Australia made a rapid reply with opener David Warner hitting 62 off just 46 balls in an opening partnership of 95 with Ed Cowan. His defiant effort was only ended by a superb running catch by wicketkeeper Matthew Wade which gave Australia paceman Mitchell Johnson his 200th wicket in his 49th Test. A big crowd approaching 70,000 at the MCG saw Sri Lanka routed for just 156, with Australia only six runs behind with three wickets down at stumps on the first day.
