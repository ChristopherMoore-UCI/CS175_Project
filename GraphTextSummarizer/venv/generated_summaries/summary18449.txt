"I am a huge Hillary Clinton fan," Dean told CNN in an interview. " Clinton's biggest challenge will be generational, Dean said, echoing a previous observation he's made about the putative Democratic front-runner. " "If she is president, which I hope she is, I think she is going to be a terrific president," added Dean, who stopped into Clinton's book signing event in the Hamptons last weekend and posed for a picture with the former secretary of state.
