The electrician asked Jacqueline for pieces of Picasso's work, and she gave them to Le Guennec over a period of time, his lawyer said. Along with the letter, Le Guennec included 26 photographs of previously unpublished Picasso pieces. Pinault said that one of the reasons the Picasso family is taking Le Guennec to court is because he hasn't adequately explained how he came across the works. Le Guennec contacted the Picasso estate by mail in January to request certification of authenticity for the works: a collection of cubist collages, drawings, lithographs, notebooks and a watercolor. Pierre Le Guennec, 71, worked for Picasso for three years, until the artist died in 1973, and continued to work for his widow, Jacqueline, until she died 13 years later, Rees said.
