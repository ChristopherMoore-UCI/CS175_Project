Rather, they would be given certificates to honor their participation in the work, just as any other writers of sampled or interpolated work." Grammys: John Legend, Common, Sam Smith and Pharrell Williams Added to Performers Petty and Lynne were added to "Stay With Me's" credits after Petty's team noticed a likeness between Smith's song and Petty's "I Won't Back Down." "Although the likeness was a complete coincidence, all involved came to an immediate and amicable agreement in which Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne are now credited as co-writers of 'Stay With Me' along with Sam Smith, James Napier and William Phillips. "Since Lynne and Petty didn't do any new writing for this work, we are considering their original work to have been interpolated by Napier, Phillips and Smith for 'Stay With Me,' " said Freimuth, the Senior Vice President, Awards. When the Petty camp reached out to Smith's representatives, they settled the matter amicably and agreed that Petty and Lynne will receive royalties.
