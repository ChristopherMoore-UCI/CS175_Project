" Michael Jackson "was surrounded by a bad circle," LaToya Jackson told a British newspaper. LaToya Jackson was "very candid" throughout the four-hour interview, which took place in Los Angeles, California, last Thursday, said Caroline Graham, the Daily Mail reporter who conducted the interview. The Los Angeles coroner could release his autopsy report on Jackson within a week, according to assistant chief coroner Ed Winter. The Jackson family knows that the probe into his June 25 death might turn into a criminal case, a source close to the family told CNN last Thursday. Los Angeles police Chief William Bratton told CNN last week that he was waiting for the coroner to determine the exact cause of Jackson's death.
