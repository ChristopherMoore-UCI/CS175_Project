Alan Pardew's side's third consecutive league defeat sees them slip further out of contention for a Europa League place next season, but with 37 points the Magpies are still nine points clear of 10th place Swansea City who drew 1-1 with Stoke City. We need some of them to drop points. Elsewhere, Tottenham Hotspur consolidated fifth place with a 4-0 thumping of Newcastle United at St James' Park. And it was the English keeper who had to face Gerrard's spot kick after Sturridge was brought down by German defender Sascha Riether. Kolo Toure, who gifted West Brom an equalizer at the Hawthorns earlier this month, scored an own goal in the eighth minute to hand the home side a boost following their 2-2 draw against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday.
