The stunning loss of life has shaken South Korea, raising troubling questions about safety standards and government oversight of businesses. Divers are still searching the submerged vessel for the missing people, braving frigid waters, strong currents and corridors clogged with debris. The chief executive of ferry operator, Cheonghaejin Marine Co., was arrested Thursday and is facing charges including causing death by negligence, said Yang Joong-jin, a senior prosecutor in the investigation. The government is also taking steps to revoke the company's business licenses, the the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries said. South Korean authorities cracked down on the company that operated the Sewol passenger ferry following the disaster that shocked the nation.
