Police required all residents of Milford, which has an estimated population of 700, to leave, after the underground pipeline exploded early Thursday, sending up orange flames stories high, said spokesman Malcolm Ward. The statement mentioned not wanting to risk exposing residents to possible effects on air quality in Milford. Milford's residents are expected to return to their homes sometime Saturday, Ward said. On Saturday, authorities reduced the evacuation zone around the incident site, and said most residents could return home. The company has provided hotel accommodations for affected residents, the statement said.
