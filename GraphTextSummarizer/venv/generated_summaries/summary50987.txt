The Casalesi clan and the area where the arrests took place prominently featured in the best seller "Gomorrah," a book written by Roberto Saviano who now lives under constant police protection. As part of the same operation, Italian financial police confiscated 43 companies and 134 apartments spread throughout central and southern Italy belonging to the Casalesi clan, worth more than 100 million euros ($144 million). The arrests were part of a large police operation aimed at cracking down on organized crime in the Campania region and in particular the powerful Casalesi clan belonging to the Neapolitan mafia known as Camorra. "Our objective is to take the water away from the sharks," said Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni. In the suspects' home, police found weapons including two AK-47s that investigators say were used to carry out the killings in Castelvolturno, as well as police overalls, one gun and one pump rifle.
