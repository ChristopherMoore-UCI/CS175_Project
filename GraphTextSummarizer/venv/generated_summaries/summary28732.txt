With a Jobs biopic, there's the added difficulty of finding someone who can play him both as a young man starting Apple Computer in his parents' garage with partner Steve Wozniak, and as the 50ish CEO who captivated audiences three decades later with high-profile launches of the iPhone and iPad. -- With news that Sony Pictures is buying the movie rights to an upcoming biography of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, speculation has jumped to who could play the late tech mastermind. Simon & Schuster announced last week that, based on the surge of interest in Jobs following his death last week, it would move the release date of the authorized biography, "Steve Jobs" by Walter Isaacson, from November 21 to October 24. Quoting anonymous sources, the New York Times and other media outlets were reporting that Sony is in final talks and will pay $1 million for the rights to the book, which traces Jobs' story from college dropout to CEO of the world's leading tech company. Jobs has already been portrayed on screen once -- by "ER's" Noah Wyle in a 1999 made-for-TV movie, "Pirates of Silicon Valley."
