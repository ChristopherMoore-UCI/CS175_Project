The Lambert-St. Louis International Airport is closed indefinitely while officials investigate the damage, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay told reporters. Concourse C is used by American Airlines, AirTran and Cape Air, airport spokesman Jeff Lea said. -- Heavy winds from a severe storm caused significant damage, shattered windows and sent debris raining down on passengers at an airport in St. Louis Friday night. One witness described a chaotic scene outside the terminal as officials evacuated passengers from at least one aircraft. "The plane was rocking back and forth," said Brett Knewitz of Albuquerque, New Mexico, who was on a plane that was about to take off from the airport when the storm hit.
