Bruni spoke at a news conference about the release of a committee report that criticizes, among other things, racial profiling and excessive use of force by U.S. police. The events in Ferguson, Missouri, are a "tragedy," but the U.N. Committee Against Torture "has to respect the decision" of authorities not to prosecute police Officer Darren Wilson in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown, committee member Alessio Bruni said Friday. The U.N. report mentions "deep concern at the frequent and recurrent police shootings or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals." Instances of police brutality should be investigated  by entities that have "no institutional or hierarchical connection between the investigators and the alleged perpetrators," the report recommends. Though the talk was private, the delegation that organized their trip said the couple told the committee that Brown's killing, and force used by police officers during protests that followed, "represent violations of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment." While the  report does not specifically mention the Ferguson case, it does express concern about the militarization of U.S. police departments.
