The first shipment of nonlethal aid from the United States to the Libyan opposition arrived Tuesday in Benghazi, U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said. The ICRC said the vessel carried medical supplies, spare parts to repair water and electrical supply systems and 8,000 jars of baby food. -- Rebel forces defending the Libyan city of Misrata from government troops are making "meter-by-meter" gains despite heavy shelling and rocket attacks, a Western journalist inside the city said Tuesday. Other items en route from the U.S. Defense Department include medical supplies, tents, uniforms, boots and personal protective gear. "From what refugees are telling us, the Libyan authorities are facilitating the departures of non-Libyan citizens from Libyan coasts," Boldrini said.
