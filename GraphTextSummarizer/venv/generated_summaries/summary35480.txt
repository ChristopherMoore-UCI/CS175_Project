NBC sportscaster Costas sat down with CNN's Piers Morgan on Monday night to discuss the growing debate over gun control. "But if no matter how imperfectly I may have done it a week ago Sunday, if this has sparked a conversation and in some small way influenced people's behavior, so much the better." It was not lost on him that many people took him to task for only speaking out about guns. " Morgan said during his debates on Twitter he had constantly been asked about the times that guns were helpful. It's an example, Morgan said, of how pervasive guns are and also how numb Americans have become to a dangerous issue. Costas said the real problem is the way guns have of escalating a situation.
