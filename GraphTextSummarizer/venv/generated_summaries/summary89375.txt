It's a debatable point, but in order to protect the minority party and make sure nobody does anything without a full debate, Senate rules require that 60 of 100 senators agree to votes to move toward confirming a nominee or passing legislation. The "nuclear option" would be the changing of Senate rules to enable judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with just 51 votes instead of 60. The Constitution doesn't say anything about Senate rules. But Senate rules are pretty clear on the 60-vote threshold. According to the Senate website, Henry Clay was the first senator to threaten going nuclear, back in 1841, on legislation.
