Afghan President Hamid Karzai strongly condemned the burning as did various U.S. officials, including U.S. President Barack Obama. The demonstrators marched toward the city center amid a heavy police presence but without incident, said Kabul City police official Abdullah Mahboob. "However, to attack and kill innocent people in response is outrageous, and an affront to human decency and dignity." At least nine people were killed and 73 injured in Kandahar on Saturday, and 12 people died Friday -- including seven U.N. employees -- when angry demonstrators stormed a U.N. compound in Mazar-i-Sharif. -- About 1,000 protesters gathered in front of Kabul University on Tuesday morning, as protests continue throughout Afghanistan to condemn the burning of a Quran by a pastor in the United States.
