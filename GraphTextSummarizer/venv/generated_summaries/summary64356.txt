A final surprising truth about non-suicidal self-injury is that it exists in a complex relationship with actual suicidal behavior. If a minority of adults responds to powerful emotions by harming themselves, why should children not do the same? People who engage in non-suicidal self-injury typically are struggling with other psychiatric conditions, such as a mood or personality disorder, so they are at increased risk of suicide generally. In fact, the demographics of suicide and non-suicidal self-injury suggest that in some ways they are polar opposites. While people report engaging in non-suicidal self-injury for various reasons, almost always, they hurt themselves in response to stressful situations or negative emotions.
