Laquian explains: "If population control had not been enforced, China would most likely be economically and socially worse off today." This remains a sensitive topic in China, poignantly depicted in Mo Yan's "Frog," a novel about a midwife in rural China and her experiences with forced abortions and sterilizations. "It was designed in 1979 to be a temporary one that required the 'sacrifice of two or three generations,' as they put it then," says Aprodicio Laquian, who served as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) representative and senior adviser on population in China from 1984 to 1990. The world's population is expected to hit 7 billion around October 31 and one Chinese demographer says that number would have come a lot sooner had it not been for China's "one-child policy." Zhai Zhenwu, a professor at Renmin University School of Sociology and Population, says but for China's population policy, the world's 7 billionth baby would have been born five years earlier. China is now facing a lopsided sex ratio in infants and young children.
