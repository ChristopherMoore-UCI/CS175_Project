In a written statement, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the United States "remains committed to help restore the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras in the wake of the June 28 coup d'etat that removed President Zelaya and led to the suspension of Honduras from the Organization of American States." He called the November 29 elections "another critical step in the restoration of the democratic and constitutional order in Honduras," and noted that the electoral process is conducted "under the stewardship of the multi-party and autonomous Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which was also selected before the coup. Zelaya and Micheletti are Liberal Party members, and their rift has splintered the party. Five months later, Zelaya is still not in power, holed up instead in the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. Ousted President Manuel Zelaya has said he will not recognize the election results and has called for a boycott. The United Nations, OAS, European Union and most nations -- including the United States -- condemned the coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated.
