-- Jordan's King Abdullah II has made a call for national unity and reform following bloody clashes between protesters and government loyalists late last week, the country's Petra News Agency reported. The demonstrations turned violent as government loyalists clashed with protesters calling for the dissolution of parliament, an elected government and constitutional reforms. Among those calling for the dismissal of government officials were family members of the 56-year-old protester. Security forces have allowed peaceful protests in the kingdom for more than 12 weeks, the two said. Al-Majali said security forces should not be accused of any shortcomings or negligence during Friday's protest, noting that had they not intervened during the clashes, "today we would have had funerals that cannot be counted."
