ABM lost support after assassinating Bedouin leaders who disagreed with their practices and beheading men accused of being informants. Before ISIS' rise to power, ABM was often associated with al Qaeda. He also argued that if the militant group associates itself with ISIS or al Qaeda then it would lose its status as a "local hero" and become a "foreign agent." Association with ISIS could also further damage ABM's image with most Egyptians. In the audio message, the Sinai-based militant group Ansar Beit al-Maqdis, or ABM, allegedly announces its allegiance to ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. Similar messages on social media proclaimed the group's allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, only later to be denied by the militant group.
