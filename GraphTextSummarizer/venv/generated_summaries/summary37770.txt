In an interview with CNN, she says Greece should use lessons learned during the Olympics to turn around its fortunes during its current economic crisis, which has seen 64% youth unemployment, a bailout from the European Union and a crippling austerity drive. They should have a lesson of how Greece performed during the Olympics. What I know about Greece is we created a miracle in the making of the Olympics. She was the first female president of both a bid committee and an organizing committee for an Olympic Games "We were the miracle, we showed a different Greece, a can-do Greece in four years instead of seven," she says. In 1996, with Greeks still wounded from losing out to Atlanta 1996 for the centenary of the modern Olympic Games, Angelopoulos was asked by the prime minister to lead the bid for Athens to be host city in 2004.
