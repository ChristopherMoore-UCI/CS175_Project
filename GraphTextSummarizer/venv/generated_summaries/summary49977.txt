-- A "suspicious" fire devastated the church attended by Alaska Gov. and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on Friday night in her hometown of Wasilla, the church's minister said. "We have no idea what caused it," the Rev. Larry Kroon of the Wasilla Bible Church said Saturday, adding that investigators were considering arson and other possible causes. The metal church building, which normally accommodates Sunday congregations of up to 1,000 people, was heavily damaged by flames and smoke, Kroon said. The pastor said church services would be held on schedule Sunday in a nearby school. " Kroon said the nondenominational church, which he described as "just a local community church," is about 30 years old and the church building itself is about 2Â½ years old.
