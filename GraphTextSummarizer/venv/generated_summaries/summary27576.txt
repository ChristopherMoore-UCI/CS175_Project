Samuel Sheinbein, who fled the United States for Israel after the 1997 killing, was shot Sunday evening by police special forces and guards at Rimonim Prison, Israel Prison Service spokeswoman Sivan Weizman said. Sheinbein, a citizen of Israel and the United States, pleaded guilty to murder in 1999 in the gruesome killing of Alfredo Tello Jr. Prosecutors accused Sheinbein and accomplice Aaron Needle of picking up Tello from work in Silver Spring, Maryland, and deciding to kill him. -- A prison inmate who murdered a Maryland teen was killed Sunday after he shot three guards inside an Israeli prison, officials said. Sheinbein, 34, shot at the guards from inside the prison's restrooms, Weizman said. After fleeing to Israel, Sheinbein admitted to the dismemberment and burning of the victim.
