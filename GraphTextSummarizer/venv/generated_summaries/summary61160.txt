In other words, although the war on Christmas phenomenon might have something to do with rising unbelief among Americans, more likely it reflects growing partisanship among politicians. Pat Robertson has hit out at those "miserable" atheists and Fox News has gone after Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee for deciding not to host a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. That prompted the Daily Caller to respond with the headline, "Disagreeing with Obama can ruin Christmas, says White House report." No Christmas is complete without a war on Christmas, and this year it's being fought on several fronts. This must be news to conservatives who have always insisted that it's the Democrats who want to steal Christmas.
