Hinckley was found not guilty by reason of insanity in the 1981 shooting of President Ronald Reagan, press secretary James Brady, Secret Service Agent Timothy McCarthy and police officer Thomas Delahanty. The members of the legal team representing presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. say they are owed "significant legal bills in arrears" and are asking a judge's permission to bow out of Hinckley's case. According to the government court filing, St. Elizabeths sent an August 8 letter stating that Colonial Behavioral Health, People's Place facility in Williamsburg had withdrawn from the plan to participate in Hinckley's treatment by providing him access to group social sessions. The legal team represented Hinckley during 13 days of testimony in late 2011 and early 2012 on a St. Elizabeths Hospital proposal to allow Hinckley to have longer visits to his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia. In July 2011, St. Elizabeths proposed allowing Hinckley two 17-day visits followed by six stays lasting 24 days.
