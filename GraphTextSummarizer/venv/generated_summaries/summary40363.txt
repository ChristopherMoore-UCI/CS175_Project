The planes Lopez saw were U.S. spy planes, and as they flew over San Cristobal on October 15, 1962, they were capturing the first photos of Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba. -- Fifty years ago, 15-year-old Omar Lopez knew a secret that governments around the world would have killed to learn or safeguard: Soviet troops were building hidden military installations in Cuba. "The troops" were thousands of Soviet soldiers and technicians who had been secreted into Cuba as part of a confidential agreement between Castro and Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev to place nuclear missiles on the island and upend the dynamic of the Cold War. But little of the drama of those times reached the remote Lopez farm in western Cuba, where palm trees vastly outnumber human residents. Kennedy ordered Navy ships to quarantine Cuba to prevent more Soviet missiles' and troops' passage to the island.
