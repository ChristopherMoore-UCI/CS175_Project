ESPN, NFL.com and other media outlets have reported that representatives for teammate Jonathan Martin submitted voice mails and text messages in which Incognito used racial slurs and threatened physical violence. -- A volunteer at a golf tournament in 2012 accused embattled Miami Dolphins player Richie Incognito of inappropriately touching her with a golf club, according to a newly disclosed police report. The police report quoted the 34-year-old woman, who was a volunteer at the tournament, as saying Incognito had been drinking before he approached her. The woman said Incognito used his golf club to touch her crotch, stomach and chest and then knock sunglasses off her head, the police report said. The woman said Incognito then leaned against her buttocks as if dancing and finally emptied a water bottle in her face, the police report said.
