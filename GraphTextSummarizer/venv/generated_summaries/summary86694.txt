-- The grandson of civil rights activist Malcolm X, Malcolm Shabazz, died in a Mexico City hospital after suffering an apparent beating, police told CNN. The prosecutor's office said in a statement that Shabazz had been at "a place of recreation" and had been drinking beers that night. "I was saddened, stunned, shocked, to read about the murder of young Malcolm," former Georgia congresswoman Cynthia McKinney said. "To all who knew him, he offered kindness, encouragement and hope for a better tomorrow," the Shabazz family said in a statement Friday. Prosecutors are investigating the death as a homicide, police spokesman Octavio Campos said.
