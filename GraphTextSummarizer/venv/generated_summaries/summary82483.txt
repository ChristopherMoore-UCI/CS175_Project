Ian Hunter Burnet, a 22-year-old Virginia Commonwealth University student, went missing days after arriving in New York City to celebrate New Year's Eve, authorities said. "It's very frustrating," said New Kent County Sheriff Farrar W. Howard, whose Virginia office is leading the investigation in conjunction with Virginia State Police and the New York City Police Department. Burnet left Richmond on a bus bound for New York on December 26, according to his father, Mark. The parents of a missing Virginia college student plan to travel to New York on Thursday to assist in his search. According to Burnet's father, Burnet and a friend had made plans to hang out together back in Virginia on January 2, but Burnet never made it back.
