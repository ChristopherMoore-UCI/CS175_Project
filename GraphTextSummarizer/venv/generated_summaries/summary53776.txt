Murray couldn't repeat the form which saw him down Djokovic in straight sets on Friday, instead playing second fiddle to 30-year-old Federer. -- Roger Federer brushed aside the challenge of Andy Murray on Saturday to claim his fifth Dubai Open title. The 16-time grand slam champion started the second set in similar fashion breaking Murray in the third game, before the world No.4 fought back to level at 3-3 -- breaking Federer's run of 66 unbroken service games in the process. Murray was happy to have achieved a couple of notable victories (Tomas Berdych and Djokovic) during the week, but conceded it was always going to be a challenge facing Federer in the final. Four games later, Federer made Murray pay, breaking his serve to go ahead 6-5 before serving out the set.
