-- A day of strikes dubbed "Black Thursday" in France looked more like "Gray Thursday," with officials reporting a mixed impact across the country. Specifically, workers are anxious about a range of problems, including low salaries, poor buying power and job insecurity. Paris municipal authorities said it was difficult for them to ensure a minimum service Thursday because they were not given enough notice for the strike. Hospital and postal workers, bank staffers, air traffic controllers and auto workers also walked off the job. Union officials plan to meet Monday to consider future strikes, they said.
