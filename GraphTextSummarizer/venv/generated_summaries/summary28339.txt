For Gaga, the role marks her largest TV gig to date and first series regular scripted gig after multiple appearances on unscripted fare including "So You Think You Can Dance," "The X Factor" and "American Idol." Gaga also becomes the latest pop icon to join one of Murphy's shows after former American Idol breakout Adam Lambert nabbed a recurring role on Fox's Glee. Star Lange has repeatedly said that season four — Freak Show — would likely be her last; co-star Sarah Paulson is set to star as Marcia Clark in Murphy's FX anthology "American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson;" and Emma Roberts is poised to topline Fox's horror comedy anthology "Scream Queens" alongside "Glee's" Lea Michele.

Gaga's casting (which comes shorty after Oscars tribute to Julie Andrews dominated social media as well as her engagement to Chicago Fire star Taylor Kinney) is the latest coup for Murphy, who previously persuaded leading ladies including Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates to join his ever-evolving AHS. Season five of American Horror Story will likely debut in October; a specific premiere date has not yet been determined.
