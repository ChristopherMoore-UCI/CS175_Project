When Chinese photographer Wang Wenlan first pressed the shutter on a borrowed Soviet camera in 1967, he was a teenager taking photos to kill time during Chairman Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. " Next year will mark Wang's 40th year in photojournalism. Curator Judy Polumbaum -- a Chinese media scholar and former colleague of Wang -- said his work is a great window to examine contemporary China. Photography was an outlet for Wang during the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, when China was convulsed by violent class struggle. "China is unfinished," said Wang, who is also fan and critic of classic music.
