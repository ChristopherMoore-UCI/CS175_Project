Last year, Efron's "High School Musical 3: Senior Year" bowed with $42 million, and while "17 Again" may have fallen short of that mark, it still represents an auspicious maiden voyage for Efron's post-Disney career. Fueled by a hefty dose of tweener love, Zac Efron's "17 Again" won this weekend's box office sweepstakes without breaking a sweat. Overall box office was up for the fourth straight weekend, surging 21 percent over this same weekend last year. In 2007, the musical "Hairspray," which co-starred Efron, opened first at $27.5 million. The film's haul marked another No. 1 debut for Efron, who helped boost ticket sales with an appearance this weekend on Saturday Night Live.
