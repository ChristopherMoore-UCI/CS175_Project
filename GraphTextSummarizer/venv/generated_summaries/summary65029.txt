Some, such as not-for-profit Providence Health Services, see this as a way for companies to look outside the realm of candidates they normally recruit, giving them a much broader audience, said Rhonda Stickley, a spokeswoman for the company providing health care services in Alaska, Washington state, Montana, Oregon and California. And Brandy Ellis, a recruiter at Colorado-based Level 3 Communications, a provider of IP transit networks, said gone are the days when companies simply posted their listings and then looked around for ways to fill them. The site, at www.universe.jobs and recently expanded by the DirectEmployers Association, is a clearinghouse of job listings that aims to create both a unified platform and one-stop shopping for both employers and employees. The aim, according to Tom Embrescia of Employ Media, which is the licensed operator of the .jobs doman, is to create "a trusted, valued source where job seekers and the people who have the jobs -- the employers -- can connect seamlessly under one intuitive URL. According to Bill Warren, executive director of DirectEmployers -- a nonprofit human resources consortium -- 580 Fortune 1000 companies have already responded and are actively posting jobs on the site.
