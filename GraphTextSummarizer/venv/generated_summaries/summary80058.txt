"It's stunning that the governor of Iowa is so unfamiliar with pig farming that he doesn't know the difference between gestation crates and farrowing crates," said Paul Shapiro, vice president of Farm Animal Protection at the Humane Society of the United States. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad said Gov. Chris Christie's veto of a ban that would have prohibited the use of pig gestation crates in New Jersey was a "good decision." He said group housing can result in aggression between pigs, and gestation crates help protect adult pigs from each other. In his comments Monday, Branstad appeared to be conflating gestation crates with farrowing gates, which keep pigs separated from piglets after giving birth but still allows access for nursing. Dave Warner, spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, acknowledged that farrowing crates -- not gestation crates -- are used to prevent sows from stepping on piglets, and said someone who makes comments like Branstad's are "just mixing them up."
