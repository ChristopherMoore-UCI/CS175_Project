Other steps proposed by Arias included moving up elections scheduled for late November, establishing a national unity government, providing amnesty for all political crimes and setting up an international commission to oversee implementation of the accord. -- Honduras' interim government on Sunday rejected a proposal to reinstate ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya, ending a round of negotiations aimed at resolving the country's political crisis. In Sunday's editions of the Folha newspaper, Zelaya was quoted in support of continuing with his push for a reform to term limits. The proposal, presented by Arias to both sides on Saturday, would have returned Zelaya to the Honduran presidency. The newspaper, however, noted that Zelaya was interviewed one day before he agreed to Arias' seven-point proposal.
