"The weather was not favorable at that time of the morning," Rowe told CNN on Friday. The series of Pacific fronts pounded southern California hardest, but the storms also strafed western Arizona, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah, which all were under flood watches and warnings that stretched until early Friday morning. The heavy rains also produced potential health hazards for swimmers and surfers on particular parts of Los Angeles' beaches, and Los Angeles County officials warned recreational users to be careful when next to drains or waterways because they carry bacteria and trash from streets and mountainsides. California Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado late Thursday afternoon proclaimed a state of emergency for Kings, Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties, to expedite government assistance and aid to the region. "Fortunately, discharging storm drains, creeks, and rivers only comprises a small portion of the beach, and therefore, anybody who wants to go to the beach will be able to enjoy their outing," said Jonathan E. Fielding, the county's public health director and health officer.
