Astaire told CNN that Rodger never expressed any fascination with guns. Astaire also mentioned a feud that Rodger had had recently with his roommates, saying Rodger complained to his landlord that his roommates were too noisy and played lots of video games. Looking back, Rodger's parents now feel that the well-being check in April by police was a "pivotal moment," and his parents are frustrated, Astaire said. Lichin Rodger called 911, and the parents set off for Santa Barbara from Los Angeles, according to Astaire. According to Astaire, that's when Rodger's mother saw her son's latest video, called "Retribution," that he posted Friday, the day of the shootings.
