President Ali Abdullah Saleh left Yemen on Sunday and stopped in Oman before continuing Monday on a trip to the United States, Yemeni government sources said. Protesters set up tents in Sanaa Monday, repeating anti-Saleh chants for hours. Saleh apologized to his people and called for protesters to stop demonstrations in a speech broadcast on Yemeni state television before his departure Sunday. The purpose of Saleh's U.S. trip is a "private medical visit," the Yemeni Embassy in Washington said in a statement Sunday. In return, Saleh will step down from power in Yemen next month after ruling the country for more than 33 years.
