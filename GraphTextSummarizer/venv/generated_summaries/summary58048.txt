The decision to dump Williams, in my view, has as much to do with his Fox News connection as his admission that he gets nervous when he sees people in Muslim garb on his plane. While Fox has practically declared war on National Public Radio, many liberals from Salon editor Joan Walsh to CNN contributor Donna Brazile to Whoopi Goldberg of "The View" criticized the radio network for axing Williams. On Sunday, we'll look at NPR's decision to ax Juan Williams over remarks about Muslims that he made on Fox News. I'll also have a wide-ranging conversation about politics and culture with New York Times columnist Frank Rich. We'll tackle that question with the Chicago Tribune's Clarence Page, CBS's Chip Reid and commentator S.E. Cupp.
