A $27.40 (20 euro) lottery ticket that matches all the numbers of the first place El Gordo prize would win $548,000 (400,000 euros), but the winner would have to pay $109,000 (80,000 euros) in taxes, the Treasury Ministry said. Year after year, the biggest winner is the state, which keeps $1.3 billion -- or 30% -- of the entire lottery intake, which reached $4.3 billion this year. On Sunday alone, in the annual Christmas lottery that will pay out about $3 billion in prize money, the government anticipates collecting tens of millions of dollars in taxes, the Treasury Ministry told CNN. For the first time, big winners in Spain's annual Christmas lottery will have to pay a 20% tax on their winnings if the prize is greater than 2,500 euros, or $3,425. Most of the prizes are relatively small, but the lucky ones holding part of the $875 million (640 million euro) first place prize, known as El Gordo -- "the fat one" -- will face the tax bite.
