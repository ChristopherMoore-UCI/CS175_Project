If you want to donate books for the people of Sandvoort, go to their Facebook page for information or to Better World Books. That's why I was comfortable taking on a library project," Cusimano said. "It's something that they wanted for so many years, and they just had no idea how to start," said Matt Cusimano, a Peace Corps volunteer and a teacher at the primary school in Sandvoort, a village of nearly 200 people. But most villagers, Cusimano said, can barely afford toothpaste. With a daughter in the primary school, carpenter Korth Leitch gave of his time by becoming the construction lead on the project.
