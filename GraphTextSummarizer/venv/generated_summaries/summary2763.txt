In his opening remarks, Committee Chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, said that U.S. work on global health issues should be strongly bipartisan, such as President George W. Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and the reauthorization of the measure in 2008. Aside from a moral obligation, improving the health of people in other nations is smart foreign policy, former President Clinton said Wednesday. " Gates and Clinton acknowledged budget restraints in providing care to people around the world but said the work was important. "We live in an interdependent world in which we have learned the hard way that no matter how brilliantly our forces perform, we can not kill, jail or occupy all of our adversaries," he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in discussing why the issue of global health should be important to the United States. He and Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft and co-chairman of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, testified on global health before the committee.
