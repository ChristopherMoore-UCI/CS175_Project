Algeria won its opening Group C tie with South Africa 3-1 but the score could have been very different if it hadn't been for own goals and missed penalties from the "Bafana Bafana." A late goal from Moussa Sow secured Senegal all three points in dramatic fashion as it saw off Ghana 2-1 in the Africa Cup of Nations Group C opener at Estadio de Mongomo Monday. With the scores tied at 1-1 and the match running deep into stoppage time, Senegal seemed as if it would miss out on a deserved victory after running Ghana ragged for much of the 90 minutes. Four-time champion Ghana look rattled and Senegal seemed to determined to pounce, only for chance after chance to be tossed away -- Ghana had to do without captain Asamoah Gyan as he continues to recover from a bout of malaria, but was able to call on brothers Andre and Jordan Ayew -- and it was the younger sibling who opened the scoring in Equatorial Guinea.
