Passersby found human bones about nine miles from where Kristi Cornwell of Blairsville, Georgia, was last seen in August 2009, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said. "What you do first is compare people missing from Union County," Bankhead told CNN Atlanta affiliate WSB. Last summer, on the one year anniversary of Cornwell's disappearance, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it had conducted interviews at 450 houses in the Union County area and that its file on the case had grown to 38 volumes. "Right now, the only person missing from Union County is Kristi Cornwell, so we'll be looking to see if there might be (a) connection to these remains. The site where the bones were discovered and Blairsville are both in Union County, in far northern Georgia.
