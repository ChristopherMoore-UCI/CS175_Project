Tourist information offices normally stay open year-round but have shorter hours in the winter. In Florence, you'll see Renaissance paintings and Michelangelo's David without peak-season crowds. In shoulder season you'll enjoy decent weather, long days, fewer crowds and a local tourist industry that is still eager to please and entertain. Outside of peak season, adventurers loiter all alone through Leonardo's home, ponder un-pestered in Rome's Forum, kick up sand on virgin beaches and chat with laid-back guards by log fires in French chateaux. The solo traveler won't have the built-in camaraderie of other travelers that he or she would find in peak season.
