Nielsen's 2012 annual report on online shopping behaviors of Chinese consumers showed that for a couple of key categories covered in the survey, men were more active than women in online shopping. A Nielsen survey found 85% of Chinese consumers regularly used social media to share their experiences with online purchases. Satisfied customers with successful online purchases are likely to drive more sales as consumers share positive experiences via social media. E-commerce and online shopping flip the traditional store-to-consumer, one-way conversation. According to the survey, 66% of connected consumers were both microblog and social networking site users.
