But Nuevo Leon State Attorney General Alejandro Garza y Garza told reporters Friday that the death of Rodriguez, who was killed on his ranch Thursday, might not be connected with organized crime, state-run news agency Notimex reported. On Thursday, authorities said gunmen killed Prisciliano Rodriguez Salinas, the mayor of Doctor Gonzalez, a small town in the border state of Nuevo Leon. Aragon said in a statement that the attacks were "cases that exemplify that the Mexican political class has once again become cannon fodder due to the inability of the federal government to contain the violence that prevails in our country." President Felipe Calderon condemned the Nuevo Leon attack. Authorities have said drug cartels were suspected in earlier deaths of the politicians, a relatively recent development in the government's bloody war on organized crime that has seen more than 28,000 people killed in less than four years. The shooting was the latest in a string of attacks against elected officials in Mexico, where at least four mayors have been killed in the past two months.
