Neither proposal recognizes that oil prices today are determined by the highest bidder in global oil markets. This policy initiative confuses the increased financialization of oil futures markets in recent years with illegal activities such as market manipulation. There is no evidence that rising crude oil prices were caused by market manipulation, and there is no reason to expect increased oversight to lower gas prices across America. Notably, between 2003 and mid-2008, global demand for oil increased faster than global oil production, resulting in a sustained increase in the price of oil. For example, seemingly compelling and widely cited data regarding the relative size of the financial market for oil and the physical volume of oil being consumed has been shown to be misleading.
