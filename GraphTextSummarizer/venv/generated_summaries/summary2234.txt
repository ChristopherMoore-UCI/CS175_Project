As the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals observed in striking down the individual mandate, when Congress exceeds the outer bounds of its authority, "the Constitution requires judicial engagement, not judicial abdication." A 2011 Institute for Justice study, "Government Unchecked: The False Problem of 'Judicial Activism' and the Need for Judicial Engagement," compared the number of laws struck down by the Supreme Court to the number of laws passed by Congress and state legislatures. From 1954 to 2002, the court struck down, in whole or in part, just two-thirds of one percent of laws passed by Congress and less than one-twentieth of a percent of laws passed by state legislatures. In the balance of power between the elected and judicial branches, the scales tip heavily toward Congress and state legislatures. Toobin: Court's Obama order a 'hissy fit' These tiny numbers and percentages of laws struck are generally consistent over time â€” including into the Roberts Court era, as a different data set with more recent rulings shows.
