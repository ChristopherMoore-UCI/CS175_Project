Changes to ballot laws last spring now give candidates about two weeks after they declare on January 19 to collect 1,000 signatures from registered Republicans for a ballot spot -- a difficult task during the cold season. They not only impede ballot access but end up denying open representative democracy to operate on the road to the Oval Office. Local laws allowed them to restrict ballot access until public pressure and a court injunction overruled their attempted end-run around democracy. In many cases, the rules are imposed by state party bosses who are less interested in democracy than in rigging the system to benefit their favored candidates. But if they are able to build enough support in those states, they can find themselves cut off at the knees in later primary states with high-hurdle filing deadlines or signature requirements.
