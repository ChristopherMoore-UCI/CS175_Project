All three suspects are from the Jackson, Mississippi, metro area, and they are believed to be acquaintances of the victim, who is from Madison, Mississippi, said university Police Chief Georgia Lindley. The suspects were apparently selling drugs and drugs were found at the scene of the shooting, Lindley told CNN affiliate WREG. Duntae Harvey, 21, was arrested Monday and was being transferred Tuesday from Rankin County, where he has been held, university officials said. Mason Perry Jones, 21, of Jackson was arrested Monday in Memphis by members of the U.S. Marshal's Fugitive Task Force, Lindley said. All three suspects are facing a charge of capital murder with the intent to sell a controlled substance, Lindley said.
