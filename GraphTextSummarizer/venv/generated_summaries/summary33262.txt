-- Three Napoli fans received hospital treatment and one remains in a critical condition Sunday after violence marred the Italian Cup final between Napoli and Fiorentina in Rome. Meanwhile, in Spain, Barcelona's hopes of defending the La Liga title suffered a serious setback after conceding an injury time equalizer against Getafe. The second half was a much cagier affair as Napoli coach Rafa Benitez, looking for a trophy in his first season at the club, tried to close the game down. Reports from domestic news agency ANSA said three Napoli supporters suffered gunshot wounds in clashes before Saturday's match in the Olympic stadium, while another from Rome was hospitalized with injuries. But Napoli broke away on the counter attack and Belgian international Dries Mertens made it 3-1, securing the club's fifth Coppa Italia success.
