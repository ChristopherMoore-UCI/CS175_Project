Sara Payne, whose slain daughter was the namesake of Sarah's Law, said Thursday that police have confirmed unspecified "details" on a list kept by private eye Glenn Mulcaire, one of the central figures in the scandal that took down the 168-year-old News of the World earlier this month. Thursday's disclosure was the latest twist in a scandal that has reverberated across the highest levels of the United Kingdom, featuring allegations of widespread phone-hacking, bribery of police officers by journalists and a bungled initial probe. And Rebekah Brooks, the former News of the World editor and News International chief who has been arrested as a result of the scandal, called the revelation "abhorrent and particularly upsetting as Sara Payne is a dear friend. Journalists at News of the World are accused of bribing police to get private details about people, including members of the royal family. News International is the British arm of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., which also owns the Fox television and cable networks and the New York Post in the United States.
