There are a total 2,648 cases of E. coli infection in Germany, according to the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's top health authority. There have also been a handful of infections in a dozen other European countries, but they appear to be linked to northern Germany. The planned settlement still needs to be accepted by EU member states on June 14, Ciolos said. There was no trace of E. coli in a pack of bean sprouts in a household in Hamburg, where a man had become infected, health authorities there told CNN Tuesday. Local officials in the German state of Lower Saxony said another man, aged 73, also died, but he had other health problems as well, so they are not certain his death was due to E. coli.
