In today's modern world, developments in technology and yacht design give sailors an ever changing arsenal of tools, as competitors drive each other to new heights of innovation. And in Dubai at the Month World Sailing Championships, Shirley takes to the water to experience hydrofoil sailing -- this is the innovation to which the French Hydroptere team attribute their world speed record which Larsen so badly wants to take from them. This month on CNN MainSail, Shirley Robertson takes a look at speed -- what drives one particular breed of sailor to be the fastest on the planet? Forever changing, constantly progressing, sailing is a sport driven by many factors. Finally Shirley meets Cameron Lewis, crew member on the first boat to sail round the world in less than 80 days -- the current Jules Verne record stands at much less than that, a target which Franck Cammas and his Groupama team are currently trying to better; Shirley talks to them via satellite phone to find out what drives them on their quest.
