The movies, which chronicle the exploits of a group of male strippers in Florida, feature hot breakdancing moves, lots of skin, mounds of muscles -- and crowds of screaming women bearing dollar bills. "Magic Mike XXL" is counting on the extra sexy trailer and film poster to build on the success of the first movie, which grossed $167,221,571 worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. The "MMXXL" trailer opens with a masked Magic Mike, played by Channing Tatum, welding metal in a suggestive manner and then breaking into a smooth dance routine to Ginuwine's "Pony." Fans of the "Magic Mike" franchise got a hump day treat with a trailer for sequel "Magic Mike XXL" dropping on Wednesday. Viewers can expect more partying, fast cars and sexual entanglements as seen in the first installment.
