-- A young transient who said he was trying to shake zombies off a stolen semi-trailer truck he was driving caused a major freeway incident in southern California that sent four people to the hospital and tied up traffic for hours, the California Highway Patrol said. Officer Nate Baer said Hartline had been riding with truck driver Daniel Martinez since his trip started in Tennessee after being kicked out of his home. "He thought zombies were chasing him and clinging to the truck," Baer said in an e-mail. Hartline has been charged with taking a vehicle without the owner's consent and receiving known stolen property, court records said. When Martinez stopped to fill out paperwork at an inspection site, he left Hartline alone in the truck, Baer said.
