I watched her work with other children at the HALO -- Helping Autism through Learning and Outreach -- center in Austin, Texas, where she teaches while Tito attends school. Tito Mukhopadhyay shuffles to the front door of his home in Austin, Texas. Eventually, an organization in the United States brought Soma and Tito, then 10 years old, to the United States to study him because he defied the stereotype of an autistic child. Tito Mukhopadhyay uses poetry to talk with his mother, Soma. That was a label Soma never accepted for 19-year-old Tito.
