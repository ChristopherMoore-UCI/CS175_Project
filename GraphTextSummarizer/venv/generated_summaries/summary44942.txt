This is the start of Twitter's promotion of its new hashtag pages: "The updated Twitter for Facebook integration now includes additional rich media experiences related to the first photo, URL, @mention or #hashtag in the cross-posted tweet," Twitter spokesman Robert Weeks told Mashable last week. Twitter's Help Center also notes the changes: "We have fixed many issues with the Twitter for Facebook integration, including the ability to post to Facebook Pages, and added some new features!" The 16-second clip features NASCAR racer Brad Keselowski seated in his car and taking a picture of the scene with his iPhone. Keselowski, who came in 24th place during the race, is taking advantage of the iPhone's capability to upload pictures directly to Twitter. What's especially interesting about the TV commercial is how Twitter plugged the NASCAR hashtag at the end of the TV spot.
