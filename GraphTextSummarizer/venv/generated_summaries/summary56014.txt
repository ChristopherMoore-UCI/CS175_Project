In the wake of the attack on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, "every country, including Russia," must determine whether it is "together with the terrorists or together with the civilized world," Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said Monday. " Poroshenko also denied suggestions by Russia that a Ukrainian jet may have downed the plane. " Ukraine has "a lot of evidence that these people are supported by Russia, trained by Russia, armed by Russia," he added. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Poroshenko said, "Every country and every person, and every leader should find out their own place." "We know exactly" where a missile was shot that hit the plane Thursday, killing all 298 people aboard, and where the flight crashed, he said. The third crime is that "terrorists" have tried to destroy evidence, he said.
