-- It's going to take more than free beer, gift cards and iPads to convince uninsured young adults that opting out of health coverage under Obamacare is a good decision. These benefits, like maternity and newborn care, prescription drug and mental health coverage, are particularly important to young people. And with fewer employers offering young workers health care benefits, the need for affordable coverage has never been greater. In the same way, at some point everyone gets sick and needs health insurance coverage, even those of us who are young and seem healthy. Generation Y shouldn't gamble when it comes to their health -- especially when Obamacare makes health insurance coverage so affordable.
