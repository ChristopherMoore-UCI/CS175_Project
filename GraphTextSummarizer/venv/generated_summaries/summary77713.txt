At its peak, Jardim Gramacho had about 5,000 catadores, people who spend their days scouring landfills for plastic, paper, wood, metal and anything else that can be sold to recycling companies. At Jardim Gramacho, about 75 million cubic meters of methane gas will be collected over the next 15 years. The landfill, known as Jardim Gramacho or Gramacho Gardens, is piled almost 300 feet high across 14 million square feet -- the equivalent of 244 American football fields. Severina Alzira Silva, 87, is described in the cooperative's blog as one of the oldest pickers working in the Gramacho landfill. At the turn of the century, complaints arose that Guanabara Bay was not safe for bathing because of contaminants leaching from Jardim Gramacho.
