The big changes we had at the start of 2009 gave all sorts of new opportunities; different ways to approach things, don't simply do things the way we've always done and really try to think what are we trying to achieve here, what is the best solution or set of solutions to suit new regulations. I enjoy the blend of design engineering, working with my fellow engineers, my colleagues here at Red Bull, working with the drivers, working with the mechanics and that blend of design and competition that we're out there every couple of weeks being measured on how we're doing -- which if it's going well it's great, and if it's going poorly it's a lot of pressure. Of course other people recognized that and over the coming years increasingly cars became a clone of the 1988 car. We will typically go from a blank sheet of paper to a complete in a space of around six months, and that's something which the aeronautical sector in particular is fascinated by because they have league times which are more like 10 years. Can you talk through the process from design to the road?
