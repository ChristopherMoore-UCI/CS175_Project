-- Ten years ago, Sharon Rocha was expecting her pregnant daughter, Laci Peterson, at dinner on Christmas Eve. Rocha and others slowly grew suspicious of Laci's husband, Scott Peterson. Rocha sold the home she lived in when Laci disappeared, but she still lives in Modesto. Prosecutors posited this theory at his trial: Peterson, who was having an extramarital affair with a massage therapist, smothered or strangled Laci in the bedroom of their Modesto home on December 23 or 24, 2002. Laci's half-sister Amy (they shared a father) is a hairstylist and still cuts Rocha's hair.
