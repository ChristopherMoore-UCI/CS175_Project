Barcelona have already banked nearly $30 million from the sale last week of Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure to English Premier League side Manchester City. Barcelona president Sandro Rosell has admitted that the proposed transfer of Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal is now in doubt. " Barcelona retained the Spanish Primera Liga title last season, but lost in the semifinals of the Champions League to eventual winners Inter Milan. "The transfer of Cesc is becoming more complicated because there are a lot of expectations on the side of the sellers and that is not good news for Barcelona," AFP quoted Rosell from Catalian radio station RAC1 on Tuesday. Premier League Arsenal are desperate to retain the services of Fabregas and have placed a big price tag on their talisman which may make the Catalan giants think twice about signing him.
