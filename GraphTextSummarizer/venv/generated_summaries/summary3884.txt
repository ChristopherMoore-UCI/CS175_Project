According to a 2011 survey by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers between 18 and 20 have the "highest incidence of crash or near-crash experience," and report the highest level of phone involvement at the time of a crash or near crash. Abby Sletten, 20, appeared in Traill County District Court on Wednesday to face a count of negligent homicide, court documents said. Although many car accidents happen because of distracted driving, it's difficult to determine whether cellphone usage is the cause unless officials are able to search the suspect's phone, as they did in Sletten's case, Niewind said. Bryan Niewind said it is against state law to compose or read electronic messages while driving. The North Dakota texting and driving law, enacted in 2011, prohibits drivers from reading, writing and sending electronic messages, including email, KVLY/KXJB reported.
