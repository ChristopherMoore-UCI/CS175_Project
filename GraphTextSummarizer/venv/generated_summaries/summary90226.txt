" Brodman issued a "letter to T-Mobile customers" on Tuesday explaining that customers disappointed about the carrier not having the iPhone should take a look at Android devices. The next iPhone will debut in October, said Apple board member Al Gore, and is set to be announced at an event October 4, according to a report from the Journal's AllThingsD website. But the iPhone will not be available for T-Mobile customers in October, he said onstage at the GigaOm Mobilize event. Smartphones account for three-quarters of devices sold by T-Mobile, and 90% of those run Google's Android, an operating system that competes with Apple's, Brodman said on Monday. T-Mobile has expressed to Apple its desire to carry the iPhone, said Cole Brodman, T-Mobile USA's marketing chief.
