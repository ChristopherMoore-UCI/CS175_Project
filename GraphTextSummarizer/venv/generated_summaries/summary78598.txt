The man was approaching the quarterdeck when sailors working security confronted him, Clark said. -- A civilian boarded a U.S. Navy destroyer at the world's largest naval base, took a gun from a Navy guard and used it to fatally shoot a sailor before security personnel shot and killed him Monday night, Naval Station Norfolk's commanding officer told reporters Tuesday. The civilian had credentials to be on the base but breached security to get on the ship, a U.S. defense official told CNN earlier Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity. Washington Navy Yard shooter raised concern previously, but military said it wasn't told CNN's Tina Burnside and Jonathan Helman contributed to this report. Clark said he didn't know why the man was there Monday night, and he didn't provide details about the nature of his previous work at the base.
