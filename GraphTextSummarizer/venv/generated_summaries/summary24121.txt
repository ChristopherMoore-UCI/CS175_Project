Federal government officials said the four -- including teams in Texas, Ohio and two in California -- were not flown there because Haiti could not "absorb" them and because they were being held as relief for crews that made it into the country. Twitter updates Asked Monday on CNN "American Morning" why the four U.S. teams and some teams in Canada had not been brought to Haiti, Kenneth Merten, the U.S. ambassador to the country, said, "I'll be honest with you. Coutts said USAID directed FEMA to prepare four more teams for possible deployment to "ensure that any additional search-and-rescue needs could be met immediately upon request." Based on postings on their Web sites, the teams thought they were going to Haiti, until being told to stand down Monday. Disaster experts said a bottleneck at the main airport in Port-au-Prince could have prevented the crews from entering Haiti quickly, but they scoffed at the suggestion that the teams, skilled in locating and freeing people entombed in collapsed buildings, should be held in reserve. In the event of earthquakes, moving US&R teams should be the "highest possible priority," and the only limitation should be insurmountable logistical ones, Redlener said.
