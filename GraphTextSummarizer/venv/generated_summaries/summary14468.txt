There have been big stars involved in Pixar films -- Tom Hanks and Paul Newman have both participated -- but the name voices in Pixar's biggest box-office success, "Finding Nemo," were comedians Albert Brooks and Ellen DeGeneres. And story always comes first, says "Up" producer Jonas Rivera. A boy tags along with an old man and his traveling house in the new Pixar movie, "Up." Including its first feature, "Toy Story," in 1995, the animation powerhouse Pixar has released nine full-length films. In the case of "Up," the story involves the elderly Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, who had a happy marriage and a career as a balloon seller for many years. Uh, no, says Pete Docter, the director of Pixar's 10th feature, "Up," which opens Friday.
