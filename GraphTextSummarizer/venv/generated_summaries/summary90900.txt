By Friday afternoon, 391 flights at New York's three major airports had been canceled as a result of snow, according to spokesman Steve Coleman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings, watches and advisories for portions of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Vermont for Friday. "I spoke to a couple of folks and they're just worried about the cleanup work afterwards," said New York resident Hoyman Leung. Forecasters projected between 2 and 4 inches of snow across the greater New York City area, with heavier amounts expected over eastern sections of Long Island. Southwest Airlines expanded the option for passengers flying in and out of not just New York and Pennsylvania airports but also Washington Dulles and Baltimore/Washington airports.
