" Djokovic will now face Tomas Berdych after the Czech knocked out No.3 seed Andy Murray, from Britain, 6-7 6-2 6-3 and the Serbian said his next opponent is a threat on any surface. Djokovic is on course to meet defending champion Rafael Nadal in the final after the Spaniard maintained his incredible winning streak in Monte Carlo with a 7-5 6-4 victory over Poland's Stanislas Wawrinka. He had a great match against Andy today. I'm very satisfied that I was able to compose myself and get on the court and try to win matches. "Today was a bit better, but still a lot of emotional ups and downs throughout the match," he was quoted as saying on the ATP Tour's website.
