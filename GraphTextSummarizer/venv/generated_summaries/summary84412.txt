-- Luxembourg's Andy Schleck has been forced to pull out of this year's Tour de France due to injuries he suffered in a warm-up race, he confirmed Wednesday. Contador, given a retrospective two-year ban which ends after this year's Tour de France, is set to make his return at the Tour of Spain where Andy Schleck hopes to compete. It completes a miserable 2012 for Schleck, who has been forced to abandon preparatory stage races such as Paris-Nice, the Tour of Catalunya and the Dauphine through a mixture of injury and illness. His brother Franck, who finished third in last year's Tour de France, will now spearhead the RadioShack effort at this year's race. Millar served a two-year ban from 2004-2006 for a doping offense and under a then British Olympic Association bye-law was banned for life from Olympic competition.
