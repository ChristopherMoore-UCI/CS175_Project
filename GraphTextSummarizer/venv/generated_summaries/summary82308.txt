The death certificate for Boston bombings suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who died April 19 after a shootout with police, says he died of "gunshot wounds of torso and extremities" and "blunt trauma to head and torso," according to the owner of the funeral parlor that currently holds Tsarnaev's body. Authorities have said they believe the brothers acted alone but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation have provided CNN with other critical details: -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators that he and his brother built the devices in Tamerlan's home; -- He said the brothers originally planned a suicide attack on the city's massive Independence Day celebration, which draws about 500,000 people and is televised nationally on CBS; -- Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told investigators that the brothers chose to target the Boston Marathon only a day or two before the event. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Devens, Massachusetts, charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, a charge that carries the death penalty.
