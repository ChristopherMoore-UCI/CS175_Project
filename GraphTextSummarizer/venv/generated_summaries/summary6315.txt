Allegations of misconduct within marching bands have garnered national attention after a hazing ritual resulted in the death of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion, 26, last November. According to the Herald-Sun newspaper in Durham, the school is ordering drum line members to attend a hazing prevention workshop and perform community service. -- After a month-long investigation, Clark Atlanta University lifted a self-imposed suspension on the school's marching band after finding no evidence of hazing. Another, North Carolina Central University, suspended its marching band's drum line for two weeks in September after an investigation into allegations of hazing found that all members of the line had violated the school's code of conduct. And Texas Southern University suspended its "Ocean of Soul" band last week to investigate a possible hazing incident involving a section of the band.
