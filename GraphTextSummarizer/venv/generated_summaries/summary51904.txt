It would be so much easier for them this way, both being able to go, be together in heaven," Leroy Kauffman, pastor of the Marrowbone Christian Brotherhood Church in Burkesville, said in a press conference Friday. The wreck happened between 5:30 a.m. and 6 a.m. at mile marker 63 on Interstate 65, roughly 40 miles northwest of Bowling Green, near Mammoth Cave National Park, said Lt. David Jude, a spokesman for the Kentucky State Police. The northbound lanes remained closed early Friday afternoon, Jude said. The night before the accident, Steinmann said the Eshe family attended a church meeting with other members of the community, expressing excitement over the wedding and requesting prayers for safe travel. A Kentucky pastor said it was "easier" that a Mennonite couple that was engaged to be married died together in a car crash Friday instead of one having to live without the other.
