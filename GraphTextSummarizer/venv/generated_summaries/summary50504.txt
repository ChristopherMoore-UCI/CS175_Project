Obama received the five Kennedy Center honorees at the White House before the annual gala that honored this year Tom Hanks, Sting, Al Green, Lily Tomlin and ballerina Patricia McBride. Earlier in the evening Obama also honored Hanks and his cult roles in movies like "Big" -- which Obama said he watched Saturday night -- "Apollo 13" and "Forrest Gump," in which Hanks' character gives another U.S. President, Lyndon B. Johnson, a look at his wounded behind in the movie. Comedy Central show host Stephen Colbert, who emceed the Kennedy Center event, made sure he spotlighted the high profile guests at last night's events, especially whom he called the "most powerful and influential person in the world": First lady Michelle Obama. President Barack Obama took an evening away from politicking Sunday to honor top artists -- and crack some jokes. But before then, Colbert's interview with Obama will air Monday night on "The Colbert Report."
