"This catastrophic failure by Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus clearly demonstrates that the circus industry needs a systematic design approach for the structures used in performances -- approaches that are developed, evaluated and inspected by professional engineers," said Dr. David Michaels, assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health. "We do not agree with the conclusion that they drew that the way the carabiner was loaded was the sole case of the accident," said spokesman Steve Payne. The so-called "human chandelier" stunt was performed May 4 at the Dunkin' Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island. "The safety of our performers, our crew -- as well as our audience -- is our top priority," said Payne. OSHA cited the circus for one serious safety violation with a proposed penalty of $7,000, the maximum allowed by law, regulators said in a statement Tuesday.
