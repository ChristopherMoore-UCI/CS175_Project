"U.S. diplomat William Bultemeier lost his life while representing his country overseas, and U.S. Marine Christopher McNeely was gravely wounded trying to protect him, all during the brazen armed carjacking allegedly perpetrated by the defendant and his confederate," Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement at the time. He was charged with the slaying of U.S. Department of Defense official William Bultemeier in Niamey, Niger, in December 2000. U.S. Marine Christopher McNeely was wounded in the attack. In late 2009, Mohamed killed four Saudi Arabian nationals in northern Niger. Authorities said Mohamed and another suspect confronted a group of employees of the U.S. Embassy in Niger as they left a restaurant in Niamey.
