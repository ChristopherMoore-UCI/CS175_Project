"To lose an only child is a parent's worst nightmare," said Robert Mongeluzzi from Saltz, Mongeluzzi, Barrett & Bendesky law firm. The distracted tugboat pilot who crashed the barge into the sightseeing craft is serving time in federal prison for his criminal conduct associated with his role in the accident, federal prosecutors said. Devlin admitted that he was distracted by his cell phone and laptop for an extended period of time before the collision, that he piloted the tug, the Caribbean Sea, from its lower wheelhouse where he had significantly reduced visibility, and that he did not maintain a proper lookout or comply with other essential rules of seamanship, according to federal prosecutors. He also surrendered his Coast Guard-issued license as a mate, according to federal prosecutors. " During his opening statement, Mongeluzzi played a video clip of the accident that showed Schwendtner throwing a life preserver to Kyle Burkhardt, the duck boatÂ¹s first mate.
