A massive brawl involving two dozen people at a Queens, New York, casino was captured on video Friday night. Two of the men were given a summons for disorderly conduct and released, while the third remains in custody and has been charged with obstructing governmental administration, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct. The fight took place in the food court area of Resorts World Casino where approximately 300 people were still at the scene when police arrived, according to the New York Police Department. One witness told CNN affiliate WCBS the scene was "chaotic" and compared it to a World Wrestling Entertainment event. The cell phone video shows a number of men throwing punches and even chairs into crowds of people.
