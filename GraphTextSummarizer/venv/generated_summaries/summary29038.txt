Westwood won by seven shots from European Ryder Cup teammate Nicolas Colsaerts, South Africa's 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen and Austria's Bernd Wiesberger. "It's started to work already -- the last couple of weeks I've played well in Houston and at the Masters last week and this week I've obviously played very well. Westwood -- who won the Kuala Lumpur event in 1997 before it became co-sanctioned -- finished with a birdie as he signed for a bogey-free 68, while 71st-ranked Wiesberger shot 67, Oosthuizen made 68 and Colsaerts 70. The former teen prodigy, now 24, followed up her runner-up finish at the season's opening major tournament -- the Kraft Nabisco Championship -- as she won by two shots from fellow American Angela Stanford. World No. 1 Inbee Park of South Korea was third.
