CNN contacted Beijing's flood control office, municipal government emergency office and municipal meteorological bureau to get an updated death toll. "In recent years, floods caused by rain storms have repeatedly occurred in Chinese cities. Chinese media reported that there were various color-coded weather warnings, but several public policy experts complained in Chinese media that the warnings made sense only to experts, not the general public.

Many people marveled at how fragile the Beijing's infrastructure seemed for a modern metropolis.
