Seized by armed men Tuesday, the building in Ukraine's restive Donetsk region is just the latest to fall under the control of pro-Russian militants. Speaking at a meeting with the heads of regional state administrations, he said the authorities' task was to prevent the spread of the "terrorist threat" from separatists and pro-Russian saboteurs to other regions of Ukraine. Pushilin also confirmed that pro-Russian separatists have seized the police department in the town of Horlivka. In the foyer of the Luhansk government building -- outside which pro-Russian flags now fly -- more armed men, sandbags and wire surrounded a desk through which access to the rest of the building was controlled. Russian actions are clear attempts to escalate tensions within Ukraine."
