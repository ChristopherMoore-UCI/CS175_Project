Rancho Feeding Corp., based in Petaluma, California, made headlines in February with its recall of 8.7 million pounds of meat products, which followed a recall of more than 40,000 pounds of meat products in January. The affected Hot Pockets products were the two-pack box of Croissant Crust Philly Steak and Cheese, and three different pack sizes of Philly Steak and Cheese. Thousands of retailers have been added to a list of companies that could have received beef products from the producer, Rancho Feeding Corp., since the February recall, the USDA said. Recall of nearly 9 million pounds of meat not fully inspected "Thus, the products are adulterated, because they are unsound, unwholesome or otherwise are unfit for human food and must be removed from commerce," the government agency reported in February. The recalled products were produced and shipped between January 1, 2013, and January 7, 2014.
