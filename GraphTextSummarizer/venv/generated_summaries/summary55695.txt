Man who shot unarmed Michigan teen takes the stand Blood alcohol level of slain Detroit woman more than twice the legal limit Detroit woman's autopsy leaves questions " Siringas' co-counsel, Patrick Muscat, suggested in his closing argument that Wafer invented the self-defense scenario to hedge his bets, because he'd realized an accidental killing could still get him convicted of murder in the second degree. A claim of self defense allows jurors to find a defendant not guilty if they find he acted in the "honest and reasonable" belief he was in danger of being killed or seriously injured, according to Michigan law. A Michigan man accused of gunning down an unarmed young woman on his front porch in November was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder, manslaughter and possessing a firearm while committing a felony. While Wafer said at trial that he acted in self-defense when he shot McBride, he also said the shooting was accidental.
