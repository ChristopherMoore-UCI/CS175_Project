Clinton discusses Berghdal in book And the two have a lot to do with one another. Sources close to Clinton are talking about "war rooms" and "surrogate operations" instead of book signings. Clinton aides say the event was tied to her family's foundation  -- the Clinton Global Initiative -- and the fact that its annual meeting will be held in Denver later this month. With the stepped up rhetoric has come a more robust inner circle of Clinton aides to tightly and systematically trickle out information about the book. It is safe to say that Clinton's book roll out is one of the first to use phrases like war room and surrogate operation.
