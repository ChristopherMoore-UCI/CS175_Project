This means global banks have to operate an infrastructure for U.S. rules and a second infrastructure for the rules of other regulators. It's therefore not unreasonable that the U.S. regulators impose different oversight on foreign banks than domestic equivalents. By fining at the billion dollar level, banks wishing to operate within the U.S. will be encouraged to be far more carefully than domestic operations. Are U.S. regulators using financial penalties as a method of indirect regulations? Banks find it difficult to operate in the U.S. because they often have to adhere to rules that are diametrically opposed to rules in their home countries.
