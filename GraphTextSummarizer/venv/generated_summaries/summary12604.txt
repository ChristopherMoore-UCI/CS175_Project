-- Chinese government authorities have intimidated and unlawfully detained parents and relatives of children who died in last year's Sichuan earthquake and harassed their supporters, an Amnesty International report said this week. "By unlawfully locking up parents of children who died, the government is creating more misery for people who have said in some cases they lost everything in the Sichuan earthquake," said Roseann Rife, deputy program director of Amnesty International Asia-Pacific. The report cited Sichuan Executive Vice-Governor Wei Hong as stating that the earthquake itself was the most important cause of the collapse. The 52-page report, released Sunday and titled "Justice Denied: Harassment of Sichuan Earthquake Survivors and Activists," documented instances where parents and relatives said they had been detained for up to 21 days for trying to get answers from officials about their children's deaths. Parents and survivors have said school buildings were disproportionately affected because they were shoddily constructed, and they have accused government officials and construction contractors of being responsible.
