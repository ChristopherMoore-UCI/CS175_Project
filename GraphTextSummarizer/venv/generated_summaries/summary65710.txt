Some caveats: House leadership is not going to pass immigration reform over the heads of conservative Republicans. Just look at pronouncements in recent months by House Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, House GOP favorite Paul Ryan and many others, including some of Congress' most conservative Republicans. It hardly matters whether you blame the President, House Republicans or the immigration-reform movement. It falls under the general rubric of partisan gridlock, but the real sticking points are more localized: bitter mistrust between House Republicans and the White House, and a divide within the GOP driven by a relatively small handful of lawmakers and outside groups who oppose compromise of any kind on any issue. Many signs suggest they could, including what's going on behind the scenes among House Republicans.
