The workers at the Gold Fields mine had gone of strike to seek higher pay, the same as workers at several other South Africa mines. The fired workers were given 24 hours -- until Wednesday evening -- to appeal the decision, company spokesman Sven Lunsche said. Many workers returned to work this week, and the company said it fired those who did not return. Four people were wounded during clashes between security officers and striking workers at a Gold One mine in September. The line of workers wanting to appeal stretched for a kilometer.
