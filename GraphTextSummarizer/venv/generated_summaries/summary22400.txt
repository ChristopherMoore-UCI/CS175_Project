-- With only days to go before the U.N. High Level Panel puts forward its recommendations on development goals beyond 2015, after the current Millennium Development Goals expire, progress towards gender equality and increased empowerment of women hangs in the balance. In some areas such as North Africa and the Middle East, more women than men are enrolled in tertiary education, but women have yet to catch up in political representation, technology, access to capital and management skills, to name but a few examples. Give women equality of opportunity and the rest will follow. Families, communities and economies suffer when women are treated as unequal to men. In order for us to achieve real progress in development, gender equality must be a standalone goal.
