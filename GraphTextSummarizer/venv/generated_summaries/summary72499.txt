A state law signed this week by Gov. Jerry Brown makes Yelp reviews a lot safer, saying that restaurants can't pursue legal action for customers who give them negative reviews. It addresses so-called "disparagement clauses," lines included in businesses' terms of service that prohibit customers from posting negative comments about the service they received. Last month, Union Street Guest House in Hudson, New York, was featured in the New York Post for trying to fine wedding parties $500 for each negative online review by a member of their parties. Hundreds of people took to Yelp to complain about the policy and write mostly fake, eviscerating reviews of the hotel. Well, that hasn't stopped restaurants and other service-industry spots from trying to go after customers for just that.
