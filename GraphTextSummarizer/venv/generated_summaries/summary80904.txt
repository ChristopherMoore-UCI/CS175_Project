" Writing for The Wrap, Jethro Nededog noted Wednesday that the SAG nomination for Davis but not Washington may have illuminated the lingering diversity problem in Hollywood. With the announcement of nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards and Golden Globes, Viola Davis' fans had plenty to cheer about. But "Scandal" actress Kerry Washington, one of the darlings of awards seasons past, was nowhere to be found. Davis has received plenty of acclaim for her work in films and began drawing even more awards buzz from almost the moment she debuted as tough-as-nails law professor Annalise Keating on "How to Get Away With Murder." "But if it's true that there's only room for one black leading actress in the run for awards, then Hollywood isn't as progressive-minded as we believe ourselves to be."
