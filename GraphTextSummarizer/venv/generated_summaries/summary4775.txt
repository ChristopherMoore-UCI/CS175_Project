-- Egypt's landmark presidential election looks set to go to a run-off vote in which Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi could face former regime figure Ahmed Shafik, according to partial results reported Friday. Shafik, a former air force officer with close ties to Egypt's powerful military, is seen as representing the interests of the old guard -- those who lost out when President Mubarak was ousted. Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram Online gave Morsi 26.48% of the vote with results in from 25 of 27 provinces, with Shafik, who was ousted President Hosni Mubarak's last prime minister, close behind with 24.74% of the vote and leftist Hamdeen Sabahy in third with about 20%. Mubarak led the North African nation for 30 years before being forced out last year amid a popular outcry. But if the first round results in a run-off between Morsi and Shafik, many Egyptians -- particularly liberals and "revolutionaries" -- will be very disappointed, said Khaled Elgindy, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington who is currently in Egypt.
