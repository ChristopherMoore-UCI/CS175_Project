The Spaniard's serve was surprisingly broken early by his 54th-ranked opponent, but from 3-3 he dominated the match to set up a clash with French seventh seed Gael Monfils. The Australian, losing finalist in last year's French Open, will next face Julia Gorges -- who beat fellow German Sabine Lisicki 6-4 6-4. Former world No. 1 Ferrero, playing his first event since last September's U.S. Open following wrist and knee surgery, battled past Italy's Simone Vagnozzi 7-6 (7-3) 4-6 6-4. The winner of Friday's Ferrer-Melzer clash will face a Spaniard in the semifinals, with veteran Juan Carlos Ferrero and Nicolas Almagro also going through. The 29-year-old left-hander beat Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-4 7-6 (7-5) to set up a clash with Croatia's 56th-ranked Ivan Dodic, who knocked out young Canadian 15th seed 7-6 (7-0) 4-6 6-3.
