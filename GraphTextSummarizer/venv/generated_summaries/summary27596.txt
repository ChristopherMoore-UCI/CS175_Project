" Cala and King also talked about King's web-based show, "Larry King Now," that's been on Oratv.com and distributed by Hulu.com since July last year, and his backer -- Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. King -- the last person to interview Chavez on CNN -- recalls Chavez being easy to be around and engaging, even remembering him as a hugger and singer. " Cala even paid homage to his hero in his wardrobe choice for the interview, greeting King wearing a matching button-down shirt, tie and signature black suspenders. "The day Castro marched into Havana, I was on the air in Miami doing my morning show and I made the announcement," King told Ismael Cala in an interview for the "Cala" talk show on CNN en Espa√±ol. "What's funny is that he spoke perfect English off air, but once the interview started, we had an interpreter," King said.
