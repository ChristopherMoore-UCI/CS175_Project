"It is with much sadness that the Durkin family informs you of the loss of John Nolen Durkin and thanks everyone for their support during the past few days," his family said in a statement released through Bates. The 21-year-old attended Bates College, but was one of six students from the Maine school taking part in a study abroad program in Rome through Trinity College in Connecticut, his school said. Investigators are looking into the death of John Durkin, an economics major from Rye Beach, New Hampshire. Bates President Clayton Spencer expressed "deep sadness" for Durkin's death and saying his college shares "the tremendous grief of his family." Bates economics professor Margaret Mauer-Fazio recalled Durkin producing "nuanced, balanced and interesting" work on China's economic reform while in her class last fall, adding that "all his work was very strong."
