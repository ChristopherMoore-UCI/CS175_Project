Martin's account to the BBC shed fresh light on the grisly scene that confronted French police near Lake Annecy after the alarm was raised last Wednesday. They met with Surrey Police, whose officers have been helping French investigators to search the home of two of the victims, Saad and Ikbal al-Hilli, in Claygate town, Surrey county. " His account came as French prosecutor Maillaud and investigating Judge Michel Mollin were in Britain seeking new leads in the case. He added that he was not surprised that French police had failed to spot a second child, a 4-year-old girl, hiding in the back of the car under her dead mother's legs, for nearly eight hours. "We wish to reinforce our cooperation and understanding with hope to reach a conclusion to these horrible murders." Surrey Police will do all they can to assist the French-led investigation, said Rob Price, the assistant chief constable.
