Britain's Lee Westwood and American Kevin Chappell, both leading on six-under after 65s on Thursday, carded respective second rounds of 72 and 74 to drop back into the pack in Kentucky. As Tiger Woods hooked his tee shot at the first hole way left of the fairway, new world number one Rory McIlroy rolled home a birdie putt on his closing hole to lead the PGA Championship on nine-under-par. Jason Day of Australia got closest with a best of the day 65 to trail McIlroy by a stroke and he was joined on eight under by veteran American Jim Furyk. The 2013 British Open champion has only one top-10 finish all season, but moved to within three shots of leader McIlroy with his late charge. Woods did save par on the first after his errant tee shot, but left himself with an almost insurmountable task to make the weekend after a three-putt double bogey on the sixth.
