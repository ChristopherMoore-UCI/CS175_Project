When reports of Rawan's case began making headlines, the group issued a statement urging Yemen to protect  girls by setting 18 as the legal minimum age for marriage. "This case was fabricated, but many other cases of child marriage are true and tragic," Al-Qureshi said. Yemeni child rights advocate Ahmed Al-Qureshi, who'd investigated the case for more than two weeks, said that while no evidence showed Rawan had been married and had died, child marriage remains a crisis in the nation. Mashhour, the human rights minister, said growing anger over the case presents an opportunity to enact laws to end child marriage in the nation once and for all. It caused outrage -- and numerous calls to end child marriage in Yemen.
