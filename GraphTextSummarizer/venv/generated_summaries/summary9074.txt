After the allegations involving Secret Service agents in Colombia surfaced, Halsne again pressed his source, who this time assented to the use of his account in the KIRO report. The U.S. government official acknowledged there had been missteps among Secret Service members, while adding that such problems are to be expected given the agency's 147-year history. " "There are rumors flying about various incidents over several years about the conduct of Secret Service personnel, as well as other law enforcement and military personnel in locations around the world," the Iowa Republican said. Responding to the KIRO report, Secret Service spokesman Edwin Donovan said, "The recent investigation in Cartagena (Colombia) has generated several news stories that contain allegations by mostly unnamed sources. Fresh off a meeting with Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee told CNN's "OutFront" on Thursday that she's learned the agency -- besides setting up working groups focused on its culture and outreach efforts, including to women -- will institute several measures in light of the uproar.
