"French dressing is less spectacular than Ascot, it's less extroverted," Arc spokesman Julien Pescatore said. Founded in 1920, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe was named after the very monument built in honor of French allied forces during World War One. With almost  â‚¬8 million ($10.4 million) in prize money on offer over the weekend, the Qatar Racing and Equestrian Club-sponsored event attracts an elite clientele of royalty, world leaders and business heavyweights. "The hat is an essential element of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe," says Pescatore. Set on the picturesque Longchamp racecourse in Paris, "the Arc," as it is known, prides itself on being Europe's most prestigious -- and richest -- horse race.
