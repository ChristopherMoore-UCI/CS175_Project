ABC ran a two-hour, prime time Earth Day Special whose celebrity-studded cast included Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Robin Williams and many others. Melting ice caps and back-to-back horrific hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005 rekindled widespread concern over global warming -- in spite of the fact that there's no proven link between an individual storm like Katrina and climate change. If environmental concern was blunted in 1994, it was buried in the aftermath of September 11, 2001. Will financial chaos turn America and the world away from environmental concern yet again? But Obama also is confronting a global economic crisis, which may limit the time and the resources he can devote to environmental problems.
