Olympic Village, a huge housing complex of some 2,800 apartments within walking distance of the stadium in East London, has already been sold as part of the post-games legacy plans. Local campaigners have pushed for more of the apartments to be social housing as part of the organizer's pledge to regenerate the area post-games. "We are starting the huge process to install essential facilities and services ready to welcome competitors from around the world in six months' time," Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Organizing Committee said in a press release issued early Friday. Nearly 1,400 of the apartments were sold in 2009 for $400 million and will be rented by local governments for subsidized housing. The original plan was for the developer Lend Lease to raise the funding privately to build the village, but the work started in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.
