Despite being a six-time Olympic champion, it was Bolt's first gold at the Commonwealth Games and he celebrated by prolonged laps of honor of Hampden Park, signing autographs and posing for endless selfies. The track and field superstar took the baton on the anchor leg of the sprint relay for Jamaica a stride behind an inspired English quartet before surging clear in the home straight -- the winning time a Commonwealth Games record of 38.58 seconds. England's last leg runner Dan Talbot might have dreamed of gold but he could not match Bolt's giant stride and had to settle for a deserved silver ahead of Trinidad and Tobago. Away from the track and field action, England's Tom Daley dominated the men's 10m platform diving to retain his title in superb style. Like Bolt, she has been having a relatively low-key year ahead of preparing for the 2016 Olympics in Rio, but still showed a neat turn of foot to lead her team home in 41.83 seconds, also a Games record.
