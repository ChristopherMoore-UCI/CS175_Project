and then she was kicked, punched and Naira's head was smashed against a wall," Judge Maria Laura Durante told Telam, the Argentine state news agency. "She came the day after she was beaten up, we did a tomography and discovered a big hematoma on the left side of her brain, so we decided to operate," Dr. Carlos Garbe told Telam. " Officials say the teen was attacked last Wednesday at about 10 p.m., after leaving the night school she attended in the city of JunÃ­n, about 260 kilometers (161 miles) west of Buenos Aires. We have testimony that suggests the motive could've been another girl or because they (the victim and her friends) acted as if they were more beautiful than the rest and dressed better than them," Durante told Telam. Nobody can explain why this happened," Ribet told Telam.
