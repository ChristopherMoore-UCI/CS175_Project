While there, the Sydney Opera House will be the site of a special "Oprah Winfrey Show" taping before thousands of Australian fans. -- Oprah Winfrey opened her talk show's 25th and final season Monday with the surprise of a lifetime for her audience, a favorite tactic for the media maven. "I was beyond excited ... and as you all might expect, a little nervous," Winfrey said in her statement announcing the show's last season. The premiere week of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" will feature an appearance by country stars Naomi and Wynonna Judd; a return visit to Williamson, West Virginia, where Winfrey did an episode on HIV/AIDS in 1987, to talk with the guests of that show; a one-on-one with Bethany Storro, a victim of an acid attack caused by a stranger; and the announcement of Winfrey's latest book club selection, according to a press release. As of January 1, Winfrey will move on to her new OWN network, and as a result, she told TV Guide that she has different standards for her guests for the upcoming season.
