But a handful of North Carolina GOP legislators are vowing to defend a recently passed law that places their state's primary fifth-in-line, in late February 2016, right after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina raise the curtain on the Republican and Democratic nomination battles. "The North Carolina legislature needs to come to its senses on choosing a primary date," said South Carolina GOP Chairman Matt Moore. Besides the early burst of national attention, Rucho said one reason to hold the North Carolina primary in February, rather than its traditional slot in May, is that candidates will already be spending their money and time in South Carolina. That means North Carolina would hold its primary on a Tuesday in late February, just three days after South Carolina, if the law remains in place. North Carolina GOP Chairman Claude Pope Jr., who has a fraught relationship with Rucho, published an op-ed in The Charlotte Observer calling on the legislature to move the primary to March 1, where it would join seven other Southern states banding together for a multistate "SEC Primary" day.
