"Because of this reality, students have decided to file ... (the complaint) to hold the university accountable for its deliberate mishandling of campus sexual violence and mental health. The complaint alleges the Ivy League university discouraged students from reporting sexual assaults, allowed perpetrators to remain on campus, sanctioned inadequate disciplinary actions for perpetrators and discriminated against students based on their sexual orientation, according to a statement from the students who are calling themselves Our Stories CU. "We have been working with students, faculty and staff to make that emphatically clear on our campus and have already taken the first of a series of significant new measures dedicated to preventing such sexual misconduct, supporting survivors, and improving adjudication of these painful cases. A group of 23 students has filed a federal complaint against Columbia University alleging the school failed to protect victims of sexual assault, according to a statement from the students. "Sexual assault and gender misconduct are unacceptable, including on college and university campuses," Columbia said in a statement.
