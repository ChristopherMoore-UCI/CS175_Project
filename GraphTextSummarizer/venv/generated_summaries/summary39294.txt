"Man shoots texter" is not evidence of a larger societal trend unless it is well-researched and part of a much larger, systematically gathered set of data. The truth is, I fear, that although we receive news of this horrible incident as evidence of something, there's really nothing to learn from it -- or from other individual events that are supposed to prove a point -- for two reasons. To understand this story, we would need to know the specifics -- why this texter got shot this time -- because humans don't act for general reasons. You can see this in the comments of people reading online articles about it. Choosing to take something as evidence of what we already believe is the opposite of evidence.
