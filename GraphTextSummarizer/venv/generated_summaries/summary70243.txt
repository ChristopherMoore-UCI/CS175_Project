-- New York Jets running back Mike Goodson was arrested on drug and gun charges in New Jersey early Friday morning, New Jersey State Police said. Police found a loaded handgun, hollow-point ammunition, drug paraphernalia and a small amount of marijuana in the vehicle, said Lt. Stephen Jones, a state police spokesman. Goodson appeared to be intoxicated, Jones said, and was taken to St. Clare's Hospital in Boonton Township, where he was evaluated and treated. Jones said Goodson and Evans are being held on full-cash bail at the Morris County Jail. Evans, 31, was a convicted felon before Friday's arrest, Jones said.
