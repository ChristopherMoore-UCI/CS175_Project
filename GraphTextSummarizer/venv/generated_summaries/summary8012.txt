Read more: Norway killer Anders Breivik ruled sane, given 21-year prison term The plot first came to light with an investigation into Breivik's contacts abroad, the Polish prime minister's office said Tuesday. The primary suspect is a university lecturer with expertise in explosives who told police he wanted to bomb Parliament with the president, prime minister and other officials in attendance, according to Piotr Kosmaty, the spokesman for the appellate prosecutor's office in Krakow. During the arrest, police found guns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, body armor and materials that could be used to make a bomb, including fuses, detonators and other materials, according to Lt. Col. Maciej KarczyÅ„ski, a spokesman for the Internal Security Service. He had enough material to quickly assemble a 4-ton bomb, Kosmaty said. The investigation began with an analysis of the Internet shopping list of convicted Norwegian extremist Anders Breivik.
