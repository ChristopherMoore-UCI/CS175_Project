The accident occurred when a Union Pacific train T-boned a Burlington Northern Santa Fe train outside of Scott City, about 120 miles south of St. Louis, Scott County Sheriff Rick Walters said. The Union Pacific train was hauling auto parts from Illinois to Texas, said Calli Hite, a Union Pacific spokeswoman, told KFVS. His car went airborne and crashed, he told CNN affiliate KFVS. There were no cars on the overpass when it collapsed, but two cars drove into the collapsed structure in the dark, said Trooper Clark Parrott, spokesman for the Missouri State Highway Patrol. -- Seven people were injured when two freight trains collided early Saturday morning at a rail intersection in southeast Missouri, causing a highway overpass to collapse, authorities said.
