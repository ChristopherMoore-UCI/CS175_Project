One year later, Jones joined a number of state and private efforts to rebuild Liberia by setting up FACE Africa, a U.S.-based non-profit organization that's working to provide access to clean drinking water in Liberia's rural communities, where running water and sewage infrastructure is often a rare luxury. She says her long-term goal is to bring access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene to as many regions of Liberia as possible, as well as other post-conflict countries that face similar problems. Called "County by County," the plan is to provide water coverage to 60,000 people in the region by building 250 water points by 2017 and to ensure that the country meets its Millennium Development Goals target of 250 people per safe water point. Jones, who travels to Liberia every three months to oversee the group's projects, says that at least half of Liberia's 4 million population lack access to adequate drinking water. " In recent months, FACE Africa has embarked on a  major initiative that's aiming to solve the water crisis in River Cess, one of Liberia's most underserved areas, where only one fifth of its 80,000 population has access to adequate drinking water.
