There's no indication that they bet on their own games. "To date we have no evidence of point-shaving involved," Ricardo Adauto, the school's executive vice president of legal affairs, said in a Tuesday afternoon news conference. -- Three University of Texas at El Paso men's basketball players have been dismissed from the team for gambling on athletic events, the school announced Tuesday. "We evaluate every film after every ballgame, and I was not suspicious of any behavior that would have said that they were betting on any UTEP event," head coach Tim Floyd said. UTEP said it was notified in December that two men's basketball players had bet on sporting events. The school said that seniors McKenzie Moore, Justin Crosgile and Jalen Ragland were dismissed from the team after an FBI investigation.
