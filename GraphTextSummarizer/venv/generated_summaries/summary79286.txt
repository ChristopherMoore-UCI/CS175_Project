Read more about Jeremy 'Lin-demand' in China Lin, whose name in Mandarin is "Lin Shuhao," is the NBA's first U.S. player of Taiwan or Chinese descent. New York Knicks star Jeremy Lin issued the request in a post-game interview after starring in his team's dramatic 104-97 win over defending NBA champions, the Dallas Mavericks. The story of the Los Angeles-born star's rise from obscurity to sudden superstar has captivated Taiwan -- home to his grandmother and birthplace of Lin's parents -- and mainland China, which also claims to be his roots. (By contrast just last month before his first start as a Knick, Lin had posted on Facebook, "Everytime i (sic) try to get into Madison Square Garden, the security guards ask me if im a trainer LOL.") Sunday was a far different story: Lin was the Knicks' top scorer of the game with 28 points and a career-high 14 assists. His filing wasn't the first; two other Californian men -- whose names aren't Lin; one is Slayton -- beat him by days.
