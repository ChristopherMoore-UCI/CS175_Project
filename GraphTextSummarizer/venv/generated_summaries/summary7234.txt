With the film now available for home viewing and Oscar voters turning in their ballots, Gere opens up about what a nomination would mean to him; why things such as power, money and beauty don't really matter; and the best decision he's ever made about his hair. Many critics were certain a nomination would come for his memorable turn as Billy Flynn in the 2002 Best Picture Oscar winner, "Chicago." I know a lot of actors and directors who seem to get darker hair every year, and mine gets more paper white all the time. In the early '80s, back-to-back performances in "American Gigolo" and "An Officer and a Gentleman" raised temperatures worldwide and cemented Gere's status as a heartthrob and sex symbol. He does a lot of bad things, and I didn't want to sugarcoat that, but I don't know how you could sustain this story, if the guy was a capital "V" villain.
