The bags of alleged heroin were branded  "black list" and "red bull" -- not the same brands found in Hoffman's apartment, the sources said. But last year, Hoffman said he'd fallen off the wagon, started taking prescription pills and slipped into snorting heroin, according to TMZ. On Wednesday night, the famed Broadway theater district will dim its marquees for one minute at 7:45 p.m. in Hoffman's memory. But actor George Clooney said he had dinner with Hoffman a few months ago, and he seemed  fine. Also found in Hoffman's apartment was his personal journal, resting on a living room TV stand, two law enforcement sources said.
