Iran's supreme leader on Sunday blasted U.S. plans to overhaul the setup for a missile defense shield in Europe, calling the Obama administration's intentions "anti-Iranian," state-run media reported. Obama said the change of gears was based on an "updated intelligence assessment" about Iran's ability to hit Europe with missiles. The "new missile defense architecture in Europe" will be ready faster, work with existing technology and provide better missile defense than the program proposed by former President George W. Bush, Obama said. On Thursday, President Obama said the United States is significantly overhauling Bush-era plans for a missile defense shield in Europe, based partly on the latest analysis of Iran's offensive capabilities. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says the U.S. president is following "anti-Islamic and anti-Iranian" policies.
