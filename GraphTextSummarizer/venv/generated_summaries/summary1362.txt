'She could have been me': Action urged after gang rape case "We need overall more women in the police station as other women feel more comfortable with female officers," he said. The fatal attack of the 23-year-old woman last month in New Delhi prompted protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks. India's interior minister has ordered the city's police stations to increase the number of women officers to facilitate the handling of complaints from women. The trial will begin as soon as all of the evidence is gathered, said Suman Nalwa, deputy police commissioner of a unit for women and children. At present, women comprise 7% of police forces, he said.
