"I'm sorry, say again," said the controller, from New York Tracon, a radar facility on Long Island that handles flights after they depart from LaGuardia or Teterboro airports.. "We're gonna be in the Hudson," Sullenberger said, about three and a half minutes after the Airbus A320 took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport. The plane, headed from LaGuardia to Charlotte, North Carolina, ditched into the frigid Hudson River. A controller at New York Tracon responded to the pilot, saying "OK, yeah, you need to return to LaGuardia. The Tracon controller then asked the pilot if he wants to go to Teterboro airport in New Jersey.
