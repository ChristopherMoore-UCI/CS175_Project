Samuel knew only too well the vicious and brutal nature of the terrorist group: just a few months before this, Boko Haram had attacked his village in northeastern Nigeria. and he had relatives there but also because it had no history of Boko Haram attacks. Their entire village was razed to the ground and so Samuel moved his family to Chibok and enrolled his eldest daughter Sarah into the Government Secondary School so that she could sit for her final high school exam. "Then before sunset he called me again, and informed me that my daughter was part of those that were taken by Boko Haram." Samuel's blood went cold as his brother continued, telling him that some of the girls had been abducted by Boko Haram.
