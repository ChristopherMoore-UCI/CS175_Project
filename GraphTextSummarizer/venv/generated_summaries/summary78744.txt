Former Merrill Lynch chief executive John Thain told investigators two weeks ago that Lewis was aware Merrill employees would be awarded billions of dollars in bonuses before Bank of America's takeover of Merrill became effective January 1, according to sources familiar with the investigation. The New York Attorney General's office served an earlier subpoena on Bank of America during Lewis' testimony last week, seeking the full list of individual bonus recipients at Merrill Lynch, according to Benjamin M. Lawsky, a special assistant to Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. -- Seven former Merrill Lynch executives have been subpoenaed by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo over $3.6 billion in bonuses paid out just before the company was acquired by federally bailed-out Bank of America last year, a source close to the investigation told CNN. Bank of America CEO Kenneth Lewis spent four hours last Thursday testifying at the attorney general's office about the $3.6 billion in bonuses that Merrill Lynch paid out just before it was acquired by the bank last year. Bank of America has been allocated $45 billion in federal bailout funds, and the Treasury has guaranteed to protect Bank of America against potentially billions of dollars in losses from investments Merrill Lynch made in real estate loans.
