In 2011, she and three other New York Times journalists were kidnapped by pro-Qaddafi soldiers in Libya, and over several horrifying days were bound, punched and groped, before being released. In Addario's line of work, death -- and new life -- abound. That's not to say Addario has stepped away from the action since having a child with husband and former Reuters journalist Paul de Bendern; the family now based in London. This is a dangerous new era for war correspondents in the Middle East, says Addario, who went undercover documenting the lives of women under Taliban rule well before 9/11 even happened. Even as we speak, the death toll from fighting in Ukraine rises, and while other people might thank their lucky stars they're far from the crossfire, Addario feels "constantly tormented but what I'm not covering."
