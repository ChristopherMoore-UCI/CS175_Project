In 2000 Saadi's Al Ahly Tripoli traveled to Al Ahly Benghazi for a league match. The team has just drawn 0-0 with Zambia in their final qualification match for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, a qualification campaign that began with the country under the rule of Colonel Moammar Gadhafi, continued through the civil war and ended before the death of the former notorious leader. By the end of August Gadhafi had been toppled. Saadi Gadhafi turned up with his dogs and the police and said: 'If you don't play the second half, we will kick you'. When Interpol released a "Red Notice" for Saadi Gadhafi in September, the allegations given were "misappropriating properties through force and armed intimidation when he headed the Libyan Football Federation."
