Single mom Thandi Zulu says she was duped by a work-at-home scam. Scammers are busier than ever because tough economic times are making people more desperate to make money, says Christine Durst, CEO of Staffcentrix, a company specializing in home-based careers that sifts through home-based job leads every day. Tell us Durst says people are searching more for home-based jobs to save money on gas, clothing and child care. But work-at-home scammers are also plundering the paltry savings of ordinary people like Zulu every day. For example, many of the people who say they lost money in Madoff's alleged Ponzi scheme were celebrity actors, writers, wealthy people -- people with abundant smarts.
