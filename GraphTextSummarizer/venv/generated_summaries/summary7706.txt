-- Over the past few decades, there has been a shift toward more mountaintop removal coal mining in West Virginia. For many in West Virginia, it feels like a choice: steady jobs or a healthy environment. Miners and coal companies say mountaintop removal projects provide much-needed jobs. Mountaintop mining blasts apart mountains and deposits debris in nearby valleys to reach the rich coal seams buried inside. About 50% of U.S. power comes from burning coal, and about a third of West Virginia's coal is mined this way.
