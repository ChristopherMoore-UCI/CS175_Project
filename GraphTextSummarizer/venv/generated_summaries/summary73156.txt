A clerk's quick flip of a switch foiled a robbery Friday at an Office Depot store in downtown Chicago. He ended up robbing a nearby Fannie May candy store at gunpoint, police said, and fled that store in a white taxi. Police said a man wearing a light blue button-down shirt and dark slacks entered the store carrying a gun concealed in a folded newspaper. He approached one of the store's cash registers and demanded the contents of the safe, police said. The clerk refused but immediately turned on the public address system so that other customers could hear what was going on.
