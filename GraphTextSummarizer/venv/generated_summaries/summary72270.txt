I also knew he was disappointed that his other nominee, [Justice] David Souter had evolved into a different kind of judge than he had expected," Bush writes, referring to his father, former President George H.W. Bush. Then-President Bush and others assumed Chief Justice William Rehnquist -- suffering from thyroid cancer -- would step down, but Bush reveals in his book that Miers, then the White House counsel, had called him the morning of July 1 with a surprise. Republican insiders were always seeking to identify bright, young, up-and-coming lawyers to hopefully one day transform the courts.. One such person was John Roberts, who had served in the Reagan and senior Bush administrations. He was a well-paid Washington appellate attorney when he played a low-key but crucial role defending the younger Bush in court during the 2000 Florida ballot recount. Despite the still puzzling Miers misstep, Bush clearly believes he hit home runs with Roberts and Alito.
