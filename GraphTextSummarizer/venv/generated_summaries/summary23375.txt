The kits include a podcast and video, a slide cast and a printable guide with information on street names for drugs, what kinds of medical problems they can cause, and tips on how to tell whether their children might be using synthetic marijuana or stimulants. "In 2010 our centers responded to 3,200 calls about synthetic drugs," said Deborah Carr, executive director of the American Association of Poison Control Centers. Among those participating were officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Department of Health and Human Services; the State Department and the Defense Department. Pasierb and Gil Kerlikowske, director of National Drug Control Policy, met with officials from government and anti-drug groups to discuss how to combat the synthetic drug problem. The Partnership at Drugfree.org on Thursday unveiled tools available online to help adults understand synthetic drugs and urged them to talk to kids about their dangers.
