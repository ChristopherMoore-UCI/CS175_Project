McCain: Stopping child immigrant nightmare must include returning children, securing border "All we need to do is change the act, the Trafficking Victims Prevention Act, to treat these children the same way as we do with Canada and especially Mexico," he said on CNN's "State of the Union," noting that children crossing borders from America's two neighbors can be immediately turned away. Fast deportations "We should do targeted appropriations where it's needed to make sure that we are able to detain people and send them back to their countries," Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on ABC's "This Week." His colleague, Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, is a member of a group appointed by House Speaker John Boehner to come up with border crisis solutions. Of the $3.7 billion request, $433 million would be for Customs and Border Protection, the agency in charge of border security. While they support the allocation of some money, numerous Republicans said Sunday that any money should be "targeted" to quickly deport the youths and to beef up border security. The two sides are also sharply at odds over the issue of border security.
