In the first "Magic Mike," 33-year-old Tatum starred as the titular Mike, a construction worker and aspiring furniture designer by day and magical male stripper by night. And instead of simply calling the sequel "Magic Mike 2," Tatum and his team have conjured up a more memorable title: "Magic Mike XXL." "Magic Mike XXL" will follow a very busy few years for Tatum. According to Tatum, "Magic Mike XXL" will shift the action from Florida nightclubs to the road. "This one will be a road trip movie," he told MTV on Sunday, when he was honored with the network's Trailblazer Award at the 2014 MTV Movie Awards.
