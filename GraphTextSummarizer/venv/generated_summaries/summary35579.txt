Libin describes the alphabetical organization of most contact lists as outdated, a remnant from when people's names and numbers were printed on linear pages. Part of the inspiration for Evernote Hello came from Libin's own inability to remember people by name, he said. -- Meet Evernote CEO Phil Libin, who runs a software company based here in Silicon Valley that has been on a hot streak. Another tech blog, ReadWriteWeb, called it "an app only Sheldon Cooper would love," a reference to the fictional nerd from the CBS show "The Big Bang Theory." Libin, who does bear some resemblance to the TV character played by actor Jim Parsons, said Evernote is making changes in response to user feedback. For example, the app should allow users to snap a picture of a business card using the iPhone's camera and automatically input the information from it -- like LinkedIn's CardMunch, Libin said.
