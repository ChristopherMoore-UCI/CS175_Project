As defined by political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, who curated the definitive list of "Things Losing Candidates Say" for Roll Call last year, the luckless phrase is a pretty good indicator that "you are losing the race at the time and have no empirical evidence to the contrary." The Louisiana Senator — an 18-year Washington veteran and outgoing chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, blessed with one of the most recognizable last names in southern politics —  stepped away from a modest crowd of supporters at a campaign event here for an interview about her difficult runoff race against Republican Bill Cassidy. Republicans have clobbered Landrieu with television ads tying her to President Barack Obama, whose approval rating in Louisiana, according to midterm exit polls, is 39 percent. Maybe she meant to, maybe she didn't, but Mary Landrieu reached straight for the encyclopedia of Things Losing Candidates Say. "The Republicans and her opponent Bill Cassidy have done a very effective job at creating an emotional target for voters to direct their frustration towards, and that would be President Obama," said New Orleans-based Democratic pollster Silas Lee.
