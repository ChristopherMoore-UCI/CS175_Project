"Of all of the thousands of cases involving missing children, the parents have always yearned for media attention." Over the years, Holloway has worked with numerous families and support groups for parents with missing children. Few know the fleeting moments of hope -- and anguish -- associated with the search for a missing child like Dave Holloway, the father of Natalee Holloway, the Alabama teen who went missing on a trip to Aruba in 2005. Though the apparent age difference makes this a stretch -- Baby Lisa, though not a baby anymore, would only be about 3 now, and Maria is estimated to be about 5 or 6 -- the mystery of the girl's identity seems to have provided a tantalizing bit of hope to the Irwin family, and to other families who hold vigil for their missing children. For the families of missing children, there is always a hope, no matter how small.
