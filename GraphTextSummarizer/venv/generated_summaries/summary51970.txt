Nadal, currently second in the world rankings, and Lopez, ranked 34th for doubles, won the event together in 2010 when they defeated Croat Nenad Zimonjic and Canada's Daniel Nestor in the final. The 10-time grand slam winner has not played since losing to Novak Djokovic in a marathon Australian Open final in January, but Nadal will pair up with fellow Spaniard Marc Lopez on Friday. "My reason for playing doubles is that I didn't play for a month," Nadal told a press conference ahead of his and Lopez's match against Zimonjic and France's Michael Llodra. " Nadal's clash with Djokovic at Melbourne Park was the longest final in grand slam history, and he also suffered defeat to the Serb in the singles final at Indian Wells in 2011. "I think doubles is a good way to practice for everybody, where you can practice different movements, different shots.
