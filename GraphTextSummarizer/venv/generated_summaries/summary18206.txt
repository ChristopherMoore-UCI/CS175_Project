-- As U.S. President George W. Bush wrapped up his tour of the Middle East, some of the region's biggest investors were doing business in the U.S. U.S. President George W. Bush during a lighter moment on his Middle Eastern tour with Saudi Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal topped up his holding in U.S. banking giant Citigroup, as part of a $12.5 billion cash injection from a group of backers, including the Kuwait Investment Authority. The same day, the Kuwait Investment Authority also participated in a $6.6 billion boost for U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch. For example, while the prospect of a recession in the U.S. has sent other investors running for cover, they've been willing and able to pump vast sums of money into the U.S. banking sector. And of course, as the value of their assets grows, SWFs too will have more money at their disposal. Some countries are worried that SWFs will give other governments undue influence over important local companies.
