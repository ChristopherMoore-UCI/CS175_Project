-- The White House Press Office accidentally e-mailed a draft version of President Obama's Thursday schedule on Wednesday night that included the back-and-forth between White House staffers. The first section of the schedule noted that in the morning, Obama planned to talk with homeowners who have refinanced their homes and benefited from lower mortgage payments. The final version took the emphasis off the economic team and said "Attending the meeting will be a handful of homeowners ... as well as members of President Obama's economic team." In another exchange, one staffer recommended nixing a line about Obama meeting with leaders from the Veterans Service Organizations and Military Service Organizations since the president was now meeting with them before his remarks in an event closed to the media. Members of the media got a behind-the-scenes look at what goes into President Obama's schedule.
