Lauri Stevens, a social media consultant for police departments, thought Hillsboro did the right thing. "We wanted something that expressed our culture of openness," said Hillsboro, Oregon, Lt. Michael Rouches, the department's public information officer. -- A viral video has real officers going for laughs with the serious intent of finding their next police chief. So we thought, 'how could we demonstrate that message to a potential chief of police?'" The answer came in the form of a scripted video that's part "Law and Order," part "Parks and Recreation." And for anyone who may be interested, the salary for the Hillsboro police chief ranges between $101,916 and $137,880.
