"The ground is so wet from all the snow we've had this winter, it's helping the trees to topple over, as well as our utility poles," said Long Island Power Authority president and CEO Kevin Law. Flood warnings remained in effect in parts of the Eastern Seaboard into Sunday night, including much of New England. Con Edison reported more than 100,000 customers without power in New York City and Westchester County on Sunday, while the Long Island Power Authority said that 150,000 of its customers were without electricity. But tens of thousands of other homes in New Jersey and Connecticut were still without power on Sunday. New York-area airports reported delays of at least two hours on Sunday, while Boston's Logan International Airport averaged 40 minute delays.
