White House officials are scratching their heads over the decision by Republicans to sue President Barack Obama over his decision to delay a requirement in the health care law for businesses to provide coverage to employees. Obama defiantly challenged Republicans last week, saying he would continue to take steps he felt were necessary with or without the support of congressional Republicans. Boehner consulted legal experts before announcing the action and CNN's Dana Bash and Deirdre Walsh reported that they were advised that keeping the focus of any legal challenge narrow offered the best chance to succeed in court. No president should have the power to make laws on his or her own," Boehner said. In order for it to be formally considered by the courts, House Republicans must prove that the chamber was somehow injured as an institution.
