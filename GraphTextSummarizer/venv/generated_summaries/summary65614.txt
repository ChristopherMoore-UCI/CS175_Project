Three companies -- Happy Apple Company of Washington, Missouri; California Snack Foods, of El Monte, California; and Merb's Candies of St. Louis, Missouri -- have issued voluntary recalls of their caramel apples. On December 22, Bidart Bros. recalled Granny Smith apples it sold in 2014 to caramel apple companies. On January 6, Bidart Bros. expanded its voluntary recall to include Gala apples shipped from the company's Shafter, California, packing facility in 2014. At least seven people have died after eating caramel apples that may have been infected with Listeria monocytogenes. In the meantime, the CDC is warning consumers who may have bought caramel apples with toppings like nuts, chocolate or sprinkles not to eat them, at least not until investigators figure out the source of the contamination.
