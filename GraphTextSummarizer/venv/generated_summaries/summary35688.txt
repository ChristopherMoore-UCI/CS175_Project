Tomblin became West Virginia's chief executive in November, when Gov. Joe Manchin resigned to fill the unexpired term of U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd. The remembrance ceremony will take place Tuesday in Whitesville, which is located 30 miles south of Charleston. The April 5, 2010, explosion was the worst mining disaster in the United States since 1972, when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho. Acting West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin will join the families of the 29 men who perished in an explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine a year ago Tuesday. The technique uses a large grinder to extract coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas, both of which are explosive.
