It is the kind of dilemma planetary scientists dream of, but you can only go one place for the first drilling for a rock sample on Mars," said project scientist John Grotzinger. India to launch Mars orbiter in 2013 ChemCam, short for Chemistry and Camera, will analyze the resulting glowing, ionized gas in an effort to identify chemical elements in the rock. "That first drilling will be a huge moment in the history of Mars exploration." "We are going to hit it with 14 millijoules of energy 30 times in 10 seconds," Roger Wiens of Los Alamos National Laboratory told reporters. The mobile science lab touched down on Mars early on August 6 and has been beaming back images of the surface of Gale Crater ever since.
