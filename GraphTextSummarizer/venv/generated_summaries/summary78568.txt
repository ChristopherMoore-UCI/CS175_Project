From the moment of infection, the immune system goes on alert and immediately generates antibodies designed to attach to and destroy HIV. TIME.com: HIV drugs may prevent infection in healthy individuals Ultimately, he adds, a vaccine will probably need to generate several of these broadly neutralizing antibodies; each person tends to make unique versions that have differing efficacy in stopping HIV. But in a fortunate 20%, this arms race is stacked in the host's favor, with antibodies that are able to neutralize not just the latest, specific mutated version of HIV but a broader range of viral marauders. Researchers report a breakthrough in generating powerful antibodies that can neutralize HIV. "We have a map on how to recreate the sequential (versions of HIV) that could drive particular antibody lineages."
