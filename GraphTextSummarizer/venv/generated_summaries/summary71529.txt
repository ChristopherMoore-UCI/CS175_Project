Her father, she said matter of factly, was abused three times by Murphy while a student at St. John's School for the Deaf in St. Francis, a suburb of Milwaukee nestled on the banks of Lake Michigan. "Mistakes were made in the Lawrence Murphy case," said Archbishop Jerome Listecki at the end of a special Holy Week mass at St. John's Cathedral in Milwaukee. It was time to tell their secret and put an end to the sexual abuse against deaf boys by Murphy, Budzinski said. The New York Times reported the documents showed top Vatican officials, including the future Pope Benedict XVI, had failed to discipline the now-deceased Milwaukee priest, the Rev. Lawrence Murphy. According to the report, Murphy abused as many as 200 deaf boys in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from 1950 to 1974.
