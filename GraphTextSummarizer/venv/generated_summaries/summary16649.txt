McMahon said police have learned Aguilar began using the Internet last year to search for information about mass shootings in malls and schools, gun laws and explosive techniques. The doctor told police Aguilar said those voices were non-violent and didn't direct him to do anything, authorities said. He was there with a friend, but police said the friend had no suspicions and no knowledge of Aguilar's future plans. What was made clear from the latest release of information about the case was that police believe Aguilar had studied the Columbine shooting and seemed to be trying to mimic what occurred there. The shooter, 19-year-old Darion Marcus Aguilar, uploaded the picture of himself dressed in cargo pants and boots to the social networking web site Tumblr before the incident, police said Wednesday.
