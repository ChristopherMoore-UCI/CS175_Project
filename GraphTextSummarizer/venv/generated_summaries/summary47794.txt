No one could have predicted accurately the course of the war then, but Petraeus stuck to his playbook, eventually becoming the top U.S. commander in Iraq, leading U.S. counterinsurgency operations and, in 2007, a strategy to overcome a bloody insurgency that was fronted by a surge in troops. Applauded for turning around what seemed a losing battle in Iraq -- he was dubbed King David for his successes -- Petraeus later went to Afghanistan, commanding U.S. and NATO forces there. Petraeus relinquishes his Afghanistan post on Monday. This week, ahead of his departure, Petraeus assessed the results of his strategy in Afghanistan. Petraeus told NATO-TV that he never thought his military career would end in Afghanistan.
