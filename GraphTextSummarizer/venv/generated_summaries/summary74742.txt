"It's a matter for government, it's a matter for business, it's a matter for civil society," Kent told CNN's Richard Quest recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. -- Global unemployment is rising, with youth feeling the brunt, and companies need to find solutions to set jobseekers on "a clearer path to success," according to Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent. "We have to not go into a corner and wait for the storm to pass," said Kent, who stressed that companies must continue to invest in their businesses. In 2012, developing economies in East Asia, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa contributed the bulk of the year's 4 million newly unemployed, according to the Global Employment Trends 2013 report. Despite the 2008 global financial crisis, the eurozone's sovereign debt challenges and China's slower-growing economy, Kent says investment can still be justified and points to Coca-Cola's own recent practices.
