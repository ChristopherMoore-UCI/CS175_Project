The Index evaluates countries in four broad areas of economic freedom: rule of law, regulatory efficiency, limited government and open markets. "Even top-ranked Hong Kong saw its score decline due to increased government spending and higher inflation. "In the post-Arab Spring Middle East, some democratically elected governments are adopting totalitarian practices reminiscent of revolutionary Iran or the Taliban," Terry Miller, a director at the Heritage Foundation, wrote in the Wall Street Journal. "Economic freedom can't flourish under the arbitrary rule of authoritarians and despots, and it has declined significantly in Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Saudi Arabia, among other countries." "The global advance toward economic freedom has ground to a halt," the index editors said in a new release.
