"The agreement called for Mr. Jackson to plead no contest to a single count of misdemeanor vandalism, which deals with the door of the apartment that was damaged and owned by the landlord," attorney Scott Leemon said. WIth the conviction, Jackson must perform 30 days of community service, attend a year of domestic violence counseling, pay $7,100 restitution for damaged property and comply with a stay-away protective order from Joy, the city attorney said. A plea agreement with the Los Angeles city attorney allows Jackson to avoid jail while serving 36 months of unsupervised probation, according to a statement from the city attorney. Jackson, 37, was accused of one count of domestic violence and four counts of vandalism for allegedly ransacking the bedroom during an argument at Daphne Joy's Los Angeles condo last June. "During an argument, Jackson allegedly began destroying the female's property," the city prosecutor's office said in a written statement in July.
