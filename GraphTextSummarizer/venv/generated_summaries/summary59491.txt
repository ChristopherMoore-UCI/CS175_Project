In "The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose from Defeat to Create the New Majority," author and longtime Nixon aide Patrick Buchanan retells the debate and intrigue around Nixon deciding to take a six-month hiatus from presidential politics ahead of the 1968 election. Buchanan, who ran for president three times, said he does see some of Nixon's strategy in Clinton. There was strong competition -- notably from then Michigan Gov. George Romney -- but none had the support Nixon had. As Clinton eyes another run at the presidency in 2016, some close to her -- especially those who are cheering reports she may wait until summer to officially announce a bid -- point to Nixon's successful 1968 presidential bid as a positive sign, particularly how Nixon's public operation went dark for about six months before entering the race. Few White House hopefuls would ever want to be compared to former President Richard Nixon, but some of Hillary Clinton's pre-campaign moves -- or lack thereof -- are reminiscent of the 37th president.
