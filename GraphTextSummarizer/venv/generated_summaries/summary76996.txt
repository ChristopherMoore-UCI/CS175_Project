"We know that children love wearing their Patriots jerseys, but may not understand why parents don't want them wearing their Hernandez jerseys anymore," New England Patriots spokesman Stacey James said in a statement. The exchange program applies only for Hernandez jerseys purchased from the Patriots' ProShop and PatriotsProShop.com. He is allowed outside of his cell for three hours a day, but has no access to television, the Internet or a weight room, Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson said. While the Patriots try to scrub Hernandez's jerseys from the public eye, the same shirts are fetching big bucks on eBay. A week after the former tight end was charged with murder, the Patriots are encouraging parents to swap any No. 81 jersey for that of any other team player.
