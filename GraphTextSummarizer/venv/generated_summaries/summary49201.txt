Brewer and other Arizona officials have said the law is necessary to make up for federal government failures in enforcing immigration laws. Some parts of the Arizona law took effect in July, including a ban on "sanctuary cities": municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. "If every state did this, we would have a patchwork of laws" on immigration, Justice Department lawyer Edwin Kneedler said. As other states pass similar laws, the issue is "very much destined for the Supreme Court," CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said in July. Republican lawmakers, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and other state governments are among those filing briefs with the appeals court supporting Arizona's argument.
