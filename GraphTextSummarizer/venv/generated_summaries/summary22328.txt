"We have a lot of support from sponsors, from different international and multinational companies that see it as an opportunity to offer their brands and their experiences as well and it makes it way more profitable," said owner of The Garden, Ismael Kassem. " The Garden is booked out every night and Kassem and his partners are bullish about the future. According to Alchemy owner and industry veteran, Alex Rizk, the conditions always existed for smartly run bars and restaurants to prosper. But this is Egypt, where political and economic chaos persist and neither Kassem nor Rizk take that for granted. Both Kassem and Rizk hope it will pay out in dividends.
