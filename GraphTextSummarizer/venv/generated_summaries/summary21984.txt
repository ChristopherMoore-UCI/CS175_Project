Second, physicians should monitor patients with cancer-associated HPV to prevent heart attack and stroke, as well as HPV patients already diagnosed with CVD to avoid future cardiovascular events." Males should get HPV vaccine too The HPV votes took place as part of the advisory committee's meeting in Atlanta. "Not every person who has HPV is going to get cancer, it may be that only those kinds that have a link to cancer will have a link to cardiovascular disease," said Ricotta, who also called for further studies before reaching "hard and fast" conclusions. In addition, the committee voted to recommend that men who have sex with men up to age 26 be vaccinated against HPV because that would protect them from cancers of the penis and rectum. The HPV vaccine is already recommended for females between the ages of 9 and 26 to reduce the risk of cervical cancer.
