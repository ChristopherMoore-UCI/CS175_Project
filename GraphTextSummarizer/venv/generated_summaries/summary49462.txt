Credit the strong leadership of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid with keeping a remarkably diverse Democratic Congress together. Senate Republicans split badly and bitterly; 25 voted against Cruz while just 19 voted with him. Savaging your colleagues, undermining your leaders, backbiting and backstabbing -- these are usually Democratic specialties. What's worse for the Republicans, when the question shifts to whether you support shutting down the government and/or defaulting on U.S. debt in order to kill Obamacare, the GOP position loses by a crushing 59 to 19 percentage points. That is, no doubt, why the House Republicans have retreated to their new position: delaying Obamacare for a year rather than outright defunding it.
