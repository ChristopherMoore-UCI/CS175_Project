"I didn't want to go to Augusta next year having not won this," McIlroy told CNN after Sunday's victory in near darkness after a weather delay. The victory -- the second time McIlroy has captured the Wanamaker Trophy -- means he has now won three straight tournaments, having also triumphed at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational last week. "I wanted to go to Augusta with four major championships, and I want to go to Augusta next year trying to win five and trying to win the career grand slam. "Going to Augusta next year, trying to complete the career grand slam for a start, and then trying to complete the third leg (winning three straight majors) -- I'm going to go to Augusta next year with a lot of expectation and a lot of hype, and one thing that I need to do is try to handle those," he said. After a disappointing 2013, and then the breakup of his long-term relationship with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, McIlroy is now firmly focused on achieving his golfing goals.
