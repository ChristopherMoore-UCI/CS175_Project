"Illegal immigration places an incredible burden on Georgia taxpayers." As they have throughout the debate, leaders in the local Latino community railed against the measure. The measure, which Gov. Nathan Deal inked about a month after it cleared the Republican-dominated Georgia Legislature, allows law enforcement officers to ask about immigration status when questioning suspects in certain criminal investigations. Among other things, that legislation would have required local law enforcement officers in Arizona to apprehend and help deport illegal immigrants. Nonetheless, anti-illegal immigrant bills can still be found from coast to coast. The National Conference of State Legislatures found that, in 2010 alone, more than 1,400 bills were introduced aiming to give individual states more of a role in immigration enforcement.
