Better still, the pilot will have the same creative team behind it as "TWD," including executive producers Robert Kirkman, Gale Anne Hurd and David Alpert. "Obviously, we all take our stewardship of the original franchise incredibly seriously," he told EW, "and we ... are all proceeding with extreme care in order to ensure that we are offering fans something truly compelling, engaging and distinct." Kirkman, who crafted the pilot script with "Sons of Anarchy's" Dave Erickson,  told EW that there are still "many corners of 'The Walking Dead' universe that remain unseen in the shadows," and he is excited to shed some light on them with a different project. Though details about the companion series are scarce, AMC President Charlie Collier assured fans that everyone is trying to keep the bar high. "The Walking Dead" consistently performs for the network, reaching a peak of 16.1 million viewers with its season four premiere in October 2013.
