The well-publicized case involves Sakineh Mohammedie Ashtiani, who faces the possibility of execution by stoning after being convicted in 2006 of adultery. "Although the verdict still stands and is definite, the execution has been halted on humanitarian grounds from the order of the honorable judiciary chief, and will not be implemented at this time," Malek Ajdar Sharifi, a judiciary official in East Azerbaijan province, told Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency. -- Iran's judiciary chief has temporarily halted the execution of a woman convicted of adultery, state media reported Sunday, citing a judicial official. Ajdar Sharifi told IRNA Sunday that Ashtiani's crimes were "numerous" but added "because of morality and ethics, I cannot go into the details of the crimes, but if the public knew, they would understand the criminal nature of them." But in response to that statement, Drewery Dyke of Amnesty International in London said Ashtiani still faced the possibility of execution.
