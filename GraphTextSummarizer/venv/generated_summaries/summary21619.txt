There was more drama in Hungary when Mercedes asked Hamilton to allow Rosberg, who was on a different tire strategy, to pass. Rosberg may not be Machiavellian but one thing is for sure, Hamilton has had his share of bad luck in 2014. But if Rosberg takes a 15-point advantage to the desert finale he can afford to finish second to Hamilton and still win the title. Hamilton knows this is his best chance of winning a second world title since his triumph with McLaren in 2008. Rosberg complained over the team radio when Hamilton cut across him to retake the lead, saying the move was "not on."
