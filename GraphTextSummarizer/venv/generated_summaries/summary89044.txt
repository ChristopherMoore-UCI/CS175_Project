"In an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers," lawyers Randall M. Kessler and Joe S. Habachy said in a statement. "Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit," Bobby Brown said last month in a statement through his lawyers. Nick Gordon, Bobbi Kristina Brown's boyfriend, says he hates her father, singer Bobby Brown. In a Facebook post on Friday, Bobbi Kristina's aunt Leolah Brown wrote an open letter to Dr. Phil, claiming that Gordon is being investigated by the police regarding what happened to her niece. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart." Gordon began living with Houston and her daughter after the superstar singer took him in when he was a teen.
