Sergewa told CNN's Sara Sidner that she began collecting the reports after receiving a call from the mother of a patient in Ajdabiya, a town in eastern Libya that was the scene of some of the earliest fighting between rebels and government forces. In other NATO efforts against Gadhafi forces Monday, an airstrike hit a Libyan army position outside the rebel town of Jadu in the western mountains, rebels in Zintan told CNN. Since then, Sergewa told CNN she has collected surveys from more than 270 women at refugee camps along Libya's borders with Egypt and Tunisia who allege they were assaulted by Gadhafi forces. Food and fuel are shipped into Libya and wounded rebels are taken out for medical treatment via the crossing, which is literally a lifeline to the rebels, the rebel commander said. Gadhafi's forces "still represent a threat to civilians and we will continue to strike targets that carry out this violence," said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard of Canada, who commands the Libya operation.
