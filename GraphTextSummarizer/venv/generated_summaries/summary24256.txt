According to a senior U.N. official, the militant Islamist group Boko Haram -- which has instigated much of the anti-Christian violence in Nigeria -- already has a presence in the Central African Republic, where the lack of government authority, porous borders and a ready supply of weapons provide the perfect incubator for such groups. The militia attacked mosques, daubing walls with the slogan "Tuer les musulmans" (Kill the Muslims) in what Amnesty International describes as "a shocking escalation of anti-Muslim rhetoric within the Christian community." Boko Haram has already shown it can operate beyond Nigeria, kidnapping a French priest in northern Cameroon last month. Intelligence sources told CNN this year that Boko Haram had trained with jihadist groups in remote areas of northern Mali before the French military intervention there, an assertion French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius recently repeated. According to a U.S. diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks, Cameroon President Paul Biya told the U.S. ambassador in 2010 that he "was concerned about the threat of Islamic extremism (and) beginning to worry about Islamic extremists infiltrating Cameroon from Nigeria and making inroads through Cameroonian mosques." Last week, Boko Haram demonstrated its resilience in the face of a crackdown by Nigerian security forces with a mass attack on an air force base in the northern city of Maiduguri.
