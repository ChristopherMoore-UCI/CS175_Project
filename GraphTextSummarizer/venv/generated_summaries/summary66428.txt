" "From her history of profiteering at the expense of Texas taxpayers while in the Legislature to using campaign funds to promote a book that enriches her personally, Sen. Davis has demonstrated blatant disregard for ethical standards Texans expect from their candidates," Hirsch said, according to the Chronicle. The Republican campaign battling Democrat Wendy Davis for the Texas governorship filed a complaint on Thursday accusing Davis of violating state election law. But Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas fired back, asserting that the campaign funded the trip so Davis could attend a "campaign event" in New York and did nothing illegal. The Greg Abbott campaign's complaint comes just a day after Davis returned from a campaign-funded trip to New York, where she promoted her recently released book and attended a campaign fundraising event, the Houston Chronicle reported. Davis appeared on CNN, MSNBC and ABC this week from New York.
