Matthew McConaughey, who played Dallas in 2012's male stripper movie "Magic Mike," isn't returning for the upcoming "Magic Mike XXL," director Gregory Jacobs confirmed in an interview with IndieWire. On "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" last week, Tatum said he originally wanted "Guardians of the Galaxy" star Chris Pratt to appear in the first film, but scheduling conflicts got in the way. According to Jacobs, the absence of McConaughey's Dallas is just one way that "XXL" will be unique from the first film. "Magic Mike XXL" is set to release July 1, 2015. While fans may have their own casting wish lists, so does actor Tatum.
