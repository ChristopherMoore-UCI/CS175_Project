Looking beyond that, Ancelotti will be seeking harmony in the squad as Real prepare for the second leg of their Copa Del Rey last-16-tie against city rivals Atletico on Thursday. " The result means Real move four points clear at the top of the La Liga table, although that lead will be reduced by either second-placed Barcelona or third-placed Atletico Madrid which face off against one another in the Catalan capital tomorrow evening. Atletico triumphed 2-0 in the first leg at the Vicente Calderon last week and Real haven't beaten them in three attempts this season. The European champions suffered back-to-back defeats against Valencia and city rivals Atletico Madrid in the space of four days last week, bringing a club-record 22-match winning streak that began all the way back in September to an unceremonious end. Yet  after the game, Real boss Carlo Ancelotti was quick to defend Bale when speaking to reporters.
