Lin said retired Rocket Yao Ming, a Chinese basketball star, sent him a text message of congratulations after his return to Houston was announced. Lin was waived by the Golden State Warriors on December 9 and was picked up by Houston on December 12. "We made an error by letting him go, and I think we rectified it now," Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander told reporters Thursday. -- For the God-fearing, Harvard-educated NBA star Jeremy Lin, it's deja vu all over again except for two things: This time he's entering Houston's Toyota Center with an fat paycheck in his pocket and inflated expectations in the stands. "I still have to kind of remind myself that this is actually happening sometimes," Lin told reporters in Houston, where he was making his redux debut as a Rocket on Thursday before a phalanx of reporters and cameras after the New York Knicks failed to match Houston's three-year, $25 million offer for the point guard.
