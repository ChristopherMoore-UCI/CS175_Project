The assembly declared Nepal a republic in May and in July elected Nepal's first president, physician Ram Baran Yadav. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, was elected four months after elections in which his Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) became the largest party in the 601-member constituent assembly. -- The leader of Nepal's former communist rebels was named as the country's new prime minister Friday. The Maoists signed a peace deal with the government in November 2006, joined an interim parliament and government in 2007 and fought multi-party elections in April this year. Prachanda's victory became certain on Thursday when the third and fourth biggest parties in Nepal's assembly decided to back him.
