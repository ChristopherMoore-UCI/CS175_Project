Medical student Philip Markoff, 23, appears in court Tuesday in Boston, Massachusetts. " Markoff, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing 26-year-old Julissa Brisman of New York on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. A Boston University spokeswoman said the school suspended Markoff, who has no criminal record, when it learned of the charges on Monday. She accused Boston police of "trying to make big bucks by selling this false story to the TV stations. Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was killed showed a tall, clean-cut young blond man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, according to Boston police, who had sought public assistance in identifying the man.
