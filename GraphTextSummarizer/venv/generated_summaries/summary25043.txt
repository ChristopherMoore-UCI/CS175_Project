-- Two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks played a role in the surprise ending of a domestic assault case in Los Angeles, according to defense attorney Andrew Flier. But after interviewing Hanks in jury selection, Flier decided he was a good fit for the final slot on the jury. If the case hadn't ended in a plea, Flier said he doesn't know how Hanks would have voted. Instead, as proceedings wrapped Tuesday, the prosecuting attorney revealed that another lawyer in the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office had interacted with Hanks outside the courtroom, thanking him for his service. As a result, Flier asked the court for a mistrial, citing prosecutorial misconduct.
