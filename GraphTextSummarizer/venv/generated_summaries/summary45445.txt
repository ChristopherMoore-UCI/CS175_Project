"I've come to the conclusion that criminal charges are not appropriate in this case, and I am releasing all of the information related to this investigation so that you, the public, can see all the facts related to this decision," Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm told reporters Monday. " Chisholm anticipated that some might be upset with his decision and, in fact, protesters took to the streets Monday night. Charges were also not filed in the death of Eric Garner, a black man, who died in Staten Island, New York, after an officer put him in a chokehold. He was armed with the officer's baton at the time that he was shot," said Lt. Mark Stanmeyer of the Milwaukee Police Department. The officer, Christopher Manney, killed Dontre Hamilton during a confrontation in April.
