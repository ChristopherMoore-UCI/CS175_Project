"These year-end totals indicate that we are making progress, with more convicted criminals, recent border crossers, egregious immigration law violators and immigration fugitives being removed from the country than ever before. Overall in fiscal year 2011, immigration officials said, 396,906 individuals were removed. "Smart and effective immigration enforcement relies on setting priorities for removal and executing on those priorities," said agency Director John Morton. The government said 90% of the agency's removals fell into a priority category and more than two-thirds of the other removals in 2011 were either recent border crossers or repeat immigration violators. Napolitano said the approach is a common-sense way to tackle immigration problems with limited resources.
