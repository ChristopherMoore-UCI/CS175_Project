The U.S. military is promising action to address conditions in a barracks at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, after a soldier's father posted images on YouTube showing a building that he said "should be condemned." A soldier battles overflowing sewage in the Fort Bragg barracks shortly after coming home from Afghanistan. Watch the run-down conditions that soldiers have been living in Â» At times, "sewage water backs up into the sinks in the lower floors of these barracks," Frawley said in his narration. Cody said he would not want his own sons or any troops to return to such conditions, Frawley said. "The soldiers have to tell one another who's taking a shower when they turn the sinks on, or the person taking the shower gets scalded with hot water." Frawley said the Army promised to have new barracks ready when his son's unit, part of the 82nd Airborne Division, returned. In one, a soldier stands in a sink to avoid what Frawley describes as 3 inches of sewage water that filled the floor when toilets overflowed.
