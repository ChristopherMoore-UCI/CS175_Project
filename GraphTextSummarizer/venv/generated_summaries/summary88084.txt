Hillary Clinton on Tuesday weaved together the national outcry over a recent report detailing U.S. torture abroad and the nationwide protests against recent police killings of unarmed black men. Clinton called attention to inequalities in the U.S. between minority groups and whites, noting the "cruel reality" that African-American and Hispanic men are much more likely to be searched by police officers, jailed and shot by police officers than white men. " Bush era haunts Obama Clinton invoked the protesters who have mobilized in major U.S. cities to protest the killings of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York, both black men who were unarmed when they were killed by white police officers. Clinton also drew on Kennedy, the one-time presidential candidate, former U.S. attorney general and civil rights champion, saying that he would call attention to the gap between American ideals and the reality throughout American history. The former secretary of state said the U.S. should reaffirm a ban on torture in "both policy and law" and suggested that Congress pass legislation to make the U.S. opposition to torture absolutely clear after a scathing Senate committee report recounting years of torture of terror suspects at the hands of the CIA.
