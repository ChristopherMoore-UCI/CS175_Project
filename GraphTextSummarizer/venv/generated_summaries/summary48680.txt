The group of MIT students behind the project - Viirj Kan, Katsuya Fujii, Judith Amores, and Chang Long Zhu Jin  - wanted to look at ways of seeing how social media worked outside the confines of the computer screen. A joint venture between design teams at MIT's Tangible Media Group and the Fluid Interface Group have incorporated the social network into a garment which signals to other wearers your interests, associations and even if people are compatible organ donors. "We wanted to examine more tangible ways of representing ourselves in social media," Kan told CNN. "While what you wear is very public, social media is able to show who you are to thousands more people and this creates really big social consequences but it often doesn't feel that way. "Current technologies are very good at connecting people over great distances but they're not so good at connecting them in the same environment," Kan said.
