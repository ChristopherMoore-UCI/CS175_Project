-- France's first lady is filing a defamation complaint against the authors of a biography published Thursday which claims she had an affair with a former French minister while seeing President Francois Hollande. In "La Frondeuse," or "The Troublemaker," authors Alix Bouilhaguet and Christophe Jakubyszyn allege that Trierweiler had a longstanding relationship with Patrick Devedjian, a former minister for economic recovery and close ally of former President Nicolas Sarkozy. Am I not good enough for her?" Trierweiler is characterized by this "abrupt iciness," the authors claim, and inside journalist circles at French newspaper Le Monde, she was labeled "Cruella." Profile: Francois Hollande "Trierweiler is an interesting subject matter because she has character," Bouilhaguet told CNN. Trierweiler's relationship with Devedjian crumbled after he was unable to commit further to their relationship, the book says -- paving the way for Hollande to step in.
