Dresses are secret weapons "I love dresses! Mandy Moore spins in a Chaiken cashmere dress and Ibisco belt. Hoop earrings work on everyone "My friend Raina's always telling me to wear hoops. She's like, 'Even if you're in jeans, a T-shirt and flats, hoops are sexy, cool, and everyone looks good in them.' Plus there's something romantic and ethereal about vintage dresses that I adore.
