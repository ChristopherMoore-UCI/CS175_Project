Iraq defeated South Korea 4-3 in a penalty shootout in a semifinal game Wednesday night in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Meanwhile, the top U.S. commander in charge of troops in northern Iraq says that a coalition troop presence will be needed in his region over the next year and a half. "With every operation coalition forces conduct we are further degrading and destroying the al Qaeda in Iraq network," said Maj. Marc Young. But Maj. Gen. Benjamin Mixon told CNN on Wednesday that it is possible the number of troops in the north could drop by sometime next year. Also Wednesday, morning raids in three cities by coalition forces targeting al Qaeda in Iraq detained 20 suspected terrorists, according to a U.S. military statement.
