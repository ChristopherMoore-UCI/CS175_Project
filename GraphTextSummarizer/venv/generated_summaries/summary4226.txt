In spite of the low Chinese production costs and production capacity, Mr Russell also insists he will maintain production for the domestic market in the UK. Manganese Bronze -- which was also affected by an embarrassing product recall last year after a series of fires in its vehicles -- has responded by cutting headcount, pay and shifts. The joint venture should also see UK production costs cut as a result of components supplied by China. In contrast to sluggish UK production, the company is working flat out to export the London cab internationally. Production is down to 12 vehicles a day during a four-day week in the UK and is barely at break even.
