New Zealand's oil spill response agency, Maritime New Zealand (MNZ), estimates that as much as 300 tonnes of fuel oil has leaked from the vessel, which was carrying 1,700 cubic meters (450,000 gallons) of fuel. "We are now coordinating a team of around 1,000 people involved in operations on land, sea and air and covering areas like field operations, planning, logistics, wildlife recovery and community and iwi [indigenous Maori people] liaison," said National On Scene Commander Nick Quinn. "This is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea," the organization's Steve Abel said. Salvors have worked to build a platform to attach to the side of the vessel today to be used to assist fuel recovery operations, MNZ said. The ship's second officer appeared in Tauranga District Court yesterday to face a charge of "operating a vessel in a manner causing unnecessary danger or risk," MNZ said.
