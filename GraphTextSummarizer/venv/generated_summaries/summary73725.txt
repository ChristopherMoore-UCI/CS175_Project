Dr. King was invested in the war on poverty, but the federal government and the media were invested in the war in Vietnam. He could not rest with the new forms of war and old forms of poverty. He contended, "There are those who want me to confine my morality to the war on poverty and overlook the war in Vietnam. However, the bombs in Vietnam ultimately explode at home because of poverty." Many of his supporters had turned against him because of his position on the war in Vietnam, but King felt he had to do what was right.
