Africa has seen a surge of adoptions in the past eight years, according to adoption expert Peter Selman from Newcastle University in Britain. "Ghana was concerned that some of the documents they had weren't filled out properly or were forged," said Hank Fortener, founder of AdoptTogether, an advocacy group that provides a platform for prospective parents to raise funds. A new report from The African Child Policy Forum entitled "Africa: The New Frontier for Intercountry Adoption" says prospective adoptive parents are turning "en masse" to the continent as other countries toughen their laws. African adoption should be discouraged 'at all costs,' group says Though they are still in the nation, Ghanaian officials have since determined their documents are legitimate, according to Fortener. The couple used the group's website to raise funds.
