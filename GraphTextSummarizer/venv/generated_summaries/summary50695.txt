-- West Indies batsman Chris Gayle entered the record books on day two of the first Test with Sri Lanka by hitting a majestic 333. Gayle became only the fourth player in history to register his second triple-hundred -- matching the feat of Australian legend Don Bradman, fellow West Indian Brian Lara and Virender Sehwag, of India. The opener's huge total allowed the West Indies to compile a mammoth 580-9 declared in their first innings, with Sri Lanka reaching 54-1 in reply before play closed for the day. Resuming overnight on 219, Gayle went on to compile the 12th highest Test total ever and the first ever triple-century by a West Indies player away from home. Andre Russell dismissed Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan for a duck but Kumar Sangakkara and Tharanga Paranavitana helped the hosts to 54-1 at the close.
