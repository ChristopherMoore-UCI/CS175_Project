In my native Britain, anti-Semitic attacks have risen and we've seen the return of old prejudices on anti-war marches. Just two years after the end of the Second World War, there were anti-Semitic riots across Britain. At the beginning of the Gaza operation, Times columnist Hugo Rifkind wrote in The Spectator that he was uncomfortable with Israel's policies. He apparently feared that demonstrators outside might trash the shop; one member of the staff reportedly said, "We support free Gaza." The rally was in reaction to a series of strange, unsettling incidents that took place during the recent demonstrations against Israeli military actions in Gaza.
