Taylor died Friday at his home on the Isle of Wight, according to starwars.com. "From the iconic opening shot of a massive Imperial Star Destroyer chasing the Rebels' Tantive IV to the setting of twin suns on Tatooine, Taylor played a large role in establishing the visual identity of the entire series," the website noted. Taylor was already a well-established cinematographer when "Star Wars" came along. "Gilbert's work truly stands the test of time," said "Star Wars" mastermind George Lucas in a statement. Gilbert Taylor, who gave the "Star Wars" films their sharp look as the cinematographer of 1977's "Star Wars," has died, according to Lucasfilm. He oversaw the camerawork on three 1960s classics, Stanley Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" (1964); the Beatles' first film, "A Hard Day's Night" (1964); and Roman Polanski's "Repulsion" (1965).
