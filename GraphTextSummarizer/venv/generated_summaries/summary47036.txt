The drone strike came just two days after Pakistan's intelligence chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, met with CIA Director Leon Panetta at CIA headquarters to voice his government's complaints about CIA activities in his country. In addition to the aerial attacks, the Pakistanis are angered by what they say is the lack of transparency about the number of CIA operatives and the extent of American intelligence activities within their country. A senior Pakistani intelligence official told CNN drone strikes carried out by Americans -- once widely believed to have the tacit approval and cooperation of Pakistani intelligence -- are now carried out autonomously by the CIA. Pakistani officials insisted this week that the United States give them details about other CIA contractors in the country. Although the United States said Davis was a security officer assigned to protect CIA officers, the Pakistanis maintained he was actually a spy whom they had been unaware of prior to the shooting incident.
