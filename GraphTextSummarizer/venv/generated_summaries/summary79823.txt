" The victim, identified as Akai Gurley, was "a total innocent who just happened" to run into Officer Peter Liang in a "pitch black" stairwell at the Louis H. Pink Houses in Brooklyn late Thursday, New York Police Commissioner William Bratton told reporters. The chokehold death of the unarmed 43-year-old man sparked street protests, a review of police procedures and calls for a federal civil rights investigation. "A life was lost and my heart goes out to the family of the young man," Mayor Bill de Blasio said. The shooting comes amid strained police/community relations after the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police on Staten Island. "What happened in Ferguson is different than what happened on Staten Island is different than what happened in Brooklyn," de Blasio said.
