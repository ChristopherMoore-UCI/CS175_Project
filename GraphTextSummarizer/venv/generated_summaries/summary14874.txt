The consolidated cases are Chadborne & Parke LLP v. Troice (12-79); Willis of Colorado, Inc. v. Troice (12-86); and Proskauer Rose LLP v. Troice (12-88). The 7-2 decision is a further legal setback for Texas financier Allen Stanford and his business associates over the sale of about $7 billion in certificates of deposit. Former investors seeking to recover losses are suing insurance brokers, financial services companies and law firms associated with Stanford. The court majority said its opinion will not hamper the federal government's ability to go after financial fraud in its separate criminal prosecutions. Allen was sentenced to 110 years in prison in June 2012 for orchestrating the $7 billion fraud, one of the largest in U.S. history.
