An International Crisis Group report in April about the conflict between government forces and militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta said Okah is accused of treason, terrorism and kidnapping. Okah, who had been MEND's main arms smuggler, was arrested in September 2007 in the Angolan capital, Luanda. After receiving news of Okah's acceptance of the government officer, MEND issued a statement. MEND has declared an "all-out war" on the government, demanding a fairer distribution of oil wealth in the Niger Delta. "We support Henry Okah's decision to accept any deal that will ensure his early release to attend to his failing health under the current circumstances," said Jomo Gbomo, a MEND spokesman.
