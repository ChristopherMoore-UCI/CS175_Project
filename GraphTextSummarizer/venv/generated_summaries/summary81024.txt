He had been "dean of academy" at English High School since January 5, where "he provided services, like finding housing for homeless students or social services or disciplinary alternatives to suspension," said Denise Snyder, a representative for Boston Public Schools. While he was working as "dean of academy" at English High, Harrison was also running a marijuana distribution enterprise, according to Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney, David Bradley. He recalled Harrison usually attended services alone, but he "got along with everyone." "He seemed to consistently care with a deep heart for saving young people who were in the streets or gang related, prison-involved," Groover said. The Rev. Dr. Gregory Groover, pastor of the Charles Street AME Church where Harrison attended services said the allegations against Harrison aren't consistent with the man he knows. The teenager, who called Harrison "Rev" told authorities he was regularly mentored by Harrison, according to police documents.
