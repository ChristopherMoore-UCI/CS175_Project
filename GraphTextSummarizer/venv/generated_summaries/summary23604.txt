-- Thousands desperate to flee intense fighting in western Libya have begun pouring into neighboring Tunisia in recent days, raising concerns Tuesday among aid agencies that the humanitarian crisis could worsen. "In the last two days, we have seen 6,000 Libyans come through," Firas Kayal, of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said by phone from near the Tunisian border town of Dehiba. A boat chartered by IOM that was delivering aid and picking up wounded in Misrata was forced to stop Monday in the break waters just outside the city of Misrata after Libyans crammed the port, hoping to board the ship to leave the city, Pandya said. The situation in Libya has become increasingly precarious for civilians and migrant workers, who have been caught in the crossfire of the conflict that has killed tens of thousands and left thousands more wounded since it began two months ago. NATO-led forces began bombing regime targets in Libya last month after the U.N. Security Council approved a resolution authorizing any means necessary to protect civilians.
