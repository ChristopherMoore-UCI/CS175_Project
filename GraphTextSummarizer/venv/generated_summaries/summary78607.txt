Three Ukrainian border guards were wounded when pro-Russian separatists launched a mortar attack and opened fire with automatic weapons near the town of Vyselky, in the Donetsk region, Ukraine's State Border Service said in a statement Saturday. The new cease-fire implemented in embattled eastern Ukraine by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Friday was clearly under threat by Saturday, if not sooner. Meanwhile, three military tanks and 10 armored personnel carriers of unknown origin were seen in Luhansk, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which operates a special monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine, said Saturday. Putin emphasized that the plan "should not take the character of an ultimatum to militants" and that the cease-fire "should be used to begin constructive negotiations and political compromises between the opponent parties in eastern Ukraine," according to the Kremlin.
