The move is part of an ongoing effort by Google to synchronize its various services, from Gmail to social network Google Plus to the Android mobile operating system. Gmail users can now send files of up to 10 GB using Google Drive, the Web giant's cloud-storage service. That's 400 times bigger than files that can be shared in a regular e-mail, according to a blog post by Google's Gmail team. The ability to sync with Gmail offers Google a built-in edge over standalone cloud storage tools like Dropbox. Drive, and before that Google Docs, already allowed users to share large files.
