Back in October, the Guinness Book of World Records named Jackson the highest-grossing actor in the history of movies -- the result of Jackson's insane four-films-per-year work ethic, his willingness to take supporting roles in mega-productions, and what we can only assume is a tremendous sense of humor. Even if phase 2 of Marvel's mad-scientist movie plan isn't as successful as phase 1 -- heck, even if "Avengers 2" makes half of what "Avengers" has made in two weeks of global release -- Jackson looks likely to achieve a career global tally of $10 billion. Most popular movie released this year featuring intense archery scenes? But as we all know, the most important thing about "The Avengers" is undoubtedly its role in the brilliant career of one Samuel Leroy Jackson. In short, that eyepatch might turn out to be the single most lucrative prop in movie history.
