-- South Korea has rebuffed North Korea's demand to meet two of its fishermen whose boat strayed into the South's waters. " South Korean officials rejected the request, saying it was "not appropriate... because those two sought to defect to South Korea. " North Koreans who come to South Korea typically go through an investigation, then attend a settlement support center called Hanawon. CNN's KJ Kwon reported from South Korea and Madison Park in Hong Kong. That fisherman was sent back to North Korea through Panmunjom, the border village in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone on Tuesday, said a Unification Ministry spokesman.
