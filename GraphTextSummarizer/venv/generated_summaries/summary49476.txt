In addition to closing borders shared with member states and banning travel outside Mali by junta members, ECOWAS said its potential sanctions include a "freezing of assets of the junta members and their partners, as well as no access to the ports of the coastal countries of ECOWAS." U.S. State Department spokesman Mark Toner spoke one day after the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) gave the military junta that ousted Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure three days to hand back power to civilians or face "diplomatic and financial embargo." The United States called on coup leaders in Mali on Friday to step down and allow for elections to take place. The group of heads of states led by Ivorian President and ECOWAS Chairman Allasane Ouattara met in Abidjan, after a pro-junta demonstration at the airport in the Malian capital of Bamako prevented them from landing in Mali for a prearranged meeting. On Tuesday, ECOWAS suspended Mali's membership, with Ouattara saying, "Dialogue and consultation will be the first instruments in finding a solution, but (ECOWAS members) will not hesitate to use any other option.
