"This arrest would not have happened without the public's help, and it demonstrates how much individual citizens can do to help law enforcement attack crime," ICE Director John Morton said in a statement issued Friday. It is an international operation aimed at child pornography and sexual abuse in which 245 suspects were arrested and 123 victims of child exploitation were identified. 245 arrested in U.S.-led child sex abuse operation Fries, called "John Doe" until he was identified, was allegedly involved in a second case, ICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen said. ICE said it took Lance Robert Fries, 43, into custody Friday afternoon at his attorney's office in Tucson. He faces potential federal charges of production of child pornography and is expected to make his initial appearance in federal court Monday, ICE said.
