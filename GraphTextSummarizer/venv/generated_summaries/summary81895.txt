"With the solemnity usually reserved for the passing of revered civic leaders, San Diego Zoo officials on Friday announced the death of Ken Allen, an escape-artist orangutan so beloved that he had his own fan club," wrote Tony Perry, a Times staff writer. This kooky incident happened at an old-timey exotic animal park run by famous animal collector Frank Buck. And of course, the clever Bronx Zoo cobra. In the late '90s, a 450-pound lioness named Nala -- after a character in Disney's "The Lion King" -- escaped from Kissimmee's JungleLand Zoo when handlers were cleaning her cage. The penguin came back to the aquarium in good condition, apparently fit for big city life.
