Van der Sloot, who remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of American Natalee Holloway, and his unnamed fiancÃ©e are working on completing the paperwork required for the wedding, said attorney Maximo Altez. In June 2010, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted him on charges of allegedly attempting to extort $250,000 from Holloway's mother, Beth Holloway. Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. Van der Sloot offered to provide what turned out to be bogus information about the whereabouts of Holloway's remains in exchange for the money, according to the indictment. Van der Sloot was arrested twice in Aruba in connection with Holloway's disappearance, but was never charged.
