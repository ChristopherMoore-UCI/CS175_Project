Sandra Avila Beltran, known as the "Queen of the Pacific" for alleged drug dealings, was deported Tuesday from the United States to Mexico, where she will face money-laundering charges, the third set of criminal accusations against her. Mexico arrests alleged leader of Gulf Cartel A federal court in Miami in July sentenced Avila to 70 months in prison for helping a Colombian drug lord, but under the plea deal the judge ruled that her time served in Mexico and in the United States was enough to complete her sentence. Avila's lawyer, Stephen Ralls, told CNNMexico last week that Avila is "optimistic" about facing what will be her third judicial process, after being exonerated in her first trial in Mexico and having reach a plea deal in her second case in the United States. After her acquittal, authorities extradited her last year to the United States, where she was accused of conspiring to smuggle cocaine along with Juan Diego Espinosa Ramirez, a Colombian national who was also known as "The Tiger." Avila denied the charges. Avila landed in Mexico City on a chartered plane from El Paso, Texas, along with other deportees, the Mexican attorney general's office said.
