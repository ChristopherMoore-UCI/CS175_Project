A report released by Amnesty International last November alleged that the abuse of migrant workers was rife within Qatar's construction sector, while British newspaper The Guardian likened the conditions for such workers to "modern-day slavery." Sepp Blatter, the president of football's world governing body, FIFA, described the conditions for migrant workers in Qatar as "unacceptable," but has so far refused to entertain the idea of moving the 2022 competition to another country.

After being awarded the right to stage the 2022 World Cup, Qatar's human rights record has come under intense scrutiny.
