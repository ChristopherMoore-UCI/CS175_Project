His task is to reverse the fortunes of United, which last season under David Moyes went from the most dominant side in the English Premier League era to one that couldn't even qualify for the often derided Europa League. Van Gaal at the helm could be a boon for his compatriot, striker Robin van Persie, who failed to match his first season at Manchester United in 2012/2013, yet he still inherits a team in transition. However, United's standing generally wasn't lost on van Gaal, whose resume boasts league titles with three European giants, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax. The retention of Giggs and van Gaal's stated intention Thursday that he would find roles for other former players on the United staff like Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil Neville shows he will not be totally breaking from the past. In case he needed a reminder of United's stature, United legend Bobby Charlton was there Thursday to greet him.
