The accused -- members of the Sindh Rangers -- can be seen opening fire on 17-year-old Sarfraz Shah in a video captured by a local television cameraman and broadcast across Pakistan's networks last week. Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Karachi police official Rafiq Gulsaid Shah pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones. "In compliance with supreme courts orders Major General Ijaz Chaudhary, DG Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) has been posted out," the military said in a brief statement Wednesday. Meanwhile, the six members of the paramilitary force who are accused of killing the teen last week have been turned over to police and will be tried under the country's terrorism act, a police official said Monday.
