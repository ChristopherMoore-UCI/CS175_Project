Al Qaeda member killed in Yemen strike, official says General threats Terrorists have made general threats against the U.S. Embassy and personnel in Yemen, including the ambassador, but the United States does not have any actionable information about a specific or credible threat, State Department officials said Tuesday. However, this week, defense and State Department officials confirmed there have been a series of conversations between the Pentagon and State Department about how long U.S. diplomats can safely stay in Yemen. The U.S. military is updating plans to potentially evacuate U.S. Embassy personnel from Yemen in the wake of rising violence and uncertainty about the security situation in that country, CNN has learned. While the Pentagon has been keeping a close eye on the deteriorating security situation in Yemen for weeks, several defense officials tell CNN that in the last few days, concern has grown. There have been clashes between rebel groups and Yemen government forces around the airport in the capital, Sanaa.
