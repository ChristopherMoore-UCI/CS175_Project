Police officials credited the "Ring of Steel" -- a network of thousands of surveillance cameras that line London's intersections and neighborhoods -- for providing license plate numbers, suspects' image and other important clues in investigations. But Steve Swain, who served for years with the London Metropolitan Police and its counter-terror operations, doubts the power of cameras to deter crime. Their images had been captured on surveillance cameras near the sites of the attempted attacks. Aided by surveillance cameras, British investigators began unraveling the plot later that day and tracked the suspects to Glasgow, Scotland. The system has four components: license plate readers, surveillance cameras, a coordination center and roadblocks that can swing into action when needed.
