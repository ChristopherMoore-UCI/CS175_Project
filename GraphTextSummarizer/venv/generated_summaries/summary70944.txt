Furthermore, the code share agreement would cut down the number of staff because flights would use Istanbul or Ankara as their hub and use Turkish Airlines staff to fly passengers to international destinations currently offered by PIA, he said. -- A second day of a strike against Pakistan's flagship carrier, Pakistan International Airlines, ended Wednesday with police charging protesters and angry passengers at Jinnah International Airport in Karachi, said Pervez George, an official with Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority. PIA staff called the strike demanding management reinstate five pilots who were fired, that Managing Director Pia Aijaz Haroon resign, and that a proposed code share agreement with Turkish Airlines be dropped. Haroon was appointed managing director of Pakistan International Airlines two years ago. PIA grounded close to 60 international and domestic flights leaving thousands of frustrated passengers at Jinnah airport and Benazir Bhutto International Airport in Islamabad.
