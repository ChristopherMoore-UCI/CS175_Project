-- The global war on drugs has failed, a high-level commission comprised of former presidents, public intellectuals and other leaders studying drug policies concluded in a report released Thursday. The commission, which includes former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, challenges the conventional wisdom about drug markets and drug use. Among the group's recommendations: -- End of criminalization and stigmatization of people who use drugs but do not harm others -- Encourage governments to experiment with drug legalization, especially marijuana -- Offer more harm reduction measures, such as access to syringes -- Other leaders, such as former Mexican President Vicente Fox, have called for drug legalization as part of a solution to his country's woes. International efforts to crack down on drug producers and consumers and to try to reduce demand have had "devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world," the report from the Global Commission on Drug Policy said.
