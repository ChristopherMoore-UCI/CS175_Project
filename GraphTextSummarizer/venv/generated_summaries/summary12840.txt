'I only got out of there by the grace of God,' " President Obama said Monday during a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Ceremony honoring Overton. At 107 years old, World War II veteran Richard Overton credits God for his longevity. Overton volunteered for service in 1942, becoming a member of the Army's 188th Aviation Engineer Battalion, an all-black unit that served on various islands in the Pacific. " Monday's audience gave Overton two standing ovations for his service. The crowd that gathered around him wept, too," Obama said Monday as he described the veteran's visit.
