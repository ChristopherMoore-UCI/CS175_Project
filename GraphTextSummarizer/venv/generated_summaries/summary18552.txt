-- Newly released photographs show what a damaged World Trade Center tower and its collapse looked like from a New York Police Department helicopter as it flew nearby on September 11, 2001, in New York. The aerial photos were obtained by ABC News after it filed a Freedom of Information Act request last year with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which had collected the images for its investigation into the towers' collapse. On the same day, hijackers flew another airplane into the Pentagon in Washington, killing 184 people. Hijackers flew two commercial jetliners into the twin towers that day, killing 2,752 people. A couple of the images show one of the twin towers burning after a hijacked airplane had flown into it.
