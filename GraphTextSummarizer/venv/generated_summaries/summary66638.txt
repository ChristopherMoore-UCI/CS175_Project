-- Bangkok turned into a war zone Wednesday as Thai military forces cracked down on anti-government protesters, ending a tense standoff that has troubled the capital for weeks. " The violence prompted the United Nations' top human rights official to implore anti-government protesters and government officials to resume talks. He said the government had regained full control and Red Shirt leaders had fled or were taken into police custody. The army surged into Lumpini Park, the area where Red Shirt demonstrators had amassed. The chaotic day left at least five people dead as Bangkok residents endured an edgy and unsettled night.
