These drugs take longer to reach normal concentration levels in the blood of obese women compared with normal weight women, according to one study. It is unclear why emergency contraceptives may be less effective for overweight women, said Anna Glasier, an expert in reproductive medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Glasier and her colleagues found that obese women had three times the risk of getting pregnant after taking emergency contraception than those with a normal body weight. Glasier published a study in 2011 that analyzed the risk of pregnancy for women who had taken emergency contraception. It's important to note that women shouldn't be relying solely on emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy.
