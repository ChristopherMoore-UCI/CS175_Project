Charlottesville Police Detective Lisa Reeves wrote in a sworn statement used to obtain a search warrant in the case that "George Huguely admitted on May 3, 2010, that he was involved in an altercation with Yeardley Love and, during the course of the altercation, he shook Love and her head repeatedly hit the wall. " The defense attorney has said there is no evidence that Love's head hit a wall, and on Saturday, the defense called a witness who questioned the nature of Love's injuries. Earlier in the trial, Chapman read e-mails exchanged between the two after Huguely heard Love had allegedly slept with someone else. A medical examiner later ruled that blunt force trauma killed Love, and authorities allege that Huguely caused it during an altercation. The defense has said Love's death was an accident.
