They insist that the fact that the flow of Mexican immigrants into the United States is at a historic low is attributable to the billions of dollars we've spent on everything from border fencing and additional Border Patrol agents to high-tech surveillance equipment. Anyway, I suspect that a lot of this is smoke and mirrors and that the Republican senators who want to block immigration reform are merely seizing on border security as an excuse. The smugglers who used to move illegal drugs have now branched out and smuggle illegal immigrants. Americans can build walls and fences, triple the number of Border Patrol agents, and deploy SEAL Team 6 if they like. It would increase the size of the Border Patrol by 20,000 agents, and complete 700  miles of border fencing.
