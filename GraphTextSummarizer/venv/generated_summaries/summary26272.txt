"Secretary Napolitano never lost sight of the fact that New York City was on the top of the terrorist target list and acted accordingly in funding important initiatives," Kelly's statement said. In a statement Friday, Kelly and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised Napolitano for prioritizing federal funding for the city's anti-terrorism programs during an era of budget austerity. Names previously mentioned as possible successors include New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and retired U.S. Coast Guard Adm. " "Any selection -- interim or permanent -- to replace Secretary Napolitano must disavow these aggressive non-enforcement directives or there is very little hope for successful immigration reform," Sessions said in a statement. "While some may consider her to be an unconventional choice, Secretary Napolitano is without a doubt the right person at the right time" to lead the university, Lansing said in a statement.
