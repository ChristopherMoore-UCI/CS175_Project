-- Re-elected German Chancellor Angela Merkel is eyeing a new coalition to replace the "grand coalition" her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party shared with the Social Democratic Party (SPD) in the previous parliament. The election was disastrous for her rival, foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier and the SPD who saw their vote fall 10 percent from 34.2 percent in 2005 to 23 percent. You'll probably see tax cuts and it will probably mean smaller government than seen in the past four years," he said. The result is the SPD's worst result since World War II. The results leave the CDU as the strongest party in the German parliament with 27.3 percent of the popular vote -- slightly down on the 27.8 percent it achieved four years ago.
