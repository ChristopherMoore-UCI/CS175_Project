" "Bayer Healthcare is doing a disservice to men by misleading them about a protective role for selenium in prostate cancer," they added. A nonprofit consumer group said Thursday that it will sue Bayer HealthCare, alleging "deceptive and irresponsible" advertising that contends selenium in two of its multivitamins may reduce men's risk of prostate cancer. A seven-year, $118 million study funded by the National Institutes of Health found last year that selenium does not prevent prostate cancer in healthy men, the center said. One A Day Men's 50+ Advantage ads say selenium may cut men's risk of prostate cancer, a consumer group says. In its promotions, the company says "emerging research" suggests that selenium might reduce the risk of prostate cancer, the center said.
