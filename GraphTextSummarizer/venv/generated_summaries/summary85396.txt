"As I have sadly said on two prior occasions, I hope that this verdict will give some small degree of solace to the families of Lofemi Hightower, Dashon Harvey, Terrence Aeriel and Natasha Aeriel.'' He is the third person convicted in the killing of Terrance Aeriel, 18; Dashon Harvey, 20; and Lofemi Hightower, 20, by shooting them in the head after forcing them to kneel against a wall on the grounds of an elementary school in Newark, New Jersey. "We hope that he will join both of his other co-defendants, who are now serving multiple life sentences in state prison,'' said prosecutor Robert Laurino at a news conference announcing the verdict. Alfaro, 20, was convicted of murder, felony murder, robbery, conspiracy and weapons charges, according to acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray. Alfaro was found not guilty of attempted murder of Natasha Aeriel, the sole survivor of the attack.
