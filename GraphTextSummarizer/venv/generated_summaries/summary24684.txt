" Most of the intrigue over who will attend his year's speech centers on Chief Justice John Roberts, who has labeled the political atmosphere at last year's address "very troubling." Roberts, who turns 56 next Thursday, said last March that partisan rhetoric and gestures aimed at the court left him questioning whether his colleagues should continue to attend. Democrats last year cheered the president when he dressed down high court conservatives in last January's State of the Union address. At least one member of the bench, Justice Samuel Alito, has publicly stated he will not attend after the dramatic criticism leveled at a court ruling by President Barack Obama. Court members are not required by law to be there, but custom has dictated their appearance, mostly for show. Sources close to Roberts have said he has grown increasingly "frustrated" at what he views as the growing partisanship aimed at the federal courts, particularly the Supreme Court Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden -- when they were senators -- voted against Roberts and Alito during court confirmation proceedings.
