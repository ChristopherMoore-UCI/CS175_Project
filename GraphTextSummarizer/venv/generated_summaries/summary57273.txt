The 88-year-old's ordeal began in January, when he went to Mexico with grandson Gary Chrisman Jr. for inexpensive dental work, family members said. At that point, the Chrisman family says, the mother demanded more money from Gary Chrisman, he refused, and she called authorities, alleging that he had tried taking pornographic pictures of her daughters. Ed Chrisman's wheelchair was pushed toward his cheering family members Monday at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport for the highly anticipated reunion, CNN television affiliate KOMO reported.

A Mexican judge ruled that Ed Chrisman could be released based on his age and health, KOMO reported.
