Terrified, he thought for a moment and then asked Jon, "Can I call my mother?" Later that night, as Aasif was seated across from Stewart at "The Daily Show" desk waiting for the program to begin, Stewart leaned over and said to Aasif, "Thanks for doing this, I know you were hesitant." Aasif responded, "It's just that I'm not the best Muslim and I can't speak for all of Islam." The more Aasif experienced hateful or simply ignorant comments about Islam, the more he felt compelled to counter the ignorance and bigotry with missiles of satire on behalf of a group of people who after 9/11 did not have the luxury of being both patriotic and critical of Islam at the same time: American Muslims. Stewart called Aasif on the phone -- which was the first time Jon ever had called him -- and asked, "How would you feel about talking about the issue on the show as Muslim? Jon Stewart made Aasif more Muslim-ish. Aasif didn't come to work one day and find Jon sitting in his office holding up the Quran, saying, "Mandvi, its time you start boning up on your Islam."
