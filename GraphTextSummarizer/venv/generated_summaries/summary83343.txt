-- Actor Jeremy London escaped from armed carjackers who kidnapped him along a Palm Springs, California, roadside last week, police said. Brian Adams, a 26-year-old Palm Springs man, was charged with kidnapping, possession of stolen property, and vehicle theft and carjacking in connection with this case, police said. London said the kidnappers forced him to "use illegal drugs," according to a Palm Springs Police statement. Police said they found London's vehicle in a residential area of Palm Springs and they arrested one suspect later that day. After they helped change the tire, London offered them a ride home, police said.
