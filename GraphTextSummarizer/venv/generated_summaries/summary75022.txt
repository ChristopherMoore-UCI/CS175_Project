Australian spin king Shane Warne suffered a losing return to cricket on Saturday as he was upstaged in the Melbourne Stars' opening Big Bash League defeat by Sydney Thunder. Playing in his home city of Melbourne for the first time in five years, the 42-year-old conceded 19 runs from his two overs as David Warner smashed 102 from just 51 balls to give Sydney a six-wicket win with six deliveries to spare. However, it was downhill from there for Warne as the Stars lost the toss and struggled after batting first. David Hussey top-scored with 52 as Warne was not required to bat, then Warner took center stage as he scored more than half his team's runs. Warner, who scored his maiden Test century in Australia's recent defeat by New Zealand, smashed Warne over the boundary ropes twice as he hit six sixes in a successful chase to overhaul the Stars' 153-7 from 20 overs.
