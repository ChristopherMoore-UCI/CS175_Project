These numbers could represent an increase in use among Americans, or simply an increase in the number of people who felt OK reporting use of the drug on a national survey. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced last week that the federal government would no longer prosecute people who used the drug in states where it was legal -- as long as there were state laws in place to keep the drug away from children. But heroin use is on the rise; the number of people using heroin is up some 80% since 2007. Nearly 24 million Americans -- that's 9.2% of the population -- say they use illicit drugs, according to the survey. Results from the past five years have shown a steady increase in weed use.
