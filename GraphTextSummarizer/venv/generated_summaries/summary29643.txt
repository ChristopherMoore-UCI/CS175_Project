Williams perfectly captures Monroe's legendary vulnerabilities and in the culmination of a series of scenes, the duality of Norma Jeane Baker, the person she was, and Marilyn Monroe, the woman she became. As for the production within the film, Monroe's reputation of difficulty on the set follows her to England, and what's more, she brings acting coach Paula Strasberg (wife of famed acting teacher Lee, played by ZoÃ« Wanamaker) with her. Leaning into Colin, Monroe whispers "Shall I be her?" and instantly, Norma Jeane disappears and Marilyn is there, shimmying, posing and doing exactly what's expected of her. When you're watching Williams go through Monroe's struggle with self-doubt and an increasingly serious pill problem, there's no doubt in your mind that it's Marilyn Monroe. In the summer of 1956, Marilyn Monroe, newly married to writer Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott), traveled to England to shoot "The Prince and the Showgirl" with co-star/director Laurence Olivier (Kenneth Branagh).
