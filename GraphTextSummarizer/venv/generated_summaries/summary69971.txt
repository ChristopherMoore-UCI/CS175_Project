Speculation: Commandeering Commandeering isn't to be confused with hijacking, a political act in which demands are issued by the hijacker, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. "That's an enormous breach of security," Weiss said of cockpit guests. "I've been running that in my brain now ever since this thing happened," said Jim Tilmon, an aviation expert and retired American Airlines pilot. As aviation expert Mark Weiss put it: "I don't think you can discount any theory, frankly." Commandeered flights have a history -- prior to the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, Bergen said.
