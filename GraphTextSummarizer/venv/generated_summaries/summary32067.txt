France remains in mourning after attacks on magazine Charlie Hebdo and other targets, including a kosher grocery store, left 17 dead and more critically injured. Also trending were hashtags #JeSuisJuif, #JeSuisAhmed and #JeSuisHumain; people looking to show solidarity with all the victims of the terror rampage, including the police officers who were shot while defending Hebdo's employees. The Committee to Protect Journalists updated their site with profiles of some of those lost, and many took to Twitter to say they'd donated to CPJ in honor of Charlie Hebdo. The website for Charlie Hebdo itself is now offering ways to donate to the magazine. 'Freedom is the right of expression,' reads its' website; 'Charlie Hebdo needs you to survive.'
