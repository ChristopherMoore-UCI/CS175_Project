-- New Zealander Warren Gatland was appointed head coach of the British and Irish Lions Tuesday ahead of the rugby team's tour of Australia next year. " After winning two Six Nations titles with Wales, as well as steering English club side Wasps to European glory, Gatland's potential role as Lions coach was thrown into doubt when breaking his heels after falling while cleaning windows at his beach house in New Zealand. The tours only take place once every four years, with the destinations rotating between Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The Wales coach, whose confirmation in the role was delayed after breaking both his heels in an accident in April, will start his role with immediate effect -- but has arranged to lead out the Welsh for two final matches against New Zealand and Australia in late 2012. The Lions have lost their last three tours to Australia and New Zealand and were last successful there back in 1989.
