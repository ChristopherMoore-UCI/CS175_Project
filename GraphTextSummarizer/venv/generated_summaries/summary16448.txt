The most important aspect for applicants is to "identify cost-effective and practical solutions to improve the energy efficiency (through renewable energy sources) of properties," Mitcham said "as well as modernizing ... government structures." Mitcham explained that most existing homes and public buildings on Tristan da Cunha are small, bungalow-type structures made from made from a mix of concrete and local volcanic rock. "The competition is looking at enhancing the built environment on the island (and) making all structures more energy efficient," the island's administrator, Alex Mitcham told CNN when visiting the UK recently. Porter and Mitcham say the islanders will have to apply to the UK and possibly the EU for grants to fund the project. Those who live there are mainly the descendants of Dutch, American and Italian sailors as well as 19th century British explorers.
