One of the men accused of the brutal daylight killing of British soldier Lee Rigby told police he took little joy in slaying. " Pathologist Simon Poole told the court Wednesday that drummer Rigby suffered "numerous and very deep wounds" to the neck and that the cause of death was "multiple incised wounds." During Adebolajo's two-hour interview with police, he also criticized British rulers whom he described as "wicked and black-hearted humans" from privileged schools like Eton, who wore expensive suits and drove expensive cars. Michael Adebolajo's interview with police was played to jurors at the Old Bailey criminal court in London on Wednesday, day four of the trial in which he and co-defendant Michael Adebowale have pleaded not guilty to the murder of Rigby in Woolwich on May 22. Earlier in the day, the court heard the statement of forensic psychiatrist Tim McKinley, who interviewed Adebolajo three times while he was being treated in a hospital after being shot by police shortly after the attack on Rigby.
