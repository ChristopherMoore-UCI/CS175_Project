Vaccination is critical for people who live with or care for young children or children with medical conditions, to prevent the spread of flu to high-risk children. Getting children ready for flu season At the time, Diane McGowan noted, it wasn't recommended that children Martin's age get the flu vaccine -- something she worked to change, lobbying the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to increase flu immunization requirements for children and teens. And make sure that family members and caregivers -- including babysitters and grandparents -- are all vaccinated to prevent spreading flu to children too young for vaccination. New research raises hopes in quest to find universal flu vaccine School-based influenza vaccination programs, however, may help prevent the spread of the virus among children and young adults. In tandem with the new data on pediatric flu deaths, an example of promising new research on flu prevention was presented at the ID Week 2012 meeting.
