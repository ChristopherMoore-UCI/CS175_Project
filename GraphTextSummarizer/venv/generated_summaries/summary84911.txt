The FBI found "very low concentrations" of ricin on letters sent this week to President Obama, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and a gun control group, a spokesman said Friday. One front of the FBI investigation advanced Friday in Texas, where authorities searched the home of a man in New Boston in connection with the threatening letters to Obama and Bloomberg. FBI agents interviewed the man after his wife contacted authorities, saying she had found suspicious containers in their New Boston home, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. Both sources told CNN that the wife told authorities she found a suspicious container and ricin research on their computer. Meanwhile, in what appears to be a separate incident of possibly poisoned mailings in Washington state, the FBI confirmed the presence of ricin on a letter sent to Fairchild Air Force Base near Spokane, the agency said.
