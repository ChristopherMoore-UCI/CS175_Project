Photos: Fired from 'Saturday Night Live' As "Saturday Night Live" prepares to celebrate 40 years on air, executive producer Lorne Michaels is looking ahead. Che will take over for Cecily Strong, who manned the Weekend Update desk with Seth Meyers before he left in early 2014 for "Late Night," and then with Colin Jost. Strong is staying with "SNL" full-time, and Jost will continue to co-host Weekend Update with Che. "got a lot of strange congratulations on the gig," Che joked on Twitter Friday. By the end of season 39, Brooks Wheelan, NoÃ«l Wells and John Milhiser were all let go. "This is about a new era, what feels appropriate for now," Michaels told The New York Times, which first reported the news of "SNL's" new addition.
