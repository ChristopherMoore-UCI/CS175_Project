In May Obama announced a plan to withdraw most American forces from Afghanistan by the end of this year, leaving behind a force of about 10,000 to maintain security and train Afghan forces. Pakistan Like in Afghanistan, militants have been targeted by U.S. drones flying over Pakistan, causing similar uproar when they strike civilians rather than suspected Taliban outposts. How Obama came to launch strikes in Syria A year later, facing a different threat in Syria in the form of ISIS and the al Qaeda offshoot Khorasan, Obama authorized airstrikes on terrorist targets alongside a coalition of other Arab states. Obama came to the brink of ordering airstrikes there in 2013, after Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on civilians. The move came after a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing use of force to protect Libyan civilians, and though regime change wasn't Obama's stated goal at the beginning of the campaign, the airstrikes ended with the death of longtime Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
