Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers. Video of Abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants "Skol! Skol!" drew plenty of attention on social media. Abbott was in a Sydney pub on Saturday evening when a group of Australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them. Abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year. The Prime Minister accepted and even gave a short, impromptu speech, one of the football coaches, Simon Carrodus, told The Australian Woman's Weekly.
