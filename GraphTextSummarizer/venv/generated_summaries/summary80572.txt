Plus, the law would still be in effect, so its many new requirements -- everything from forcing insurance companies to cover anyone who wants insurance to forcing everyday Americans to carry health insurance or pay a fine -- would still be in effect, too. Is Obamacare health insurance government insurance? On the one hand, the government is making people either carry insurance or pay a fine, on the other hand the government is making insurance companies provide insurance to anyone who wants it and they're controlling how much the insurance companies can charge. A lot of people think that because of Obamacare, fewer companies will offer health insurance, particularly to low-paid workers and retirees. However, if you get health insurance at work, you could probably drop that coverage and buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges.
