The time slot was terrible (Friday nights), it had no major stars attached to it and the premise -- Grimm fairy tales set in modern times around the banner of a police procedural -- sounds like it could be the cheesiest thing ever. CNN recently spoke with the actor from the "Grimm" set in Portland, Oregon, about what makes the show such an unlikely hit and the process of bringing fairy tales to the small screen. There were more Armenians in Little Armenia than I think in actual Armenia. I think what happens to a Grimm, over time, they get hardened and mean. They pluck what they want from the original Grimm fairy tales and discard what they don't want, in a sense.
