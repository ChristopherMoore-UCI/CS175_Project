"It gives Mr. Arellano Felix the hope of one day being released from custody and returning to his family in Mexico," attorney Anthony E. Colombo Jr. said after Wednesday's hearing. -- A former leader of Mexico's Tijuana drug cartel pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court in San Diego on Wednesday to charges of racketeering and conspiracy to launder money, according to court documents. Arellano Felix, 58, had been named in two U.S. indictments alleging conspiracy, money laundering, drug trafficking, operating a drug smuggling organization and murder. Arellano Felix has been convicted of organized crime activities in Mexico and served nine years there before his extradition to the United States last year. "Arellano Felix led the most violent criminal organization in this part of the world for two decades," U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said in a statement.
