But residents of Gaza can now buy a fragrance inspired by the rockets used in Hamas' recent conflict with Israel. Although the conflict resulted in the deaths of many more Palestinians than Israelis, Hamas' leader Khaled Meshaal claimed victory for his organization, saying Hamas had forced Israel to accept their terms. The M75 was one of the long-range missiles militants in Gaza fired at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem during the conflict last month, which ended after eight days with a cease-fire on November 21. "M75 in Gaza means a period of happiness, or the feeling of victory, and the use of the perfume is an expression of happiness as well." "We have a marketing slogan which is 'Whoever loves victory, happiness and dignity, loves the M75 perfume,'" the company's marketing director, who wished to be identified only as Shadi, told CNN at the Stay Stylish store in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood.
