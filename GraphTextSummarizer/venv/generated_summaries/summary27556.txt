To fight our way through this may well require ideas from much wider sources -- perhaps from systems architects and evolutionary psychologists, or from researchers dreaming up new energy sources or philosophers or activists questioning our basic priorities. TED was founded in 1984 by information architect Richard Saul Wurman and his partners. I showed up at TED for the first time 11 years ago and was exhilarated to find myself among people turned on by cool ideas. Certainly, CNN's partnership is a big step forward for us, giving TED exposure to a vast global audience hungry for knowledge that matters. The first TED showcased the brand-new Apple Macintosh and strange round silver shiny discs, the first CDs.
