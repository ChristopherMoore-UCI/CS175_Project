-- Six months after an earthquake devastated Haiti, a United Nations representative on the ground there says many challenges still lie ahead in the aftermath of the "worst living disaster." Nigel Fisher, the deputy special representative for the stabilization mission in Haiti, told the U.N. press via video-conference Monday that progress has been made in rehabilitating the country, but that the nation still faces many problems. Six months later, more than 1.5 million remain in overcrowded displacement camps, and Fisher does not anticipate the number in camps to reduce soon. "It is important to remember what Haiti was and what Port-au-Prince was before the earthquake: two-thirds of the population was living in poverty, many lacked access to clean water and were living in slums," Fisher said. "There has been no epidemic of cholera or measles," Fisher stated, because access to clean water and free medical facilities have reduced chances of an outbreak. But with a focus more on urban reconstruction and the development of a closer link between government and education, Fisher said Haiti could become a better nation than it was before the earthquake.
