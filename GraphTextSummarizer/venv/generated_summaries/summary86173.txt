Spending time with Bob Weir poolside The upcoming tour will feature mostly "Grateful Dead classics -- the things people like to hear," he says, so expect performances of "Truckin'," "Casey Jones," perhaps the band's sole Top 10 hit, "Touch of Grey," and maybe even the Holy Grail of Dead jams, "Dark Star." Just as they did on their last outing, Lesh, guitarist Bob Weir and drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann will perform under the shortened moniker The Dead. Bob Weir and Phil Lesh will be taking part in The Dead's April-May tour. Colorful tie-dyes and painted buses are never out of style All The Dead's members are in their 60s, with Lesh the elder statesman at 68. Lesh hopes they'll make a guest appearance when The Dead hits their town -- if it doesn't interfere with their finals.
