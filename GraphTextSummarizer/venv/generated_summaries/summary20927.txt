The bodies have not yet been identified, said Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson. Asked whether Towns owned a Mustang like the one the Runions were looking for, Steverson replied, "He does not. " Earlier Monday, the suspect sought in the case who had posted a Craigslist ad turned himself in, the Telfair County Sheriff's Office said on its Facebook page. For days, authorities searched for the couple using helicopters and watercraft, Steverson said. Two bodies, one male and one female, were recovered Monday in the case of a Marietta, Georgia, couple, who went missing after contacting a car seller on Craigslist.
