-- Three people are dead, including a gunman who opened fire in a courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware, Monday morning, Delaware State Police said. The officers who survived the shooting were treated and released from a hospital, police chief William Jopp said. The shooting came on the day the police chief of Wilmington was in Philadelphia to attend a roundtable discussion about gun safety. The courthouse was evacuated and police did a floor-by-floor search of the 12-story building to make sure there was only the single gunman and there were no more threats, Shavack said. Biden, who served as a senator from Delaware for many years, acknowledged Monday's shooting.
