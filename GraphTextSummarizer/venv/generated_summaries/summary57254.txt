Williamson sought the help of the court because Holocaust denial is punishable in Germany only if it is publicized there. -- A German court Monday refused to intervene in the case of Bishop Richard Williamson, who is facing prosecution for denying the Holocaust -- a crime in Germany. Williamson hit the headlines last month when he and three other ultra-conservative bishops were welcomed back into the Roman Catholic Church, more than 20 years after Pope John Paul II excommunicated them on a theological question unrelated to the Holocaust. Williamson asked the court to order Swedish Public Television to restrict broadcast of an interview in which he doubts the existence of Nazi gas chambers and a systematic Nazi plan to annihilate European Jewry. He has also said he did not know of Williamson's views on the Holocaust when he lifted the excommunication.
