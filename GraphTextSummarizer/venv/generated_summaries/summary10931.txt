-- Thousands of residents of the southeastern Spanish city of Lorca slept outside Wednesday night, hours after the city of about 80,000 was struck by an earthquake that killed eight people, state radio reported, citing authorities. At least one of the deaths occurred in a building collapse in Lorca, state-run EFE said. "It was a strange sensation," said a press office worker who was in his office in the regional capital of Murcia, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from Lorca. Television pictures showed the belfry of an old church collapsing soon after the earthquake, as well as fallen bricks on top of damaged cars there. Many of those who were spending the night outside said they were afraid to return to their houses or had been advised not to do so, state radio said.
