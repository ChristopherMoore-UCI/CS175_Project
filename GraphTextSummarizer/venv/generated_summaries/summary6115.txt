-- Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher will reach the 300-race milestone when he competes in this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix at Spa Francorchamps. Schumacher's first appearance in F1 came at Spa in 1991 for Jordan before he moved to Benetton to win successive titles in 1994 and 1995. "It's uncanny how I always seem to have special moments there -- my debut, my first win, a world championship victory and many great races. Barrichello made 326 Grand Prix appearances before retiring at the end of 2011. "We delivered a good performance in Spa last year; I'll be doing everything possible to drive a strong race," he added.
