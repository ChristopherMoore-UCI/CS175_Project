Authorities say they believe the woman has held up banks in the Connecticut towns of Middletown, Montville, East Hartford and Windsor, as well as banks in West Springfield, Massachusetts and Westerly, Rhode Island. The one-woman crime wave in New England apparently began September 21 at the Citizens Bank in Montville, Connecticut. Women commit 6.2 percent of bank robberies nationwide, up from 4.9 percent in 2002, according to recent FBI figures. Four days later, a woman entered a branch of the New Alliance Bank in East Hartford, Connecticut. The 34-year-old resident of Norwich, Connecticut, will be formally charged with robbery in the first degree, police said.
