Meyers' first week of guests sets the stage for that kind of high-low mix: the first two guests on "Late Night" will be his old "SNL" co-star Amy Poehler, along with Vice President Joe Biden. On the surface, that tendency to hang back would make Meyers appear to be an ill fit for "Late Night," whose most recent host liked to slow jam the news, throw down in lip-sync battles and play beer hockey with guests. At 12:35 a.m., the 40-year-old "Saturday Night Live" star will step behind the desk of "Late Night" and occupy a chair once filled by David Letterman, Conan O'Brien and, directly before him, his pal and fellow "Saturday Night Live" alum Fallon. Tweaking the type of guests "Late Night" viewers are used to seeing is the kind of risk that Meyers' "Late Night" producer and champion, Lorne Michaels, wants to see. But Meyers also wants to use his writing staff as a sort of communal sidekick that would allow him to do the kind of interviews with fictional characters fans remember from "SNL."
