Mexican authorities have detained Servando Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug cartel, federal police told CNN En Espa√±ol on Friday. The Knights Templar drug organization has operated for years in Michoacan, in central-western Mexico. Authorities in Mexico said last year that the presence of Mexican troops had weakened the Knights Templar. Gomez was detained early Friday in Morelia, the capital of the state of Michoacan, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) west of Mexico City, authorities said. Michoacan has long been a flashpoint in Mexico's drug war.
