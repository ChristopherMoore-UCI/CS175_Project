"The best way to continue working on these requirements is not by way of pressure or to seize and occupy public offices," said Carlos Romero, minister of government. The hunger strike, started by 60 spouses, began this week and was being held in La Paz and other cities. Friday, protesters raided police intelligence offices, seizing computers and burning investigation documents. Protesting police are in charge of controlling the massive demonstrations that occur frequently in La Paz. Government officials appealed for peaceful negotiations.
