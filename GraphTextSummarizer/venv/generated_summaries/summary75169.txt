Pressure grew on FIFA to act after widespread reports that harm had come to head coach Kim Jong Hun and his squad after they suffered three defeats at the finals in South Africa in June. In a letter, the Korean federation claimed that Kim Jong Hun and his team are "training as usual" and would be taking part in the 16th Asian Games. -- FIFA says it won't be punishing the North Korean football federation over allegations that its players and coaches were publicly humiliated following their World Cup exit. It also responded that the election of its president had been held in "accordance with the statutes of the association" and came after a good performance against Brazil in their opening match in South Africa. North Korea's first appearance at the World Cup finals since 1966 began with some promise after they went down to a narrow 2-1 defeat to the Brazilians, who scored a late winner.
