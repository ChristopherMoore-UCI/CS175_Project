Responding to reports that snowy owls were being killed with shotgun blasts, New York airport officials are initiating a program to trap and relocate birds seen as a threat to air safety. It's illegal to possess or release migratory game birds and upland game birds without the proper license from the Department of Environmental Conservation. In the last two weeks, five planes in New York airports were struck by snowy owls that have been migrating to the region in "far higher than typical numbers," according to a statement from the Port Authority. "DEC and the Port Authority are working together closely to quickly develop a process to trap and relocate snowy owls that pose a threat to aircraft," the Department of Environmental Conservation said in statement. The Port Authority of New York & New Jersey said in a statement Monday that it would be work with the state Department of Environmental Conservation to implement the program.
