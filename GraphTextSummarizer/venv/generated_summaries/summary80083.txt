Once upon a time a man with such evident racial prejudices would probably have owned slaves and used racial epithets publicly, with complete impunity. In fact, 21st-century American racism looks and sounds precisely like the alleged Mel Gibson recording. By analogy, we need to understand the profound metamorphosis of American racism and construct new "weaponry" to combat it. Americans, so anxious to believe that we have entered into a "post-racial era," tend to ignore the one element needed to corroborate such a conclusion: a lack of racial animus. -- Actor and director Mel Gibson appears to be at it again.
