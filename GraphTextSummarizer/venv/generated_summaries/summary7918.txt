During an interview conducted at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and posted on IndieWire, Mel Gibson said he can sympathize with LaBeouf who was recently arrested after on outburst in New York City. But Gibson holds out hope for LaBeouf who recently announced he was receiving treatment for alcohol addiction. "When I see someone like Shia LaBeouf with the bag on his head and stuff, my heart goes out to the poor guy," Gibson said, referencing an appearance the actor once made on the red carpet with a paper bag covering his face. " Gibson -- who was at the festival in the Czech Republic to receive a lifetime achievement award -- knows a thing or two about run-ins with the law and being labeled "troubled." " "People are in line to sort of point the finger at him and say that he's this, that, or the other," Gibson said.
