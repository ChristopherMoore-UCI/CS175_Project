-- Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou will meet Monday with the leader of the country's main opposition party to discuss who will become the nation's next prime minister -- a day after an announcement that Papandreou he will step down amid the country's financial crisis. It also paves the way for passage of an agreement that Papandreou negotiated October 26 with European leaders. On Monday -- in addition to a meeting between Papandreou and Samaras -- the Greek president will hold another meeting open to heads of all Greece's political parties. Economists worry that a Greek default on its debt could pull down larger European economies -- particularly those of Italy and Spain, as well as struggling Portugal and Ireland. The deal would wipe out 100 billion euros in Greek debt, half of what it owes to private creditors, and includes a promise of 30 billion euros to help the public sector pare its debts -- making the whole package worth a total of 130 billion euros ($178 billion).
