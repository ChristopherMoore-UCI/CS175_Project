The search for extraterrestrial life and expeditions to hunt for life in Earth's extremes -- from the bottom of the oceans and Antarctica's extremes -- seem like luxuries for excitable explorers and space scientists.

But it is only recently that the search for extraterrestrial life has been underpinned by experiments -- telescopes to search for Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, rovers, like NASA's Curiosity, to hunt for life on Mars. By exploring the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and beyond we learn things of practical benefit to living on Earth and settling space. Instead, we are confronted by a future with a single challenge -- build sustainable human settlements in the cosmos, whether on Earth or in space.
