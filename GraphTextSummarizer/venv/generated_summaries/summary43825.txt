A Dallas Police spokeswoman said earlier in the week that they wanted to press charges against Badu because children were present, but no one had called police or filed a complaint that day. A citation of misdemeanor disorderly conduct has been mailed to Badu, who is a Dallas resident, police said. She did post a series of short messages on the social networking site Twitter last weekend, soon after the "Window Seat" video was released on her Web site. The singer shed her clothes as she walked through Dealey Plaza until she was nude and then fell near where President John F. Kennedy was assassinated. If convicted, Badu could be fined $500, police said.
