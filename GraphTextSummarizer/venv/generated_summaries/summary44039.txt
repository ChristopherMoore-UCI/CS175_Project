Chavez's goal can be described as a three-point strategy, Lauria said: to control the flow of information, stop critical reports and disseminate pro-government propaganda. The shuttering of the radio and television stations and media crimes law are part of a larger strategy that Chavez has followed since he was briefly deposed in a coup in 2002, he said. A group of pro-Hugo Chavez rioters beats Venezuelan journalists in downtown Caracas on August 13. The recent closure of 32 privately owned radio stations and a proposed law to punish "media crimes" are signs that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is moving to quash criticism of his government, according to a recent U.S. intelligence report. The intelligence report coincides with numerous critical statements against Chavez by press freedom organizations.
