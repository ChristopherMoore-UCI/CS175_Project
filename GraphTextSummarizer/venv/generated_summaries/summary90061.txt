Those opponents say the state has effectively been funneling taxpayer money to religious schools through a third-party "front" group. Supporters of the Arizona aid program say theirs is no different from the Cleveland program approved eight years ago, because in both cases, government does not direct any money to religious schools. An Arizona Republic newspaper investigation found that of the $54 million in scholarships awarded in 2008, 93 percent went to students attending religious schools. " "It's a great leap to say that it's government funds, that any money the government doesn't take from me because it gives me a deduction, is government money," said Justice Antonin Scalia. The growing popularity of school choice plans around the country has raised fresh legal questions about whether Arizona's plan is religion-neutral, and whether parents have true decision-making power, free from government intervention.
