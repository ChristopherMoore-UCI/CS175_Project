The video site's supporters see the 15-camera project as a stride forward in U.S. efforts to halt illegal immigration, drug smuggling and border violence. Run by the Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition, an association of 20 sheriffs from border counties, the project seeks to spread responsibility for the border's security across the nation's masses of Internet users. But critics say the program tempts extremists to become involved in border security, which they say is a job better left to trained professionals.

A Texas program lets Internet users around the world monitor live video from the Mexico border.
