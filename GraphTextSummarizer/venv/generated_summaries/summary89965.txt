What do you think of colorful wedding dresses? "I tried on a heap of dresses in all kinds of colors, wanting something that still stood out and said 'bride' -- or at least, 'dressiest person there,'" said Scutts. Scutts says her wedding planning, as well as her dress, was definitely rooted in both her and her husband's "feminist resistance to much of wedding tradition." In many non-Western cultures, including Southeast Asia and India, weddings are often opulent affairs draped with multicolored fabrics. "We've seen a lot of brides throw the wedding rules, as we know them, out." Sewall says BHLDN brides have embraced color in a less dramatic sense; vintage crÃ¨me, nude tones and very pale pink are all popular choices.
