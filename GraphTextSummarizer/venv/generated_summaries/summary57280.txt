Last year, the USDA designated 2,245 counties in 39 states, or 71 percent of the United States, as disaster areas due to drought. "As drought persists, USDA will continue to partner with producers to see them through longer-term recovery, while taking the swift actions needed to help farmers and ranchers prepare their land and operations for the upcoming planting season," Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. The U.S. Agriculture Department cited drought and heat on Wednesday in designating 597 counties in 14 states as primary natural disaster areas. Australians battle wildfires Wednesday's announcement comes a day after the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that 2012 had been the hottest year on record for the continental United States and the second-worst for "extreme" weather such as hurricanes, droughts or floods. Affected counties have suffered severe drought for eight consecutive weeks, which qualified them for the automatic designation.
