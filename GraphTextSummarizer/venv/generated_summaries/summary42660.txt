But he adds it appears that Adif officials did not adequately mitigate all the predictable scenarios of human error by the driver. Judge Luis Alaez Legeren wrote that five Adif officials in charge of track and signal security, along with the current and two former Adif presidents, will face preliminary charges because there was no safety system that would have compensated for any human error by the train driver. The judge investigating the train crash that killed 79 people last July is expanding the preliminary charges to include numerous top officials of the state railway infrastructure company, Adif, for alleged negligence, a Tuesday court order shows. News media reported that part of the conversation in the days after the crash, citing officials, who blamed excessive speed for the crash. An Adif spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment about the judge's order, and company lawyers were studying it.
