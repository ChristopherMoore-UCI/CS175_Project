"He is thinking cuz sure can't talk," one day care manager from Heavenly Haven Learning Center 2 wrote, according to CNN affiliate WAVY. -- Two Virginia day care workers have been fired after photos of children in their care showed up on Instagram -- along with comments making fun of them. Speaking Tuesday to CNN's "New Day," she had a message for the day care workers: "If you don't genuinely love and care for children, and if it's not a passion of yours, this isn't something that you should be involved in. Asked how she would feel if the workers involved said it was a misunderstanding and that they were just trying to be funny, Jordan told CNN, "maybe I would be a little bit more understanding, like OK, it was an inappropriate joke." Melissa Jordan says the photo shows her son, Ethan.
