Or that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change now says that if we want to stay below a 2-degree Celsius (3.6-degree Fahrenheit) increase in average global temperature, we can't emit any more carbon dioxide than what's released by burning 1 trillion tons of carbon. Third, we can use incentives such as carbon taxes and moral persuasion to bring down energy consumption. The average U.S. driver clocks 12,000 miles per year, pushing six tons of carbon out of his auto's tailpipe. Every mile we drive, ours cars emit about a pound of carbon dioxide. We know how to capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks (though not from all those cars).
