-- It was a year ago this month that British singer Amy Winehouse died of alcohol poisoning at 27. The last album particularly took a lot out of her emotionally, every song was autobiographical, dragged from her soul, and I wouldn't want her to have made more albums like that because she would have been in constant turmoil. It is a bracingly honest account of Amy's problems with heroin, alcohol and men. Mitch Winehouse: First of all, I felt that the book would help me with my recovery, and then there were lots of misconceptions about Amy after she passed away, so I wanted to set the record straight. I'm pleased that she didn't write more albums like that actually.
