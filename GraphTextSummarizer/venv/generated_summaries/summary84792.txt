So, in a way, I'm going back to first grade in Catholic school. My excuse always has been that Catholics have their Bible passages read to them at Mass every Sunday. Later, when I graduated, my grandparents gave me a beautiful Bible that has traveled with me from Vermont to Montreal to Atlanta and finally to Washington. Another friend's daughter is making her first Holy Communion in May, and  has also offered to connect us because her class is reading the Bible in school. In that newsroom conversation this week, Daniel Burke, the religion editor at CNN.com, suggested I read the Bible each day for a year and chronicle it weekly for Belief.
