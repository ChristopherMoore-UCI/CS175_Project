" "This is indeed a sad day for Wayne Community College and this close family and community," school President Kay Albertson said. All buildings have been cleared, Maj. Tom Effler of the Wayne County Sheriff's Office said. The suspected gunman, identified by law enforcement as 20-year-old Kenneth Morgan Stancil III, worked at one time for the victim and is a former student at the school. While authorities were clearing out rooms, they deployed tear gas into a restroom someone was in, Effler said. A gunman walked into a building on the campus of Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina, on Monday and shot the school's print shop operator, killing him, authorities said.
