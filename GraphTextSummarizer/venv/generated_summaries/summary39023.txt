Iniesta broke Emilio Butragueno's record of 50 La Liga matches without defeat during the course of last season but he was on the losing side in game 56 as Ronaldo's Real won 1-0 at the Camp Nou in April to clinch the La Liga crown. Iniesta received his trophy from UEFA president Michel Platini at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco where earlier the Champions League draw had been made. He has won every honor in the game in a glittering career, scoring the extra time goal as Spain beat the Netherlands 1-0 in the 2010 World Cup final in South Africa. Andres Iniesta pipped Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi and Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo to win the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award Thursday. Argentina ace Messi won the first edition of the new award which is the brainchild of former French international star Platini.
