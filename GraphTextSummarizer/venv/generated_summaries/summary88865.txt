Cerza came up with the "bobbing for burgers," event after a trip to Wal-Mart. "I saw kiddie pools on sale, and ketchup one row over," Cerza said. The country's first deep-fried cheeseburger is making its debut among at least 30 other varieties of hamburgers served by 15 different vendors at the National Hamburger Festival in Akron, Ohio, this weekend. Still, he says, with hamburger chains White Castle and Wendy's beginning in the state, it's tough to deny that "Ohio is a hamburger state." This year's two-day festival includes live performances from a Jimmy Buffett cover band, a beauty pageant and, likely the messiest event of the weekend, bobbing for burgers in a pool full of ketchup.
