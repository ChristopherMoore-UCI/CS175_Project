-- About 150 pro-Fatah Palestinians seeking refuge from a Hamas crackdown in eastern Gaza City were allowed into Israel on Saturday, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN. Hamas forces took control of the al-Shojaeya neighborhood in eastern Gaza City late Saturday, ending several hours of deadly fighting. They were let in at the request of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas after Hamas took control of a neighborhood in eastern Gaza City on Saturday. Fatah members are led handcuffed and blindfolded through a Gaza City checkpoint into Israel on Saturday. Hamas sources said Saturday the group will release 10 Fatah members arrested earlier in Gaza.
