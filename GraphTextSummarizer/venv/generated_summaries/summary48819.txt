-- Farrah Fawcett, the actress known worldwide for her beauty and her role on "Charlie's Angels," is reportedly seriously ill and may be close to death after a long battle with cancer. Farrah Fawcett, seen here in 2004, is featured in a documentary about her fight with cancer. I know how, you know, devastating the press, you know, was with Aaron when he had cancer. I think the one that Aaron really decided he was really going to use her was this American beauty pageant and, also, it was like "Murder on Flight 502." On Thursday, Larry King talked with Candy Spelling, a close friend of Fawcett.
