Turkey is a NATO ally, a candidate for membership in the European Union, a front-line state facing Iran, Syria and Russia -- and it is heading seriously in the wrong direction. Europe had Christian Democratic parties; why couldn't Turkey have a Muslim Democratic party? Turkey's Twitter-banning prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, came to power after a big election win in 2002. At the same time, the Erdogan government did initiate important economic liberation of Turkey's traditionally state-led economy. All the bad impulses that imposed that Twitter ban remain in place -- and will remain so long as Erdogan remains in office.
