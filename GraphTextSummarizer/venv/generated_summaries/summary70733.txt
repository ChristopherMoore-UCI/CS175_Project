Oprah Winfrey took to Twitter last night to ask Nielsen viewers to watch her cable network OWN, drawing criticism from some followers and investigative scrutiny from the ratings measurement company. "In accordance with our policies and procedures, Nielsen is reviewing this incident with our clients and we may withhold, breakout and/or make a note in the ratings," a Nielsen rep told EW.com. Oprah Winfrey released this statement: "I removed the tweet at the request of Nielsen. She later added, "Commercial Grammy people..u can turn to OWN." "We take any violation of our policy seriously and will work with clients to resolve the situation." Of course, given that 39.9 million people watched the Grammys last night, with CBS crushing rivals, a more effective punishment might be releasing OWN's ratings instead of holding them back.
