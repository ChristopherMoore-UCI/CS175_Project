"Mr. Donilon and the ECOWAS delegation reaffirmed their shared commitment to see that the winner of the recent elections, Alassane Ouattara, takes his rightful role as President of Cote d'Ivoire, and their shared resolve to see former President Laurent Gbagbo cede power," the statement said. "An in-depth investigation into violations in the commercial capital, Abidjan, revealed an often-organized campaign of violence targeting members of opposition political parties, ethnic groups from northern Cote d'Ivoire, Muslims and immigrants from neighboring West African countries," Human Rights Watch said. "Following reports of rapes in Cote d'Ivoire, I condemn in the strongest possible terms the employment of sexual violence as a means to political ends," said Margot Wallstrom, a special U.N. representative on sexual violence in conflict. -- A United Nations representative has condemned sexual violence in the Ivory Coast as the White House met with leaders urging the nation's incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo to give up power. "I would also like to recall that the Security Council last December reiterated their readiness to consider patterns of sexual violence when imposing sanctions against parties."
