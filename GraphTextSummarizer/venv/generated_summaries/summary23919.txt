Federer 80-up Later on Sunday Roger Federer won his sixth Cincinnati Open, and an incredible 80th career title, after beating Spain's David Ferrer 6-3, 1-6. -- World number one Serena Williams won her first ever Cincinnati Open, and her 62nd career WTA title, by brushing aside Ana Ivanovic 6-4, 6-1. " Poor season It has, by her own high standards, been a below par season for Williams. "It was such a great week," Williams said after the victory, before praising Ivanovic's performance. And whilst her five titles this year -- in Miami, Brisbane, Stanford, Rome and now Cincinnati -- could be considered a good eight month's work for almost any other player, Williams is held, both by herself and her peers, to a higher standard.
