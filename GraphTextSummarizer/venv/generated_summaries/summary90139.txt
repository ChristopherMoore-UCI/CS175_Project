Holder has forcefully ended the practice of allowing guns "to walk" in the hands of illegal purchasers with the intent of tracking weapons to cartels. The ATF's planned sting operation to track weapons illegally purchased by straw purchasers bound for a Mexico drug cartel proved disastrous when ATF agents lost track of hundreds of weapons after they crossed the Mexican border. -- ATF Deputy Director William Hoover has resigned, just days after a congressional report on Operation Fast and Furious sharply criticized him and four other ATF officials for the botched gun-trafficking operation. Hoover and his boss, Ken Melson, who was acting director of the ATF at the time, were re-assigned last year in a shake-up ordered by Attorney General Eric Holder. The controversy over Fast and Furious erupted after two of an estimated 1,400 missing weapons lost by the ATF in Mexico, were discovered at the scene of the murder of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.
