On Sunday, 66-year-old hijacking suspect Pena Soltren surrendered to federal authorities at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, the same airport from which Hopkins' flight was commandeered. Former flight engineer George Hopkins says he remembers vividly being hijacked to Cuba in 1968. Pena Soltren is one of the men accused of hijacking Pan Am Flight 281 on November 24, 1968, and taking it to Cuba. The suspect had remained hidden in Cuba for decades, and Hopkins' memories of the ordeal had receded. Hopkins, a former flight engineer, got the call Monday from a friend and former Pan Am pilot, a day after the surrender of Luis Armando Pena Soltren.
