In fact, if women farmers were on the same playing field as their male counterparts, the FAO says the number of hungry people in the world would be reduced by up to 17%. According to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), women farmers typically have less land to farm and probably don't own that land. For nearly 70 years, Heifer International has been working with small farming communities to raise productivity and create a surplus that can be sold or provided to other hungry people. Even though they are as equally capable as male farmers, these women face challenges that cause them to grow less food. Not surprisingly, about 98% of hungry people live in developing countries and the crisis will likely get worse.
