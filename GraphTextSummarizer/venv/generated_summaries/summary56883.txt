Feldman's opinion also properly expressed concern that the livelihoods of many Gulf residents depend on continued oil production. With a moratorium in place, oil companies have enormous incentives to identify a sound set of contingencies for the kind of accident we have seen that would reduce the flow of oil long before a relief well can be dug. Consequently, we have witnessed two months of BP foundering from one ad hoc scheme to another while millions of gallons of oil pour into the Gulf. The reality is that drilling for oil in the Gulf is more dangerous than we thought, and more precautions are in order before proceeding. One-third of domestic oil production comes from the Gulf, and comes from increasingly deep waters.
