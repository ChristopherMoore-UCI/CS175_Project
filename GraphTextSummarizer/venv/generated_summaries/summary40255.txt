I had started flying into Ohio's capital city from where I lived in San Francisco because it was cheaper than flying into Dayton, my true hometown, some 75 miles to the west, where my father lie battling pancreatic cancer. The middle of Ohio didn't turn out to be my escape, but it was the beginning of a new kind of life. I had flittered all over the Golden State before finally landing in San Francisco, a city that quickly enchanted me with its fog and food. And the snob I had become said I would be through with drama of relationships because there couldn't possibly be anyone that could hold my interest or steal my heart in central Ohio. I took the plunge: I did quit my job and move to Columbus a few months after that summer morning.
