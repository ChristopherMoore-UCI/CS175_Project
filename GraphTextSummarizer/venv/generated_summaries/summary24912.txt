In the Playboy interview, Oldman gives his unfiltered opinion on political correctness and how it's impacted controversial actors like Alec Baldwin and Mel Gibson, the latter of whom has used anti-Semitic language in the past. Gary Oldman apologizes for remarks "I said some things that were poorly considered," a subdued Oldman told Kimmel. "Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him -- and doesn't need to feed him anymore because he's got enough dough," Oldman told the magazine. And on "Jimmy Kimmel Live," Oldman took the extra step to also apologize to his fans. Oldman also thanked Kimmel for giving him the opportunity to appear on the show and speak his piece, to which Kimmel replied, "I'm so happy that someone has to apologize on this show, and it's not me for once."
