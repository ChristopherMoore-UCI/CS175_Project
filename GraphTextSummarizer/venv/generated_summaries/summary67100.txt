Panetta's statement follows news this week that Iraq's top political leadership agreed that a number of American troops should remain in the country to aid in training and security, though said it was "unnecessary" to grant U.S. forces legal immunity. The defense secretary said negotiations were ongoing between Iraq's political leadership, U.S. Ambassador James F. Jeffrey and Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, commander of U.S. forces in Iraq. The prospect of U.S. troops staying beyond the end of the year sits uncomfortably with many Iraqis, who have routinely questioned American motives following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein. -- The U.S. Secretary of Defense says any agreement reached that keeps American troops in Iraq past an end-of-the-year deadline to withdraw must include immunity from Iraqi prosecution. Panetta made the comments while answering a question from a sailor, who inquired about Iraq refusing to grant legal immunity to American forces and what it might mean for the future role of the U.S. military in Iraq.
