Until then, the prime purpose of anti-monopoly laws was to protect citizens against concentration of political power. Amazon made clear it wanted to continue to set prices for Macmillan's books, as it does for most books it sells.

And Wal-Mart is a goliath that has repeatedly used its dominant position to influence the content of products by refusing to sell certain books or music.
