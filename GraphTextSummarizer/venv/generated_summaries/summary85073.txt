Twenty-five Marines have died in motorcycle crashes since November -- all but one of them involving sport bikes that can reach speeds of well over 100 mph, according to Marine officials. Any Marine caught riding, even on leave, without going through the training courses faces Marine Corps punishment, officials say. " Amos said he and other top Marine officials will spend half the day Monday "focusing on nothing but motorcycle issues." More recently, it added a second training course specifically designed to train Marines who ride sport bikes. The rise in motorcycle deaths isn't confined to Marines.
