The Funny River Fire began burning Monday evening and was 20% contained by early Saturday, Alaska's Interagency Incident Management Team said. -- A days-long wildfire had covered more than 78,000 acres of Alaska's Kenai National Wildlife Refuge by early Saturday, a state agency said. Kenai Peninsula Borough Spokesman Brad Nelson said there are two subdivisions in the area of the fire. Investigators suspect human action was the cause, but this is still under investigation. Officials say access to the fire is difficult.
