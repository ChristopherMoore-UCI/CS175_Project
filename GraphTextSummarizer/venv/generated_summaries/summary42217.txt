I have seen the runny noses and tired eyes of a kid getting picked up from day care after a nine-hour day. There were days I gave a dose of Tylenol and crossed my fingers that the tail end of a fever wouldn't come back at school. Tears would run down my cheeks each time I watched my daughter bravely march into a new school and again at the end of the day when my son would squeal and run to me after a nine-hour stretch at day care. Aside from being a little too broke in the very beginning to afford an SUV or a Gymboree membership, my early mommy years were just as I hoped they would be. I had worked in day care centers.
