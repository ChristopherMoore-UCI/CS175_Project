"Although the group's early years were more heavy-metal-based, they were one of the first bands to incorporate a more alternative and ethereal sound into their thunderous and visceral music, blazing a trail that newer bands continue to follow today," Portnow said. -- Deftones bass guitarist Chi Cheng died Sunday morning, five years after a car crash left him in a coma, his mother announced. " Cheng and his group won a Grammy for best metal performance in 2001. "I know that you will always remember him as a giant of a man on stage with a heart for every one of you," Mom J wrote.
