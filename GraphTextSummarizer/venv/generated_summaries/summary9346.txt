Saturday marked Gabor's 24th wedding anniversary with Von Anhalt, her eighth husband. She has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. Gabor, 93, is suffering complications from last month's hip-replacement surgery, but she and her husband decided against additional surgery, publicist John Blanchette said. "The doctors did everything they could do," her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, said. She underwent surgery for the removal of a blood clot that night, a complication relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, he said.
