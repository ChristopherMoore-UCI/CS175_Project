Gary Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after his traveling companion Robyn Gardner was last seen on a beach on the Caribbean Island. "Gary Giordano defense attorney's request for release has been denied," said Ann Angela from the Aruban prosecutor's office. -- A man detained in the disappearance of a Maryland woman during a vacation in Aruba will remain behind bars at least until the end of October, Aruban prosecutors said Monday. On Friday, Giordano hired a new lead defense attorney, Chris Lejuez, who spent two days in lengthy meetings with Giordano at the prison in Aruba where he is confined. Giordano has maintained that he had been snorkeling with Gardner, when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office.
