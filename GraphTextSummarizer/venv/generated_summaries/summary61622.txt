The White House pushed back, with spokesman Jay Carney saying that "this administration takes all appropriate and necessary steps to prevent leaks of classified information or sensitive information that could risk ongoing counterterrorism or intelligence operations. " Other recent possible leaks of classified information included details on the administration's efforts to expand its drone program and President Barack Obama's involvement in "kill lists" against militants in Yemen and Pakistan. Congressional leaders agreed Thursday on the need for a full investigation of what one called a recent "cascade" of leaked classified information but differed on exactly how the inquiry should be conducted. Clapper and "every member of the leadership team in the intelligence community" are angry about the series of leaks, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, the ranking Republican on the Senate panel, said after Thursday's meeting. While the cyberwarfare report brought this week's public condemnation, the issue touches on a longstanding dispute between Congress and the federal government over intelligence information.
