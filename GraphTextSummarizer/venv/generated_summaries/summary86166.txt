But Benitez, whose side sit fourth and five points off leaders Manchester United, insists the hostile welcome did not bother him. The former Liverpool manager replaced Roberto Di Matteo after the Italian was sacked by owner Roman Abramovich last week. The Spaniard, who coached his side to a goalless draw with Manchester City, was subjected to chants and taunts throughout the game by home supporters. But manager Roberto Mancini felt his side should have done better, especially after Sergio Aguero missed a glorious opportunity early on. Jermain Defoe scored twice and Gareth Bale was also on target with Andy Carroll breaking his 15-game drought for the visitors.
