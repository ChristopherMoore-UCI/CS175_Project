Alaska election officials will begin counting write-in ballots Wednesday despite a federal court challenge by the campaign of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joe Miller, state director Gail Fenumiai said. The Miller suit says, according to state election law, that a write-in vote can't be accepted if the voter did not correctly write either the full name or last name of a candidate; the voter wrote a candidate's name incorrectly, or misspelled it; or the name written on the ballot is not the name used on the candidate's certificate of candidacy. "It is clear the Miller campaign wants to exclude as many votes from being counted as possible," Murkowski campaign manager Kevin Sweeney said early Wednesday. "We believe this action to be unconstitutional and contrary to express legislative mandates." Miller is believed to be locked in a tight race with incumbent Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who ran as a write-in candidate. In last week's election, Miller received 34 percent of the vote, Democrat Scott McAdams, who conceded, collected 24 percent and 41 percent of ballots were for write-in candidates.
