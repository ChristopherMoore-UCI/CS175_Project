An autopsy on the body of Donda West, mother of hip-hop mogul Kanye West, was inconclusive pending the results of toxicology tests, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner said Tuesday. A statement issued late Monday from "Kanye West, his family and friends" thanked "everyone for the outpouring of support" and asked that in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the Kanye West Foundation, which Donda West co-founded with her son. She was pronounced dead at 8:28 p.m." A funeral for West is scheduled for November 20, a representative for Kanye West said. West retired from her post as professor and chair of the English Department at Chicago State University in 2004 to become her son's manager, according to the Kanye West Foundation Web site.
