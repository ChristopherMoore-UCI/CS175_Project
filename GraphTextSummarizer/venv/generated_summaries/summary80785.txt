Three deaths Wednesday evening in Tennessee -- two in Cumberland County and one in DeKalb County -- followed six deaths earlier in Illinois and three in Missouri. The death toll from an enormous storm system that plowed through the Midwest and spawned more tornadoes as it moved east climbed late Wednesday to 12, authorities said. Several homes were damaged or destroyed in Cumberland County, and there were reports of downed trees and power lines, according to county emergency officials. He said it resulted from warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico colliding with cool Canadian air. Trees were reported down in Marion County, which was walloped by EF5 tornadoes in the April 2011 storms that pulverized the state.
