But two of the most conservative Republicans in recent history, it is worth pointing out, have issued telling public apologies of their own. What Romney, who after disparaging 47% of Americans for being dependents has insisted there was nothing wrong in what he said, fails to understand is that presidential apologies are nothing new. The most moving of these conservative apologies was the one that Ronald Reagan made in 1988 on signing the legislation that provided $1.25 billion in reparations, along with a formal apology from the government, for the forcible relocation of 120,000 West Coast Japanese-Americans after the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Mitt Romney hates apologies. "It's a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values," Romney declared.
