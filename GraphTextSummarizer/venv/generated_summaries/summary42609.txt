Searchers plotted initial search areas based in part on satellite data that they said indicated the plane flew to the southern Indian Ocean. The search area will be "refined," rather than brand new, and still will be in the southern Indian Ocean, where previous underwater explorations have failed to find the aircraft, the official said. Last week, a group of independent experts -- using satellite data publicly released in May -- also said it thought the missing aircraft was in the south Indian Ocean, but approximately hundreds of miles southwest of the previous search site. -- Australian authorities most likely will announce the next search area for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on Thursday, a senior Malaysian official told CNN on condition of anonymity Wednesday. Officials with three nations deeply involved in the search -- Malaysia, China and Australia -- approved the next search zone, the senior Malaysian official said.
