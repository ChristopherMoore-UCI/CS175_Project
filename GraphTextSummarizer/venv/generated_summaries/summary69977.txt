While Victoria's Secret models are enjoying more visibility these days because of increased TV specials, Bassil doesn't believe they're at the same level of supermodels from the '80s and '90s, like Cindy Crawford and Claudia Schiffer. " "Modern Family's" Sofia Vergara nabbed the top honors and, at age 39, is the "most senior No. 1 we've had," Bassil said.

Kristen Wiig outranked Tina Fey at No. 36, while Fey dropped to No. 97.
