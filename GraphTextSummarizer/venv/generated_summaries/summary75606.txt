Fellow strugglers Wigan are now second-from-bottom after a 3-2 defeat at home to Sunderland, while Queen's Park Rangers remain rooted to the foot of the table after a 1-1 draw at West Ham United. -- Manchester City moved to within four points of neighbors and English Premier League leaders Manchester United on Saturday with a comfortable 2-0 win over Fulham at the Etihad Stadium. The Spanish midfielder opened City's account after only 95 seconds pouncing on a loose ball after Fulham keeper Mark Schwarzer could only parry Edin Dzeko's long-range effort. Silva's second came midway through the second half, this time meeting a pass from Gael Clichy before lifting the ball over Schwarzer. Aston Villa let slip a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at West Bromwich Albion.
