In September 2006, when Spyker bought the Midland F1 Racing team, it used the Spyker name as a headline sponsor: "Spyker MF1 Racing". Last week Spyker Cars announced that it was to sell some or all of its stake in Spyker Formula 1. Even if Spyker Cars sells its entire stake in the team, FIA rules state that the team must retain the Spyker F1 name Then there was the surprise sacking of the Dutch driver, Christijan Albers after he had failed to bring in promised sponsorship revenue. Spyker maintains that these teams are merely B-teams racing cars that are barely-disguised versions of the outgoing cars of their parent teams (Red Bull Racing and Honda, respectively). Spyker Cars took out a $4 million loan to keep afloat, using the "Spyker" name as collateral.
