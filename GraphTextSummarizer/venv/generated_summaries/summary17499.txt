The plane, an Airbus A330-300, landed in Hong Kong safely around 3 a.m., Malaysia Airlines said, and the 271 passengers on board have been transferred onto flights with other airlines. The scheduled return flight from Incheon to Kuala Lumpur has been canceled, Malaysia Airlines said, and passengers have been placed on other flights. Hong Kong airport said it received a call at 2:30 a.m. alerting it of the flight's urgent change of course and placed local teams on standby. The reason for the diversion of Malaysia Airlines Flight 066 was "an inoperative aircraft generator, which supplies normal electrical power," the company said. CNN's Sarita Harilela reported from Kuala Lumpur, and Jethro Mullen wrote this report from Hong Kong.
