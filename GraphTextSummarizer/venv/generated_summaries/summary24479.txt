The local economy will crank up if we pay people in Haiti to do the cleanup and to run the distribution centers. Gen. Russel Honor√©: In the first days after a disaster, people are generally scavenging for food. The role of the military is to provide a sense of order and try to keep people from becoming too excited when food and water are distributed. I think sometimes we talk security, because as a culture, we are afraid of poor people in large groups. Hospitals will be overflowing with people who have injuries, there will be infections that will need treatment.
