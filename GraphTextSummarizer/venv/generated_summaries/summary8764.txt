Organizers from FIFA and tournament sponsors have already started making mass hotel bookings for next summer, and private home owners in Brazil have responded, renting out apartments for the World Cup period, according to the Rio Times. A large percentage of those travelers are expected to be looking for alternative accommodations, such as private homes, bed and breakfasts and hostels. A studio apartment in Copacabana is being rented out at $7,000 for four weeks, while a villa is using the deposit from a booking already made for next summer to renovate the house for more such rentals. -- Travelers planning to attend the 2014 World Cup in Brazil better get cracking on their accommodation bookings. Hotel infrastructure for Brazil's most anticipated mega-event has been a concern, but the local hotel industry says it's confident it will be ready to face the onslaught of tourists.
