Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and Arizona Sen. John McCain will be among the speakers at the memorial. It crossed the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, a park named for the senator's mother and one-time family matriarch, and passed the Massachusetts State House and the home that John Kennedy lived in when he first ran for Congress in 1946. -- A bell tolled atop Boston's Faneuil Hall on Thursday as the body of Sen. Edward Kennedy passed through the streets, while mourners lined up outside his late brother's presidential library for a chance to say goodbye. Kennedy lay in repose Thursday evening after his flag-draped casket arrived at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library from the family's Hyannis Port compound on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The proposed gravesite is 95 feet south of the grave of Sen. Robert Kennedy, which is in turn just steps away from John Kennedy's burial site.
