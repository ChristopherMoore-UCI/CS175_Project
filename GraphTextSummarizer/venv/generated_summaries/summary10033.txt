But even as our eyes are drawn to the horrors being committed overseas, concern is growing in Washington that the Obama administration's strategy for defeating ISIS is falling short. The irony is that this town -- which had little or nothing to do with the vast challenge to our interests posed by either ISIS or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's murderous regime, and yet still consumed 70% of the airstrikes in our struggle against ISIS over the past months -- has been trumpeted as a key victory by the Obama administration. Last year, Obama laid out the goal of defeating ISIS, but he still has not put forward a comprehensive strategy to accomplish this goal. Despite President Barack Obama's claim in his State of the Union address or the customary boasts of Secretary of State John Kerry in London two days later, most credible reports show that ISIS is growing stronger in Syria. We have recently learned that an estimated 20,000 foreign fighters have gone to Syria and Iraq to fight with ISIS, an estimated increase of 5,000 in the past three months.
