With most people in Myanmar living on an average of $1.20 per day, the cost of drugs is unaffordable for most. Earlier this year when a deadly cyclone hit Myanmar that killed almost 100,000 people and left millions homeless, the government turned away international aid to the frustration of many organizations. The report states aid agencies may be put off by challenges Myanmar imposes such as strict constraints and difficult bureaucratic procedures. Doctors Without Borders has been providing essential healthcare services in Myanmar since 1993 and began an integrated program in 2003 to support people living with HIV/AIDS. LONDON, England  -- Almost 25,000 people will die this year of HIV/AIDS in Myanmar unless lifesaving treatment is significantly increased, according to a new report.
