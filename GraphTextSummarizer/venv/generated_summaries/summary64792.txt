This, I think, is what Americans indicated they were looking for when they elected a president in 2008 who, four years earlier, had risen to national prominence by giving a speech in which he took issue with those who would "slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states." Of course, Supreme Court justices have advantages. They do not have to stand for election and, as the chief justice wrote in his opinion read Thursday, they do not have to take a position on whether a law "embodies sound policies." Unfortunately, in today's world, partisans have adopted what amounts to a version of political fundamentalism in which giving any credence to the other side's position is a form of heresy. Even strict advocates of the separation of Church and State ought to say "Amen" to that line after Thursday's decision upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act .
