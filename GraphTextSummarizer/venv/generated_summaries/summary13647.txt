Khayri Williams-Clark, 18; Nigel Dumas, 19; and an unidentified 17-year-old minor were all charged with the murder of Abelino Mazariego, 47, the Union County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement Tuesday. "Without getting into too much detail, it was videotaped and showed amongst teenagers in town," spokesman John Holl of the Union County Prosecutor's Office told CNN. Meanwhile, a registered nurse at Overlook Hospital has been charged with theft after allegedly stealing several hundred dollars from Mazariego while he was being treated in the emergency room, the prosecutor's statement said. The Union County medical examiner determined the death was due to brain injuries sustained in the assault, the prosecutor's office said. According to investigators, Mazariego was sitting on a bench in an upscale neighborhood park area in Summit, New Jersey, when he was approached by the teenagers.
