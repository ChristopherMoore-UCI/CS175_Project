" Mary Kennedy, the estranged wife of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was found dead Wednesday in Bedford, New York, the small town north of New York City where she lived. The prominent environmental lawyer is the third of 11 children born to Ethel and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who was gunned down in 1968. David Kennedy died of a drug overdose in 1984, and Michael Kennedy was killed in a skiing accident in 1997. More than three decades later, in 1999, John F. Kennedy Jr.; his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy; and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, died when a plane he was piloting crashed in the waters off Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, five years before his younger brother.
