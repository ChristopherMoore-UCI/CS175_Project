Gowdy had also asked that Clinton turn over her server to the State Department inspector general for an independent review. In his letter to Gowdy, Kendall said the former secretary of state "chose not to keep her non-record personal emails." "Thus, there are no ... e-mails from Secretary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state on the server for any review, even if such review were appropriate or legally authorized," he wrote. State Department officials have said they will release them after they have been reviewed. In December, Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department. Clinton did not have an official government email account, so her personal server was the primary repository for her emails during her time as secretary of state.
