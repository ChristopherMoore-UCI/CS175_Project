According to Uri Tours, which specializes in North Korea travel, close to 1,000 Western tourists traveled to the country to attend the Arirang Festival last year. "More people visiting is creating a snowball effect," says Troy Collings of Young Pioneer Tours, one of a handful of travel companies that organize visits to North Korea. Koryo Tours, another of the few North Korea tour operators, estimates 1,200 to 1,500 international visitors will attend this year's event. Massive state-sponsored entertainment is a big part of the lure of North Korea's annual Arirang Festival, or "mass games," and it's drawing foreign visitors in increasing numbers. Its profile perhaps boosted by recent visits from Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt and professional bizarre human being Dennis Rodman, North Korea is gaining popularity as a travel destination; a record number of foreigners is expected to attend this year's festival.
