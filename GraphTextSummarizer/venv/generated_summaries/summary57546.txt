But this time around you're building robots for real, assembling modules that can create walking spider robots, beverage bots, or even your very own Wall-E.

"The basic hole distance in our platform is the same as the basic dimensions in Lego, both are 8 mm, so it's possible to attach Lego blocks to Makeblock parts. "Like Lego, parts can connect to each other easily and flexibly, but you don't need nuts to make the connections, since we have a clever threaded slot design." All the pieces slot together in a construction process designed to be easy and intuitive, says Wang. " Makeblock appeals to this sense of creativity, but it's not just analogous to Lego, it is Lego-compatible, says Wang.
