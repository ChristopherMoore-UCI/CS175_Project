The ICC has issued two warrants for al-Bashir's arrest for his alleged role in a five-year campaign of violence in Darfur in western Sudan. -- Arrest warrants issued for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for allegations of war crimes and genocide are illegal and should be revoked, according to two British attorneys. The International Court of Justice, based at The Hague, Netherlands, is the principal judicial arm of the United Nations to settle disputes between U.N. member nations, but it has no jurisdiction to try people for war crimes or crimes against humanity. "There is a provision in the ICC (International Criminal Court) charter that states should observe their obligations to other states in terms of immunity even where there is an indictment by the ICC," Nice told reporters late Saturday at the AU summit, held just outside the Ugandan capital of Kampala. The original warrant, the first ever issued by the court against a serving head of state, included five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture and rape.
