In a June letter to Armstrong, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, the USADA said it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were "fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Judge blasts Armstrong, tosses lawsuit against anti-doping agency Tour de France cyclist Remy Di Gregorio arrested amid doping claims CNN's David Close contributed to this report. The USADA -- a quasi-government agency recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic sports in the United States -- has accused Armstrong of using, possessing, trafficking and giving to others performance-enhancing drugs, as well as covering up doping violations. Armstrong, the judge pointed out, "has not exhausted his internal remedies, namely ... procedures in the USADA protocol."
