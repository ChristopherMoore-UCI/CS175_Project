The sleeper of great US roads, US 83 is anything but a snooze, especially if you want hundreds of miles of driving through wide-open spaces, often little changed since the last Conestoga wagon passed through. In Florida US 41 links the resort towns of the Gulf Coast before cutting due east through the heart of the Everglades to Miami. Lonely Planet: The planet's ultimate drives US 61 (1400 miles) From a start in the lake-dotted prairies just north of Minneapolis-St Paul, US 61 stays with the Mississippi River through Wisconsin, Iowa and Missouri, where it passes through Mark Twain country in Hannibal and the urban pleasures of St Louis. Often overlooked, the old national highways (with route numbers proceeded by 'US') offer some incredible north-south journeys. Although US 89 officially ends at Flagstaff, you can follow its original route south through Tucson and Saguaro National Park to Nogales and the Mexican border.
