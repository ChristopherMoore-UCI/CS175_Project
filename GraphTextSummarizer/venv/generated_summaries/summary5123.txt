"NBC's decision to add Mr. Stern to AGT will likely result in a sharp increase in explicit content, and we urge you to be mindful when considering a media buy," Tim Winter, president of the Parents Television Council, said in a letter to 91 companies that have previously bought time on the show. Stern, whose show is heard on Sirius XM Radio, was hired to replace CNN host Piers Morgan as a judge for the seventh season of the highly rated talent competition. Advertisers must have a "presumption that Mr. Stern will only continue to conduct himself in precisely the same manner as he has done for decades," the letter said. Stern's publicist pointed CNN to an online video of interviews of three unidentified women who attended a recent show taping. When Winter's group issued a statement in December calling Stern's hiring "an act of desperation for a flailing network," Stern responded with a call to Morgan's CNN show.
