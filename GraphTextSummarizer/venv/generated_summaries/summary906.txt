Today, that joke would have to be updated to add that not only can you write a book, but you can also be on reality TV show, host cable news programs, run for office again and possibly even win. Former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer -- who resigned because he was caught frequenting prostitutes -- went on to host not one, but two different shows on cable TV. Weiner later admitted to having non-sexual but "inappropriate" relationships with various women on social media. Weiner revealed he had spent more than $100,000 on polls recently to explore possibly running for office in New York City. Ney, who resigned in 2006, served more than a year in prison after pleading guilty to corruption charges in connection with the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal.
