Former NFL player suffered from brain disease Another player who showed signs of brain damage was former NFL defensive lineman Shane Dronett, who committed suicide at age 38 in 2009. During hearings by the House Judiciary Committee in October 2009, U.S. Rep. Linda Sanchez, D-California, "analogized the NFL's denial of a causal link between NFL concussion and cognitive decline to the tobacco industry's denial of the link between cigarette consumption and ill health effects," the lawsuit says. "By failing to exercise its duty to enact reasonable and prudent rules to protect players against the risks associated with repeated brain trauma, the NFL's failure to exercise its independent duty has led to the deaths of some, and brain injuries of many other former players, including plaintiffs," the lawsuit says. "This action arises from the defendants' failure to warn and protect NFL players such as plaintiffs against the long-term brain injury risks associated with football-related concussions. In addition, in a related study, the committee found that "many NFL players can be safely allowed to return to play" on the day of a concussion, if they are without symptoms and cleared by a doctor.
