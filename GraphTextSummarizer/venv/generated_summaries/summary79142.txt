Barca's 1-1 draw at Valencia meant the club's La Liga lead was trimmed to nine points by Atletico Madrid, who later beat Real Betis 1-0, but it moved the Catalans 16 points clear of third-placed Real Madrid. It lifted Milan to fourth in the table on goal difference above city rivals Internazionale. Dortmund led 2-0 in side 10 minutes but the home side leveled with two goals in four second-half minutes from midfielder Stefan Reinartz before Poland striker Robert Lewandowski struck the winner from close range just 60 seconds later. "We're coming off of a very tough match away to Madrid and that, from a physical standpoint, always wears you down," said the assistant to coach Tito Vilanova, who was absent due to his ongoing cancer treatment. Fourth-placed Malaga spurned the chance to close the gap on Real after drawing 1-1 with Real Zaragoza, but Betis stayed a point behind in fifth after Diego Costa's 61st-minute winner for Atletico.
