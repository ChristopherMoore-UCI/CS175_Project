It's amazing," Sisson said, explaining the "overwhelming and overflowing love I have for Shant√© but also for people and the hope I have in my heart that this really means progress here." Though the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama cleared the way for same-sex marriages to begin Monday in Alabama, the famously conservative chief justice of the state Supreme Court on Sunday mounted a last-ditch effort to stop the weddings, instructing probate judges not to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. He added that he had "great respect" for the legal process and said, "We will follow the rule of law in Alabama, and allow the issue of same sex marriage to be worked out through the proper legal channels." The U.S. Supreme Court said Monday it would not intervene for now, making Alabama the 37th state (plus Washington, D.C.) to permit same-sex marriages. In a statement that included a link to the U.S. Supreme Court's dissenting opinion but not the majority opinion that cleared the way for the marriages, the governor said he was disappointed "a single Federal court judge disregarded the vote of the Alabama people to define marriage as between a man and woman." The American Civil Liberties Union called Moore's order spurious and reminded Alabama's probate judges they are sworn to uphold the U.S. Constitution, which outweighs state law on this issue.
