At the AllThingsD tech event last year, Jobs boasted that Apple's corporate structure doesn't include committees, which is a common practice among big business for distributing the responsibility for strategy among key executives. " As Jobs' managerial presence dwindles, Apple is in no immediate danger, because his thinking has been ingrained into many of the company's 46,600 employees, industry analyst Tim Bajarin said in a statement. "Apple is an incredibly collaborative company," Jobs said in an onstage interview at a tech conference last year. Apple is driven by "core values," Jobs said last year, not by one man. -- Steve Jobs, who resigned as CEO of the world's largest tech company late Wednesday, is often identified as the singular face of Apple -- the man who is the energy and creative spirit behind the company.
