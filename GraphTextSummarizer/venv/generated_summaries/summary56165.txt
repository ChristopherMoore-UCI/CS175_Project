-- The leader of the hacking group LulzSec has been charged in connection with an attack on a government website in early April, Australian police officials said Wednesday. He is charged with two counts of unauthorized modification of data and one count of unauthorized access to (or modification of) restricted data. In a news release posted on their website, the Australian Federal Police said the man was a 24-year-old Internet technology professional from Point Clare, a suburb on the New South Wales coast, about 75 kilometers (46 miles) north of Sydney. On June 2, 2011, LulzSec burst onto the cybersecurity scene with a splashy exploit: It published a trove of data stolen from 1 million user accounts on Sony's website. Police didn't release the man's name, but said he worked for a company that did work for government agencies.
