U.S. officials have expressed concerns that the group is beginning to cooperate with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the Northern Africa based affiliate of the group, and another al Qaeda-linked group in Somalia, al Shabaab, to target American interests in Africa. -- Security forces killed 20 suspected members of the militant Islamic group Boko Haram in northeastern Nigeria on Sunday, an army captain said. From its base in Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria, Boko Haram has waged a violent campaign of bombings of Christian churches in Nigeria that have killed hundreds and wounded many more. The terrorist designation blocks all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction of the three individuals named, and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with, or for the benefit of, the three. The United States in June designated as terrorists three senior members of Boko Haram.
