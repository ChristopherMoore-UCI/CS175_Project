The controversies have provided even more embarrassment for race organizers, already reeling after Floyd Landis was stripped of his 2006 title for steroid use and Michael Rasmussen was kicked off while leading last year's race for lying to his team to avoid a random drug test. Duenas Nevado, of the Barloworld team, was also busted for using EPO on Wednesday, while veteran Liquigas rider Beltran was ejected last Friday after testing positive for the same substance. -- Italian climber Riccardo Ricco has become the third cyclist to be kicked out of this year's Tour de France after testing positive for the blood-booster EPO, but by far the most high profile. Riccardo Ricco is the highest-profile of the three riders so far ejected from this year's Tour de France. He follows Spanish duo Moises Duenas Nevado and Manuel Beltran in being kicked out of the race following positive drug tests.
