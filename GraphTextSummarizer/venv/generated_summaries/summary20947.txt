"The practice of contracting jobs to private companies in state-owned mines should be stopped immediately," said a statement from the secretary general of DISK, one of Turkey's largest federations of labor unions, in the wake of the Zonguldak disaster. Rescuers have found the bodies of 28 workers buried in a coal mine, authorities said Thursday, dimming hopes for two more missing days after an explosion rocked the facility in northern Turkey. "This is a mining town with a mining tradition," Taci Alkaya, the head of the mine worker's union in Zonguldak, told CNN by phone. Turkish labor unions have denounced the practice of hiring private contractors, questioning their safety standards. The miners were trapped Monday after a mysterious explosion rocked the sprawling state-owned coal mine near the Black Sea port of Zonguldak.
