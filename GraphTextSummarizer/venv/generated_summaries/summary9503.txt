Many wonder if America is falling behind as other countries are catching up fast. Designed in America, made in China Americans may be rolling out one great idea after another, but other countries are getting many of the jobs that come from its inventions. China is trying desperately to become a science and technology competitor to America, but it drove Google out of the country and its heavy-handed tactics have led to technology that mostly copies other countries' ideas. And remember, others countries are also learning from America's success. The fact that America is the birthplace of revolutionary ideas is not an accident.
