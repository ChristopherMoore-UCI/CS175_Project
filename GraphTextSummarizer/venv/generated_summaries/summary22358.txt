Hours earlier, the FBI, Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration began probing reports of "a bomb on board US Airways Flight 2596," FBI spokeswoman Lindsay Godwin said. US Airways spokeswoman Tina Swail said three crew members also had been aboard the CRJ 200 plane. But US Airways' express flights -- like the one from Dayton -- are experiencing delays as a result of the incident, airline spokeswoman Tina Swail said. The plane was preparing to land when the airport was told to hold the flight, said Courtney Mickalonis, a spokeswoman for Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority. -- A bomb threat made at an airport ticket counter in Dayton, Ohio, prompted a search of a US Airways flight that landed safely at Washington's Reagan airport Sunday, authorities said.
