"Toyota is testing not only the GX, but other SUVs simply because we want to make sure everything is right for our customers. The carmaker does not plan to suspend the sales of other vehicles it's testing, said Ririko Takeuchi, a spokeswoman. But it will suspend Lexus GX 460 sales. In its response, Toyota said its engineers conducted similar tests and found no such issues. "There has been no indication there would be any problem in the other vehicles, so, for the time being as soon as we have results of those tests, including the test of the GX, we'll be sure to make those public.
