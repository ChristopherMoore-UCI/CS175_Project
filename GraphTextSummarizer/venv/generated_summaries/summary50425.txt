"After I killed so many civilians and (North Korean) soldiers and destroyed strategic objects in the DPRK during the Korean War, I committed indelible offensive acts against the DPRK government and Korean people," Newman said, according to that report. Merrill Newman, who returned to the United States this weekend, told the Santa Cruz Sentinel in California that he was kept in a hotel room, not a jail cell, and fed traditional Korean food during his detention. For weeks, the North Korean government offered no explanation as to why they were holding Newman. When asked about the apology, Newman gave a smirk, according to the Santa Cruz Sentinel. -- An 85-year-old American man detained and later let go by North Korean authorities described his time in custody as comfortable.
