The wife of British hostage Alan Henning pleaded Saturday with ISIS to release him, describing her husband as a "peaceful, selfless man" who was only in Syria to help people in need. "When they hear this message, I implore the people of the Islamic State to see it in their hearts to release my husband, Alan Henning." Leading Muslim figures in the United Kingdom have also called for Henning's release in a video posted on YouTube in which they say that killing him isn't permitted by Islamic law. ISIS refers to itself as "the Islamic State." Alan Henning, a taxi driver from near Manchester, England, was part of a team of volunteers that traveled to Syria in December to deliver food and water to people affected by the Middle Eastern country's devastating civil war. While part of the convoy stopped at the Turkish border, Henning -- the only non-Muslim in the group -- volunteered to cross into Syria with a 10-person advance party. "Alan is a peaceful, selfless man who left his family and his job as a taxi driver in the UK to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need," she said in the statement.
