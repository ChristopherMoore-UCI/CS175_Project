The enhanced cleaning will include "thorough sanitization of all public spaces and surfaces including soft furnishing and carpets, railings, door handles and the like," Princess said, and staterooms will be cleaned more than once before the next guests board. Nearly 60 crew members and 114 passengers have reported illness on the current voyage, according to Princess Cruises. We will, of course, be refunding their cruise fare, arranging flights home, including covering change fees if air was not booked through Princess, providing hotel accommodation if necessary, and offering a 25% future cruise credit," the cruise line said. Princess is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Vessel Sanitation Program to combat what officials suspect is norovirus. The new outbreak means the ship will return to port in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Thursday, two days early, for an extensive two-day cleaning, Princess Cruises said in a statement.
