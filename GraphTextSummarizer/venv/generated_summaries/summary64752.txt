-- Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder was seen Sunday sitting with the outgoing president of the Navajo Nation as the NFL team continues taking heat for not changing its name, a term considered derogatory by many Native Americans. Seattle Times gets rid of 'Redskins,' joins tide against name Deswood Tome, a spokesman for Shelly, told CNN affiliate WJLA in Washington that Shelly was there to support a franchising agreement in which Snyder agreed to sell Navajo art and crafts at FedEx Field. Fox Sports showed Ben Shelly and his wife -- both wearing Redskins hats -- sitting next to Snyder for the Redskins vs. Cardinals game in Arizona on Sunday. Opinion: Why Redskins decision is wrong Shelly's term expires in January. The Cardinals defeated the Redskins, 30-20.
