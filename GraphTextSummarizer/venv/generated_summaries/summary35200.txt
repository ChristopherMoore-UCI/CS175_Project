"African lions are the only cats that have a strong instinct to live together," Craig said. " Non-governmental organizations ran the fairgrounds for years as a way to raise money, Craig said. The sanctuary helped rescue the lionesses at the behest of the Panamanian government and its National Environmental Authority (ANAM), said Pat Craig, executive director of the sanctuary in Keenesburg. After 14 years of undernourishment and overcrowding, Elena, Kaitlyn and Alyssa heard the roar of other rescued African lions Wednesday at their spacious new home in Colorado. One of the big cats, Elena, is named for Elena Castejon, who actively assists with animal rescues in Panama.
