In the steeplechase, with only one win from his previous four competitive attempts at the event and twenty-three others lining up with better personal times, Keino was not even expected to make the final. Keino was 24-years-old before he competed at his first Olympic Games in Tokyo in 1964 where he finished 10th and fifth in the 1,500 meters and 5,000 meters respectively. The first black African to break onto the international stage at the beginning of the 1960s, Kip Keino won two Olympic golds and was a formidable force in the sport for 12 years. He recovered to win a stunning gold in the 1,500m. Knowing that race favorite, Jim Ryun had a devastating kick in the final hundreds, Keino decided to hit the front early. -- That Africans today so dominate distance running is in part testament to the career of Kipchoge (Kip) Keino.
