-- Two New York residents have been arrested on charges of conspiring to send aid to terrorist groups in Afghanistan, New York City officials said Thursday. "The arrests of these two New York City residents, Nabi and Alsarabbi, demonstrate the spectrum of terrorism threats that the New York City Police Department must continue to guard against," said New York Police Department Commissioner Raymond Kelly in a statement. Nabi, a Pakistani national, and Alsarabbi, a naturalized U.S. citizen from Kuwait, allegedly planned to supply warm winter clothing and electronics to militants in the region to ensure their attacks can continue during harsh Afghan winters, according to the Queens County District Attorney's office. According to the complaint, Nabi admitted to engaging in a plan to provide outerwear and jackets to fighters in Afghanistan because he hates the United States, Jewish people and U.S. soldiers. From recorded conversation it was determined the money was sent to Nabi's father for "merchandise to Afghanistan," the complaint states.
