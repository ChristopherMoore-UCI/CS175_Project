Boston Police Commissioner William Evans said 55-year-old Stephen Pasceri of nearby Millbury came onto the second floor of the hospital, where the cardiovascular unit is located, and asked to speak with Dr. Michael Davidson. Pasceri's sister, Marguerite Joly, told the Boston Herald that Davidson had performed heart surgery on their mother, Marguerite Pasceri, who died in November. It doesn't make any sense," Michelle Piselli, a neighbor of Stephen Pasceri, told CNN affiliate WHDH. "Dr. Davidson was a wonderful and inspiring cardiac surgeon who devoted his career to saving lives and improving the quality of life of every patient he cared for," the hospital said in a statement. " At a new conference Wednesday, colleagues remembered Davidson as a loving father and devoted friend who played guitar in a band with other physicians.
