-- Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi is to be tried on charges of having sex with an underage prostitute and abuse of power.. Prosecutors allege that Berlusconi paid for sex with a 17-year-old nightclub dancer, Karima El Mahrough, nicknamed Ruby. Judge Cristina di Censo has ruled that Berlusconi should face trial on the two charges -- having sex with an underage prostitute, and abuse of power. Berlusconi has survived two votes of no confidence in recent months, and while his personal approval ratings have been dented, his party, the People of Freedom, still enjoys widespread support in Italy. Both he and El Mahrough, who is now 18, deny ever having had sex with one another.
