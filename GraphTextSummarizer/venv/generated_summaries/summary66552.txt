-- Princeton University will make a meningitis B vaccine available to all undergraduate students, graduate students living in dorms or the Graduate College and annexes, and other university community members with particular medical conditions, the school said Tuesday. In Princeton's statement Tuesday, the university said: "The CDC and state health officials recommend that classes and activities at Princeton University continue as planned, and the surrounding community can continue to attend events on the campus. "I think students do know that it is an important and fatal issue that is spreading on campus -- and each student individually decides to what degree to protect themselves," Stephen Cognetta, a junior, said in an e-mail. Of those, 160 were group B. School activities continue Several students told CNN that their peers are not overly afraid of getting meningitis, but that it's definitely a topic of conversation. Antibiotic treatment of the most common types of bacterial meningitis "should reduce the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, although the risk remains higher among young infants and the elderly," according to the CDC.
