-- A New Delhi court Tuesday granted bail to India's former telecom minister, who was at the center of one of the country's biggest corruption scandals. Suspects are accused of participating in a scheme involving the underselling of cell phone licenses at the height of India's lucrative telecom boom. Last year, police arrested the former minister, Andhimuthu Raja, and more than a dozen other defendants as part of high-profile investigations into the suspected below-price sale of telecom licenses. In February last year, prime minister Manmohan Singh accepted opposition demands for a wider, cross-party investigation into the massive scandal. Raja's lawyer Ramesh Gupta told CNN that the court ordered his client be released on bail Tuesday .
