Unlike many traditional online learning programs, students have the option of a flexible schedule during allotted blended learning days. In a study published in 2014 in eLearn magazine, 92% of students surveyed at Huntley High said that they were satisfied with the blended learning experience, and no teachers reported negative experiences with it. What's still left to be determined about blended learning is how well students do in college or jobs after they graduate, Burkey said. " Huntley High School students and educators often refer to the program simply as "blended." My own kids are still in elementary and middle school, so they have not done blended learning yet, but they definitely will when they get to high school."
