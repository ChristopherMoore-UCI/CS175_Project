But the defending men's champion in New York had an easier time in sweltering conditions Sunday, dispatching German Florian Mayer 7-6 6-2 6-2 to move into the fourth round. It was especially impressive given Mayer's ability to throw off opponents with his change of pace and quirky forehand. Once Murray took it in a tiebreak, and convincingly, Mayer's shoulders slumped and he proceeded to win four games the rest of the way. Stephens sent Williams packing in the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, although the latter was injured in the match, and some regard the 20-year-old as the future of American tennis. Murray was happy he didn't have to spend too long on court -- under two hours -- in the draining conditions.
