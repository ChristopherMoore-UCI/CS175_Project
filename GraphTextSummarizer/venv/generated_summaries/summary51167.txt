Dekenipp was determined to spend Valentine's Day with his girlfriend, CNN affiliate KTVK reported. Dekenipp had been booked in jail last month on various charges, including suspected car theft, unlawful flight and driving on a suspended license, the affiliate reported. Their big break came when two teens told authorities that their friend gave Dekenipp a ride to the bar. Dekenipp went missing Friday afternoon from a fenced recreation yard at the detention center in Florence, according to the affiliate. When inmates there returned to their residential units, Dekenipp was nowhere to be found.
