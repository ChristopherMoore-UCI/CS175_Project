-- Band members who were with Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion on the bus in a parking lot in Orlando, Florida, where he died last month tried frantically to get him help when they realized he was not breathing, a 911 tape released Thursday reveals. Under Florida law, any death that occurs as the result of hazing is a third-degree felony. Ammons moved to fire White shortly after Champion's death, citing "alleged misconduct and/or incompetence involving confirmed reports and allegations of hazing with the Department of Music and the 'Marching 100.'" White, who has hired an attorney to fight for his job, said he has zero tolerance for hazing, which he described as a national problem. The dismissals were announced Tuesday in a letter from university President James Ammons to the board of trustees. Whenever Robert heard the sound of the drum, his knees raised, his toes pointed and he was on a mission to make the FAMU community proud," said White, who began leading the 420-member FAMU band in 1998.
