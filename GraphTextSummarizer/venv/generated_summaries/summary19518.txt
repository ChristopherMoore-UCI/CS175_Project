The Miami Dolphins have suspended Pro Bowler Richie Incognito after allegations of misconduct lodged by linemate Jonathan Martin, who left the NFL team last week in the middle of the season. Several media outlets said Martin had left the Dolphins because of bullying, something Incognito denied on Twitter. The Sporting News takes a yearly poll of NFL players, and in 2009 they dubbed Incognito the dirtiest player in the league. Philbin said he met with Martin and also talked with members of his family before Sunday, and the second-year player didn't say anything about player misconduct. Last week, the Dolphins announced Martin had taken "a leave of absence."
