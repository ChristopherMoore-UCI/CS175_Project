Real Madrid defender Pepe had blocked an early effort by Bayern Munich striker Mario Mandzukic and Cristiano Ronaldo soon found the ball at his feet. "Everything is still possible in this tie," Bayern keeper Neuer told Uefa.com. Madrid will now travel to Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena next week with a slender advantage while Munich manager Pep Guardiola must work out how to make his team's possession pay. But it was Bayern substitute Mario Gotze who almost had the last say with a powerful shot on goal only for Casillas to instinctively block his strike. Real Madrid came closer to scratching their 12-year Champions League itch with a 1-0 home victory over defending champions Bayern Munich.
