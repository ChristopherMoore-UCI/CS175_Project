The people that plan these sorts of things generally hire more political speakers when politics is interesting and in turn I'll make more money and then John Boehner and Eric Cantor will start referring to me as a job creator. These political people include operatives, politicians, volunteers, bloviators, journalists, pundits, columnists, staffers -- we actually like politics and campaigns. The same goes for politics -- if you really love it, you hope for a good race that goes on and you enjoy watching people who are skilled at doing this. If this thing gets any worse the people in Mississippi will be making Texas jokes -- then you've really hit rock bottom. When Rick Perry announced he was running for president back on August 13, to tell you the truth I got a little excited.
