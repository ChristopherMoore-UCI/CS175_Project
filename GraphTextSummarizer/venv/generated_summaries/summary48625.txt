Officers staking out a home in south London saw and followed de Menezes, 27, believing he was one of the suspects. De Menezes was killed on a London Underground train weeks after four suicide bombers struck on the London transport system on July 7, 2005. -- Police in London have reached a settlement with the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, whom officers shot dead in 2005, mistaking him for a suicide bomber. The Independent Police Complaints Commission concluded in 2007 that de Menezes was innocent of anything that might have justified police action. De Menezes was killed July 22, 2005, a day after four failed bombings aboard the London transit system.
