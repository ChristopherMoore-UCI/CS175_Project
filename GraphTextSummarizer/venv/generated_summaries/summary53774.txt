Using those resources, Thompson said, Pennsylvania has brought in almost $900,000 in the past nine years selling checkpoint items. Pennsylvania employees research the market values of items and set prices, taking into consideration the items' conditions. But prohibited items -- knives, large tools and sporting equipment -- are considered excess government property and are sent to the nearest state willing to accept them. Troy Thompson knows that not because he is privy to the nation's latest intelligence reports but because he works for Pennsylvania's Department of General Services, where objects discovered and surrendered at airport checkpoints are stored, sorted and resold to the public. (The TSA seizes on average four guns a day at checkpoints and took a total of 1,549 last year.)
