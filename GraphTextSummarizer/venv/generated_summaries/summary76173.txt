Palmor, the spokesman for Israel's foreign ministry, said "nothing constructive" had ever come out of the group's Palestine committee. The envoys banned from attending the meeting were foreign ministers from Algeria, Cuba, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Malaysia, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said. Palestinian officials were discussing alternative locations for the Non-Aligned Movement committee meeting, the ministry said. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki described the move as "a total Israeli diplomatic failure." -- Diplomatic talks in the West Bank were canceled Sunday after Israel denied entry to five envoys, the Palestinian foreign ministry said.
