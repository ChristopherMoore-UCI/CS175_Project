Now Russia says it will continue to extend asylum protections to Snowden and won't send him back home. On Thursday, around the time that Snowden was answering questions online, Attorney General Eric Holder said that "if Mr. Snowden wanted to come back to the United States and enter a plea, we would engage with his lawyers." My case clearly demonstrates the need for comprehensive whistle-blower protection act reform." Snowden offered his remarks from Russia, where he's been since June, having been granted a one-year asylum. Snowden has said the time isn't right for him to return to the United States, where he could face criminal charges for leaking classified information. Russia gave him asylum for a year.
