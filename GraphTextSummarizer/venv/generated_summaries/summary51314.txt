Even still, in 2006 the UK's Manchester Business School assessed the environmental impacts of food production and consumption and concluded that there isn't a clear cut answer to whether the environmental impact is greater on a trolley full of organic food compared to a trolley full of non-organic food. A new study reveals organic foods are not necessarily healthier than non-organic food Year on year the organic food market grows as consumers look to make a greener and -- often thought -- more nutritional choice. However, one possible spanner in the works for the organic sector could be the results of a new study by the University of Copenhagen which revealed that organic foods contained no more nutrients than non-organic foods grown with the use of pesticides. He told the UK's Sunday Times newspaper in January 2007 that organic food represented a lifestyle choice consumers could make and suggested that the use of chemicals and pesticides in non-organic foods didn't necessarily mean they were of inferior quality. A report by the UK's Soil Association revealed that consumers there spent a record $3.7 billion on organic products in 2006, that's more than 20 percent growth on 2005 spending on organic goods including food, drinks and health and beauty products.
