-- A storm system unleashed a tornado that slammed communities in northern Arkansas, damaging homes and destroying a church, officials said Wednesday evening. Video footage from CNN affiliate KATV showed toppled trees and twisted building girders at one damage location. "If the tornado would have come an hour and a half later we would have been caught in it," said Senior Pastor Ester Bass, referring to Wednesday night services. Some 33 homes and a business were damaged in the county, said Tommy Jackson of the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management. According to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center, a Van Buren County highway was blocked by fallen trees and an 18-wheeler truck was overturned.
