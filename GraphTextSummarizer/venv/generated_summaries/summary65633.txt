-- When freelance journalist Steven Sotloff disappeared during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2013, his family kept the news a secret. "My office has contacted the relevant agencies, departments and even organizations with connections on the ground in Syria to try to get answers for the Sotloff family," Ros-Lehtinen said. But Lotzia said he has been in touch with Sotloff's father, Art, and Tuesday's video "was the first time his dad and family have heard anything about Steve since last December. " Ashley Burns, who edited some of Sotloff's work for their college newspaper, said that out of all the people he met through the newspaper, he wished he had followed Sotloff's work more in recent years. "If any old friends asked me about Steve over the past year, I'd just say I hadn't seen him in a long time." Sotloff's family members have not commented on their son's disappearance.
