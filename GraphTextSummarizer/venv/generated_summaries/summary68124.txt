-- Retired U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, a supporter of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, on Sunday questioned whether Sen. John McCain's military experience qualified him to be commander-in-chief. " When Schieffer asked to explain the comment, Clark said he was referring to McCain's experience, or lack thereof, in setting national security policies and understanding the risk involved in such matters. Retired Gen. Wesley Clark, who ran for president in 2004, questioned John McCain's qualifications Sunday. The dust-up began with Clark's appearance Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation,"  where moderator Bob Schieffer asked him about his interview with the Huffington Post earlier this month. In a statement released by the McCain campaign Sunday afternoon, retired Admiral Leighton "Snuffy" Smith criticized Clark's comment.
