What changed in this election was that women accumulated power in a calm and measured way, and began to look for the first time much less like outsiders to the political process. Married women tended to vote for Romney, while single women went for Obama. What about the "war on women," the constantly mutating arguments over reproductive rights? New Hampshire, arguably a state populated by the greatest concentration of political insiders and obsessives, gave us our first ever matriarchy -- a delegation of House, Senate and governor that is entirely female. Yes, more women voted for President Obama, but not in record numbers.
