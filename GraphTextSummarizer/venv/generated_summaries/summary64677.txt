A super PAC affiliated with the conservative Koch brothers is spending more than $1 million each in Arkansas and Iowa on a second round of television commercials that feature U.S. veterans and a mother critical of Democratic Senate candidates running in those two states, CNN has learned. The latest Freedom Partners Action Fund commercial in Arkansas features six U.S. veterans speaking directly to the camera about their displeasure with Democratic incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor. Democrats' favorite bogeymen fight back And in an attempt to tie Pryor to President Barack Obama, another veteran says in the commercial that the senator "votes with Barack Obama 90% of the time." Instead, "Christina" touts GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst, a member of the Iowa National Guard, as a person for her children to emulate. Seven Democrats and six Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, sit on this subcommittee.
