So naturally, I noticed how potato chips have taken less and less space on the snack table to make room for tortilla chips and guacamole. Although potato chips continue to be the top-selling salted snack in terms of pounds sold, tortilla chips have been increasing in sales at a faster pace than potato chips, especially during this time of year, according to Tom Dempsey, CEO of the Snack Food Association. Kettle Brand is one of the few companies that isn't owned by Frito-Lay, and even though potato chip sales fell below tortilla chips recently, the company has focused its energy on two vital chip components: structure and flavor. I love tortillas chips and potato chips, in every shape, size and flavor. And, it's not just tortilla chips selling at such high rates either.
