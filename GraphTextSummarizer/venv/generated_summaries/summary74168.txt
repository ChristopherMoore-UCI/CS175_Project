But Villa hit back immediately when England goalkeeper Paul Robinson dropped Gareth Barry's corner, allowing Laursen to prod home after a ricochet off Pascal Chimbonda. However, Pascal Chimbonda and Robbie Keane pulled goals back and deep into added time Kaboul found the top corner to level the scores. LONDON, England -- Younes Kaboul scored in injury time to earn Tottenham a remarkable 4-4 Premier League home draw with Aston Villa, sealing a remarkable fightback after trailing 4-1 and possibly saving manager Martin Jol from the sack. Dimitar Berbatov opened the scoring for Spurs but two goals from Martin Laursen edged the visitors ahead and Gabriel Agbonlahor and Craig Gardner added to the lead. That set up an exciting finish and Tottenham's relentless pressure finally paid dividends when Kaboul slammed home in stoppage time after Villa failed to clear a corner.
