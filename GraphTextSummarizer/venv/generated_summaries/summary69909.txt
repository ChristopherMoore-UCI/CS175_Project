A lawsuit filed Thursday by the celebrity couple blasts Chad Hurley, accusing him of secretly recording West's surprise proposal to Kardashian in the middle of San Francisco's AT&T Park on October 21. "An opportunity to do so appeared to Hurley when he learned of the October 21, 2013, event featuring West and Kardashian," it said. The video shows West kneeling near second base to ask Kardashian to marry him while a large orchestra plays in center field. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are accusing a YouTube co-founder of illegally publishing video of their engagement party to boost his new "foundering" website. "Immediately after giving his word to honor the condition required for his attendance at the event," Hurley posted the shaky video on MixBit, a video sharing website owned by his San Mateo, California, company, it said.
