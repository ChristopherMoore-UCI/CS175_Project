In the Thomas incident on July 5, Quinonez happened to witness police "beating on Kelly Thomas" as Quinonez was boarding his bicycle on a bus near the altercation, he said. The officer was also allegedly involved in a third case of suspected police brutality last year in which Mam, 31, of Baldwin Park, California, has filed a civil lawsuit against Fullerton police, said Mardirossian. As he witnessed the encounter between police and Kelly Thomas, Quinonez saw the same officer from his arrest "walking up, and that's when the whole beating process started" in the Thomas arrest, Quinonez said. Added Mam: "If (Fullerton police) would have taken action on (Quinonez's) behalf, I probably wouldn't be in this mess, and Mr. Kelly Thomas wouldn't have passed away. Fullerton police investigated a police misconduct complaint filed by Quinonez shortly after the arrest, Goodrich said.
