It's just a coincidence that the release of the Michael Jackson King of Pop slot game on Tuesday is occurring along with the trial of the performer's physician, Conrad Murray, who's charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, said a spokesman for Bally Technologies. Because the game will be networked with other Jackson machines across Nevada -- a so-called wide-area progressive game -- the jackpots will start at $750,000 and extend into the millions, Bally officials said. The game emphasizes an immersion experience in which players sit in a chair with Jackson's music piped into speakers behind the headrest, and the tunes are intensified with subwoofers and thumpers, said Bally video game designer David Schultz. "These were groundbreakers, and they still hold up," said Bally game producer Chris Guerrero about the Jackson videos. "We started the process about a year ago," said Mike Mitchell, vice president of game design at Bally, adding that's when the firm negotiated the licensing of Jackson's music and videos with several parties, including Jackson's family and estate.
