-- Former Chelsea assistant Ray Wilkins believes the Premier League club will re-appoint Guus Hiddink as their new manager. Since then, Hiddink -- who is currently in charge of the Turkish national side -- has been linked with a return to Stamford Bridge and Wilkins, who was controversially sacked by Chelsea last season. McLeish led Birmingham to victory in last season's Carling Cup final, but the club were also relegated out of the Premier League for the second time under his control -- and he quit his position under a cloud last week. United won 2-1 there last season, but WBA were the only team to come away from Old Trafford with a point in a 2-2 draw. "The Champions League seems to be the holy grail for Chelsea and if they are to go one stage further in that competition, Guus would be the man to do that.
