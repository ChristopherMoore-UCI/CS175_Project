-- Libya's new government said it has control of new areas in Bani Walid as the battle rages on for one of the last cities loyal to the ousted ruler. National Transitional Council fighters also battling for control in Gadhafi's hometown of Sirte, and will boost Bani Walid troops as soon as that battle is over, said Abdurahman Bousin, a council spokesman. The city center and the northern part of the city are now under government control, said Ali Daeki, a member of the executive crisis committee. Government forces have surrounded the city from all sides, and arrested more than 20 loyalists of former ruler, he said Saturday. "It could be up to 7,000," said Mona Rishmawi, a senior official with the group in Geneva, Switzerland.
