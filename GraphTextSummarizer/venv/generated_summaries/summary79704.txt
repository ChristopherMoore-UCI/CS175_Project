There is no slight, no malice, no scandal here, rather a wish to preserve the elements of sacred family Christmas. After breakfast on Christmas morning, it's church, lunch, a huddle around the television to watch the Queen's Christmas message to the nation, a country walk, and an evening of parlor games. Every family celebrates Christmas in their own unique way, and the Middletons would never presume to be included in the royals' personal festivities, nor would the Queen, Philip, Charles and Camilla expect to load the corgis and a fruitcake into the Range Rover and head down to Bucklebury. Oh, that it were true if only because Richard Palmer, royal reporter for Britain's Daily Express, tweeted that if Carole Middleton, the mother of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, emerged alongside the Queen and drove to church, he'd cartwheel naked down the path. Last year, with the Queen's blessing, William and Kate chose to spend Christmas with Kate's family in Bucklebury, Berkshire.
