It includes a population of elliptical galaxies that don't form stars, disk galaxies that do form stars, and irregular galaxies. "These observations capture a large variety of galaxy luminosities, sizes, colours, morphologies and evolutionary stages, providing remarkable benchmarks for galaxy formation theories," study authors wrote. A range of galaxy types emerges in this simulation, such as blue spiral and red elliptical galaxies. A new study in the journal Nature describes a simulation of the universe that is unique because of "how realistically it recreates the galaxies and the universe that we see, which is kind of a first for a simulation like this," said Dylan Nelson, study co-author at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. Over the course of the universe's history, galaxies have formed where dark matter was most concentrated.
