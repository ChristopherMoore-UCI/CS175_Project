"Africa will start producing very notable international rock bands and metal bands as well and probably in 10 years' time it won't be unusual to see bands from Africa headlining big stages and sharing stages with bands like Metallica. " And Marshall thinks African bands could one day bang heads with the biggest international names in stadium rock. "In fact, Africa already has metal bands which have toured Europe, and if given the chance, we will deliver. It started off with classic rock and later on more extreme forms of metal were introduced." "Metal is a music about power, independence and freedom," said Giuseppe Sbrana, singer of local band Skinflint.
