From African Voices: Nigerian NBA boss finding basketball stars Most kids in Africa don't start playing basketball until they are 13 or 14 years old. That's what we use for my Giants of Africa camp. With a tremendous assist from the NBA, Nike and the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), we have been trying to provide opportunities for the next generation of African basketball players. Every year, we conduct the Giants of Africa camp, sponsored by NestlÃ© Milo and Nike, as well as the NBA Basketball Without Borders Africa elite camp. These guys are great examples for young people in Africa.
