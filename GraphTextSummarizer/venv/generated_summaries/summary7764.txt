Nestled in the classy Hyde Park suburb in Johannesburg, Kapo has spent the last decade designing and creating intricate pieces of jewelry for his elite clientele across the globe, including customized handcrafted pieces for some of the top auction houses like Christie's and Sotheby's. Throughout the years, Kapo made several trips to various African countries, including Ghana, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, to learn more about the industry. -- He fell into the jewelry industry 38 years ago almost by accident but Labi Kapo is today a master goldsmith whose dazzling hand-crafted creations cost thousands of dollars. When he's not designing unique pieces, Kapo spends much of his time teaching local youth the knowledge he has gleaned throughout the years as part of his efforts to help locals benefit from their land's valuable resources. In 2002, Kapo opened his own line, Akapo Jewels, in South Africa.
