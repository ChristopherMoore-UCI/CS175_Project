The core objection to nuclear energy among many old-school environmentalists resides not so much in danger to human health -- which is dwarfed by mortality attributed to coal, gas and oil -- nor by the cost of the technology, but rather in a palpable fear of granting human civilization access to an abundant supply of energy -- in whatever form. If something is not done to dramatically change the way in which humankind produces energy, we will bequeath to our children and grandchildren a planet that is almost beyond our ability to imagine; one in which climate issues will begin to overwhelm basic social and political cohesion. The same industrial techniques that have been proven successful in reducing the costs of wind and solar -- and every other recent technological innovation -- could, if applied to nuclear energy, allow us to transition to a non-CO2 emitting world at the speed and scale that's required to avert a climate catastrophe. Simple arithmetic will tell you that nuclear energy is essential to any viable way forward, if a climate disaster is to be averted. Imagine what could be done today with a serious commitment and public support for a combined portfolio of both renewables and advanced nuclear energy?
