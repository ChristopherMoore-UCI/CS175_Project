Espinosa was in the makeshift media center during last week's shelling by Syrian forces that killed American Marie Colvin of The Sunday Times of London and French photographer Remi Ochlik and wounded French reporter Edith Bouvier of La Monde newspaper. " Espinosa escaped Baba Amr on Sunday just days before Syrian forces began an assault on the neighborhood that culminated Thursday with rebels announcing a "tactical retreat," saying they were withdrawing to protect the civilians in the neighborhood. Espinosa, who works for the Spanish daily El Mundo, was one of four journalists who escaped this week from Baba Amr, a neighborhood of about five square miles that was shelled for 26 consecutive days before Syrian forces began an assault. Espinosa described the shelling by Syrian forces as "systematic." The announcement by the opposition came at the same time Syrian forces seized control of the neighborhood.
