Back on the Thames, British monarchs have a long-standing tradition of using the winding river to celebrate different types of royal events such as processions, receptions, coronations, weddings and christenings. Pageant master Adrian Evans agrees, but says that the symbolic connection between royalty and the sea reflects a broader disposition embedded in the national psyche: "Britons' relationship with water runs deep, and our characters have been forged by the canals and the rivers." "Back then the Thames was the biggest boulevard in London, so if a monarch wanted to make an impression on the populous they would do it on the river," said Pageant Master Adrian Evans, the man responsible for organizing Sunday's eye-popping event. During the 18th and 19th centuries their naval conquests ensured that the "sun never set" on its empire, but even though times have changed since then, the monarchy still enjoys a very special relationship with the symbolically titled Royal Navy. As Britain began to industrialize, the number of royal pageants began to dwindle.
