Police announced Thursday they had arrested a couple on suspicion of being involved in forced labor and domestic servitude after authorities took a Malaysian woman, 69, Irish woman, 57, and 30-year-old Briton to safety from a property in Lambeth, south London. However, police told CNN on Friday that while the man and woman were arrested under the slavery, servitude and forced or compulsory labor section of the Coroners and Justice Act of 2009, that law did not necessarily describe the alleged crime. "It is not as brutally obvious as women being physically restrained inside an address and not allowed to leave. " Police have not released the names of the man and woman -- both 67 -- alleged to have held the women captive but say they are not British nationals. What we have uncovered so far is a complicated and disturbing picture of emotional control over many years.
