Authorities found the children, ages 7 to 16, dead in their Pierce County home Saturday afternoon, and the father, James Harrison, was found dead inside his SUV in adjacent King County, Detective Ed Troyer told CNN Radio Sunday. Troyer said that on Friday night, Harrison and his 16-year-old daughter found his wife with another man. At the home, Harrison and the children held a family meeting with other relatives, Troyer said. The couple argued, and then Harrison and his daughter returned to the family home near Tacoma without his wife, Troyer said. The relatives left, and later that night Harrison shot all five of his children -- four girls and one boy -- as they slept in their beds, Troyer said.
