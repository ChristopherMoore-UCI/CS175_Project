-- After Apple unveiled a pair of new iPhones Tuesday, Tim Cook & Co. made the phones briefly available for some hands-on (and fingers-on) testing. A better flash would be a welcome improvement over the traditional LED flashes on iPhones (and most other smartphones) that flood scenes with harsh light. The polycarbonate body does feel sturdier than other plastic phones, and the phone still has bit of weight to it. The new burst mode, which takes rapid-fire photos at a rate of 10 per second, is meant for capturing moving subjects such as twitchy children or sprinting athletes. It worked seamlessly when I tested it, though adding new profiles takes a bit of time.
