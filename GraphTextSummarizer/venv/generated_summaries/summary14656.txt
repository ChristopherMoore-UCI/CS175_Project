"An object like this will have a pretty spectacular display when it enters the atmosphere," said U.S. Naval Observatory spokesman Geoff Chester. But eyewitness accounts of the color, shape and timing of the light and sound had officials at the Naval Observatory confident of the phenomenon's cause: the re-entry of orbiting space junk from the Russian Soyuz spacecraft that blasted off last week from Kazakhstan. Naval Observatory officials say that scenario is unlikely in this case, since the space junk was already orbiting in the area. Chester said the yellow, orange and iridescent green flashes reported by witnesses resemble both fireballs and burning space junk. The likelihood of space debris hitting one's home is pretty remote, Chester said, so residents don't have to worry.
