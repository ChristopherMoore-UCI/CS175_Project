Sono now provides legal assistance for rape victims and counsels young men about the seriousness of violence against women. She says the stigma and shame of rape is what forces most women including herself to keep it a secret. Zwelithini Sono, a former defense lawyer who now helps rape victims, says he has never lost a rape case. The young rapists we met have attended Sono's session and they tell us they do not see themselves violating women ever again. Human rights activists believe the majority of rapes in South Africa go unreported.
