-- When Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup there was much pomp and pageantry in the tiny Persian Gulf state. Issues relating to the feasibility of playing in scorching summer temperatures, the conditions of migrant workers building World Cup infrastructure and allegations of bribery and corruption have all been raised. Work on the first stadium has already begun and the government has earmarked much of this year's $62 billion budget for World Cup infrastructure spending. "If you look long term, the bigger risk is the loss of brand Qatar. "The decline in construction activities is going to have an impact on overall GDP growth," said Farouk Soussa, chief economist for the Middle East at Citigroup Global Markets.
