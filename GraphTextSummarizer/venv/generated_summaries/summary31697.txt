"The reported arrest in Pakistan of Umar Patek, an Indonesian national alleged to be involved in several major terrorist attacks, may increase the risk of violent responses in Indonesia in the short term," the warning from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. Authorities and security experts say Patek was a member of the terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, that he took part in the Bali bombings, and that fled to Mindanao in the Philippines in 2003. Patek is one of the top suspects in the Bali bombings that killed more than 200 people in 2002, Indonesian police have said. -- Australian authorities issued a warning Friday to its citizens who may be traveling to Indonesia that the recent arrest of a terror suspect could lead to terror attacks there. Indonesia has sent a team to Pakistan to confirm that it is indeed Patek that was arrested.
