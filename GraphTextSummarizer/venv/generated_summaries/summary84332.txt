-- Some call gridlocked Washington a "hopeless place," but the "Good Girl Gone Bad" found much more than just love outside 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on Monday -- Rihanna found new Instagram photos. Rihanna even took to the podium in the White House briefing room and pretended to field questions from the press before taking a walk on the North Lawn. In one caption where Rihanna is talking on a pay phone, the caption reads "Fitz, darling," an apparent reference to "Scandal"'s President Fitzgerald Grant, the fictional two-term incumbent Republican and former governor of California. Rihanna is in town for the Veterans Day benefit Concert for Valor, where she will perform Tuesday alongside Bruce Springsteen, Carrie Underwood and other artists. In another caption, Rihanna drops the acronym "O.P.A." though it was unclear if she was referencing Oliva Pope and Associates, or the Department of Health and Human Services branch Office of Population Affairs.
