As well as Blatter, Prince Ali is up against former Portugal captain -- and 2001's FIFA World Player of the Year -- Luis Figo, who says he who was convinced to stand after FIFA's handling of the Garcia report. It was meant as a joke, but Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein inadvertently cut to the chase with the perception hanging over world football as it wrestles with the decision as to re-elect FIFA president Sepp Blatter or opt for a new beginning. At the moment a spirit of inclusion is not altogether apparent in FIFA's corridors of power, with ethics investigator Michael Garcia resigning in December to protest the handling of his own report into Qatar and Russia's successful bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Prince Ali spoke of a "culture of intimidation" within FIFA, with some national associations fearing retribution if they back any other candidate other than Blatter, though he didn't provide specific examples. "I've tried as much as I can to reform it from within... having seen what's happened I'm not going to allow another four years of this," Prince Ali said of FIFA's internal workings.
