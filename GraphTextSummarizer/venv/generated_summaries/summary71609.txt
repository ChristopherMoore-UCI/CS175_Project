-- A controversial new cyberlaw has been temporarily suspended in the Philippines by the country's top court Tuesday, a move seen as a victory of netizens who objected to the criminalization of libel, which could result in social media users being thrown in jail for posts. Petitioners said the law has a "repressive perspective on personal freedoms and regressive view of technology." The law seeks to address cybersex, child pornography, identity theft and other computer-related offenses. The Internet community was up in arms over implications the law may have on social media communication. The Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 went into effect on October 3 amidst widespread protests by the Filipino online community, journalists and free speech activists.
