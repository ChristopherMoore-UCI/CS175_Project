Markoff, 24, was a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine when arrested in April 2009 in the killing of Julissa Brisman, 25, at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. -- Prosecutors in Boston, Massachusetts, on Thursday filed paperwork in court that officially ended the murder case against "Craigslist killer" Philip Markoff, who committed suicide in jail last month. Conley said the Brisman family was "robbed of the opportunity" to seek justice against Markoff. Authorities said Markoff killed himself in his jail cell by cutting himself multiple times with a makeshift scalpel crafted from a pen and a piece of metal. The Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said prosecutors had a "very, very strong case" against Markoff, but it was short-circuited when Markoff took his own life August 15.
