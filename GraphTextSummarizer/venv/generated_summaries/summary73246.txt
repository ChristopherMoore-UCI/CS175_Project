The USDA requires brain and spinal tissue be removed from meat products from cattle 3 years and older because it can carry the protein that causes mad cow disease. -- More than 4,000 pounds of rib-eye and other fresh beef products have been recalled because they could contain contaminated materials linked to mad cow disease. People who consume meat tainted with mad cow disease could develop a rare, fatal disease in humans called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. The inspectors found no indication any of the animals slaughtered showed signs of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the formal name of mad cow disease.
