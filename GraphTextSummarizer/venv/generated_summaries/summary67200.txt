The remarkable display of civil disobedience by hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens reflects a profound sense of desperation that has grown as China has closed off all political options and made it increasingly clear that it intends to call the shots. In June, China released its first-ever White Paper on Hong Kong, which stresses how Hong Kong's autonomy has limits. There may be a potential middle ground of compromise, but many doubt that Leung has the flexibility to negotiate with Hong Kong protestors. Since 1997, when Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule, many of China's efforts at exerting political influence have been subtle, and, with a few exceptions such as implicitly limiting the press, Hong Kong has more or less been allowed to continue its open economy, legal system and freedom of assembly. The White Paper offered other reinterpretations of the 1997 Accord, including the notion that the territory's judicial decisions must "take into account the needs of China," a vague requirement but crystal clear to Hong Kong.
