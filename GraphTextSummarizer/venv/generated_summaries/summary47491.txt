Comments on a thread started October 15 in Apple's support forums to complain about battery life had grown to 217 pages by Thursday morning. -- Apple has acknowledged a problem with battery life on the iPhone 4S and other devices running its new operating system. "A small number of customers have reported lower than expected battery life on iOS 5 devices," Apple said in a statement to AllThingsD, a part of the Wall Street Journal network. "We have found a few bugs that are affecting battery life and we will release a software update to address those in a few weeks." The company previously had not publicly acknowledged complaints about battery life on the phone, which surfaced soon after it was released October 14 and continued to grow in the weeks since.
