About 8,000 military personnel from the United States and South Korea are to participate in joint military exercises dubbed "Invincible Spirit" from July 25-28, Combined Alliance Joint Naval and Air Exercises announced Tuesday. -- North Korea has agreed to hold talks Friday with the U.S.-led U.N. Command on the peninsula over the sinking of a South Korean warship. Officers from both sides will meet in Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. The demilitarized zone was created as part of the armistice signed between North and South Korea in 1953 that halted fighting in the Korean War, but the war has never officially ended. An international investigation blamed North Korea for the sinking, an assertion the North has denied.
