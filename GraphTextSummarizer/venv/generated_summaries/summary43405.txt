The quake in the central Philippines on Monday damaged houses, churches and many other buildings. The Philippines is situated in the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The state-run Philippines News Agency had reported Tuesday that the number of people killed by the 6.7-magnitude quake off the coast of Negros had climbed to 48. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council on Wednesday put the official death toll at 26, with 71 people still missing. But PNA later reported that the army had reduced the total to 22 confirmed dead after it "learned that not all believed dead in various towns and cities were accounted for."
