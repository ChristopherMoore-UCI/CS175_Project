Jeffs could be sentenced to five years to life in prison on the charge of aggravated sexual assault regarding the alleged 12-year-old. During the hearing Friday, Jeffs said he objected to the introduction of items seized in the raid and documents that should get "religious protection." Several also cried during the niece's testimony, in which she described an incident that allegedly occurred between her and Jeffs when she was 7 years old. Texas Ranger Jesse Valdez and Ezra Draper, who left the FLDS in 2003, also testified Saturday. Brent Jeffs, 28, told jurors that his uncle raped him when he was 5 years old.
