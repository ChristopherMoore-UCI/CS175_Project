After the passengers evacuated, the fuel tanks exploded, causing massive devastation to the aircraft, a spokeswoman for the local branch of the Russian Emergency Situations Ministry said on state television. The aircraft's last overhaul was in 1998, according to Russian state television. Photos on state-run newswire RIA-Novosti's website showed only the tail of the plane recognizable amid a huge plume of black smoke. A pre-flight check found it to be in good condition, state TV said. One of the engines aboard the Tu-154B-2 caught fire as the plane taxied toward the runway in Russia's Siberian city of Surgut, Russia's Investigation Committee said in a statement on its website.
