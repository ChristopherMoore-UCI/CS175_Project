The first flight carrying cruise guests from the Bahamas left Tuesday morning, and flights will continue throughout the day, Royal Caribbean said. The company's president and CEO, Adam Goldstein, and other officials with Miami-based Royal Caribbean headed to Freeport on Monday morning to meet guests, she said. The ship's 2,224 guests and 796 crew members initially were headed to CocoCay, Bahamas, but the ship was redirected to Freeport for evaluation, Royal Caribbean said. The ship arrived at Freeport about 10:15 a.m., Royal Caribbean said. The emergency, as she and other passengers would learn, was a fire that started in the rear of Royal Caribbean's Grandeur of the Seas cruise ship about 2:50 a.m. Monday while it was heading to the Bahamas, sending guests to the decks under the night sky.
