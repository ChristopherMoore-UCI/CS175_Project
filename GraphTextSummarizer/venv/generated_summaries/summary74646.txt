Housing rights groups say many old buildings in the city are rundown and neglected, while newer ones are often built illegally, using substandard materials and have structural defects. Several buildings in the Mumbai area have crumbled this year, one of them with disastrous consequences. Repairs followed the warnings, and there were plans for future repairs, a spokesman for Brihanmumbai Municipal Council, which owns the building, said. Rescue personnel "are closely monitoring any noises or movement from under the debris that can lead us to people trapped inside," said Sachidanand Gawde, deputy commandant at the National Disaster Response Force. Deadly collapses have occurred in the city in past years, as well.
