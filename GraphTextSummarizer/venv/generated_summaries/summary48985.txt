The two films took home the top prizes at the 2014 Golden Globes Sunday night, winning best motion picture drama ("12 Years") and best comedy or musical motion picture ("Hustle"). Best moments and GIFs from the Golden Globes Amy 'n' Tina Hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler started the show by picking up where they left off last year. She won her first Globe, for best actress in a comedy or musical TV series, and was hilariously nervous as she accepted. Cate Blanchett won the Globe for best actress in a drama (motion picture) for her performance in "Blue Jasmine." The 71st Annual Globes had its share of shockers, perhaps none bigger than the two awards won by the freshman comedy "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" for best TV series comedy or musical.
