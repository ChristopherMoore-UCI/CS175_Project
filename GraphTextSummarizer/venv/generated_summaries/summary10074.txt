"For the sake of those who died and the family members still living, we've got to find out what happened at the school," U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, said in a letter dated Wednesday to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. In 2008, Florida's then-Gov. Charlie Crist ordered a state investigation into allegations by a group of men, known as "The White House Boys," who had came forward with stories of how they were beaten with leather straps by school administrators in the 1960s. At the time, the law enforcement agency said it could not determine where another 50 boys -- who died at the school as a result of illnesses or accidents -- were buried, blaming poorly kept school records. Now, investigators say there's evidence that 98 boys died at the school, and some of them may be buried in the 50 graves found on school grounds. Mystery surrounds school graves
