Given her well-known love of horses, it's perhaps fitting -- some might say unimaginative -- that the majority of gifts presented to Queen Elizabeth II from world leaders last year revolved her favorite four-legged animals. A dressage crop from the governor general of Canada, David Johnston, and a boot scraper from Felsted School in the east of England can also be put to good use at Her Majesty's stud farm on the royal Sandringham Estate. Fittingly, the previous year Prince George also received a teddy wearing the same silk jacket as those worn by the Queen's jockeys, from promotional group Great British Racing. Among the more peculiar gifts given to the Queen was a miniature seven-inch throne from the "Game of Thrones" TV series, during a visit to Northern Ireland in June. Will the young prince also inherit a love of horse racing passed down through the centuries?
