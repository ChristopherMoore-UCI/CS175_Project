Mercedes and Red Bull have left Ferrari trailing in their wake this season, with double world champion Alonso recording just two podium finishes in 12 races. "I have a contract for another two years and as I always say on the subject of rumors and to ensure calm, what I want is to continue for the necessary years," Alonso told the Ferrari F1 team's official website on Wednesday. " Alonso joined Ferrari from Renault in 2010 and currently earns around $30 million a year, according to U.S. business magazine Forbes. The rumors have been whizzing around the pit lane for months, but Fernando Alonso says he's staying put at Ferrari -- at least for the time being. "Talk of other teams has never come from my lips, in fact it's always been the opposite."
