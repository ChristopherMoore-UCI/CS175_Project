The team's last league defeat -- a 2-1 defeat at Hanover -- came on September 18th last year. Other chances came and went before Bremen drew level with a headed effort of their own from defender Gebre Selassie -- who arrived from Czech champions Slovan Liberec in June -- in the 75th minute. Efforts to put the game beyond the reach of the visitors in the second half were initially repelled as Bremen goalkeeper Sebastian Mielitz palmed defender Mats Hummels' header over the bar. New signing Marco Reus opened his account for the reigning champions with a sweet strike in the 11th minute to send Jurgen Klopp's men a goal up at the break. Bayern Munich's quest for a 23rd league title begins at newly-promoted Greuther Fuerth on Saturday, while last season's third-placed team, Schalke start their season on Sunday with a trip to Hanover.
