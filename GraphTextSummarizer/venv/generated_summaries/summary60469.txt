Like Stimac, Serbia coach Sinisa Mihajlovic wants his players to inspire passionate support from their fans. Croatia currently sit second in the group, level on 10 points with leaders Belgium, while Serbia are on four points and would be nine points behind Stimac's side should they lose the much-anticipated game. "All the Serbs will be watching at home; we've had bad experiences in the past when we've tried to watch Serbia games and Croats have come and thrown stones at the cafes we're in," Djordje Macut, president of the town's Council of Serbian Minorities, told the Independent newspaper. Cursed war A Croatia victory on Friday would effectively end Serbia's World Cup qualification hopes. It was the scene of an infamous encounter between Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb and Serbian team Red Star Belgrade in 1990 which saw a riot break out and a number people stabbed and wounded.
