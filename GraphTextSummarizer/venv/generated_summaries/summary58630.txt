Space debris is now recognized by all countries (and militaries) as a threat to space assets. Project 921 is the result of China's fear of being left behind in the development of space technology. Part one of China's Project 921, a 30-year plan for space exploration that was approved in 1992, is complete. The real danger for the United States is in ceding space exploration and leadership to China because it lacks the political will to proceed at a steady, supportable pace. Should Americans be worried that China will overtake us in both space exploration and military capability in space?
