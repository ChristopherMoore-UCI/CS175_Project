Sarah Maynard's mother, Tina Herrmann, 32, remains missing, along with 10-year-old Kody Maynard and Herrmann's friend, 41-year-old Stephanie Sprang. Matthew Hoffman, 30, is suspected of having abducted Sarah Maynard, who authorities discovered over the weekend. "The likelihood is, of course, that they are not alive," Barber said about Herrmann, her son and Sprang. Authorities have said they expect additional charges. Hoffman appeared in the Mount Vernon Municipal Court on Tuesday via a video link with the local jail, according to Pam Fuller, a deputy clerk.
