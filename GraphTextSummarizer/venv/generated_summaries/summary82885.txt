-- One of the most sensational and infamous murder cases in modern U.S. history returned to a courtroom Monday as former Green Beret doctor Jeffrey MacDonald sought a new trial in the killing of his family. MacDonald was back in court in Wilmington, North Carolina, as his lawyers argued new evidence should be heard by a jury. So we are very pleased at this point," MacDonald lawyer Gordon Widenhouse told CNN affilliate News 14 Carolina. MacDonald and his lawyers contend that DNA tests show that hair samples found underneath the fingernail of one of the victims did not come from a member of the MacDonald family and presumably were from one of the killers. MacDonald told investigators that he was at home, sleeping on a couch, when he heard screaming.
