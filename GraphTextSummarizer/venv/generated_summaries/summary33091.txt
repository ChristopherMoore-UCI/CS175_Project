In addition to his titles, Chen said thieves took framed photographs of Sampras with Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, as well as some personal letters written by Bush. His agent, Grant Chen, said authorities contacted Sampras after one of those trophies and several other items were found late last week at the Griffith Park Recreation Center in Los Angeles. The recent recovery of one of his stolen trophies and several scrapbook items at a Los Angeles park left tennis legend Pete Sampras "a little more optimistic" that the rest of his coveted memorabilia will soon be found, his agent said Monday. "Only a few people knew the contents of the 50 to 60 tightly sealed boxes that we stored." Sampras can account for all but one of the 14 Grand Slam trophies -- given for his wins at the Australian Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Sampras, who grew up in Southern California, defeated Andre Agassi at the 2002 U.S. Open before retiring the following year with the most Grand Slam wins in tennis history.
