-- Germany's Tommy Haas upset Roger Federer in straight sets to win the ATP tournament on the grass courts of Halle Sunday. Federer, who will now head to the third grand slam of the season bidding for a seventh Wimbledon crown, was magnanimous in defeat. It was Haas' second Halle title after winning in 2009 and his 13th on the ATP Tour. When Federer hit a return long it was Haas who raised his arms in triumph after 95 minutes of gripping action. Federer was bidding for his sixth title at the Wimbledon warm-up tournament but had no answer to his 34-year-old opponent, who won 7-6 (7-5) 6-4 in front of his home fans.
