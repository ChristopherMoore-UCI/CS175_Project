After the actor's death in a fiery car wreck Saturday, the studio has pledged to give a percentage of the proceeds from the home entertainment sales of "Fast & Furious 6" to Walker's charity, Reach Out WorldWide. We keep Paul's memory alive and honor his legacy through continued support of Reach Out WorldWide, the non-profit he founded to give hope to those who must rebuild after they have experienced natural disasters. " As others have, Brewster made it a point to note Walker's generous spirit. Walker's family has requested that grieving fans and friends donate to Reach Out WorldWide in lieu of sending flowers. Gibson has shared what he calls words of healing with fans, and Diesel posted a farewell message to Walker on his Facebook page.
