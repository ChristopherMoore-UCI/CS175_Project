Albino whales are rare and Migaloo is the only documented all-white humpback adult, according to Peter Harrison, director of marine ecology research at Southern Cross University in Australia. "Everyone here is quite excited," says Oskar Peterson, who runs a website that tracks sightings of white whales around the globe. But they often hang around Cape Byron searching for mates, so whale watchers may see the albino humpback for a few more days, Harrison says. Migaloo is expected to pass by Cape Byron, the easternmost point in Australia, in the coming hours after passing by Surfer's Paradise, Peterson says. Humpback whales are believed to survive as long as 90 years in the wild, Harrison says.
