Pasinetti reveals a particularly bullish view on rural education in China: "A lot of these (rural) schools tend to be boarding schools. Jiang sees a China where the wealthy will move education resources to a system of new private schools that cater only to them. " Though Jiang's assessment is in line with what has generally been reported about China's rural education challenges, Pasinetti calls it an "irresponsible perception." "It is a huge misconception that local communities aren't invested in the education of their children and grandchildren," says the Teach for China founder. But Jiang is not optimistic about the prospects for education equity in China. While 84% of high school grads in Shanghai go to college, less than 5% of China's rural poor make it to university.
