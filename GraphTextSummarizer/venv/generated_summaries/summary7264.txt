Female veterans also don't "all readily identify themselves as veterans," Parker said. "If we want take care of veterans and families, we've got to focus on female veterans. "We've got a number of preferential efforts going to hire veterans, but you have women veterans in some cases who are opting out of using that on their resume," he added. Also, there are fewer health services in the Department of Veterans Affairs specifically designed for female veterans; some question whether that impacts their ability to successfully transition from the military. The difference in unemployment between female and male veterans is even more dramatic when you consider veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: For women, the rate was 11.2% last month, 5 points higher than it was for men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
