Separatists: Bodies to be returned to Russia Dozens of pro-Russia separatists were killed after Ukrainian security forces launched their assault on Donetsk International Airport on Monday, following the militants' seizure of a terminal. The United States has been using satellites to track Russian troop movements for weeks, and both the United States and NATO have released imagery to bolster their case that Russia had amassed tens of thousands of troops along the border. Taruta said he was in talks with pro-Russia separatist leaders in the region to try to calm the situation, adding that the aim was to "reach real understanding," rather than just a deal. Also in Slovyansk, the self-declared mayor said pro-Russia separatist militants are holding four European observers who have been missing since Monday. About 10,000 troops -- mainly infantry -- remain along Russia's border with eastern Ukraine, the official said, and there are some signs those troops will be pulling back as well.
