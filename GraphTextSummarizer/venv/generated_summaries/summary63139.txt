These are people who suffer any one -- or all -- of the following litany of afflictions daily: Barrel bombs -- randomly dropped, crudely made devices intended to maim, kill and terrify; warring rebel militia, also fighting with the regime; radical Islamic groups; shortages of food and water; people cutting down whatever trees they can find for fuel. Hanaa Singer, a spokesperson for UNICEF, says the situation this winter in Aleppo "is very desperate, regardless whether areas are control of the government control or armed opposition groups. After months of hospitality and risking themselves to assist journalists, rebels now find their ranks bedevilled by radicals and criminals who see foreign media often as a form of currency to help with boosting funds or dealing with another scourge: ISIS. "There is no electricity or fuel for heating which leaves many people with the only choice of cutting trees from the public spaces and use them to heat the houses" she says, adding the situation is even harder for the displaced as many live in "unfinished buildings or collective shelters where they have no windows, doors or even walls. The hill and its associated settlement lies to the northeast of Aleppo city, on a vital road into the rebel-held areas.
