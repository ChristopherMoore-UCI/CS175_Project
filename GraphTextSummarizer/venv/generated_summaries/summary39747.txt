"When countries start trying to address corruption they lift up the stone to see what's underneath and it often looks an awful lot worse than you thought it was," executive director of Transparency International Robert Barrington told CNN. He said for many countries trying to roll back corruption, the starting place is getting more transparency and accountability in the system. Barrington said that despite China's official line on corruption, many people were taking their discontent to the streets and protesting about graft. " Gifts and hospitality While graft may often be standard practice in China, where it is usually disguised as gifts and hospitality, the victims of corruption are often those who can least afford it. He said that because corruption was often difficult to measure, the index surveyed perceptions among country experts such as businesspeople, diplomats and journalists.
