" Lawson, who won two world titles on home soil in 2009, last month blamed Bowls NZ chief executive Kerry Clark for blowing the incident out of proportion. "Kerry Clark turned up the next day, and he's the guy who pushed it -- he pushed it at World Bowls level with coach Dave Edwards, and at the end of the day it got blown way out of proportion. "From what evidence we have, it is our opinion that once the Canadian complaint was referred to it, Bowls NZ not only proceeded with due expedition with the only course available to it but also was at pains through its counsel to provide all other requirements in a timely manner. The New Zealand fours team, of which Lawson was the leader, was accused by Canada of deliberately losing a match against Thailand at the Asia Pacific Championships in Kuala Lumpur last August. Gary Lawson, one of New Zealand's most successful bowlers with a joint-record 10 national titles, has been suspended for six months and fined $NZ5,000 ($3,500) following an incident at a tournament last year.
