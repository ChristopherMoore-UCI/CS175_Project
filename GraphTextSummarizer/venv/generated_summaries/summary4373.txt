Two U.S. states -- Colorado and Washington -- have made marijuana use legal, and several other states, cities and countries have decriminalized its use or have announced plans to do so. And public opinion has rapidly shifted toward softer policies on marijuana use, particularly. But Francis said such policies are "not only highly questionable from a legislative standpoint, but they fail to produce the desired effects." "To think that harm can be reduced by permitting drug addicts to use narcotics in no way resolves the problem," he said. Francis has spoken of the dangers of drug use before. Jamaican officials said this month that they plan to modify that nation's laws to decriminalize pot use and possession.
