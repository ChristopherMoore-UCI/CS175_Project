Army spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher Garver of the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs said that under law, the military could not comment on or release details about Manzella's discharge. " CNN contacted the Army for more details on the nature of Manzella's discharge. " Manzella says that the e-mails and calls went on for months and that after many sleepless nights, he decided to ask his supervisor for help. By the next morning, Manzella's supervisor had reported him as having broken the law under "don't ask, don't tell," the 1993 policy that prohibits anyone who "demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts" from serving in the U.S. military. Despite his professional success, Manzella says he began to question his personal life.
