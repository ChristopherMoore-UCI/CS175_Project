Nevertheless, Republican legislators across the country are needlessly pursuing photo ID laws, at the risk of disenfranchising millions of eligible Americans. Republicans have disingenuously claimed that photo ID laws are necessary to prevent election fraud, but state and federal laws already do that. Her life has spanned nearly a century of progress: The 19th Amendment extended suffrage to women, the Civil Rights movement led to the dismantling of segregation laws, and the Voting Rights Act outlawed overt racial discrimination in elections. As Mrs. Cooper's experience shows us, photo ID mandates simply don't work -- unless, of course, your goal is to prevent eligible Americans from voting. In 2011, Republicans have pushed through photo ID mandates, reductions of early voting and restrictions on voter registration.
