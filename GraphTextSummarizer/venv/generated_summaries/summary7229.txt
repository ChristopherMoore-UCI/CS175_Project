Tucson attorney Michael Piccarreta, who appeared in court on behalf of slain federal Judge John Roll and his family, was asked by reporters afterward what he thought of seeing Loughner face-to-face. -- A federal judge Wednesday entered "not guilty" pleas on behalf of Jared Lee Loughner, the Arizona man accused of fatally shooting six people and wounding 13 others, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. "We can't do anything until I'm assured that Mr. Loughner is on board and able to assist" in his own defense, the judge ruled. But with a new indictment now issued, the judge said it is time to unseal the documents relating to what was found in the Loughner family home. Loughner's public defenders didn't want such a hearing, saying it would be premature and could interfere with their ability to develop a relationship with Loughner.
