"He went out to sea and then he threw her out, like an old rag," van der Sloot told Aruban businessman Patrick van der Eem January 16. In the interview with ABC, van der Eem became emotional himself while saying that van der Sloot talked about Holloway's death "without any emotions. On the tapes, van der Sloot also says that he wasn't certain Holloway was dead before his friend dumped her body in the ocean. On video, Joran van der Sloot says he "didn't lose a minute of sleep" over  knowing Natalee Holloway's motionless body had been taken out to sea and dumped. In the video that aired Sunday on Dutch television, van der Sloot, a suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Holloway, told a man he was with the Alabama teen on an Aruban beach when she apparently died and that a friend of his with a boat disposed of Holloway's body.
