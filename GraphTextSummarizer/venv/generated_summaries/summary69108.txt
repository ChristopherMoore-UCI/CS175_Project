-- U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps broke the Olympics' most hallowed record Sunday by winning an unprecedented eight gold medals in a single Games. Phelps, the hands-down favorite coming into the Games, won the 400-meter individual medley; the 200-meter freestyle; the 200-meter butterfly; the 4X200-meter freestyle relay; the 200-meter individual medley and the 100-meter butterfly. Consider his evolution: At 15, Phelps competed in the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia, placing fifth in the 200-meter butterfly. Sunday's win brings Phelps' total Olympic gold medal count to 14. But, he added, "I've said it all along, I want to be the first Michael Phelps, not a second Mark Spitz.
