"God forbid, that's a distinct possibility," said Andebrhan Giorgis, senior policy adviser for Africa for the International Crisis Group, a non-profit organization that seeks to prevent and resolve crisis. " North-south tensions have worsened even as international attention has focused more on persistent violence in the Darfur region of western Sudan, where roughly 300,000 people have been killed since 2003 in a campaign of killing, rape and displacement that the U.S. calls genocide. A south Sudanese soldier keeps watch, with the threat of civil war still high in the war-torn country. Results from the national census, which began Tuesday, will be used to establish electoral districts and determine political representation in a national assembly, Giorgis said. The war pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians and animists in the south.
