IOC President Jacques Rogge told a media conference Thursday that the fact Diack and Hayatou were not IOC members at the time they had taken money was a "mitigating circumstance." The IOC executive board meeting in Lausanne handed down a warning to IAAF president Lamine Diack of Senegal, while Cameroon's Issa Hayatou, who heads the African football conferederation (CAF), was reprimanded. " Hayatou's reprimand is a more serious sanction, but Rogge confirmed both men will be able to continue all their duties as IOC members. Havelange resigns from IOC The details of the findings in the cases against Hayatou and Diack were published on the IOC official website Thursday. But both will remain as IOC members.
