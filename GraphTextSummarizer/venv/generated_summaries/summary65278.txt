This Sunday, I walked over to view two competing rallies - pro and con - over the Islamic cultural center (with mosque) that is to be built on Park Place, near the site of the former World Trade Center. The majority of people I spoke to seemed clear on the constitutional right to build an Islamic cultural center/mosque, as President Obama asserted. Many signs warned about sharia law, as if the center represents a first step toward the unconstitutional imposition of Islam's religious principles on Americans. The counter protest was pitifully small by comparison; a few dozen people, no stage set or amplifiers, signs with earnest slogans like "grief is no excuse for bigotry or war" or self-righteous non-sequiturs like "America, when did it become O.K to be a bigot and a racist again. But as President Bush and President Obama have repeatedly emphasized, our enemy is most assuredly not Islam as a whole.
