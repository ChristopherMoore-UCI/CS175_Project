Affleck won Best Director honors at this year's Golden Globes, as well as at the Director's Guild, SAG and Producer's Guild awards. I'm talking Oscar winners like Mira Sorvino, Joe Pesci, Louis Gossett Jr. and Kim Basinger. But Oscar gold doesn't always translate into personal gold. In fact, the 2012 Grammy awards had higher overall ratings than that year's Oscar telecast. For example, in 2000, nearly 47% of the people watching TV on Oscar night watched the Academy Awards.
