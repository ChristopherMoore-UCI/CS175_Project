"Peckham as an area has witnessed a phenomenal uplift with property prices almost doubling in certain regions of the area," said Jason Morris, managing director of JT Clarke London, the estate agents in charge of selling the house when contacted by CNN. Property prices in London increased by an average of 18.5% year on year in May according to the UK Land Registry, their fastest annual rise in 11 years. Morris still believes there's more to come from the area given the underlying market conditions and high-demand for property -- although he cautions that other parts of London may soon start to cool off. Not quite what you'd expect from a $1.1 million (Â£650,000) property -- but that's the price sought by the overseas owners of a house in London that until recently was the domain of illegal squatters. The three-bedroom home came on to the market in the Peckham area of the British capital last week and is described by estate agents as "spacious" and an "exciting opportunity" for potential buyers despite the obvious need for "modernization."
