The motley crew of celebrities on the video was assembled by Wilson, an actor, and director/actor Justin Baldoni, who directed a short documentary about Zach for his compelling online reality series, "My Last Days," which runs on Wilson's SoulPancake YouTube channel. When Zach's song was posted to YouTube last year it quickly went viral. She told me about a trip the family took last year, "a sort of pilgrimage to Europe," with 10 intense days of sightseeing. -- Zach Sobiech, 18, passed away Monday morning, surrounded by family and friends. In the past few weeks, donations to Zach's cause -- the Children's Cancer Research Fund -- skyrocketed, as did downloads of his song, "Clouds," which at the time of his death had more than 2.9 million page views on YouTube.
