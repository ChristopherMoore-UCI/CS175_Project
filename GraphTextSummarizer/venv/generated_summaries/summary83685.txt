By comparison, authorities eradicated 330,000 plants over the six-month growing season last month, said Lt. Mike Boudreaux of the Tulare County Sheriff's Department. Authorities uncovered more than $1 billion worth of pot plants in Sequoia National Forest this week. "These are organized drug cartels out of Mexico." Boudreaux says authorities are furious that cartels are operating in a U.S. forest. " Once at the national forest, the growers carry with them everything they need: tents, food, guns, fertilizer, irrigation hose and marijuana seeds. Authorities have arrested 38 people and seized 29 automatic weapons, high-powered rifles and other guns, Boudreaux said.
