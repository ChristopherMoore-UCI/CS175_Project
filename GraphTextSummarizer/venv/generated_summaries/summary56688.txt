"As the plane descended into Atlanta, the flight attendant announced that there was a special guest on board," wrote Frank, in a letter to Delta Air Lines CEO Richard Anderson. Anderson was returning to Atlanta from a business trip,said Delta spokeswoman Betsy Talton. Wanting to share her story with Delta, Frank reposted her letter on Delta's Facebook page. Saying she couldn't remember the last time she flew an airline other than Delta, Frank says the comments she's received are 99% positive, and has been overwhelmed with the responses. Since June 17, it's gotten 194 "likes" and dozens of comments, including a personal thanks from a Delta employee named Cecelia.
