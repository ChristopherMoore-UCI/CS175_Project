By talking to many other parents who have lost children to childhood cancer, I have come to understand that this pain will last until I am gone. Lighting gold is the first step toward greater awareness of childhood cancer -- awareness that will hopefully lead to increased funding, which will lead to more research, that will hopefully lead to a cure for all types of childhood cancer. But there is another reason to light gold: It helps to heal the hearts of parents such as myself who have lost children to cancer. I began my mission to increase childhood cancer awareness in August 2012. Yet the National Cancer Institute devotes just 4% of its budget toward pediatric cancer research.
