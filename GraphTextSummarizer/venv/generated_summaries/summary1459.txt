Preparations were also in place for a special opening night concert in Hyde Park featuring bands Snow Patrol and Duran Duran. London Assembly member Navin Shah told gathered protesters: "I am proud that the Games are taking place in London but the protesters like me are simply against the sponsorship of Dow Chemical who have betrayed the victims of the Bhopal Disaster. Dow Chemicals is a major sponsor of the Olympics, with the multimillion-pound deal including a fabric wrap around the stadium in east London. Taxi drivers gathered at Hyde Park corner as part of a demonstration against Olympic traffic lanes, while protestors held a "die-in" against major sponsor Dow Chemicals outside the Olympic Park in Stratford. Dow Chemicals told CNN it remained "fully committed to our partnership with the IOC and to contributing to a successful, positive London 2012 Games" and questioned whether the protest should go ahead.
