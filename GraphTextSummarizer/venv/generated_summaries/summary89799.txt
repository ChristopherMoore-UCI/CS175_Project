First-time nominees Rush, Deep Purple, N.W.A., Public Enemy, Albert King, The Marvelettes and Procol Harum join previously nominated acts Chic, Heart, Donna Summer, Kraftwerk, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Randy Newman, Paul Butterfield Blues Band and The Meters. Watch a video of this year's nominees To be eligible for a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nomination, artists must have released their work at least 25 years prior to appearing on the ballot. Blues guitarist Albert King has been eligible since 1987, while 2013 marks the first year the seminal hip-hop acts N.W.A. and Public Enemy are eligible. The winners will be revealed in December and the 28th Annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony will be held in Los Angeles at the Nokia Theatre L.A. LIVE on Saturday, April 18, 2013. That means this year's hopefuls released their first single in 1987 or earlier.
