In fact, we tend to see more "Super Typhoons" during El Nino years, and this is true again this year, as Choi-Wan and Melor both reached Super Typhoon status. Since September 1 we have seen eight tropical cyclones, five of which became typhoons, two reaching Super Typhoon status, the strongest classification of tropical cyclones in the Western Pacific. According to Maue, we see more cyclones later in the season during El Nino years in the Western Pacific, and they tend to form farther east. Named storms, however, are a notoriously poor metric for measuring the ferocity of tropical seasons. The answer may be El Nino, which refers to a periodic change in the atmosphere and ocean in the Pacific.
