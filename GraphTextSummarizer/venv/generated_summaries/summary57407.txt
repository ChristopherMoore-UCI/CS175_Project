Democrats, meanwhile, are suffering in Colorado, where Pivit players give Sen. Mark Udall only a 7% chance at winning re-election, and in Arkansas, where Sen. Mark Pryor is at just 5%. Republicans are getting good news in Iowa, where their candidate, Joni Ernst, is at 73% -- as well as in Kentucky, where at 94% Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell currently looks like Pivit's surest thing. The percentages aren't scientific -- they're based on a combination of Pivit experts' analysis of public polling and other race data and players' predictions. -- Republican Gov.

But they're also confident that two embattled Democratic senators will win re-election.
