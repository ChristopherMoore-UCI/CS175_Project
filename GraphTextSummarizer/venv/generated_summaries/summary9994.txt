Media company IAC has "parted ways" with company PR executive Justine Sacco over her tweet: "Going to Africa. Meanwhile, other Twitter users started scoping out Sacco's past messages and flagged other questionable comments she'd made before, like this one: "I can't be fired for things I say while intoxicated right?" All of those messages disappeared, though, early on Saturday, when someone -- presumably Sacco -- deleted her Twitter account. "We hope, however, that time and action, and the forgiving human spirit, will not result in the wholesale condemnation of an individual who we have otherwise known to be a decent person at core." Sacco did not immediately respond to messages left by CNN. Others said they felt sorry for Sacco, regardless of how offensive her Twitter message was, because she hadn't had a chance to defend herself during the 12-hour flight. Parody accounts started to appear on Twitter and Facebook that portrayed Sacco as a mean, bitter person.
