The bombs detonated within a 15-minute span, between 4:30 and 4:45 p.m. Two of the churches are in central Baghdad's al-Karrada district, and the third is in al-Ghadeer in eastern Baghdad. Sunday evening, a car bomb exploded outside a church on Palestine Street in eastern Baghdad just after 7 p.m., the official said. The church is in the al-Jamiaa neighborhood of Baghdad, a former stronghold of al Qaeda in Iraq. The first bombing took place Saturday night at St. Joseph's church in western Baghdad, according to an Interior Ministry official. Many of Iraq's estimated 1 million Christians have fled the country after targeted attacks by extremists.
