Energy secretary defends U.S. nuclear industry Nuclear energy produces practically no pollution, and it is more reliable than other clean alternative sources -- like wind and solar energy -- that depend on the weather, according to nuclear power advocate Burton Richter, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. Michael Vandenbergh, director of the Climate Change Research Network, says he hopes nuclear concerns don't overshadow other pressing environmental issues that Americans should remember as Earth Day approaches. This year, as Earth Day approaches, tragedy and uncertainty may once again temper the mood of the annual event: Japan is still assessing what could be its worst environmental disaster -- the damage to its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. Recent polls suggest that Americans are divided over nuclear energy. When asked by CNN if they are OK with nuclear energy as a source of electricity, 57% of the respondents said they approved, while 42% disapproved.
