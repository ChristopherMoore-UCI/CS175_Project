TSA: Number of guns discovered in airports rising Questions about recent repositioning of airport police The shooting has stirred questions about a recent repositioning of airport police officers around what is known as LAX. By then, security was out in force -- an "enhanced deployment" that included Los Angeles police department officers and air marshals in addition to airport police, according to Airport police Chief Patrick Gannon. A law enforcement source told CNN on Saturday that airport police officers had complained to their union about being "bored with the assignment" of being stationed behind the TSA checkpoint. Ciancia is being treated in a hospital after being shot himself by airport police, Bowdich said late Saturday afternoon. Concurrently, TSA management complained that airport police officers weren't paying attention -- sometimes perusing their phones, using iPads or reading books on the job -- according to the same source.
