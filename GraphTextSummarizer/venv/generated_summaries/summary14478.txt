Customs officials discovered the Bibles during an X-ray scan of their luggage, said Pat Klein, director of the group, which supplies Bibles and other Christian material to people in China and other countries. " President Bush criticized China's record on human rights and religious freedom in a speech he made before going to China for the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics. "I have spoken clearly, candidly and consistently with China's leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights," he said. Klein said he's been bringing Bibles into China for 21 years and had no idea he was breaking Chinese law. "We firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights, religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries," he said.
