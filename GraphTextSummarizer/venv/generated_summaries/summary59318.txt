A late Sergio Ramos goal earned Real Madrid a 2-1 win against Barcelona at the Bernabeu on Saturday as the La Liga leaders slumped to a second consecutive El Clasico defeat. Despite the loss -- just their second in the league this season -- Barca are still way out ahead of on 68 points, but not in an unassailable position just yet, as the match winner Ramos pointed out. Five days after being dumped out of the Copa del Rey by Jose Mourinho's side, the Catalan club were once again forced to play second fiddle to their archrivals. The result takes Real to 55 points and within one point of second-place city rivals Atletico -- who travel to Malaga on Sunday. But thoughts are already turning to Tuesday's last 16 Champions League match up against Manchester United at Old Trafford.
