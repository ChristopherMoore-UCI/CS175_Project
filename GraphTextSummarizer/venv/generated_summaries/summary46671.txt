Turkish diplomats and military commanders have denied speculation that the Patriots could be used as part of U.S.-backed missile defense shield against its eastern neighbor, Iran. The Turkish government is putting itself forward as a neutral party, offering to host talks between Iran and the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China on Iran's controversial nuclear program. During the first Gulf War, Patriot missile batteries were temporarily stationed on Turkish territory. "It is wrong to draw links between the Patriot and Iran," Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu told CNN's sister network, CNN Turk, Friday morning. The White House has said the program was aimed at protecting allies from Iran, not from Russia.
