"They have been tended to and are being given refreshments because the temperature on the tarmac is near 100 degrees," said Yuma International Airport spokeswoman Gen Grosse. "I heard a loud popping sound about three or four minutes before it blew open on us," passenger Greg Hansen told CNN. Southwest said in a statement that the flight crew "discovered a hole in the top of the aircraft." A new aircraft is en route to the base with maintenance, ground crew and customer service agents "to assess the damaged aircraft and support the 118 customers aboard." One of the passengers told CNN affiliate KOVR that the incident occurred shortly after flight attendants took drink orders. The FAA said the captain made a rapid controlled descent from 36,000 to about 11,000 feet after the cabin lost pressure.
