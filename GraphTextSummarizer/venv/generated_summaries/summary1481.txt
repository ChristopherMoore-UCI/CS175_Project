The off-duty, plainclothes officer was driving in the area of the snowball fight when several snowballs hit his vehicle, police said. About 200 people from a D.C. neighborhood had gathered Saturday to brave a snowstorm for a massive snowball fight, CNN affiliate WJLA reported. The uniformed officer holstered his weapon when he recognized the plainclothes officer, Newsham said, according to WJLA. The officer exited the vehicle and yelled at the crowd, WJLA reported; witnesses accused that officer of drawing his gun. The police statement said "there is no evidence that [officers] pointed any weapons in the direction of the crowd or at any individuals."
