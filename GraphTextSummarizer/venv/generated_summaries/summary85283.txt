If China were to use military force, the United States -- which does not support Taiwan independence -- could intervene under the Taiwan Relations Act, a 1979 law declaring that peace and stability in the area are in U.S. interests. Yang reiterated China's diplomatic stance on Syria, which has been the subject of international criticism. "In particular, the U.S. side needs to honor its commitments and carefully and properly handle Taiwan- and Tibet-related issues that concern China's core interests," Yang said at a news conference held on the sidelines of the Chinese legislature's annual meeting. -- Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi on Tuesday called on the United States to tread carefully on issues related to China's core interests in order to build trust and avoid conflicts. Yang said China opposed the development and possession of nuclear weapons by any country in the Middle East, including Iran.
