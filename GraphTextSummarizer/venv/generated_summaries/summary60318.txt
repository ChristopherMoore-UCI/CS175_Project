On a fine evening, it's definitely Soho, especially Old Compton Street, Frith Street and Greek Street. So to blend in, stay away from Buckingham Palace and Green Park, Leicester Square and Oxford Street. Brixton is a great neighborhood, because it sums up all of London's best and worst bits -- it's culturally vibrant, fashionably edgy and economically and socially diverse -- into one big, boisterous, rapidly developing city-within-a-city. London Gold, by Young's, or London Pale Ale, by Meantime Brewery are popular local choices. Try Ellie Goulding's "Lights" for sparkling British pop or Anna Calvi's eponymous album for something altogether more dramatic.
