Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was last month banned for eight matches for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice Evra, and his club made a big show of publicly defending the Uruguay international before finally accepting the punishment earlier this week. -- English football club Liverpool apologized Sunday after an opposing team's player complained of being abused by supporters. A statement on the club's website read: "Whatever the outcome of what is now a police investigation, all of us are deeply sorry for what happened on Friday night and players and our club pass on our sincere regrets to Tom Adeyemi for the upset and distress he suffered as a result of the matter at hand. Oldham's on-loan defender Tom Adeyemi was visibly upset after an incident during Friday's FA Cup third-round tie at Liverpool's Anfield ground. Before the arrest on Saturday, former Oldham player Reuben Hazell claimed on social networking website Twitter that it was a matter of racial abuse.
