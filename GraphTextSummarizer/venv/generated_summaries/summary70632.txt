The evening started well for Alberto Zaccheroni's side and they took an early lead when defender Giorgio Chiellini nodded home from close range. But Getafe refused to lie down and pulled a goal back almost immediately when former Madrid player Dani Parejo dispossessed goalkeeper Iker Casillas before firing into an empty net. That goal was Higuain's 22nd of the season, equalling his tally for the whole of last season. Meanwhile, Juventus continue to struggle in Italy's Serie A and they slumped to another defeat on Thursday, 3-1 at Napoli -- who moved up to sixth place in the table, one ahead of Juve. Real Madrid's 10th successive league victory ensured Manuel Pellegrini's side move above Barcelona on goal difference, just 24 hours after the defending champions had gone top with a 2-0 win over Osasuna.
