"There was a small window of opportunity for the crime to have occurred," Los Angeles Police art theft detective Don Hrycyk said Friday. It took six years for the FBI and Los Angeles investigators to receive a big break in the case in which a $200,000 reward was being offered: an overseas tipster gave information that ultimately led investigators to set up an undercover purchase of the paintings from a man in a West Los Angeles area hotel. One of the biggest art heists in Los Angeles history began when a housekeeper left the home of an elderly bedridden couple. The FBI and Los Angeles police believe other people were involved in the theft. Authorities are still investigating the case, the FBI's Bill Lewis said at Friday's press conference.
