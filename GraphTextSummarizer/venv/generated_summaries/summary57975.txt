6 must-reads from Palin family brawl police report Other people interviewed by police described the Palins as instigators in a brawl that also reportedly included Track Palin and his father, Todd, fighting several men. -- Bristol Palin describes being dragged through the grass and called a series of obscenities during a massive brawl last month in recordings of Anchorage police interviews that CNN obtained through a public records request. She also criticizes Klingenmeyer, saying: "What would he be doin' pushin' girls around, though?" Matthew McKenna, whose birthday was the reason for the party, told police that people had gotten "drunk and stupid" -- and that he had video of the altercation, but wouldn't share it. Klingenmeyer said he'd approached Todd Palin to say that "your daughter's out of line" and that he should get the situation under control. They said Bristol Palin punched Klingenmeyer several times before he restrained her.
