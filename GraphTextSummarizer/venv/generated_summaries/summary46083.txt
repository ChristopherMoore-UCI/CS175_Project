At the beginning of the year, Obama declared 2014 as a "year of action," vowing to pursue his agenda on his own if Congress gets bogged down in partisan gridlock. Sen. Rand Paul castigated President Barack Obama on Friday for his use of executive action, arguing the President is an "arrogant" leader whose policies resemble those of an "autocrat." " The Obama administration has cited a 2001 measure passed by Congress to fight al Qaeda and the 2002 Iraq war authorization as legislation that grants him power to take action against the militant group. While the senator agrees with the President's decision to lead an airstrike campaign against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, he continued to blast Obama for not seeking authorization from Capitol Hill first. In July, for example, he signed an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against employees on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.
