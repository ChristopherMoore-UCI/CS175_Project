-- Oscar Pistorius has been sending the family of Reeva Steenkamp, the girlfriend he fatally shot last year, a monthly payment since March 2013, a probation officer told his sentencing hearing in South Africa on Tuesday. Probation officer and social worker Annette Vergeer told the court that Pistorius' legal team had told her about the payments, of 6,000 rand (about $540) a month, and she suggested that this showed remorse. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel said that Reeva's mother, June Steenkamp, had said she didn't want "blood money." He told the court that Steenkamp's parents had said they would repay the monthly payments in full. Pistorius 'vulnerable' in prison Judge Thokozile Masipa, who presided over Pistorius' high-profile trial and delivered the verdict last month, will decide his sentence, which may or may not see him spend time behind bars.
