Torrential rains triggered the landslide, Red Cross spokeswoman Catherine Ntabadde said by phone from the scene. It occurred in the same region where a landslide killed at least 87 last year near Mount Elgon, on the Kenya-Uganda border. -- A massive landslide swallowed homes in eastern Uganda early Monday, killing at least 23 people, the Red Cross said. Two people have been rescued, but the death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews scour through the site in Bulambuli district. Heavy rain, hilly terrain and inadequate equipment slowed efforts to recover hundreds of people buried last year.
