Norm Coleman will argue many votes were not recounted properly in his bid for re-election to the U.S. Senate. Should Franken prevail, Democrats would be one vote shy of 60, which would give them the power to muscle through major legislative initiatives over Republican objections. The Franken side will ask the Minnesota Supreme Court on February 5 to order Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Secretary of State Mark Ritchie to issue a temporary election certificate so Franken can be seated in the Senate. Coleman was first elected to the Senate in 2002 and has served one term. -- A three-judge panel will begin hearing testimony Monday in Republican Norm Coleman's post-election legal challenge for the U.S. Senate seat.
