The system itself remained a threat, with winter storm warnings from the National Weather Service in effect Thursday night for parts of eight states -- Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho and Montana. The National Weather Service noted that "heavy new snow" falling on top of a "weak snowpack" heightened the threat in sections of Washington, Montana, Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. In more populated sections around Washington state, many restaurants closed, hotels full and roads cluttered by fallen trees Thursday. Even though the state hadn't received requests for assistance "so far," Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire proclaimed a state of emergency Thursday "purely (as) a precautionary measure." By late Thursday afternoon, all three of the airport's runways were open -- after two of them had been closer earlier -- spokesman Perry Cooper said.
