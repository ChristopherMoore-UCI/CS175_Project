-- One of Osama bin Laden's sons has left Spain after he was denied asylum in the country, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman told CNN Saturday. Omar bin Laden left Madrid Saturday afternoon en route to Cairo, Egypt, she said. Bin Laden, who is in his late 20s, stepped off a plane from Cairo at Madrid's Barajas International Airport during a stopover late Monday and informed authorities that he planned to request asylum, the spokeswoman said. Spain's decision came after bin Laden appealed the country's initial decision Wednesday to deny him asylum. He was taken to a secure area of the airport for asylum seekers while his request was processed.
