President Francois Bozize  fled and ended up in Cameroon after rebels took Bangui on Sunday, Cameroon state TV said Monday, reporting a government communique. In a communique published on the AU's website, the union said the rebels violated a January cease-fire agreement and peace deal that had called for rebels to form a unity government under the nation's president. Seleka rebels call Bozize the former president A written statement from an official with the Seleka rebels referred to Bozize as the country's former president and urged residents of the landlocked country to remain calm and prepare themselves to welcome rebel forces. Swift world condemnation France condemns rebels' "use of force" to capture Bangui and said any political transition in the former French colony should be governed by the January peace deal, according to Philippe Lalliot, spokesman for France's Foreign Ministry. But that peace deal also fell apart.
