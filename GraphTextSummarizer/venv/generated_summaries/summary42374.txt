It is a fight between the feudal politics of Pakistan's barons, President Asif Ali Zardari being chief among them, and the military's dominance of its industry, security and strategic sectors. The memorandum called on Mullen to dissuade his friend, Pakistan's army chief Gen. Ashfaq Kayani, from moving against the civilian government in the tense days that followed Operation Neptune Spear -- the U.S. Special Forces raid that killed Osama bin Laden. That struggle, hidden from the world's view through the many years of dictatorship and moribund civilian rule, has now come out in the open as a result of my column's disclosure of a confidential memorandum that Pakistan's then ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, directed me to draft and deliver to Admiral Mike Mullen, then chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. To some in Pakistan, the memo was the product of an honorable civil servant (Haqqani) attempting to save his boss's government from imminent demise at the hands of military men he had come to despise. Haqqani should be offered immunity from prosecution in Pakistan and simply tell the Pakistani people the truth about what he -- and his boss -- did.
