The announcement sounded unsettling, but North Korea had already said in 2009 that its military was no longer bound by the armistice because South Korea was joining a U.S.-led anti-proliferation plan. But during 14 years of Kim Jong Il's rule, the United States and South Korea "had a track record of what North Korea would do and a sense of what to expect," Yun said. But Pyongyang's decisions to carry out the rocket launch and nuclear test were most likely carefully timed, according to Yun, who was part of U.S. teams that negotiated with North Korea under former President Bill Clinton. The U.S. decision to fly B-2 stealth bombers, which are capable of carrying nuclear weapons, over the region only served to further antagonize North Korea amid the annual military drills. Joint military exercises conducted by South Korea and the United States each spring start this week.
