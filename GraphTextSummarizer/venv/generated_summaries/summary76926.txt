Ariel Castro's son: I won't visit dad in prison Prosecutors also have submitted an evaluation of Castro's confinement and abuse of Knight, DeJesus and Berry that was compiled by acclaimed psychiatrist Frank Ochberg, considered a pioneer in trauma science. Castro abducted Knight, Berry and DeJesus separately over a two-year period between 2002 and 2004, according to investigators. At least one of Castro's victims, Michelle Knight, will likely make an impact statement during the hearing, Alicea said. The women and Berry's 6-year-old daughter were held in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home. The women were freed in May after Berry shouted for help while Castro was away.
