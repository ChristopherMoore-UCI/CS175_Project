However, in the past, Romney has expressed support for a federal amendment banning gay marriage and has said that he, unlike Obama, would defend the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as the union of a man and a woman. But if social issues do play a prominent role this cycle, Obama would come out ahead in the resulting debate, said Koppelman, who has done extensive research on the legal implications of same-sex marriage. Analysts say the move could prove to be risky for the president this fall, especially in key swing states like Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia, which have strong conservative bases and demographics that might take issue with the president's stance. Opinion: Obama's most courageous moment "While this president can point to successes in advancing gay civil rights, much more than I think any other president, that final step (of endorsing same-sex marriage) would leave him open to a series of negative attacks that could really alienate swing voters," CNN political contributor John Avlon said Tuesday, before the president made his statement. In an election year that some pundits have predicted will be focused on jobs and the economy, social issues like same-sex marriage have stolen the spotlight a surprising number of times.
