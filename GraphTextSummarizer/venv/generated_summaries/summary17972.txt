"I know that there are a lot of people who are suffering, and my oath, my commitment to them, doesn't end," former Lt. Dan Choi told CNN's Don Lemon. -- A former Army lieutenant who was discharged from service last week for being openly gay said Sunday that he will continue to fight for a quick repeal of the controversial "don't ask, don't tell" policy. Choi was arrested in March for handcuffing himself to a White House fence in protest of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which bars people who are openly gay or lesbian from serving in the military. He admitted his sexual orientation publicly for the first time last year on MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show," prompting the Army to initiate proceedings to discharge him. President Barack Obama is pushing for a repeal of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy.
