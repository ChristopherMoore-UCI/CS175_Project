My parents, Shanthi and C. S. Seshadri, met only twice before their wedding 30 years ago in southern India. He enjoyed cheese puffs, knew how to eat with chopsticks and the names of different types of alcohol. She had never ventured too far out of her town of Vellore, had never heard of these foods and alcohol was an unspeakable word. He was a city boy, had traveled to and lived in various parts of India. They are opposites in many ways.
