Massera took part in the overthrow of President Isabel Eva Peron in 1976. -- Emilio Massera, a former admiral who was part of a military junta that ruled Argentina in the 1970s, died Monday in the hospital where he had been for some time, the state-run Telam news agency reported. The ex-dictator carried a legacy of being one of the most brutal enforcers during the country's "Dirty War," in which the military government sought to purge leftist factions in the country. Together with Jorge Videla and Orlando Agosti, Massera formed the junta that ruled Argentina. The amnesty was later repealed, but Massera's health had deteriorated to the point that he was found unfit to stand trial.
