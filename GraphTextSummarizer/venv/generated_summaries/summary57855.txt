These are the traits the next police chief in Ferguson, Missouri, will need to shrink the ocean of distrust between community and police. "You want to find the best candidate to be police chief," said attorney Benjamin Crump, who has represented the families of both Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. He'll get severance and a year of health insurance and will turn the reins over to Ferguson police Lt. Col Al Eickhoff next week. New York police Commissioner William Bratton said there are two issues confronting the heads of police forces. The police department was already groaning under the epic weight of months of nearly constant protest and last week's release of a damning Department of Justice report that found evidence of discriminatory conduct on the part of Ferguson officials.
