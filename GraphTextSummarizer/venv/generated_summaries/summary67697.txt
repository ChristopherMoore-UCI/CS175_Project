"Wrestling will now join the seven shortlisted sports -- baseball/softball, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, wakeboarding and wushu -- vying for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program as an additional sport," the IOC said in a statement. "In an effort to ensure the Olympic Games remain relevant to sports fans of all generations, the Olympic Programme Commission systematically reviews every sport following each edition of the Games," the IOC said in its statement Tuesday. Whichever sport is chosen will join the 25 sports the IOC listed Tuesday as core sports for 2020: athletics (track and field), rowing, badminton, basketball, boxing, canoeing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, football (soccer), gymnastics, weightlifting, handball, field hockey, judo, swimming, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, tennis, table tennis, shooting, archery, triathlon, sailing and volleyball. Wrestling has been a part of all but one of the modern Olympic Games since their inception in 1896, missing only the 1900 Games in Paris. Federation officials will meet this week in Thailand to discuss the IOC's decision and how to make a case for wrestling at the May IOC Executive Board meeting.
