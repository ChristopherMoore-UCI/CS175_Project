-- South African President Jacob Zuma has sent a delegation to neighboring Zimbabwe to rescue what appears to be a cracking power-sharing government formed last year by President Robert Mugabe and his former political foe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. Nqakula said the delegation would meet with Mugabe, Tsvangirai and Zimbabwe's deputy prime minister, Arthur Mutambara. Last week, Tsvangirai publicly accused Mugabe of making unilateral decisions in the 20-month-old coalition government. As a result, Tsvangirai wants diplomats posted by Mugabe to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, and New York, the European Commission, South Africa, Sweden and Italy not to be accredited. Tsvangirai threw confusion into the coalition government after he said he would not recognize the legitimacy of some 10 ministers, five judges, the attorney general, chief of police and the head of the central bank head.
