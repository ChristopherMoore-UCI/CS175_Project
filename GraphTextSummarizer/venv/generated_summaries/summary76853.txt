Vitamin D The good news: A short stroll in the sun supplies enough vitamin D to maintain healthy bones; emerging research points to strong anti-cancer benefits, too. But on days when you aren't going to spend much time in the sun, leave spf off legs and arms to let them manufacture vitamin D. In just 10 minutes, a light-skinned person produces 10,000 to 20,000 IU vitamin D. Because skin pigments can interfere with vitamin D synthesis, darker-skinned people produce it more slowly. If you have dark skin or live or work where you are seldom exposed to sunlight, talk to your doctor about supplementing your intake of vitamin D. Hollis recommends choosing a supplement that contains vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol; it's the vitamin's most readily absorbable form. Take vitamin D, the "sunshine" vitamin, so named because it is produced primarily in the skin through a chemical reaction that requires ultraviolet light. We went to the experts for help in sorting out what the science really says about vitamin D and three other nutritional riddles, and more importantly, what that means for you.
