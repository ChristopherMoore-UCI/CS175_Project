Egypt Egyptians are putting a revolutionary twist on the traditional Eid greeting "Eid Mubarak," meaning "a blessed Eid," said engineering student Abdulrahman Khedr. But as the sighting of a crescent moon officially marked the beginning of Eid on Tuesday, feelings are decidedly mixed for many Muslims. "I remember celebrating Eid for the last couple of years in Libya," she said. In Karachi, where ongoing rivalries between three political parties vying for power have left dozens dead, Faisal Kapadia said Eid this year is a "hollow one." "Never have I felt the apathy and sadness I feel now at the death of so many of my brothers and sisters in this last month," said Kapadia, a writer and entrepreneur in Pakistan's largest city. Traditionally, Eid prayers are a communal affair -- held in open fields to accommodate crowds too big to contain in mosques.
