Top takeaways from the CIA torture report Feinstein said that Hayden painted a "starkly" different picture of certain interrogations in a hearing than what committee staff members learned about those interrogations from cables. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden as well as some top political voices are issuing blistering responses to the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on torture. Their statement said the report created the "false impression that the CIA was actively misleading policy makers and impeding the counterterrorism efforts of other federal government agencies during the Program's operation." Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said he understands why torture was used on detainees and argued that American officers aren't the bad guys. "Everything here happened before I got there [to the CIA], and I'm the one she [Sen. Feinstein] condemns on the floor of the Senate? "I'm mentioned twice as much in there as [former CIA Director] George Tenet â€” but George and [former CIA Director] Porter Goss had 97 detainees during their tenure, while I had two." He said statements he made about the program's later days -- when the interrogation system was better regulated and more finely tuned -- were applied to the earlier days of the program when he wasn't in charge.
