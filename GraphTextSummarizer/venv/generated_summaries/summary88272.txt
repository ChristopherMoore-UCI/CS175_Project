Such measures might not produce immediate results, but like the campaign against drunken driving, would steadily enhance gun safety and raise higher the obstacles to the obtaining of weapons by people likely to misuse them. But one of the many, many families bereaved in this year of random violence -- maybe they will be moved to follow for the victims of gun crime the lead Candice Lightner established for the victims of reckless driving? Here's one more such paradox: Obama has done literally nothing to restrict the (large and growing) rights of gun owners. Yet the election of Obama has triggered an angry reaction among gun owners fiercer than anything seen under Clinton. That campaign should be led from outside the political system, by people who have suffered loss and grief from gun violence.
