These challenges involve setting up "virtual corridor" traffic systems in the sky that guide PAVs under existing aircraft, using advances in swarm technology to stop them crashing into each other and working on landing systems that do not involve air traffic controllers. Google holds open the door Dr B端lthoff said recent advances, and social acceptance of, Google's driverless car had given real hope to researchers on the project. "It's been a dream of mine since I read it in science fiction books and in the movies as a kid, but science fiction is becoming the reality these days," says Dr. B端lthoff,  director of perception, cognition and action at the Max Planck Institute in T端bingen, Germany. A flying car for everybody "There's no intention with this project to actually build the system," explains Dr.B端lthoff whose research is part of a 2007 EU report called "Out of the Box: Ideas About the Future of Air Transport". Under the four-year project, the EU has drawn together six institutes from across Europe to look at the problems associated with commuting in personal aviation vehicles (PAVs).
