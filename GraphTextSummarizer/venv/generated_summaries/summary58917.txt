Israel has said any organization or state that wants to give humanitarian aid to Gaza can do so in coordination with Israeli authorities via existing land crossings into the Palestinian territory. Israel says it is concerned about the smuggling of arms to Gaza militants intent on attacking the Jewish state. But activists say Israeli's embargo of goods into Gaza from land and sea punishes civilians in the tiny and densely populated strip of land along the Mediterranean coast. Vessels attempting to break Israel's blockade of Gaza have sparked controversy -- and violence -- in the past. The boat, named Estelle, was about 30 nautical miles off the coast of Gaza when it was stopped, said Reut Mor, an Israeli activist.
