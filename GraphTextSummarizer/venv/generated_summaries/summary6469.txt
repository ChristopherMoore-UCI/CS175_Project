-- Mohammed Bdaiwi, the Baghdad bureau chief of Radio Free Iraq, was shot and killed Saturday in Baghdad, police said. Radio Free Iraq is a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The guard was eventually handed over to police once Iraq's prime minister made a surprise appearance to demand that he be taken into custody, the station reported. Bdaiwi was on his way to his office, near the residence of Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, when he was shot by a military guard after an argument between them, the radio station reported. At least 10 people were killed Saturday in shootings and explosion across Iraq, police said.
