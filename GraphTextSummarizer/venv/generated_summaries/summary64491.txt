" Poland and Ukraine primed for Euro 2012 kick-off Hamilton believes that with clubs now possessing wide-ranging global scouting networks, the need to pay such large sums to agents should be lessened. " Hamilton also outlined the danger of having agents who represent managers and players employed by the same club, such as when manager Mark Hughes and Argentina striker Carlos Tevez were both at Manchester City while being represented by Israeli Kia Joorabchian. "They discover and scout players themselves, and the clubs that aren't scouting players are relying on agents. "I think certain clubs rely on particular agents who are not just representing players, but also representing managers," he said. With agents primarily employed to negotiate deals on behalf of players with their respective clubs, Hamilton argues it is the footballers themselves who should foot the bill for their services.
