A July 2007 Government Accountability Office report found that "systems supporting the US-VISIT program have significant information security control weaknesses that place sensitive and personally identifiable information at increased risk of unauthorized and possibly undetected disclosure and modification, misuse and destruction. The Department of Homeland Security is now collecting scans of all 10 fingerprints from foreign travelers entering the United States at Dulles International Airport, and plans to extend the program to all international airports in the country by the end of next year. The 10-print system gives the United States the ability to compare fingerprints of travelers with criminal and terrorist databases compiled by the FBI, the Defense Department and others. Discover America Partnership, a trade group representing the tourism industry, is cautiously supporting the program, but urges a greater effort by the United States to make foreign travelers aware of the program. Privacy advocates such as the Electronic Privacy Information Center claim the system puts personal information at risk.
