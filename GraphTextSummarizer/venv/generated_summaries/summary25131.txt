" A Defense Ministry official said, "It's unfortunate the civilians were there in the wrong time." Yemen's al Qaeda threat The United States is the only country known to have conducted drone strikes in Yemen. The drone strike came on the heels of the recent emergence of a video showing a large gathering of al Qaeda members in Yemen. Even though more voices have risen within Yemen in opposition to U.S.-led drone strikes, President Abdu Rabu Hadi has shown no sign his counterterrorism strategy will change, especially because al Qaeda has proved to be a bigger threat than anticipated. Operatives targeted A source from the region said the strike targeted three "well-known" al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula operatives linked to a training camp in southern Yemen. Only this week, Yemen's Foreign Minister Abu Bakr al-Qirbi said his country could handle the al Qaeda threat alone.
