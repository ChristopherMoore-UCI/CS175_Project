Li rose through the ranks of CYL while completing a master's degree in law and then an economics doctorate under Li Yining, the guru of market reforms in China. -- If body language is a good gauge of political standing, Li Keqiang is looking very much like China's premier-in-waiting. Last Monday, Vice Premier Li delivered the keynote speech at the Boao Forum, a meeting of business and political leaders held yearly in southern Hainan province. Inside and outside classrooms, students and faculty debated big topics like "Where to, China?" "Like everyone in our generation Li Keqiang was keen for new ideas," recalls Yang Baihui, an international politics major. "China's reform has entered a crucial juncture", Li said, stressing that "reform and innovation" are the driving force to promote economic and social development.
