" Crump said Martin's father, Tracy Martin, wept through much of Friday hearing, and the family was distraught at the prospect of Zimmerman being able to reunite with his family. "I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son," Zimmerman said in an unusual appeal directly to Martin's family before he testified in the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford. Timeline of case Martin's family and the special prosecutor appointed to investigate the case have rejected that argument, saying they believe Zimmerman disobeyed the instructions of a police dispatcher to stop following Martin, racially profiled him and unjustly killed him. The decision to grant Zimmerman bond followed a hearing in which his wife and parents testified that he was a caring, nonviolent man. "This was the most disingenuous, insulting thing I've ever seen," said Martin family attorney Natalie Jackson.
