Today, there are fewer than 200, and that number will continue to decrease if North American indigenous language revitalization efforts aren't considered paramount to the continuity of Native American communities by the United States. Then, the government worked in collusion with Christian institutions to stamp out Native American languages, including Navajo. Recently, a neighbor and I were discussing Native American languages. There are various campaigns to revitalize Native American languages. My hope is that when President Barack Obama visits with our Native American leaders this month at Standing Rock, North Dakota, he will be reminded of the significant contributions of Native American peoples like Chester Nez.
