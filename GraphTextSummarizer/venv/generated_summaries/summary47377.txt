The sad part is that the idea was good to begin with: develop a common curriculum that outlines what students should know at every grade level so that students attending different schools in different states get roughly the same education. They worry about a one-size-fits-all process that holds back high achievers so all students in different schools and different states get the same level of education, even if the results students have in common are mediocre. Americans are part of a collective with public roads, public libraries, public schools. If you take underperforming schools and less-demanding curricula in some states and raise them to a level where they compare to higher-performing schools in states with more demanding curriculum, you give students a "common" experience. In the 1960s and 1970s, Americans grappled with "new math," a dramatic change in how math was taught in elementary schools that was prompted in part by the federal government's desire to ratchet up teaching of math and science.
