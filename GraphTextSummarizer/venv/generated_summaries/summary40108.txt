Your brain makes this neurohormone naturally to "tell the body that it's time for sleep," says Naiman. Some studies have shown that valerian can help increase sleep quality (it's packed with antioxidants, too). Good to know: You don't have to stick to traditional aromatherapeutic scents -- any fragrance that makes you feel good can be calming, says Dr. Phyllis Zee, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of neurology and the director of the Sleep Disorders Center at Northwestern University, in Chicago. Certain fragrances, including lavender and lemon balm, promote snooze-inducing relaxation, says Rubin Naiman, Ph.D., a sleep specialist at the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, in Tucson.
