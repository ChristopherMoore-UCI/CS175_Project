Henry made Catherine of Aragon his queen and George wed Mary of Teck. George V was also the second son -- and also became heir after his elder brother died young from influenza. The current Queen's father, George VI, was the second son of George V, and was never meant to be king. What will be even more difficult for this second child is that he or she will grow up in a world of camera phones and social media, where private photos are gold dust and royals are the biggest celebrity big game of all. We are fascinated by royal children -- most of all by the second or the "spare heir."
