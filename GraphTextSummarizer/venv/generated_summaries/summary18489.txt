For me, as a Muslim who belongs to a rich culture of Arab, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, terrorizing human souls is an act against God. In Islam, worshipping God is connected to peace, whether peace of mind or body. Starting our deeds by "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful" is a recognition of the basic human attitudes towards everything in life. Abducting school girls in Nigeria by the so-called "Boko Haram" is an act of torture and terrorism against innocent souls. This entails a different and old interpretation of God.
