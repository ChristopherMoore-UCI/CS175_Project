"Dilshan has that magic touch with bat, ball and on the field," Sri Lanka skipper Kumar Sangakkara told reporters. -- Co-hosts Sri Lanka became the first team to book a quarterfinal place at the Cricket World Cup after demolishing Zimbabwe by 139 runs on Thursday thanks to a superb all-round performance from Tillakaratne Dilshan. The Zimbabweans then lost their last nine wickets for just 63 runs to be all out for 188 in 39 overs as Angelo Mathews got rid of Tatenda Taibu (4) and opener Brendan Taylor (80) before Dilshan had Prosper Utseya (4) stumped by wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara. The result put Sri Lanka top of Group A, a point ahead of second-placed New Zealand, who Sangakkara's team face in their final match on March 18. And both openers scored a century to set a new first in a World Cup match, with Dilshan making 144 from 131 deliveries faced and Tharanga 133 off 141 after Zimbabwe captain Elton Chigumbura won the toss and opted to field first.
