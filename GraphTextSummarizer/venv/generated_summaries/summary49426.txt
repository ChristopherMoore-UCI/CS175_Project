"We wanted to create a space where activities that were traditionally outdoors in nature are brought to an indoor environment," Robin Goh, Changi Airport Group spokesperson, tells CNN. "In order for Changi Airport to stay ahead amidst intensifying competition from other airports, it's important for continuous innovation to be introduced," says Goh. Scheduled for completion in 2018, if all goes according to plan, Project Jewel is likely to cement Changi's reputation who is recently named SkyTrax World's Best Airport for the third consecutive year. A winner of multiple best airport awards over the years, Changi served 54.1 million passengers in 2014. More than simply a new terminal, Jewel Changi Airport will be constructed on the site of the old parking lot fronting the existing Changi Airport's Terminal 1, and will be "seamlessly connected" to the existing terminals, according to the airport.
