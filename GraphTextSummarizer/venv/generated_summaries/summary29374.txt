-- The Mississippi Supreme Court on Thursday denied the state attorney general's attempt to have it reconsider its assent to controversial pardons -- several of them for convicted killers -- issued earlier this year by outgoing Gov. Haley Barbour. Other convicted killers who, like Gatlin, received full pardons and were named in Hood's brief include Charles Hooker, who was convicted in a 1991 murder, and Anthony McCray, convicted in a 2001 murder. In a statement afterward, Barbour said the decision "reaffirmed more than a century of settled law in our state," but acknowledged that his pardons have been difficult for those who themselves or had family members victimized by those who went free. Barbour, who also is former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has said that he believes in redemption and that people deserve second chances. Attorney General Jim Hood has been a harsh and persistent critic of the 214 pardons and clemencies issued by Barbour in January, shortly before the governor left office.
