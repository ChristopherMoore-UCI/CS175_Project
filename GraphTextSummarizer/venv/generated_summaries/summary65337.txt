According to Senate rules, a certain number of hours of debate can still be demanded by any senator once a filibuster is broken. Known as "post-cloture debate time" in Senate parlance, up to eight hours of debate time is allowed for nine of the 10 nominees on Majority Leader Harry Reid's list. Typically, Senate leaders would agree to allow that debate time to run with the Senate out of session. Until last month, longstanding Senate rules required a supermajority of 60 votes to break a filibuster over a presidential nominee. Customarily, Senate leaders work together so the chamber can conduct its business during more regular hours.
