In an interview Monday on Fox News, Paul was asked: "If a vote were to come to Congress to ask you to go to war against ISIS -- and to call it that -- would you vote yes?" "Yes," he responded, though he added that he'd try to sunset the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force, a measure that the Obama administration is using as the legal basis for airstrikes against ISIS. It seems that if a measure came to the Senate that only approves the training/arming of Syrian rebels, Paul would not support such action. -- Sen. Rand Paul has gotten questions from the media lately at nearly every stop and in almost every interview about where he stands on combating the threat of ISIS. The United States has already supplied arms to Syrian rebels in the past year, and Paul said Monday on CBS that it would be a "mistake" to ramp up that effort. Paul has said he doesn't support the arming and training of vetted Syrian rebels to fight against the militant group.
