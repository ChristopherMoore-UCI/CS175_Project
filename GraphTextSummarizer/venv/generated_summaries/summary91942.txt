In a statement, Israeli settlement watch group, Peace Now, said the move is a blow to the efforts by U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, to work out a framework agreement for the resumption of negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis. Netanyahu has issued tenders for 11,047 settlement units in East Jerusalem and the West Bank , and were promoted through different stages," said Lior Amihai, acting director for Peace Now. "A government that issues tenders for almost 1,900 housing units is fooling its own public, the Palestinians leadership, the international community and especially the U.S. Secretary of State, who has just recently left the region," Peace Now said in a statement. "As much as Mr. Kerry intensifies his efforts to achieve peace, Netanyahu intensifies his efforts to torpedo Kerry's efforts. Of the total, 2,258 are to be built in the West Bank and 3,091 in East Jerusalem, Peace Now said.
