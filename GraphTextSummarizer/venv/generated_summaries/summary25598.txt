This is a message left on the their home answering machine, allegedly by a male Green Tree representative: "Stanley McLeod, you need to call Green Tree and get your act together and make your payments on your mortgage and quit playing these games. McLeod is suing her mortgage company, Green Tree Servicing, for the wrongful death of her husband. She believes constant harassing phone calls and other tactics eventually killed him. Billy Howard is an attorney who runs the Consumer Protection Division for Morgan & Morgan. Howard represents McLeod and has about 500 similar cases against companies who use what he called "Tony Soprano tactics," a reference to the fictional organized crime leader who was the central character in the HBO drama "The Sopranos." "I think it's frightening because these companies go after people and they utilize tactics people just don't know are illegal," Howard said.
