For the U.S., corporal punishment is prohibited in public schools for 31 states and the District of Columbia. More than 70 additional nations have specific laws in place that prohibit corporal punishment in schools. Since then, many other countries in Europe have also instituted bans, as have New Zealand and some countries in Africa and the Americas. Two states, Iowa and New Jersey, extend their bans to private schools as well. In some cases, such as the United States, there are partial bans in place depending on either location or the age of the children.
