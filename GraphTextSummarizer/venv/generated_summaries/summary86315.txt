Over the weekend, South Korean President Park Geun-hye visited the port where the rescue operation is based to console families and encourage divers. The work has become even more difficult because divers have faced closed cabin doors blocked by debris. Park In-ho, head of the hospital where Lee died, said the diver's blood was tested and appeared normal except for high potassium. CNN's Stella Kim reported from Seoul; Ed Payne wrote from Atlanta No one has been found alive since the ferry sank April 16 with a passenger load largely made up of high school students on a field trip.
