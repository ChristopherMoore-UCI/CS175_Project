So it may be no surprise that among the first artifacts to be brought up from the wreck of the CSS Georgia in Savannah are two sets of leg irons. Texas A&M is working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Savannah to conserve many of the artifacts for eventual display. Conservation of selected artifacts and parts will be done at Texas A&M and will take about two years to complete. Contract divers are out on the site every day, weather permitting, not more than a couple miles east of the city's famous River Street and waterfront. Much of it is is detritus of the wreck: small iron plates, nails and spikes.
