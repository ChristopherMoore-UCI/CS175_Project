His ouster came as Kurdistan Regional Government President Massoud Barzani called on all Kurdish members of the Iraqi parliament and Kurdish ministers in the Iraqi government to return to the Kurdistan region in northern Iraq, said Khasro Goran, a leader in the KDP Kurdish Party. The Kurds strongly dispute al-Maliki's allegations and say he wants to scapegoat the Kurds for his failures in northern Iraq and divert attention from how ISIS militants have poured into Iraq and waged warfare against the government, a senior Kurdish official said. In a possible portent of growing factional conflict, a leading Kurdish minister was removed from Iraq's government, and the Kurdish semi-autonomous government took over two oilfields in the north, officials said Friday. "This morning's events have shown that the (Kurdish Regional Government) is determined to protect and defend Iraq's oil infrastructure whenever it is threatened by acts of terrorism or, as in this case, politically motivated sabotage," the Kurdish government said. Kurdish participation in Iraq's government formation will depend on the outcome of the decisions made by the Kurdish alliance in Irbil, a senior Kurdish official told CNN.
