Congressional approval wouldn't solve the problem with international law, a senior administration official said, but it would enhance the legitimacy of military action. The president's decision to launch military strikes that would be "limited in duration and scope" is illegal under international law, legal experts say. Obama has long grappled with the issue of how to deal with civil war atrocities when international law doesn't offer a way to stop them. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry, who made a forceful case for military action on Friday, have carefully portrayed al Assad's actions as violating "international norms." That's a problem for a president, who has tried to distinguish his administration from that of President George W. Bush on the idea that he is bringing the United States back into compliance with international law.
