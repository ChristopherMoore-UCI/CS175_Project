The 2009 champion from Argentina and Snedeker, who tied for third at Augusta in 2008, both shot three-under par rounds of 69 to finish on seven under par, one shot ahead of Australia's Adam Scott, who also shot 69 on Saturday. Woods is tied for seventh place with South Africa's Tim Clark whose five-under par round of 67 was the best of the day. Guan's third round was two strokes better than Rory McIlroy, who played his way out of contention with a disastrous round of 79. -- Former champion Angel Cabrera and America's Brandt Snedeker are tied for the lead after the third round of the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club. Woods ended up shooting a round of 70 and wasn't firing on all cylinders but is now well placed to mount a challenge in Sunday's final round.
