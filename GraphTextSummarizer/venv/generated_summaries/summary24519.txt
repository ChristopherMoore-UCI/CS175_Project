" On Saturday, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir ordered the shutdown of pipelines carrying South Sudanese oil through Sudan, accusing South Sudan of supporting rebels in Sudan. "At 9 p.m. on Wednesday, a group belonging to the Justice and Equality Movement...aided by South Sudan launched an attack, specifically ... into Sudanese territory," said Al-Sawarmi Khalid, the Sudanese army's spokesperson, in a statement to the semi-official Sudanese Media Center (SMC). Instead, JEM accused the Sudanese government of not being able to carry out its plans with shutting the flow of South Sudanese oil, and of being was responsible for the blast. -- Rebels aided by South Sudan bombed an oil pipeline in the disputed district of Abyei, a Sudanese army official said on Thursday. When they separated, South Sudan acquired three quarters of Sudan's oil reserves.
