Rickard acknowledged that the images show "elements of social media and technology that aren't pretty," but he said the series is also about YouTube as medium and the way it has become "a platform where people have a voice â€” it is an immediate stage with reach. " Abusive behavior exploited by technology is not a new story, but Rickard becomes a predator among the predators, hunting for images to tell this dark American tale. Rickard hopes the book will be a wake-up call on issues of race, economic injustice and technology, saying, "It is this America that I see in my mind, not the land of the free." "The range of search terms for the work was huge but largely tied to the broken elements of the American economic spectrum," Rickard said. I determined quickly that 'crackheads' or 'girls passed out' or 'hood fight' were search terms on YouTube that would bring up massive amounts of content that people were uploading.
