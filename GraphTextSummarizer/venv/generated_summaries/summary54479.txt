But harmful mutations in BRCA genes can lead to breast or ovarian cancer. But harmful mutations in BRCA1 can lead to breast cancers that are harder to treat because they don't respond to hormone therapies used to treat tumors that occur more often in women with BRCA2 mutations, according to The Breast Care Site. Myriad Genetics, which created a test to screen for such mutations, said the risk of breast cancer can be as high as 87% for those with BRCA abnormalities. Only 3% to 5% of women who develop breast cancer have a BRCA mutation, and about 10% to 15% of women with ovarian cancer have a BRCA mutation. Harmful BRCA mutations also raise a man's chance of developing cancer of the pancreas, skin or prostate.
