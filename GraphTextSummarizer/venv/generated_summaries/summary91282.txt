-- The president of Tokyo Electric Power Company, the business at the heart of Japan's nuclear crisis, apologized again Wednesday, a day after the situation there was designated a Chernobyl-level nuclear accident. " Japan declared the Fukushima Daiichi crisis a Level 7 event on the international system for rating nuclear accidents Tuesday, putting it on par with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. The top-scale designation was based on the massive release of radioactivity since the accident began, particularly in its early days, and classifies Fukushima Daiichi a "major accident" requiring long-term countermeasures. His speech comes after Japan's prime minister vowed to wind down the month-long crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant "at all costs." The crisis began with the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated northern Japan.
