Although he outspent his rivals, Romney received just 175 delegates on Super Tuesday, compared with at least 504 for McCain and 141 for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, according to CNN estimates. With Romney out, Sen. John McCain is locked in as the front-runner in the GOP race. The crowd booed when Romney mentioned McCain, saying, "I disagree with Sen. McCain on a number of issues." Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama viewed Romney as a more vulnerable candidate, preferring to run against him rather than McCain, CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley said. Romney had won 286 delegates through the Super Tuesday contests, compared with McCain's 697.
