-- A Connecticut judge ruled Wednesday that he does not have the authority to grant bail for Kennedy cousin Michael Skakel, who awaits a new trial in the 1975 slaying of neighbor Martha Moxley. Moxley's body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. As part of the proceedings for a new trial, Skakel could be allowed to leave jail on bail, but Bishop said he wants the criminal court to decide on the conditions of any possible release.
