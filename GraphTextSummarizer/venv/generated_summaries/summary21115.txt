"He's the last person that we'd think that would happen to," Bahauddin Ali Khan, a member of the mosque that Khan regularly attended in Bolingbrook, Illinois, told CNN affiliate WLS. Agents searched Khan's Bolingbrook home, where he lives with his family, finding pro-ISIS writings and drawings in common areas of the house, according to the criminal complaint. Khan wrote that there is an obligation to "migrate" to territory controlled by ISIS, which has used bloodthirsty tactics to seize control of large areas of Syria and Iraq. That person, Khan told agents, was to take him into ISIS territory. According to the complaint, Khan told authorities he was planning on working in some type of public service for ISIS -- like a police force -- providing humanitarian work or taking up a combat role.
