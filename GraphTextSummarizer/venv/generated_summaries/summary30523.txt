After months of leveling humiliating criticism at the Israeli prime minister, here was President Obama calling Netanyahu a man of peace, speaking of the "unbreakable" bond between the United States and Israel and essentially giving Israel a green light to skirt transparency in its suspected nuclear program, citing its "unique security requirements." Obama administration officials before the meeting, and Obama himself during his press availability with Netanyahu, emphasized that moving to direct talks was the most important issue on the agenda. Obama wants Israel to "widen the scope" of Palestinian security control in the West Bank beyond the current few cities, citing advances made by Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. Netanyahu's delegation left Washington satisfied that Obama understands Israel's security needs. But the conundrum is that Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has refused to restart direct talks without a full settlement freeze, while Netanyahu is resisting extending the existing ban until talks start.
