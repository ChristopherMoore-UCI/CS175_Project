Australian officials have said they don't think missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is in the patch of the southern Indian Ocean where underwater pings were picked up last month. Australian officials say they remain confident in the conclusion -- reached by a team of experts from Boeing and aviation authorities around the world, including the United States and Europe -- that Flight 370 ended its journey in the southern Indian Ocean. With that zone now ruled out, Australian authorities, who have been coordinating the search in the southern Indian Ocean, say attention will shift to a new area as large as 60,000 square kilometers. " The underwater search will remain in the same overall region, as officials are basing their focus on an analysis of satellite, radar and other data that concludes the plane ended up somewhere along an arc stretching into the southern Indian Ocean. Search coordinators say they are looking for sonar equipment that can be towed by a ship, an autonomous underwater vehicle with a mounted sonar device and optical imaging equipment.
