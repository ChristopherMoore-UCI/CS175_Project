Since baseball became a professional sport in the mid-19th century, players and coaches have been tucking tobacco between their gums and cheeks and spitting out brown saliva. Atlanta Braves coach Bobby Dews remembers the first time he was offered a "chaw" of tobacco, as they call it. "Everyone was chewing tobacco in the minors," Dews says. Even before Major League Baseball announced this week that there would be no more tobacco chewing within sight of the fans, teams would bring in well-known players such as Bill Tuttle, a former Detroit Tigers outfielder, to tell players about his tobacco chewing days and the throat cancer he battled. During World War II, Dews' father was playing for the Atlanta Crackers in AA baseball.
