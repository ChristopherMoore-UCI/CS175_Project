In Port Said, dried blood caked seats in the stadium where fans of the hometown Al-Masry club stormed the field after a 3-1 win over Cairo's Al-Ahly club. "We will know what the reason is and who caused the catastrophe that happened in Port Said." Tantawi said the incident is not "something that will let Egypt fall." Thursday's violence occurred as the country began three days of mourning for those who died Wednesday in the Mediterranean city of Port Said. The incident at  Port Said, at the mouth of the Suez Canal, ranks among the world's worst sports disasters. In the aftermath, horrified fans questioned why police had not stopped the Al-Masry fans from rushing the visitors' stands, why exits were barred and how fans were able to take weapons into the stadium.
