-- British innovator James Dyson, who has built a multi-billion dollar empire around his distinctive vacuum cleaners, has described patent laws across Europe as "absolute madness", saying they are unhelpful for inventors and small businesses. But Dyson points to the red tape surrounding the patenting process as being a massive hurdle for businesses wanting to develop ideas. "There shouldn't be this endless rigmarole of 'could this have been devised by one skilled in the art?'" Because the current system involves many expenses due to varying jurisdictions throughout the continent, a Europe-wide patent is the answer, according to Dyson. " Issues surrounding plagiarism are not limited to businesses, with consumers also feeling the impact of the high cost of producing and securing new inventions, Dyson said. Dyson told CNN he wants the patent system in Europe radically overhauled.
