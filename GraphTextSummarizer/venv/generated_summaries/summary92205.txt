Simpson hopes a splash of water can flush out some of the best-loved qualities of his work and counter the perception of Adams as a capturer of lifeless landscapes. Philippa Simpson, the museum's touring exhibitions manager, aims to re-energize engagement with Adams' photographs by drawing attention to the life imparted into his images by the irrepressible movement of water. As an avid explorer of California's Golden Gate coast, water reappears in all its forms through Adams' body of work. "Adams was a coastal boy and the interest in the sea, and water more generally, permeated his entire career," says Simpson. Simpson describes how vast movements of water -- frozen in time by Adams' trademark razor-sharp shooting -- bring life to one of the most well-worn images on display in the exhibition.
