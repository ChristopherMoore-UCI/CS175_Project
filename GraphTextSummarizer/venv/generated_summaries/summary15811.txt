"Greatest Photographs of the American West" 2013 exhibition dates Booth Western Art Museum, Cartersville, Ga.; through March 10 Buffalo Bill Historical Center, Cody, Wyo.; through August 11 National Museum of Wildlife Art, Jackson Hole, Wyo.; through August 11 Rockwell Museum of Western Art, Corning, N.Y.; through September 15 At the end of summer, the exhibition begins traveling again. -- When discussing his favorite images from the "Greatest Photographs of the American West" traveling photography exhibit, National Museum of Wildlife Art president James McNutt, who curated the exhibit, starts with the oldest: William Henry Jackson's "Mountain of the Holy Cross." From early documentary efforts like Edward S. Curtis' celebrated North American Indian portraits to David Alan Harvey's contemporary impressions of modern Native life, from the pristine glories of awe-inspiring landscapes to the gritty exploitation of the region's resource wealth, McNutt's opus is both a loving gaze at the magnificence that attracts so many to the West, and an unblinking eye on the pressing challenges of keeping the romance alive. " Jackson's famous shot became one of the country's favorite photographs of the 19th century and effectively introduced photography in the West. The final cut -- winnowed to 185 images for the show and 75 for the award-winning book -- shows the West's myriad faces thematically grouped into Legends, Encounters, Boundaries and Visions, corralling into categories an epic visual record of almost a century and a half of exploration of the American West with the camera.
