South Korean forensics officials say they are sure the body found in a plum orchard last month is Yoo Byung Eun, a billionaire fugitive who was wanted in connection to the fatal Sewol ferry crash that claimed nearly 300 lives. Yoo had been wanted by South Korean authorities, as prosecutors believed he and his sons controlled the shipping company that operated the Sewol ferry that sank on April 16. Yoo's wife, Kwon Yun-Ja, is under arrest in South Korea. Yoo's body can now be turned over to his family, but the whereabouts of most of his children are not known. But the country's forensics service said there was no way to determine the cause of death of Yoo, 73, because of the decomposed state of the body.
