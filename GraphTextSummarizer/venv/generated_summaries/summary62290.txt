Meanwhile, in the day's other Bundesliga match, Werder Bremen had the better of the chances but were held to a 0-0 draw by Hannover. But hopes Podolski's strike would inspire the home side fell flat a minute after half-time when Levan Kobiashvili scored a winner to move Schalke up to third in the table. Schalke's early goal came courtesy of a corner to the far post where Gerald Asamoah was waiting to head the ball back across goal. Defeat for Cologne leaves them rock bottom with just one point from their opening five games. The decisive moment in the game arrived just a minute after the interval when the dangerous Farfan attracted the home defence in the middle of the area before laying off a pass for Kobiashvili to thrash left-footed into the net.
