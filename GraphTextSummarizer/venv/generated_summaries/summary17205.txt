-- Two more suspects in the killing of a Hamas leader in Dubai, both carrying British passports, have been identified, police said Tuesday. This brings to eight the number of people who entered Dubai with British passports to allegedly take part in the killing of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of the military wing of the Palestinian Islamist movement. Al-Mabhouh was behind the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers in 1989, according to Hamas. Dubai's police chief has said he is "99-percent" certain that the Mossad, the secretive Israeli foreign intelligence unit, is behind al-Mabhouh's killing. The development is likely to deepen concerns over how the killers acquired the passports a day after the European Union condemned what it said were brazen cases of identity theft.
