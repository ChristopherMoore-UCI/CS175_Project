-- American skating star Apolo Anton Ohno snatched a record-breaking silver medal at the Winter Olympics in Vancouver after a final-lap crash by his South Korean rivals in the 1,500 meters race, while skier Hannah Kearney gave the United States a first gold medal in Saturday's final event. Kearney, by comparison to Ohno, won her first Olympic medal as she edged out defending champion Jennifer Heil of Canada to win gold in the final run of the ladies' freestyle moguls event, with American Shannon Bahrke taking the bronze. Ski-jumping Switzerland's Simon Ammann earlier claimed the first gold medal of the 2010 Games when he won the opening men's ski-jumping event on Saturday, while Dutch skater Sven Kramer took out the first title on ice in a record time. She became the first athlete from the East European nation to win at a Winter Olympics, with her winning time of 19 minutes and 55.6 seconds heading off Germany's Magdalena Neuner in second place (19:57.1). Her points tally of 26.63 lifted her above Heil's 25.69, which gave hosts Canada a first medal, with U.S. national champion Bahrke tallying 25.43 to add to her silver medal from Turin in 2002.
