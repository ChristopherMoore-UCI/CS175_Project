"I'm so glad House Republicans met Democrats half way, as Senate Republicans did months ago," said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who said the bill will "protect and create 3 million jobs." "At the end of the day, Senate Democrats fought for red tape, while House Republicans fought for jobs -- and got some important wins," said a House GOP leadership aide. Republicans also won reforms that would allow states to opt out of federal mandates to spend highway dollars on bike paths and highway beautification projects. Passage of the bill, which funds construction for highways, bridges and other transportation projects for two years in every state and congressional district in the nation, would be a significant accomplishment for lawmakers, who have spent much of this session mired in partisan gridlock. "This bill is far from perfect, but it is a substantial improvement over the original Senate bill." Although the agreement includes many of the reforms the House GOP pushed for, it falls far short of the broader transportation and energy bill that House Speaker John Boehner unveiled earlier this year.
