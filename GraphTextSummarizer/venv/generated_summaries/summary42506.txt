The search began Thursday after Swedish intelligence picked up an emergency radio call in Russian, reported The Local, citing the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet. Helicopters, battleships and minesweepers searched waters off Sweden's capital, Stockholmm on Tuesday, The Local reported. Russia on Sunday denied it has any vessel in Swedish waters. Why would a Russian sub snoop around in Swedish waters? "We don't know what it is," but we "are prepared to use anything necessary to bring the vessel to the surface if we need to," Swedish military spokeswoman Therese Fagerstedt told CNN on Tuesday.
