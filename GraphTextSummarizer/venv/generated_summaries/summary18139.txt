-- Former hostages held at the American Embassy in Iran are hoping the Academy Award for Best Picture for "Argo" boosts their efforts to be paid reparations for the ordeal. "As an essential condition of their release from captivity, however, the United States agreed in the Algiers Accords to bar claims by the former hostages against Iran from U.S. courts. John Sheardown, Canadian 'hero' in hostage crisis, dies "The United States government remains deeply grateful to the former hostages for their service to their country, and expresses its sympathy for the suffering they experienced during their ordeal," the State Department said in a statement. He and other former hostages believe Iran has never been held accountable for the episode and should have to pay each of them restitution. The hostages were released in January 1981 under a set of agreements, the Algiers Accords, which stipulated that the hostages could not sue Iran for damages.
