" Gadahn's reported presence in Karachi "is an indication of how easily it is for al Qaeda sympathizers and Taliban sympathizers to hide in that city," Robertson said. -- Conflicting reports emerged Sunday about whether Adam Gadahn, a U.S.-born spokesman for al Qaeda, has been arrested in Pakistan. In October 2004, he began appearing in disguise in al Qaeda videos. A government official told CNN Mehsud died as a result of a January 14 unmanned drone attack in North Waziristan; other sources said Mehsud died near the city of Multan in central Pakistan while on his way to a treatment center in Karachi. In December, Gadahn released a video message in English offering condolences to "unintended Muslim victims" killed in attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere.
