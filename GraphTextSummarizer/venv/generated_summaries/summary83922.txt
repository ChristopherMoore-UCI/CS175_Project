-- The father of a 7-year-old girl abducted and killed near her north Georgia home this month said Sunday he is "relieved" to have his daughter back in Puerto Rico, where she will be buried this week. Services were held Saturday for mourners in Georgia before her body was flown to Puerto Rico. Galarza told CNN last week that he last saw his daughter two years ago, when she visited for the summer. Authorities have accused 20-year-old Ryan Brunn -- a maintenance worker at the complex -- of killing her. She was supposed to visit for Christmas this year, Galarza said.
