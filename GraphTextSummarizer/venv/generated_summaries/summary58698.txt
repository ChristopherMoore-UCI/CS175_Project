Prince Philip received a birthday visit on Monday from his wife, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, as he recovered from abdominal surgery at a London hospital. It went as planned and Philip is "progressing satisfactorily." Prince Philip: The man behind the queen Philip left Greece a year after he was born there, following the 1922 overthrow of his uncle King Constantine I. Philip has had a number of documented health problems in recent years, including treatment for a blocked coronary artery in December 2011 and a hospitalization in June 2012 for a bladder infection. A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Philip, who turned 92, was "comfortable and in good spirits." Despite his roots, he has a mixed ancestry and, like his wife, is a great-great-grandchild of Britain's Queen Victoria.
