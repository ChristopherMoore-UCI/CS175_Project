Yep, "Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa" topped the chart with an excellent $32 million in its first three days, giving Knoxville his sixth No. 1 movie after his three "Jackass" films, "Men in Black II," and "The Dukes of Hazzard." "Bad Grandpa" finally knocked "Gravity" out of first place, but Warner Bros' $100 million space drama starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney still managed a terrific hold in its fourth weekend. "Bad Grandpa," which Paramount made on a $15 million budget, didn't feature the entire "Jackass" crew, but it still posted numbers in line with the rest of the irreverent prank franchise. Audiences gave it a middling "B" CinemaScore grade, but if it performs similarly to its "Jackass" predecessors, "Bad Grandpa" should finish with about $70-80 million total. This weekend, a Ridley Scott-directed drama starring Michael Fassbender, Javier Bardem, Cameron Diaz, and Brad Pitt got trounced at the box office by Johnny Knoxville in an old-man costume.
