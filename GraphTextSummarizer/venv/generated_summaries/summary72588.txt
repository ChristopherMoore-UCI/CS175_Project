Anderson's film work began when he was a swordfight stunt double and coach for Errol Flynn in the 1953 movie "Master of Balantree," but perhaps his best-known job was when he put on Vader's helmet in "Star Wars" for the famous duel with Luke Skywalker, according to the Internet Movie Database. " "He was truly one of our greatest fencing masters and a world-class film fight director and choreographer, and both the fencing community and film world will miss him," Philip Bruce, president of the British Academy of Fencing. -- Former Olympic fencer Bob Anderson, the man who wielded Darth Vader's light saber, died Sunday at 89, according to the British Academy of Fencing. His credits include the 1993 remake of "The Three Musketeers," "The Mask of Zorro," "The Legend of Zorro," "Die Another Day," "The Princess Bride" and "The Parent Trap." Anderson "passed away peacefully this morning at 4 a.m. in hospital," Bruce said in a posting on his group's website.
