At about 2 a.m., campus security officers returned to Fagan and McIntosh's apartment and confiscated a pistol and a shotgun from the apartment. Because the apartments are owned by Gonzaga, both police and campus security responded when Fagan and McIntosh called 911. On the night of October 24, students Erik Fagan and Daniel McIntosh were in their apartment when there was a knock on the door. Meantime, Fagan and McIntosh have asked university security to return their firearms, but that hasn't yet happened. In a disciplinary board hearing on Friday, the board, made up of three faculty members and two students, found Fagan and McIntosh guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons, according to Chuang.
