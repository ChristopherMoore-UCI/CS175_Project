" Giordano has told authorities that he is the beneficiary of a $1.5 million accidental death insurance policy tied to Gardner, a local official told CNN. According to a transcript of a police interview, obtained by CNN, Giordano told police that he feared for his life when he signaled for Gardner to turn back and didn't look for her as he swam for shore. On Tuesday, authorities on the Caribbean island questioned Giordano for an eighth time in connection with the disappearance of Robyn Gardner. Giordano told authorities he was snorkeling with Gardner and signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office. He said he believed Giordano's continued detention stems from the high-profile case of Natalee Holloway, an Alabama teenager who disappeared on Aruba in 2005 and has never been found.
