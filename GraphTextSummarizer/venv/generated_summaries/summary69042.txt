Provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers; -- Install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers (current regulations do not require such a backup); -- And, adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers.

The Interior Department, facing the reality of energy drilling dangers, is in the process of toughening rules for offshore oil exploration. Based on 55 years of engineering experience, including a stint as chief offshore engineer for Shell, Bea is warning government investigators that blowout preventers are not reliable in the deep sea and he worries they could fail in the Arctic, where the industry is pursuing energy resources.
