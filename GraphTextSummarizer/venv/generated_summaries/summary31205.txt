Cornejo was found at Hedglin's residence, but authorities don't know whether she went there voluntarily or was abducted, Colorado Springs Police spokeswoman Barbara A. Miller told CNN at the time. Dramatic surveillance camera video shows a Skywest pilot running to a jet that, once set in motion, clips an airport building in last July's bizarre incident involving pilot Brian J. Hedglin, who stole the plane while being sought on suspicion that he had killed his former girlfriend. "Although the FBI responded to the incident in St. George this past summer, at this point we are not making any further comments on the matter," said spokeswoman Debbie Bertram. "The answer to that is 'We'll never know,'" said St. George, Utah, city spokesman Marc Mortensen. Had Hedglin gotten the plane aloft at St. George Municipal Airport, the regional jet -- a CRJ 200 -- contained enough fuel to fly for about 50 minutes, according to the police report.
