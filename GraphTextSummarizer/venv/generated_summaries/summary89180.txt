Passengers who fail to comply with standard airline policies -- such as staying seated when the seat-belt sign is on or turning off electronics when the plane is landing  -- also spark confrontation, airline attendants said. " Laws prohibiting interference with flight crews and attendants on aircraft have been on the books for decades. In 2000, a series of incidents in which passengers verbally harassed and hit crew members prompted the FAA to boost the civil penalty fine for interfering with a crew member from a maximum of $1,100 to $25,000. Crew members are used to experiencing the wrath of passengers who are frustrated by delays and missing baggage. Many confrontations occur when a flight attendant refuses to serve an intoxicated passenger another alcoholic beverage, according to flight attendants.
