A sexual harassment complaint has been filed against New Zealand Prime Minister John Key after a waitress complained about him repeatedly pulling her ponytail at an Auckland cafe. When I realized she took offense by that I just sort of immediately went back, gave her some wine, apologized and said I was terribly sorry." Politicians and public figures also rounded on Key, with Green MP Metiria Turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate. As politicians, our job is to make people feel safe at work, not bullied," New Zealand media reported her as saying. CNN affiliate TVNZ reported that the complaint was filed Thursday morning by Graham McCready, an accountant described in the New Zealand press as a "serial litigant," who has previously launched private prosecutions against Key. The National Council of Women of New Zealand, while accepting that Key was joking and did not mean to offend, criticized the premier.
