In the best-case scenario, we should get big money out of politics, stop big corporations from influencing our laws and reclaim our republic for "We the People." The use of GMO ingredients in food is similar to the issue of money in politics. In the long term, we need to level the playing field by reducing the amount of money that big corporations spend influencing legislation and elections. What's at stake is I-522, the initiative that would mandate labeling food that is genetically modified. Maine and Connecticut have passed mandatory GMO labeling laws.
