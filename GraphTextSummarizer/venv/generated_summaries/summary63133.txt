Pilots generally learn how to fly new aircraft by undergoing many weeks of training at ground school classes and on plane simulators and, finally, by being shadowed by a "check airman." Hersman also downplayed the significance of the pilot's experience, saying it's typical for pilots to change aircraft types. It's routine for pilots with fewer than 100 hours of flight time on an aircraft to land at Runway 28 Left, Weiss said. This new wrinkle in the mystery surrounding the crash raises questions about how pilots are trained to fly new aircraft. Does it matter that the pilot at the time -- aviation veteran Lee Kang-kuk -- has only 43 hours of flying time in the 777?
