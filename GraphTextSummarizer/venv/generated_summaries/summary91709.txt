Slovenia entered the race for a Security Council seat some 11 years ago. They join the Security Council's five permanent members -- China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States -- plus five countries elected to two-year, non-permanent membership last year -- Colombia, Germany, India, Portugal and South Africa. Four countries, including Pakistan, were elected last week to join the Security Council in January as non-permanent members for two-year terms. Starting in January, the council will have as members seven of the nine nations known to have nuclear weapons: China, France, India, Pakistan, Russia, the United States and the United Kingdom. "In the coming year, the Security Council will address many pressing global challenges, including nuclear non-proliferation, counter-terrorism, conflict prevention and resolution, promotion of democracy and human rights, and the oversight of complex UN field operations, and the United States looks forward to strong partnership with the incoming members," it read.
