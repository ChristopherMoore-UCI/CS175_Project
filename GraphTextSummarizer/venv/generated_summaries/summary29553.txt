-- A New York man the federal government dubbed the nation's "Most Wanted Deadbeat Parent" has pleaded guilty to evading $1.2 million in child support payments. E. Lynch, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. In November, Sand was arrested while trying to enter the Philippines without proper identification and was deported to Los Angeles, where he was taken into custody by U.S. marshals. He admitted to relocating from New York to Florida and then fleeing the country after arrest warrants in 2000 and 2002 were issued, according to Loretta. In the past decade, Sand ran a business in Thailand, accumulating fees that eventually totaled more than $1 million in back child support.
