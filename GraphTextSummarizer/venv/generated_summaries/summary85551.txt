Gary Pruessing, the president of the ExxonMobil Pipeline Company, told reporters Tuesday that spilled oil had been confirmed 25 miles away, with most pockets of oil within 19 miles of the leak site. LaHood has also proposed federal legislation that would improve oversight on pipeline safety and increase the maximum civil penalties for pipeline violations from $100,000 per day to $250,000 per day, and from $1 million for a series of violations to $2.5 million for a series of violations. The Silvertip Pipeline is a 12-inch pipeline about 69 miles long and carries crude oil from the Silvertip station in Elk Basin, Wyoming, to an ExxonMobil Refinery in Billings, Montana, federal officials said. -- Federal authorities have ordered ExxonMobil to make safety improvements to a ruptured pipeline in Montana that caused 750 to 1,000 barrels of crude oil to gush into the Yellowstone River last week. ExxonMobil reported 750 to 1,000 barrels (32,000 to 42,000 gallons) of oil spilling into the river in Laurel, about 16 miles southwest of Billings.
