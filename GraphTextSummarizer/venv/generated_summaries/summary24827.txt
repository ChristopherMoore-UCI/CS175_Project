Opinion: Freedom Group, a gunmaker ripe for an ethical takeover Dr. Cornel West and Rush Limbaugh sounded stunningly similar notes by suggesting that because the victims of other gun violence didn't look like the Newtown victims, the national media essentially didn't care.

Jackson outside a convenience store, marking the 500th homicide of the year in the Windy City, most of them due to gun violence.
