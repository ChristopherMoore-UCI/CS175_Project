Queen Bey, don't you realize your racy lyrics and dirty dancing are emasculating a whole generation of young men, promoting lesbianism (so implies Sandy Rios, FOX contributor), and celebrating "gangsta culture" that causes the collapse of black families. As for the fear of all things Beyonce, she added, "A powerful black woman with Beyonce's values may be seen by some as a threat -- to their racial and gender privileges, world view, and way of life. "There was a period of time when men who were feminized and confused about their own sexual identity had entered the priesthood; sadly some of these disordered men sexually abused minors; a terrible tragedy for which the Church mourns. She told me, in a fabulously spirited way, that some people bash Beyonce because she sends out the "scariest" message possible: "Feminism is cool. "A number of men -- and women -- reject feminism because they fear that it will destroy the social order that they are comfortable with," Frances Negron-Muntaner told me.
