Bill, the first hurricane of the 2009 Atlantic season, was heading west-northwest at near 16 mph as of Tuesday afternoon. Hurricane Bill is expected to continue toward the northwest Tuesday night and Wednesday. Although Bermuda may escape a direct hit from Bill, it might experience strong waves and fierce winds, meteorologists said. "On this track, the core of Bill will be passing well to the northeast of the northern Leeward Islands late Wednesday and early Thursday," forecasters said. The center said Bill is a large storm, with hurricane force winds extending outward up to 45 miles (75 kilometers).
