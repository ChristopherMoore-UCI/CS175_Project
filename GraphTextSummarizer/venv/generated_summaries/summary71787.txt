Shwygar Mullah says the wife of Gadhafi's son Hannibal poured boiling water on her for failing to keep a child quiet. CNN first met Mullah on Sunday while visiting the luxurious former home of Hannibal Gadhafi. CNN has been inundated with offers of assistance for Mullah and is working with humanitarian organizations and medical officials to get help for her. And after Aline Gadhafi found out about the kind actions of Mullah's co-worker, he was threatened with imprisonment if he dared to help her again. As a CNN crew was about to leave, one of the staff members mentioned a nanny who worked for Hannibal Gadhafi.
