Last month videos captured protestors confronting Anaheim police and officers shooting rubber bullets at mostly Latino residents. "I believe Anaheim residents should have a say in how they want to be governed," Tait told CNN. Just because of one man, doesn't mean that everybody's the same," said Anaheim resident Perla Castillo. "I really think that the community needs to look at themselves," said Anaheim resident Alexandra Araiza. Latino residents feel that under the current conditions they are not being represented adequately -- especially in the wake of videotaped violent confrontations between police and Latino residents.
