Designed to serve those students who were "left out" by the school system or "left behind" by competitive Duke Ellington auditions, Yarborough says, the institute provides young local musicians with free jazz instruction, lectures, professional workshops and paid performance opportunities. After obtaining donated space in his local D.C. church, Yarborough and his wife, jazz vocalist Esther Williams, created the nonprofit Washington Jazz Arts Institute. Yarborough provides Washington youth the opportunity and guidance to nurture their musical talents, not only as an educator at the Duke Ellington School of the Arts but also at his nonprofit jazz arts institute. As part of its goal to inspire and cultivate jazz audiences, Jazz at Lincoln Center sponsors youth events including an annual nationwide high school jazz band competition and festival, a Band Director's Academy and a popular concert series for kids. But when some school music programs in his district were cut, Yarborough noticed that many other students who had a desire to learn an instrument no longer had an opportunity to play or nurture their talent.
