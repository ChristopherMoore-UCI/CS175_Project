CNN vote count: Budget deal nearing Senate approval, but not there yet Final congressional approval of the elusive budget agreement would mark a rare win for bipartisanship and a step up for a Congress infected with political dysfunction and held in low public esteem with midterm elections less than a year off. But after reading details of the agreement, many Senate Republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill. Senate supporters of a bipartisan budget compromise that aims to prevent another shutdown moved close Monday to securing the votes they need to clear a crucial upcoming test vote after several conservative Republicans announced their support. Orrin Hatch of Utah, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Johnny Isakson of Georgia joined four other Senate Republicans who had already said they will either support the bill or, at a minimum, vote in favor of critical procedural motions that require a supermajority of 60 votes to prevail. Graham, Wicker, and Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, sent a letter to their Senate colleagues urging them to oppose the bill over the reduction in military benefits.
