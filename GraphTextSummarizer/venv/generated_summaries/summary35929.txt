It was about an Arizona woman who found a chicken foot in a package of breast meat from Safeway. -- It's been a rough month for chickens. PETA hoped it could stand at the intersection near where the accident happened to alert livestock truckers to be extra careful and to remind motorists that "chickens are among the most abused animals on the planet. " PETA spokeswoman Shakira Croce added that "the best way to prevent crashes like this is to go vegan so that chickens don't have to make the trip to the slaughterhouse in the first place." Personally, I love the idea. Kevin Hottman, a city traffic engineer, noted that it's a congested area and the statue "would be a distraction and possibly a hazard." So, now, chickens in Salem will just have to live in constant fear of another roadside tragedy while they're on their way to get slaughtered.
