Fellini's beautifully choreographed tableau in the Trevi Fountain sees young journalist Marcello (Marcello Mastroianni) rendered helpless as buxom screen goddess Sylvia (Anita Eckberg) draws him into her spell. The highlight of Woody Allen's confessional masterpiece is Annie's (Diane Keaton) first meeting with Alvy (Allen) at the tennis club where we're blown away by her vitality, ebullient charm and fresh contrast with Allen's wound-up, navel-gazing New Yorker. The laughing couple freewheel down the cobbled streets past Sacr√© Coeur, filled with the delirious exuberance of new love. -- Take a handful of screen goddesses and a clutch of matinee idols, put them together and one thing's sure to happen. After ninety minutes of vacillating, Harry and Sally have one final bout of verbal sparring before they finally get it together for good.
