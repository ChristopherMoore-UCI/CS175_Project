"We've seen incredible advances in HIV treatment, but to end the epidemic, we need to ensure all at-risk pregnant women are tested for HIV, and if they are positive, they receive HIV treatment so their babies can be born HIV free," said Nancy Mahon, global executive director, MAC AIDS Fund. -- Every day in sub-Saharan Africa 700 children are infected with HIV, mostly through their mothers, according to the United Nations. The effort is the brainchild of John Megrue, chairman of private equity firm Apax Partners, who was concerned with the spread of HIV to the smallest and most vulnerable people in sub-Saharan Africa. "I am thrilled that the fashion community has so generously added their time, talent and voice to our collective efforts to meet the serious, but achievable challenge of eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV by December 31, 2015," said With just one pill a day -- a combination of several anti-retroviral medicines -- a mother with HIV or AIDS can almost completely eradicate the risk of passing the disease on to her baby, according to Born Free.
