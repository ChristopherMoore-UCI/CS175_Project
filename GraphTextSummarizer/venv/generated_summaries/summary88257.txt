Yemen has become a key al Qaeda battleground, with Yemeni security forces carrying out offensives against suspected militants. A much smaller number of people turned out to demonstrate in favor of President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the sources said. Egypt is also wracked by protests in the wake of the demonstrations that unexpectedly forced Tunisia's longtime President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to leave the country. There were at least four demonstrations Thursday in the capital Sanaa, local journalists told CNN. Authorities arrested Tawakkol Karman over the weekend, accusing her of organizing anti-government protests in Sanaa.
