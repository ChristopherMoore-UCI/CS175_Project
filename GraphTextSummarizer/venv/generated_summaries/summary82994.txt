"Boats loaded with migrants fleeing the ongoing conflict in Libya have been making the journey to Italy and Malta over recent months, sometimes with tragic consequences. More than 30,000 migrants and refugees from Tunisia and Libya have risked the dangerous journey to Lampedusa since last February. Scores more were still missing Friday as a rescue operation by Tunisian authorities continued. "Desperate passengers rushed to one side, seeking rescue by the Tunisian coast guard and fishing boats that had approached the vessel," and the boat capsized, the agency said in a statement. The overcrowded boat, which set sail Saturday from Tripoli, was headed for Lampedusa, in Italy, carrying about 850 people.
