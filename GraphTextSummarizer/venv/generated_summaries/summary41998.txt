As expected, the four original members of Black Sabbath -- Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward -- announced recently they will reunite and tour in 2012, including a headlining set at the Download Festival in June. Rubin said it sounds like the four guys in Black Sabbath getting together and playing, and Butler agreed. "I was a very alienated young person," Rollins said, "and when I heard Black Sabbath I realized my life had a soundtrack. The surprise news was that the reunion will include a new album, produced by Rick Rubin, due next fall. I realized there were people out there using music to make great statements.
