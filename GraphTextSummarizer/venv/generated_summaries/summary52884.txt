In an interview with Esquire conducted by his son, Nick, legendary rocker and KISS frontman Simmons said that -- thanks to a crumbling business model, including "file-sharing and downloading" by fans who believe they "were entitled to have something for free" -- "rock is finally dead. -- Add Gene Simmons to the list of people pulling the plug on rock 'n' roll. Simmons, of course, is far from the first to lament the decline of rock. " "I am so sad that the next 15-year-old kid in a garage someplace in St. Paul, that plugs into his Marshall and wants to turn it up to 10, will not have anywhere near the same opportunity that I did," Simmons said. But rock will never die," wrote Bill Brenner.
