Higher pressure readings would mean the leak is being stopped, while lower pressure indications would mean oil is escaping from other parts of the well. The money will help replenish a $1.5 billion federal trust fund established to pay for damages associated with oil spills. Among those costs is skimming oil on the surface of the Gulf. Scientists estimate that 35,000 to 60,000 barrels of oil have spewed daily from BP's breached well and Allen cautions that even if the engineering containment efforts work, there is still a lot to be done in a disaster that has affected the environment and the livelihoods of people from Louisiana to Florida. "There's still a significant amount of oil out there, and the oil recovery and the impacts of this oil will probably extend well into the fall in terms of oil coming ashore, tar balls, beach cleanup, and then we will be moving of course at that point of the natural resources damage assessment trying to understand the long-term environmental ecological impact of the event," Allen said.
