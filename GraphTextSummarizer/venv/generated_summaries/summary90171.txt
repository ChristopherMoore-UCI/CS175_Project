"A couple of hours ago, I thought I'd had it," she told New Zealand network TV3 Tuesday. Officials said they had given up hope of rescuing at least 100 people who were trapped in the Canterbury TV building in downtown Christchurch. One was Anne Vos who was rescued Wednesday from the rubble of the Pyne Gould building in the central business district, according to Australian and New Zealand media. The death toll from the 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck Christchurch this week has risen to 113, police said Friday morning.
