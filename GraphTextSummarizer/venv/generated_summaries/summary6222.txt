Oppenheimer's 2012 film helped open up public discussion about a troubling and little-spoken of period in Indonesia's recent history: human rights groups estimate between 500,000 to 1 million Indonesians were killed by military death squads during anti-communist purges in 1965 and 1966 that helped cement the "New Order" regime of General Suharto. In December community screenings will take place across Indonesia, and Karseno, encouraged by the recent election of Joko Widodo as president, feels optimistic that the country can get over its "mental block. " After a multi-year investigation, the country's National Commission on Human Rights in 2012 declared the massacre a gross violation of human rights. "That screening on Monday night was a big, big moment," says 54-year-old Irawan Karseno. " As head of the Jakarta Arts Council, Karseno was instrumental in bringing the film, Joshua Oppenheimer's companion piece to last year's Oscar-nominated "The Act of Killing", to a captivated audience of around 1,500 people.
