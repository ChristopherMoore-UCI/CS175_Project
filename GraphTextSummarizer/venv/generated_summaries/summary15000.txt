Otherwise, check out the Fondazione Querini Stampalia, a stunning palazzo in central Venice that hosts temporary art exhibitions alongside a permanent museum of fine art and antiquities. But recent developments show that the city is in fact thriving -- due in large part to the many artists and designers who have chosen to make the city their home, and because each year it is host to exciting events such as the alternating architecture and contemporary art biennales, and the Venice film festival. Both were developed by French billionaire and art collector Francois Pinault to showcase his impressive contemporary art collection, which includes work by artists like Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst and Takashi Murakami. -- When people think of Venice, three things come to mind: gondolas, art and sinking buildings. SEE: If you want to see contemporary art outside of the Biennale, which takes place every two years in the Giardini Pubblici, look no further than the Punta della Dogana and Palazzo Grassi.
