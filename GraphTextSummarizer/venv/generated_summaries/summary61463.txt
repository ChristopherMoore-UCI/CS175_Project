Caterham F1 has been sold by Tony Fernandes and his partners to a consortium of Swiss and Middle Eastern owners, who are led by former Midland and HRT F1 principal Colin Kolles. It will be run by former Dutch F1 driver Christijan Albers, who will be assisted by Manfredi Ravetto, replacing current team principal Cyril Abiteboul. In closing his Twitter account, Fernades, who is the founder and chief executive officer of Asia's first low-budget carrier Air Asia said: "F1 hasn't worked, but love Caterham Cars." Caterham, who are sponsored by CNN, finished bottom of the constructors' championship in 2013 and are struggling again this season. " It ends a four-year stint in the sport for Fernandes, who combined his role at Caterham with being chairman at football club Queens Park Rangers, who recently were promoted to the English Premier League. Caterham joined F1 in 2010.
