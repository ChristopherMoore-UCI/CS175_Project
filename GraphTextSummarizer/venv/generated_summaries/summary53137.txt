About 40 Turkish soldiers watching over the Tomb of Suleyman Shah in northern Syria have been evacuated amid the continuing security crisis, Turkish officials said. As part of the Treaty of Ankara in 1921, Turkey was allowed to keep the tomb in Syria, raise a Turkish flag over it and place guards at the white marble mausoleum. The danger in Syria has gotten so bad that even ancient remains -- and the Turkish soldiers who guard them -- had to be removed. The tomb and the sarcophagus were temporarily moved to a new site within Syria close to the Turkish borders, the Foreign Ministry said. Even though the tomb is in Syria, it is considered a Turkish exclave.
