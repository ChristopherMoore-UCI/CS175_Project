Pedestrians and shoppers died, and three officers were among more than two dozen people injured, said government official Javid Marwat and Peshawar Police Chief Tahir Ayub. For more than a decade, Peshawar has been the front line for the Pakistani government's fight with militant groups. Police suspect the blast on the outskirts of Peshawar targeted a vehicle carrying Pakistani air force officials, they said. Peshawar is the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the gateway to Pakistan's tribal region, which is largely ungoverned and has a strong militant presence. -- Nine people were killed in an explosion Wednesday in northwestern Pakistan
