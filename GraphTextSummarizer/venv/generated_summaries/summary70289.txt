Provide independent third party verification of the safety and effectiveness of blowout preventers, -- Install a secondary control system for subsea blowout preventers (current regulations do not require such a backup), and -- Adhere to new inspection and reporting requirements for blowout preventers. And a growing number of blowouts in the past decade have caused offshore oil drilling to become sloppier. By September the Interior Department intends to require blowout preventers to have two sets of shear rams spaced at least four feet apart in case a drill pipe joint is in front of a shear during an emergency. The Interior Department, facing the reality of energy drilling dangers, is working to toughen rules for offshore oil exploration. If the blowout preventer cuts through drilling pipe it can easily cost $10 million to replace that section of pipe and put the rig back into production, said Baugh.
