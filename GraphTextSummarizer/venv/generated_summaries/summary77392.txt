In a one-sided final at the Estadio Monumental, Uruguay almost took the lead in the third minute when Diego Lugano's header was blocked on the line by Paraguay keeper Justo Villar. It marked Uruguay's first Copa America triumph since 1995 and they can now boast one more title than hosts Argentina, who they beat in the quarterfinal. -- Diego Forlan grabbed two goals as Uruguay thrashed Paraguay 3-0 in Buenos Aires to secure a record 15th Copa America title. Paraguay tried to force the pace in the second half and hit the crossbar after Nelson Valdez's shot was tipped onto the woodwork by Uruguay goalkeeper Nestor Muslera. Suarez put Forlan through on goal just after the half hour mark but Villar made a crucial save to keep the deficit at just one goal.
