Leaders of the two main unions -- the Socialist-leaning General Workers Union (UGT) and the Communist-leaning Workers Commissions (CCOO) -- were due in Madrid's central Puerta del Sol plaza late Wednesday to meet with union picketers who will then spread out across the capital, while other picketers fan out across the nation. If they walk out, they will lose a day's wage, which for government workers could amount to several hundred dollars. -- Spanish unions were making final preparations for a general strike Thursday to protest the new conservative government's labor reforms and austerity cuts. The strike comes one day before the government unveils its 2012 budget on Friday, with the aim of reducing Spain's deficit to 5.3% of gross domestic product this year, and to 3% next year, to meet European Union requirements. Unions and government officials in many, but not all, of Spain's 17 regions have agreed on minimum services, which generally call for about 30% of public transportation to run, while public hospitals and other essential services would have reduced staff, similar to holiday levels.
