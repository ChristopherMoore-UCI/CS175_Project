Jennings is accused of attacking Mohamed Anmar with a 2.5-inch blade, using racial slurs against Anmar, who is of Middle Eastern descent, and failing to pay for services rendered. Jennings told police he acted out of self-defense, fearing Anmar would take him back to Manhattan and he might be "dropped in any number of dangerous places." Police documents allege that Jennings stabbed at Anmar, cutting his hands as he tried to close the partition. William Bryan Jennings, a bond-underwriting senior manager at Morgan Stanley, entered the plea in Connecticut Superior Court in Stamford, according to court documents. According to a sworn affidavit, Anmar said he picked up Jennings, whom he described as drunk, and told him he could go to Connecticut for a flat rate of $204.
