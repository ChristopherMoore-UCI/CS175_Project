However, non-IVF fertility treatments such as fertility drugs still are causing a disproportionate number of multiple births. By 2011, 36% of twin births and 77% of triplets, quads and quintuplets came as a result of fertility treatments including fertility drugs, according to a study published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine. While doctors recognized the phenomenon was a public health issue, Adashi said, "We didn't really have the hard numbers and we certainly did not have the kind of detailed insights into what's driving the increase in the number of multiples." Researchers arrived at these details by studying the number of times women gave birth to multiples between 1962 and 1966 -- the era before fertility treatments. He believes education is key to help doctors and their patients understand the negative health impacts of giving birth to multiple children. However, scientists studying the impact of medical intervention on multiple births were in for  a surprise -- in vitro fertilization (IVF), which has anecdotally borne much of the blame for multiple births because more than one embryo is typically implanted, was not the primary cause of multiples.
