Much of America met the second Richard Sherman on Sunday night when, after making an amazing defensive play to seal the Seattle Seahawks' trip to the Super Bowl, he ranted in a postgame interview about his opponent. Sherman, who was defending 49ers receiver Michael Crabtree near the end of the tight contest, batted a ball to a teammate.

In his CNN interview, Sherman said it takes certain characteristics to become a successful football player.
