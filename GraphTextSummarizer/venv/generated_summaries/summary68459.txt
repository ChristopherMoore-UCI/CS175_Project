On Sunday, the sale of raw milk from Fukushima Prefecture and spinach from  neighboring Ibaraki Prefecture were banned due to detected levels of radioactive iodine and cesium that surpassed  government limits, Japan's health ministry reported. The decision to prohibit food produce sales is another potentially devastating blow to a part of northeast Japan hit by the earthquake, tsunami and other potential fall-out from the Fukushima  plant. Besides causing devastation throughout northeast Japan, the 9.0-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on March 11 seriously damaged several reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, leading to the release of an unspecified amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere. Japanese officials reported levels of radioactive iodine in milk from  four locations in Fukushima that ranged from about 20% over the  acceptable limit to more than 17 times that limit. Hygiene expert Satoshi Takaya, who helped  Japanese scientists prevent contaminated food from entering the country  at that time, said the current situation is no Chernobyl -- but he said  the current crisis is sure to affect Japanese farmers.
