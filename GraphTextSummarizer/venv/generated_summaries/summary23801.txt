It is not the lack of political will that hampers Africa regional integration, it is poor infrastructure. The country's armed forces recently established Africa's first University of Military Science and Technology which is training engineers to build and maintain infrastructure projects. Led by an increasing number of technocratic presidents, Africa's armies can give future generations hope by helping to build infrastructure -- the motherboard for all economic activities. Infrastructure built to address economic needs has the additional purpose of helping to maintain internal law and order as well as maintenance of national security. Africa's challenges have less to do with fragmentation of state but more to do with the lack of infrastructure connectivity, especially energy, transportation, irrigation and telecommunications.
