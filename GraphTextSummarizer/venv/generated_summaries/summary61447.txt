Last year, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. -- Two people were killed and 13 wounded Monday in a bombing that targeted polio workers in northwest Pakistan Najeeb-Ur-Rehman, the senior superintendent of police, said the bomb was remotely detonated as polio vaccines and accompanying materials were being handed out to health workers. Many Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program in 2011 to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Pakistan is one of three countries in the world where polio has yet to be eradicated.
