Witness Dylan Parker told WFAA that the attacking lion held Johari by the neck "for like 10 minutes ... waiting until it quit moving." "The male lion that started it just had his mouth over her throat, and everyone thought they were playing at first," witness Jim Harvey told WFAA. Dozens of zoo visitors saw the attack, CNN affiliates WFAA and KTXA reported. "At first you think they're playing, and then you realize he's killing her, and ... you're watching it and you just can't believe your eyes," witness Michael Henshaw told WFAA. The zoo said the male lions won't be in the exhibit with the lionesses for now, WFAA reported.
