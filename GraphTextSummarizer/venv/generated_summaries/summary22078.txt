Baby boomers crowded classrooms and later, the labor force, boosting the economy and consumer spending while their taxes funded Social Security benefits and Medicare for the elderly. When budgeting medical expenses, baby boomers should expect increased health care spending as they age; for instance, those ages 55 to 64 spent $3,262 and those 65 and over spent $3,899, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
