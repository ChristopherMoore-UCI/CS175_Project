CNN spoke to world affairs expert Fareed Zakaria about the most recent developments. However, the global financial crisis has sunk its teeth in to the point that analysts say the $700 billion bailout plan and coordinated rate cut were merely steps in the right direction, and it will take much more to really get credit moving.

Zakaria: What is happening now is a deep, wrenching financial crisis unlike any we've seen since the 1930s. But the history of capitalism is filled with credit crises, panics, financial meltdowns and recessions.
