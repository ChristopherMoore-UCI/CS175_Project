-- Wikipedia this week created a new feature that allows readers of that online encyclopedia to create their own e-books with its content. The "EPUB export feature" makes it easier for people to read free encyclopedia articles on their mobile phones, e-readers or tablets when they don't have a connection, Wikipedia said in a blog post on Monday. Once you do, a green button will appear at the top of Wikipedia pages asking you if you want to "add this page to your book." "In countries where Internet access is still very rare, not to mention mobile devices are the only devices, this won't be seen just as a feature of Wikipedia. More than one encyclopedia article can be added to a single e-book.
