"Rick is very sick and weak, but slightly improved from when he arrived yesterday," Debbie Sacra said Saturday in a press release issued by SIM, the Christian mission organization for which Sacra works. -- Dr. Rick Sacra, an American missionary doctor infected with the deadly Ebola virus, has improved slightly while being treated in Omaha, Nebraska, his wife said. "He asked for something to eat and had a little chicken soup." Debbie Sacra and the couple's 22-year-old son visited him for 25 minutes by a video link at Nebraska Medical Center, according to the press release. Debbie Sacra said she and her husband want to keep the focus on the Ebola crisis in West Africa. Sacra, the third American with Ebola to return to the United States for treatment, was stationed in Liberia when he was exposed to the virus.
