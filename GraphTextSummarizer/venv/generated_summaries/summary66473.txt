Officials identified three of the men as U.S. native Daniel Patrick Boyd, 39 -- who had fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan -- and Boyd's sons, Dylan Boyd, 22, also known as "Mohammed," and Zakariya Boyd, 20. Also found at the home of Daniel Patrick Boyd and his sons were gas masks and a book that FBI special agent Michael Sutton called "essentially our playbook to how we respond to acts of terrorism. The arresting agent told Sutton that Daniel Boyd attempted "to acquire his sidearm," and that Dylan Boyd "failed to comply with their instruction and had to be subdued." Watch Sabrina Boyd state her family's innocence Â» Sutton testified Tuesday that Daniel and Dylan Boyd were arrested in Durham, North Carolina. Sabrina Boyd -- the wife of Daniel Patrick Boyd and the mother of the two younger Boyds -- said last week the allegations against her family are false.
