First, the cons: It whitewashes the realities of prostitution The movie glosses over the less-than-glamorous motivations that can lead women into sex work, says Katie Hail-Jares, a board member of the Sex Workers Outreach Project (SWOP USA). "Ideologically, 'Pretty Woman' is a love song to consumerism and capitalism," said Bitch Flicks' Johnson. " Its shopping scenes are revenge-fantasy bliss Ask some "Pretty Woman" fans to name their favorite scene and they don't mention Vivian's swoony moments with Edward. "You get the sense that she's not the norm, and that allows us to get invested in her while not necessarily worrying about the welfare of other women who fall into the (sex worker) stereotype." Vivian's exit from sex work thanks to Gere's character is also troubling, she says. Some critics complain the Garry Marshall film, whose female lead is an unrefined prostitute rescued from the streets by Richard Gere's elegant millionaire, degrades women and glorifies materialism.
