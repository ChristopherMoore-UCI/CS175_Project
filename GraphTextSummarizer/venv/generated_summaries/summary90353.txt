Around 300 tonnes or 20,000 individual items of F1 material -- from race cars, replacement parts, pit equipment, TV equipment and the furnishings of the VIP Paddock Club -- are moved for each grand prix. "We send about five-and-a-half tonnes by sea and we send this three months in advance of each race," said Williams race team coordinator Paul Singlehurst. They provide a place for drivers to debrief with their engineers, team members to refuel and corporate guests to be entertained. But normally, a fleet of about 20 vehicles is required to ferry team personnel between their hotel -- block-booked months in advance -- and racetrack all weekend. "Once the calendar is released, we sit down with all the different departments," explained Toyota team manager Richard Cregan.
