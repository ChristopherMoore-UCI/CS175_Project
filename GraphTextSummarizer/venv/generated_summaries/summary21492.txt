In the early morning hours Wednesday, the parties gathered in Belarus with one question answered in part: Will separatist leaders whose pro-Russian forces are battling with Ukrainian soldiers for control of eastern Ukraine show up? But top Western and Ukrainian leaders have said there isn't any doubt that Russia is behind surging violence and separatists' efforts to take over territory in eastern Ukraine. Officials from Russia, Ukraine and separatist groups engaged in low-level talks hours before a crucial meeting over the crisis in eastern Ukraine. The main points of negotiations of the so-called Normandy group -- the leaders of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine -- would be the withdrawal of heavy weapons, the creation of a demilitarized zone and the beginning of a permanent dialogue between Kiev and the Donbas area, which comprises Luhansk and Donetsk, RIA Novsoti quoted a diplomatic source at the talks as saying. He said other Western proposals, such as imposing more sanctions against Russian interests, isolating Russia or the possible arming of Ukrainian forces, would only destabilize the situation.
