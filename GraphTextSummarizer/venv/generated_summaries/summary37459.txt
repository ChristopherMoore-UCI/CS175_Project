The domain name's suspension occurred a few days after the U.S. government seized several key Syrian government sites, Noman said, leading researchers to believe that the move was intended to create some distance between the hacker group and the Syrian government. "They said they are determined to escalate attacks on websites belonging to the United States, European countries and all the countries preparing a possible military action against Syria," Noman said. The Syrian Electronic Army, a group of pro-Syrian regime hackers that has aggressively targeted major news organizations and activists, has claimed credit for a 20-hour-long outage of the New York Times website. They could carry out more DDOS attacks and may seek to use malicious software to steal private information from Syrian dissidents, he said. In its own words, on that website, the Syrian Electronic Army says, "We are a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria."
