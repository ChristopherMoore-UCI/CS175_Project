Unlike inside of the stadium, the crowds seemed to be regular residents, although it's worth remembering that Pyongyang resident are the very upper echelons of North Korean society. Outside the imposing Kim II Sung stadium, where the race began, we had the chance to have our photos taken with spectators and North Korean runners alike. As we ran through the streets of the city we got a close up view of North Korean urban society. Unlike most distance running events, there were no barriers along the way and no sponsorship billboards -- essentially we were just out running the streets, directed around the course by race officials. Sadly, I wasn't able get a picture perfect finish side by side with a North Korean -- they'd all finished well ahead of me -- but I did get 50,000 Korean spectators in the stadium cheering me across the line.
