-- A court in Jordan acquitted radical preacher Abu Qatada of charges of plotting to bomb millennium celebrations in Jordan in 2000, semi-state owned newspaper Addustour reported Wednesday. British authorities said he raised funds for terrorist groups, including organizations linked to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, and publicly supported militants' violent activities. Qatada, whose real name is Omar Othman, was cleared in July of charges of conspiracy to bomb a U.S. school in Jordan in the late 1990s, state media reported. The cleric was deported from the United Kingdom last year, ending a years-long legal battle to force him to leave the country. Videos of his preaching were found in a German apartment used by some of those involved in the 9/11 attacks on the United States, including ringleader Mohammed Atta.
