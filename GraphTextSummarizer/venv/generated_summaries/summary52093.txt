The 68 A380 planes in operation are being flown by Air France, China Southern, Emirates, Korean Air, Lufthansa, Qantas and Singapore Airlines, according to the company website. -- All Airbus A380 airplanes must be checked for cracks in the wings, the European Aviation Safety Agency ordered Wednesday. It expands an existing order that the 20 oldest A380s be checked for cracks, Fouda said, adding, "Now, with the second directive, we are including the whole fleet." South Korea's Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs said that it will issue an order to Korean Air on Thursday to conduct a safety check on its five A380 aircraft. If cracks are found, the airline must contact Airbus for instructions, the agency said.
