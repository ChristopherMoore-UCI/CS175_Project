-- International leaders and top Israeli officials attended a state memorial ceremony Monday for Israel's former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who died last week. "Prime Minister Sharon was a complex man ... who engendered strong opinions from everyone," he said. "We deal with the death of Sharon as an end for the crimes he committed against the Palestinian people," said Isra Almodallal, a spokeswoman for Hamas, the Palestinian movement that runs Gaza. He also raised ire in the Arab world by encouraging Israelis to build settlements on occupied Palestinian land but later did an about-face and pushed for the historic withdrawal from settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, which were turned over to Palestinian rule for the first time in nearly four decades. Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, spokesman of the Israeli military, said that two rockets fired from Gaza landed around Sha'ar Hanagev in southern Israel.
