" Meanwhile, striker Ruud van Nistelrooy has been left out of Holland's provisional World Cup squad, but coach Bert Van Marwijk says it doesn't necessarily spell the end of his World Cup dream. Meanwhile, Germany coach Joachim Loew has been dealt a double blow ahead of the World Cup after goalkeeper Rene Adler and midfielder Simon Rolfes were ruled out of the tournament through injury. Adler has been told he needs surgery on a rib injury, aggravated while playing for his club Bayer Leverkusen during their weekend German Bundesliga draw with Hertha Berlin. He said: "I am very pleased with the healing process but it is now definitively clear that the World Cup finals for me make no sense. Rolfes, who also plays for Leverkusen, has been out of action since an operation on a knee injury back in January and will not be adding to his 21 caps at the finals in South Africa.
