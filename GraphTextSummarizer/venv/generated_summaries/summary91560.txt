" Magaw said that, in light of the Aurora incident, "it's important (for) the community to know that we take all threats seriously and if you're going to make a threat, we will take action." Magaw said police went Thursday afternoon to the man's apartment in Crofton to interview him and found him wearing a T-shirt that said, "Guns don't kill people. Magaw said that, given Pitney Bowes' status as a federal contractor, the man could be subject to federal charges. Early Friday, police picked him up from his apartment and took him to Anne Arundel County Medical Center, where he was being given a mental health evaluation, Magaw said. "Both of those times and both of those telephone conversations he made significant threats to coming back and harming people at the business." Magaw added, "In fact, he said 'I'm a joker and I'm gonna load my guns and blow everyone up.' "We believe this was a significant threat based on some of the mental issues this individual has, the weapon capability he had (and) what he said to the employees at Pitney Bowes," Magaw said, referring to the business involved.
