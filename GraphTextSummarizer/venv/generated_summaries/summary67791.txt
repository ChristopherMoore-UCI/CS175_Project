Three other players have homered three times in one World Series game. Sandoval, who had 12 home runs during the regular season, hit a solo home run in the first and a two-run shot in the third off Verlander. Last year, St. Louis Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols had three home runs in Game 3. Barry Zito gave up just one run in 5 2/3 innings to earn the win for San Francisco. Sandoval broke his bat on his third home run.
