"Richie was feeling a lot better than I was and I was running out of sugars towards the end," explained Froome, who is aiming to win his first Tour de France after helping Sir Bradley Wiggins to the crown last year. -- There was French fever as Christophe Riblon won stage 18 of the Tour de France -- but it was Britain's Chris Froome who extended his overall lead despite being handed a penalty. The Spaniard was unable to respond when Froome pushed on twice during the second ascent.
