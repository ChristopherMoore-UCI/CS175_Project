Pentangelo gave this scenario of events: Paterson police called Port Authority officers, who serve the major bridges and tunnels of New York and New Jersey. A concerned Facebook friend who saw the post contacted police in Paterson, New Jersey, alerting authorities to the apparent suicide threat, according to Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo. While Port Authority police have used social media before to investigate threats and gather information, Pentangelo said, this was the first time social media was used to reach out. And it was a social networking first for officers from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Police Department -- using Facebook and other outlets this week to track down and help a troubled 18-year-old whose three-word online posting seemed to say suicide. -- A social media thread proved strong enough to pull a New Jersey teenager back from possible suicide, according to authorities.
