Sitting in an office with political memorabilia on the walls, former Washington Mayor Marion Barry reflects on the bad moments -- drug possession, jail, and tax evasion -- and notes that he has moved on. Barry is in many ways after a 40-year public career the prototype for political disgrace and political resurrection. Barry added that scandal can make a politician resilient and better suited for the rough and tumble of public life. But to most Washington political experts, Barry has added to that distrust. According to Barry, the only thing he did wrong was avoid paying income taxes.
