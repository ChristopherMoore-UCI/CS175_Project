But Assistant State Attorney Erin Wolfson said Wednesday that Dunn's claims don't add up. Dunn has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 17-year-old Jordan Davis. Among the requests from the jury was to see surveillance video from the gas station where Dunn shot Davis. " Dunn testified Tuesday that he saw Davis reach down and pick something up, and that he saw about "4 inches of a barrel" from a 12- or 20-gauge shotgun above the window. 'You have reasonable doubt' Witnesses testified that child locks on the SUV were engaged, and that Davis -- who was seated in the rear -- could not have gotten out of the back seat to threaten Dunn.
