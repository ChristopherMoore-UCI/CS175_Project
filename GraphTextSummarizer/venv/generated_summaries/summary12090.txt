Roach credits former heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali and actor Michael J. Fox, both of whom have Parkinson's disease, with raising awareness and money for Parkinson's research, and he says he's confident a cure will be found in his lifetime. The five-time trainer of the year has worked with the likes of Mike Tyson, Oscar De La Hoya and James Toney. But his star pupil by far is current World Boxing Organization welterweight champion Manny Pacquiao. Roach, one of the most sought-after boxing trainers in the sport, loves coming to work each and every day, and he says it's that passion that helps him deal with Parkinson's disease. Whether boxing contributed to or caused Roach to develop Parkinson's disease is unknown.
