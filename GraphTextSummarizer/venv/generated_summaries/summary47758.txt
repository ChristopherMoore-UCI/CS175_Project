It's a sport where even driving ability often fails to overcome mechanical failures -- eventual world champion Hamilton was forced to retire from last year's race at Albert Park. The Australian crossed the line in second place -- seemingly becoming the first Aussie to finish on the podium at Albert Park -- but jubilation soon turned to despair. "I'm sure even Lewis (Hamilton) and Nico (Rosberg) last year were frustrated at the times because you never have the perfect car," he added, referring to the two Mercedes drivers, who finished first and second last season. Despite Ricciardo's previous disappointment, he's can't wait to race on his home turf again next Sunday. He was disqualified hours after the race when officials ruled his car had exceeded the maximum fuel flow rate, a rule which states each car is limited to 100 kilograms of fuel per race and was introduced to make the sport more fuel efficient.
