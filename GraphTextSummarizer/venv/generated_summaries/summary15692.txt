-- After weeks on the run and days in immigration detention, American technology pioneer John McAfee arrived in Miami on Wednesday. Authorities in Belize, where McAfee had lived since 2008, say they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull. For the past week, McAfee waged a public battle, requesting an asylum in Guatemala and arguing that police in Belize were persecuting him. "He opted to return to his country of origin," said attorney Telesforo Guerra, who has represented McAfee since he arrived in Guatemala last week. McAfee said he had nothing to do with the death and insists he left Belize to escape police persecution.
