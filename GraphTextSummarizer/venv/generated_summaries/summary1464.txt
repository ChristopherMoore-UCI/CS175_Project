In 2003, for the 20th Video Music Awards, VMA MVPs Britney and Madonna teamed up (along with Christina Aguilera) for a startling performance that nabbed each of them a second spot on our top-five list.

The show opened with each of the younger stars paying tribute to Madonna's first-ever VMA appearance nineteen years earlier, singing "Like A Virgin" in not-so-virginal white.
