The right punch Mexican Juan Manuel Marquez threw to knock out Filipino Manny Pacquiao in the sixth round of their non-title welterweight clash arguably registered on the Richter scale, with the aftershocks being felt from the posh MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada to the last-standing shanty in the typhoon-ravaged areas of Mindanao, the Philippines. In the Philippines, where the fight was shown in cinemas, restaurants, and makeshift arenas, some stood in silence in utter disbelief while others unabashedly shed tears. From the time he burst into the world boxing stage by knocking out Mexican Marco Antonio Barrera in November 2003, Pacquiao has been looked upon as a walking icon, a symbol of everything that is positive about the Filipino: God-fearing, resilient and tough as nails. The devastating loss to Marquez, however, sends the signal that Pacquiao is already feeling the brunt of the responsibility he has been made to assume. When Pacquiao hit the canvas with a resounding thud, Filipinos all over the world cringed and felt the impact of the debacle down to their toenails.
