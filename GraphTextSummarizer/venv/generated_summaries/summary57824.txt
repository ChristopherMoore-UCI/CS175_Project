Today, our challenges address those posed by new medical wisdom: addressing unmet medical needs, researching new drugs, new drug delivery systems and new therapies. Would women setting up business in India today find it easier than you did? India and companies like Biocon provide very effective co-development partnership opportunities to bring these costs down. Finally, new drug development costs are under tremendous pressure both in terms of funding and development. Over the next 10 years, we systematically addressed these challenges and built a self contained enterprise that had captive power and water supply, state of the art labs and facilities and a team of highly experienced scientists and engineers capable of delivering world class research and technologies.
