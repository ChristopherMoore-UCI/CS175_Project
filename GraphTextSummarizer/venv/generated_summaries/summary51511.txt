The drama of an American ship captain held hostage by Somali pirates led last Sunday's talk shows. Faced with this response it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products, carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives. In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing. In light of this incident we should recognize there are two sets of victims here: innocent workers taken hostage by pirates and those people living along the poisoned and depleted Somali coast who may well see these pirates as heroes. As recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse.
