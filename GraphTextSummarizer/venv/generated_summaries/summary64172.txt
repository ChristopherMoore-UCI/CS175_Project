" Holder said he also stood by comments from a 2009 speech in which he said America is a "nation of cowards" on race and sees a crop of new voter identification laws, many of them passed by GOP-controlled state legislatures, as a way to disenfranchise minority voters. " And not all conservatives are motivated by race, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. Former Illinois Republican congressman turned conservative radio host Joe Walsh Tweeted: "Simple question for Eric Holder and all others who use race to protect Obama: Is it possible to oppose Obama and not be a racist?" "The willingness of the Obama administration to stoke racial divisions for political gain is astounding," Riley wrote adding that the voter identification laws are intended to ensure "ballot integrity" and that there's no proof they suppress minority votes. As attorney general, Holder is likely speaking to some sentiment held by the Obama administration, said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University.
