As tech companies like Apple, Amazon and Google expand the offerings of their cloud computing services, the amount of power going into data centers continues to grow. Among its recommendations, it says Apple should: â€¢ Buy renewable energy for its data center in Oregon instead of purchasing renewable energy credits from Pacific Power. Apple uses data centers for its iCloud service, which lets users store music, photos and documents on the Internet/ where they can be accessed from several devices. The location of those data centers is important, Greenpeace argues, because data centers -- basically big warehouses full of computers that store data "in the cloud" or online rather than on home machines -- are such big users of electricity. "To show true leadership, the company has to be willing to use its influence to change the electricity ecosystem outside the walls of its data centers as well." Specifically, Greenpeace says, Apple should pressure Duke Energy, which it says provides power to its North Carolina data center, to produce energy by cleaner means and to end its "mountaintop coal removal operations" from Apple's supply chain.
