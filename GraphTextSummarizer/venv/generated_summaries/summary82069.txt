-- World heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko has told CNN he is ready to fight David Haye anywhere. Haye retained his WBA heavyweight crown with a three-round demolition of former Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison on Saturday, before setting his sights on the Klitschko brothers. Haye was scheduled to fight Wladimir Klitschko in June last year but had to pull out due to injury. Right now, I think it will be exactly the same: before we make negotiations David Haye will find excuses. But Vitali accused Haye of becoming world champion "by talking" and predicted he would knock the Londoner out if they met in the ring.
