-- The one-star general almost yells when asked to talk about the infamous Abu Ghraib photos showing U.S. soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees. "There is a lot of witness testimony from detainees who suffered maltreatment in Iraqi detention facilities. " And there it is -- the issue of detainee abuse and what the U.S. military struggles with, and has struggled with, since the release of those photos in 2004, some of which showed naked prisoners being humiliated, stacked in piles or subjected to mock torture. Inmates in American detention with arrest warrants against them will be turned over to Iraqi authorities under the terms of the U.S.-Iraqi security agreement. "Iraqi detention facilities are not good; they are not like American facilities," said a woman who had just visited her detainee husband at Camp Cropper.
