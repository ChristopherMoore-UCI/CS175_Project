-- A liner carrying nearly 2,000 passengers ran into trouble Saturday in Finland's Aland archipelago in the northern Baltic Sea. The company plans to try to move the ship to the port of Langnas on Saturday evening. Viking Line said its liner, M/S Amorella, had "touched slightly aground" at about lunchtime local time. The ship is not letting in water, but a small leak has been observed on a ballast tank that normally holds water, it said. None of the 1,945 passengers was injured and the situation on board the ship is calm, a statement on Viking Line's website said.
