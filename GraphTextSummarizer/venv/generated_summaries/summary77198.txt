On Saturday, Snapchat decided to change their policy by introducing an update that lets younger users register for a more limited version of the app, which the startup has dubbed SnapKidz. "Instead they are able to use 'SnapKidz' a version of Snapchat that includes an interface for taking snaps, captioning, drawing, and saving them locally on the device, but does not support sending or receiving snaps or adding friends," the company wrote in a blog post. -- Snapchat, the app that sends automatically-deleting messages, has proven to be hugely popular among teens and young adults, but until now, it restricted anyone under the age of 13 from using it. By introducing a more PG-version of the app for younger users, Snapchat may be able to boost its user numbers and change the perception that it is simply a tool for sexting. Do you think Snapchat will find success among younger users?
