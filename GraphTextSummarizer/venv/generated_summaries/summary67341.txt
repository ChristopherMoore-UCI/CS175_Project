The bubble burst, and South Sea share prices collapsed to roughly their pre-bubble level. Starting at £128 in January, the price for South Sea securities rose to £175 in February and then £330 in March. So, in June and again in July, Sir Isaac Newton -- the inventor of calculus (the branch of mathematics that describes change over time, which is to say, an awful lot of what matters in both science and life); the man who framed the laws of motion and set physics on its modern trajectory; a pioneering chemist, an inventor (virtually all present-day telescopes derive from his design), a religious historian -- and even a financial thinker -- put a sizable chunk of his personal fortune into shares of the South Sea Company. He made his first investment in the South Sea issue early, in 1713, and held it for several years, marking a modest paper profit. The South Sea stock price held up through August 1720, and then in September, the gap between the possible income from all the purchased debt and the returns promised to investors became too obvious to ignore.
