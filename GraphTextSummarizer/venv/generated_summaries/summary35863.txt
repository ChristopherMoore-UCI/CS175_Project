Noriega Rios was arrested on "administrative immigration violations," and two days later she was turned over to Mexican authorities at the border crossing in San Ysidro, California, U.S. officials said. ICE officers and U.S. marshals arrested Noriega Rios without incident last week at her El Monte, California, residence, about 14 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, authorities said. Mexican authorities charge that Noriega Rios helped oversee the cartel's methamphetamine distribution activities in California and Washington state, ICE officials said. She was delivered to Mexican authorities last week after ICE officers reinstated a prior order for her removal from 2004, ICE officials said. In a statement, David Marin, acting field office director of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations in Los Angeles, said U.S. authorities "will continue to work closely with its law enforcement counterparts in Mexico to assure the safety of law abiding citizens in both nations."
