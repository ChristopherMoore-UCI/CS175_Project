The England center-back is likely to miss Wednesday's Champions League tie with Apoel Nicosia, but should be fit to face Everon next weekend. City lost England defenders Richards and Bridge to injury -- the latter stretchered off after a studs-first lunge by Juliano Bennetti -- before substitute fullback Nedum Onuoha gave Chelsea the chance to level in the 82nd minute when he brought down Ivory Coast striker Didier Drogba. Rio Ferdinand and Jonny Evans are ruled out, but Ferguson hopes Serbian center-back Nemanja Vidic will recover from illness for Wednesday's Champions League trip to Wolfsburg, with United needing a point to finish top of Group B. Brazilian midfielder Anderson crossed for Antonio Valencia to score the third from close range 10 minutes later, and the Ecuador winger set up England striker Wayne Rooney just 60 seconds after that. Frank Lampard missed a late penalty as Chelsea's English Premier League lead was cut to two points following a 2-1 defeat at Manchester City on Saturday evening.
