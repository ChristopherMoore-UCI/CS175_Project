" After his rescue by U.S. Navy SEAL commandos, Phillips was lauded as a hero and wrote a book about his ordeal, "A Captain's Duty." After failing to take control of the ship, the pirates seized Phillips and held the captain on a small lifeboat for five days until Navy SEALs shot and killed three of the kidnappers and captured the fourth. The real-life events that surrounded the 2009 attempted seizure of the Maersk Alabama inspired the film "Captain Phillips," which will be released on Friday. In reality, Phillips ignored numerous warnings to stay farther off the coast of Somalia, the site of dozens of hijackings, which hit their peak in 2008 and gained international attention. The publisher promoted him as a sea captain who risked his life by offering himself as a hostage "in exchange for the safety of the crew," something Phillips later acknowledged was a falsity spread by erroneous media reports.
