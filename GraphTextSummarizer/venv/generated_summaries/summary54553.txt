The third Jamaican hope, Asafa Powell, won his heat ahead of young British star Adam Gemili, while American Tyson Gay came through with a comfortable 10.08 seconds clocking. Gay's United States teammates Ryan Bailey and Justin Gatlin were the quickest qualifiers from earlier heats. Saturday's qualifying races also saw 'Blade Runner' Oscar Pistorius finish second in his 400m heat to qualify for the semifinals. The early times indicated that the track was suitable for fast times and Bolt's world record of 9.58 seconds could come under threat in Sunday's semifinals and final. The 25-year-old world record holder has been receiving treatment for hamstring and back problems but there was no sign he was hampered by injury.
