Nick Griffin, the controversial leader of the British National Party, was among thousands of guests due to attend one of the queen's three annual summer garden parties at Buckingham Palace. London, England -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II withdrew the invitation of a far-right politician to her garden party Thursday after he "blatantly politicized" it, Buckingham Palace said. The palace said Griffin "overtly used his personal invitation for party political purposes through the media." Queen Elizabeth hosts at least three garden parties every summer at Buckingham Palace as a way to reward and recognize public service. The possibility that Griffin would attend a royal garden party last year caused outrage.
