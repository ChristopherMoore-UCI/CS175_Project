With that in mind, the main goal of U.S. policy toward Havana should be helping the Cuban people live in prosperity and freedom, able to enjoy the benefits of modernity, complete with the right to free expression and participation in the global economy. So, as the United States moves to dismantle the old, failed embargo, let's hope it plays its hand with greater skill on behalf of the Cuban people moving forward, and extracts from the government verifiable progress on human rights and individual freedoms. The sight of Raul Castro -- the aging, unelected Cuban leader -- wearing his military uniform as he announced on television that Washington and Havana will restore ties "without renouncing any of our principles" reminded me of a conversation I had with a Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs official back when communist regimes were collapsing around the world. The dean of Cuban dissidents, Elizardo Sanchez, reportedly declared, "Castrismo has won." The leader of the opposition group Ladies in White, Berta Soler, called Obama's decision a mistake, adding that "democracy and freedom for the Cuban people aren't going to be achieved by what Obama has given to the Cuban government."
