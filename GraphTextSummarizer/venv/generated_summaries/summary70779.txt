Many doctors believe parents' fears about vaccines -- brought on by the Wakefield article and other non-scientific information -- has lead to a resurgence of diseases like measles and Pertussis or Whooping Cough. Last year, the United States saw its highest number of reported measles cases in 15 years, even though the disease was eliminated from the country in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even with people refusing vaccines, or delaying them, or spacing them out, autism rates continue to rise, he said. It was written by the now-infamous Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who argued that there was a link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccines, and autism. In 2010, 10 children died in from Whooping Cough in California.
