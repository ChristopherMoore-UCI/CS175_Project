On a visit to the border city of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, President Felipe Calderon apologized to the families of 15 people killed in a massacre last month and promised residents that their input would form part of the strategy against drug-related violence. Calderon said last year that 6,500 Mexicans died in drug violence in 2008. Representatives of different sectors of the city's civil society -- security, human rights, religious -- took turns giving their proposals in front of Calderon and a tense crowd. Violence in Juarez comes amid a backdrop of vastly increased numbers of homicides nationwide, as drug cartels battle each other and the Mexican government steps up its efforts to combat them. Juarez is one of the front lines in Calderon's offensive against the country's major drug trafficking organizations.
