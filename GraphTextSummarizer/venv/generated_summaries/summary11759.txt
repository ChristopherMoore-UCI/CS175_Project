The 35-year-old, who played on the second-tier Nationwide Tour last year before earning his card, followed up his opening eight-under 63 with a 65 to be one shot clear of fellow American Mark Wilson when the second round was finally completed on Saturday. " Brier, ranked 478th in the world, could not improve on Friday's second-round 66 as he finished on 69 after his second bogey of the round at the final hole -- but is still in second place with 18 to play on Sunday. The 39-year-old birdied four of the last five holes on Saturday to card a six-under-par 66 which moved him up to 11-under 205, leapfrogging overnight leader Markus Brier of Austria. But a disappointing round of 75 left South Africa's first-round leader and 2007 champion Retief Goosen tied for 28th place on 215 alongside world No. 2 Martin Kaymer and Spain's Sergio Garcia (69). Thomas Aiken of South Africa also shot 69 to finish the day in fourth place on seven under, while Spain's Alvaro Quiros (66) and England's Richard Finch (71) tied for fifth on six under.
