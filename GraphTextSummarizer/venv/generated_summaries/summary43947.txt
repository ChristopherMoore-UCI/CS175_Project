During the question and answer session broadcast to millions nationwide, Li addressed China's relationship with the United States and recent friction over allegations that Chinese hackers had targeted U.S. networks. Echoing recent comments from the president, Li said the government would lead by example, reducing spending on government offices, buildings, travel and hospitality. Xi's speech was followed by the first news conference by Premier Li Keqiang who, like Xi, was confirmed as one of the nation's new leaders during the meeting. However, economic growth will not come at the cost of the environment, he said, adding that complaints about pollution and tainted food supplies had been heard. "We must make persistent efforts, press ahead with indomitable will, continue to push forward the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and strive to achieve the Chinese dream of great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," Xi said, according to state news agency Xinhua.
