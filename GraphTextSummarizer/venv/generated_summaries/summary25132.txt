-- A man suspected of fatally shooting two Tampa, Florida, police officers is a suspect in another homicide and is sought for questioning in two others, Police Chief Jane Castor said Thursday. Meanwhile, Morris' picture was featured on FBI billboards in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, authorities said Thursday. Meanwhile, Tampa police said Wednesday afternoon the reward for information leading to Morris' arrest has increased to $100,000 -- the biggest in the city's history. Asked about officers' anger toward Morris, Castor said police are "reeling over the loss of two family members" but are professionals who will take Morris into custody safely if at all possible. Although it's not the first time authorities have featured fugitives' pictures on billboards, the posting of Morris' photograph marked the first time authorities could post such images themselves, through a partnership with outdoor advertising companies, said Chris Allen, spokesman for the FBI's Tampa bureau.
