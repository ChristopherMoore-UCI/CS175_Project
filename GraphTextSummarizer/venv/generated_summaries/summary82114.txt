Tuesday's deadly explosion comes at a time when the 26-year conflict between Turkish security forces and Kurdish PKK militants is once again flaring. Though the Kurds represent Turkey's largest ethnic minority, their language has historically been suppressed by the Turkish state, which long referred to Kurds as "mountain Turks." Twelve Turkish troops were killed in eastern Turkey last weekend during clashes with rebels along the border with Iraq. "All military forces and groups, bureaucratic persons who have a role in this racist war against Kurdish people are our target," said the statement, which was released on the pro-Kurdish web-site, the Firat News Agency. The Kurdistan Freedom Falcons are a splinter group from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, a movement of Marxist Kurdish guerrillas who have been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s. Initially, the movement fought to carve out a separate homeland for Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority, which makes up nearly 18 percent of the Turkish population, according to the CIA World Factbook.
