That is because the Kremlin's main goal remains to put a pro-Russian government in Ukraine, the kind that will sign an agreement of friendship and cooperation and will recognize to Crimea as a Russian territory. The rest of the world agrees that Crimea is Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia. My main concern is that Russia will start destabilizing southeast Ukraine before the presidential elections on May 25. Russian Prime Minister Medvedev, who visited Crimea recently, promised 33 airplanes full of visitors from Russia each day during the summer. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov repeats each day that Russia doesn't plan to occupy eastern and southern Ukraine.
