"Justice was served tonight as the state executed Charles Warner for the heinous crime of raping and murdering an infant," said Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin. Warner's attorney, Dale Baich, had filed a motion with the U.S. Supreme Court asking for a stay and asked the court to review Oklahoma's lethal injection policies in general. Warner was originally scheduled for execution on the same night as Lockett -- April 29, 2014 -- but the execution was called off after the state took 43 minutes to execute Lockett, a controversial event that was witnessed by media and state officials. "Of particular concern is the use of midazolam, which has been involved in several extremely problematic executions, including the gruesome and horrific execution of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma and the two-hour prolonged death of Joseph Wood in Arizona in July 2014," Baich said. " Lockett's execution was the first time Oklahoma had used midazolam as the first element in its three-drug cocktail.
