Ana Gasteyer -- the "Saturday Night Live" alum, current "Suburgatory" star, and laugh-til-you-cry visionary behind Schweddy Balls -- is in the throes of a one-woman campaign (or, as she likes to call, it "my own l'il Arab spring") to get her Twitter account verified.

Gasteyer's Twitter account has been verified, witnessed by this tweet: "To all who fought tirelessly for my verification, thank you.
