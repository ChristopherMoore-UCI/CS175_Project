Lassana Bathily, who emerged as the hero of the Paris supermarket attack, received his new French passport from the hands of Prime Minister Manuel Valls and Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve at a ceremony in Paris. Both Valls and Cazeneuve emphasized the importance of keeping French citizenship open in order to remain faithful to the Republican ideal. " Valls also recalled the strong ties between France and Mali, a "country which saw Timbuktu being wrecked by terrorists," and which received French support in its fight against jihadism. "Welcoming new French citizens is an opportunity for the country as well as for those who become French," Valls said. Bathily, who arrived in France when he was 16, had dreamed of gaining French citizenship since his childhood.
