The second day of Royal Ascot delivered a shock in the day's feature race, the Prince of Wales Stakes. Racing in the colors of Sheikh Joaan's Al Shaqab operation and ridden by Frankie Dettori, who got off to a flying start on the first day of the meeting, if she had looked carefully, Treve would have been greeted by a friendly face on her first trip outside France. The French filly would be the first Arc winner to run at the Royal Meeting since 1989 winner Carroll House finished last in the following year's Hardwicke Stakes. In the Royal Hunt Cup, the day's major handicap, a fast finishing Sea Shanty managed a creditable 4th behind Field of Dream. "She proved today what she can do against top class horses."
