-- Speed and beauty have long been the driving factors in car design, but this year's most exclusive automobiles include a few practical considerations such as alternative fuel sources and smart ideas to improve safety and cut urban congestion. Some of the names that grabbed attention in Paris, and at the X Prize competition and elsewhere will captivate many drivers' imaginations: Lamborghini's Sesto Elemento, the Ferrari SA APERTA, Bugatti's Super Sport and the literally electric Jaguar C-X75. Still, the first thing about these cars that catches the eye ain't the miles per gallon (or perhaps mile per watt). While many of these cars could empty more than a few pocketbooks, they also could save their owners a few bucks on fuel. The contest pushed designers to come up with a conventionally powered vehicle that would top 100 MPGe (miles per gallon energy equivalent).
