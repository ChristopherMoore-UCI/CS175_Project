This is an opportunity for the President to get back into this fight and embrace the Jeb Bush spirit," Gergen said of the former Florida governor's "compassionate conservative" approach to immigration, which includes understanding the impact of deportation on families. In the meantime, Obama has faced increasing pressure from immigration activists and members of his own party to use the power of his pen to help stem the high number of deportations that have occurred during his administration. But he does have some latitude in implementing such laws, immigration law experts say. There are concrete ways within existing law to help keep families together and spare U.S. citizens from losing their wives, their husbands and their children to deportation. "If a Republican president made an executive action and used Obama as an example to say 'I could do what I want,' it could hurt Democrats." Still, strong signals from the White House recently in directing Homeland Security to look into how it can apply immigration laws "more humanely" give members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and their constituents hope.
