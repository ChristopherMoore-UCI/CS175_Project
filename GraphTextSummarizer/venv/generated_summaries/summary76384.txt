With the promise of coming AIDS vaccines, former President Bill Clinton urged the world's nations Monday not to give up on funding to prevent a calamity. "You'll start having large numbers of people dying again, you'll have more political instability, more economic collapse, and it's going to cost us more money later. "If we all do this, the consequences will be calamitous and you'll spend more money later," Clinton said, referring to reduced donations. Clinton said the United States has increased contributions to AIDS programs, but not as much as hoped. " When asked about the affordability of such medicine in poor countries, Clinton said cost should not be an issue.
