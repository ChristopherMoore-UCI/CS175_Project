In Arizona, for example, there is a state requirement that prevents insurance companies from cherry-picking which counties they offer PPO plans in, according to Arizona Department of Insurance spokeswoman Erin Klugh â€” although they can selectively offer HMO plans. Another reason why insurance options and prices vary so significantly from region to region has to do with how state governments choose to use their rate review authority, which was expanded under the Affordable Care Act. In her grilling on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius reiterated a frequent assertion in the Obamacare sales pitch --- consumers have options when shopping for insurance plans on the health care exchanges. "Before the law's implementation, state insurance officials claimed that there would be as many as eight carriers offering coverage in the individual market," wrote Senator John Boozman and Representatives Tom Cotton, Steve Womack, Rick Crawford and Tim Griffin. The technical problems facing the website are, to some extent, drawing attention away from the shortage of insurance options.
