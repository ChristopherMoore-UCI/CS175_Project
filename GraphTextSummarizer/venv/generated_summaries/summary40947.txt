Today, there's a new resurgence in anonymous social networks and messaging apps, which seem to be gaining traction in light of Edward Snowden's revelations that the National Security Agency has access to just about everything we do online. Legendary venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who has invested in almost every major startup in recent years, from Facebook to the recent crop of Bitcoin payment apps, caused a stir the other day when he posted several tweets saying anonymous apps are bad for society. After posts of students' sexual exploits and even personal threats began to spread across Juicy Campus, some colleges attempted to block their servers from accessing the site. Whisper doesn't seem to have the same scandalous cloud hanging over it that Secret does, mostly because it has a team of human editors monitoring posts for naughty content. Perhaps that taps into the essence of why Andreessen and others aren't convinced anonymous social networks can be a long-term success.
