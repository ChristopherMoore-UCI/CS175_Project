Kim's late father, Kim Jong Il, was also singled out as having made the launch possible through his military-first policy that channeled billions of dollars into the development of missiles and nuclear weapons. Kim Jong Un has "stressed the need to continue to launch satellites in the future," the state-run Korean Central News Agency said in a report Thursday, raising the prospect of more controversial moves in the future. Experts do not believe North Korea has a nuclear warhead small enough to fly on the kind of missile that Pyongyang has now proved it can send long distance. But state media reported Friday that the satellite is weather-related and will "gain information on temperatures of sea and land surfaces and atmosphere, humidity and wind and other meteorological data." State media also released images of Kim apparently watching the launch unfold.
