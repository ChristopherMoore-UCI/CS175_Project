The country music group announced last week that Henryville Junior-Senior High School was the winner of its "Own the Night" prom contest based on a video entry submitted by a rival Clark County, Indiana, school. -- Students at an Indiana high school heavily damaged by a tornado this month will have a private prom party thrown by the country music trio Lady Antebellum, followed by a public concert to raise money for their community. Lady Antebellum was already booked April 27, the night of the Henryville prom, so they set aside May 16 for a prom party in KFC YUM! "We were so moved by the stories from Henryville High School but also from the students at their rival schools who raised their hands and said they wanted to help. "They missed so much with the school being destroyed that things like this help them feel whole again," West Clark Community Schools Superintendent Monty Schneider said.
