Annexation no longer the focus of Ukraine crisis Amanpour blog: Russia could invade Ukraine 12 hours after order, says NATO commander Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, also told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that with 40,000 troops massed near the border, Russia has all the components necessary to move on Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but many countries that are members -- such Poland and the Baltic states -- have voiced their increasing anxiety about Russia's recent actions. NATO said on Tuesday that it would suspend "all practical civilian and military cooperation" with Russia in response to its annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea region, which has triggered the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War. Rasmussen again said Russia had a "massive military buildup along Ukraine's borders," with troops in a high state of readiness, and that NATO had not seen signs of any significant reduction in that buildup.
