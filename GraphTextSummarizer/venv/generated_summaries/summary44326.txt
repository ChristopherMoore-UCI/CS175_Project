Budi's "eyes fill with tears ever time he's moved by the doctors and he screams in pain," said Dr. Karmele Llano Sanchez, International Animal Rescue's program director in Indonesia. "After weeks of physiotherapy, medical treatment and a nutritious diet, Budi's muscles are developing well," said United Kingdom-based International Animal Rescue. It's unclear how Budi became someone's pet, said Dr. Ayu Handayani. When Budi arrived at International Animal Rescue's Orangutan Rescue Center in Ketapang, his condition was extremely critical. Budi, an adorable baby orangutan, is on the road to recovery after an animal shelter in Indonesia rescued him.
