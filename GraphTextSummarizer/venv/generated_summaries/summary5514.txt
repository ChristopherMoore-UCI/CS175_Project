This is no "Chinatown" exercise in history as neo-noir, and it's sure no James Ellroy-style take down of the LAPD (the controversial 1950s Police Chief William Parker -- played by Nick Nolte - gets a free pass for instigating what amounts to a vigilante hit-squad operating beyond any legal jurisdiction). And it's Beatty's film that comes to mind most immediately, with Sean Penn channeling a snarling Al Pacino (and showing off a striking prosthetic nose) as ambitious LA racketeer Mickey Cohen, an all purpose bad guy who orders a Chicago rival to be chained to two autos and ripped in half in the film's first minute. O'Mara has established his impeccable heroic credentials by crashing one of Cohen's brothels, shooting or beating up five of his henchmen and rescuing an innocent dame from a fate worse than death -- all to the consternation of his immediate superiors, but impressing the heck out of Chief Parker. For all its historical liberties, the movie does have fun re-creating mid-century Los Angeles. Anachronistically, for Parker's LAPD, there's also an African-American who is handy with a knife (Anthony Mackie) and a Latino who muscles in on the action (Michael Pena).
