Technostalgia: 20 Misty Memories of Personal Computing A Kickstarter campaign, which aimed to raise $16,000 to fund the reunion, announced that the event will take place on Nov. 11. "If one had to pick the single most important moment in personal computing history, the first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club in that dimly lit garage in Menlo Park might be at the top of the list," the campaign's organizers said on Kickstarter. Tickets for the public are being sold via the Kickstarter page; a single ticket costs $64, or $128 for a ticket and a limited-edition t-shirt. Original members of the club will be on hand to "celebrate their legacy and to impart their wisdom to the next generation of hackers and creators whose innovations will shape the future," according to the Kickstarter page. The legendary computer club where Apple co-founders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak first showed off their early retail computers is reuniting next month.
