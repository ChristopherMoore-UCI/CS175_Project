"She should be afforded some sort of privacy." Santa Monica police are investigating Heller for suspicion of asking Lohan's personal assistant, who was in the car with the actress when she was involved in a car crash last June, to lie in his testimony by saying he had control of the Porsche when it crashed into a dump truck, a source close to the investigation told CNN last month. "It's horrible, because Lindsay Lohan or any defendant should be able to feel that their privacy is being protected," Heller told CNN on Wednesday after TMZ reported Lohan would check into the Seafield Center in Westhampton Beach, New York, for her court-mandated 90 days of substance abuse rehabilitation next month. Mark Heller, who is himself being investigated for alleged witness tampering in Lohan's probation violation case, called for an investigation of the Santa Monica and Los Angeles city attorneys. "I can sum it up in one word: ridiculous," Heller said when asked for a comment last month. "It impacts the integrity of the legal system in California," said Heller, a New York lawyer.
