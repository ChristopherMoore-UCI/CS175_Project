-- A year to the day after racially abusing an opponent, John Terry stepped out as Chelsea captain wearing an anti-racism armband -- only for the Blues to suffer their first Champions League defeat since winning the trophy in May. Terry wore the band as part of a week of action organized by the group 'Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare)', which has asked all club captains in European competition to help its campaign. After outstanding Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster thought he had done enough to repel the home side's best efforts, Barcelona secured their 100th Champions League win when Jordi Alba found the net four minutes into stoppage time to secure a 2-1 win. "Perhaps it was one of our best games in recent times," Shakhtar coach Mircea Lucescu told the official website of European body UEFA. Meanwhile, the Germans, who were beaten runners-up on home soil against Chelsea in the final in May, rebounded in solid if unconvincing fashion when winning 1-0 at French side Lille. "It's been the story of our season at home -- start badly, lose goals and have to fight back to rescue games," said United coach Alex Ferguson after the 3-2 victory.
