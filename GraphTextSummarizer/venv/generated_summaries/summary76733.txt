The central government lost control of Benghazi, with multiple witnesses reporting that protesters took over Libya's second-largest city with support from some military who dropped their allegiance to Gadhafi. Several people noted that major unrest came to Gadhafi's doorstep in the capital Tripoli for the first time on Sunday, where crowds of anti-government protesters loudly decried Libya's current government, set fires to cars and braved gunfire by uniformed and self-styled security forces. -- While state TV bounced between scenes of serene concert footage and orderly rallies in support of leader Moammar Gadhafi, eyewitnesses describe a far different, far more chaotic Libya -- one with arms-toting mercenaries, demonstrators ramming stolen tanks into a military base and masked men firing guns and blasting pro-government tunes from their sport utility vehicles. A relative calm had also descended by then in Benghazi, Libya's second largest city and a hotbed of anti-Gadhafi sentiment. According to one person, the heavy guard detail normally positioned outside Gadhafi's residence disappeared Sunday night.
