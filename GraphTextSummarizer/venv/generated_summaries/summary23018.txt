Rastogi wonders: "How did they think up something so elaborate and yet so simple in its basic philosophy? Award-winning architect Manit Rastogi, who designed the academy, explains that baoli -- the Hindi word for stepwell -- are bodies of water encased by a descending set of steps. "We've been able to demonstrate that good green building is not only cheaper to run; it's not only more comfortable to live in -- it's also cheaper to build," says Rastogi. While traditional stepwells often go many stories below ground level, Rastogi's go down just four meters. "When water evaporates in heat, it immediately brings down the temperature of the space around it," he says.
