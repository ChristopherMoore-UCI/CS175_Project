South Korea's foreign ministry said Friday that it urged the North to respect the United Nations ruling and "observe its international responsibility." Academics said the North Koreans' announcement is about more than developing the technology needed for satellite launches, which is the same technology needed for missile launches. North Korea "must abandon" plans to launch a rocket to put a satellite into orbit next month, because doing so would violate the terms of U.N. Security Council resolutions, it said. Previous satellite launches by the reclusive North Korean regime have been widely viewed as ballistic missile test launches in disguise. " The Security Council demanded that North Korea not conduct further launches. The official said that the United States replied that all other nations have not been judged to be a threat to international peace and stability and enjoined explicitly against conducting ballistic missile launches.
