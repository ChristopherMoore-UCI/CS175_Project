-- It has been 20 years since best-selling crime writer Patricia Cornwell began work on her first novel in the series chronicling the cases of forensic analyst Dr. Kay Scarpetta. I'd like them to take away an idea of how someone like Scarpetta deals with being in the same world you What I watch is the nonfiction, documentary type things, shows that depict real crimes that happened. I try to keep my mind blank, and keep the influence of my own research, so I don't tend to watch crime dramas or crime movies. I'll always show you the latest and greatest forensic science and technology, but I can't show it all, so it's very important that I make things interesting in different ways.
