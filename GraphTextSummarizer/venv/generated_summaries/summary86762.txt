I know that my appearance is misleading, and I know that many people would disagree with what I see as efficacious inscriptions. The lesson I hope to teach others through my life is that it's important to see past appearances. We are often asked to declare our identity for documents, applications, bank loans and even social networking sites. I also have a bald eagle on my forearm to reflect my commitment to making this country a better place and a skull wearing a graduation cap to reflect my lifelong commitment to teaching. I have the "female" sign behind my left ear to reflect my commitment to feminism and women everywhere; I have the Human Rights Campaign logo behind my right ear to reflect my commitment to LGBT struggles.
