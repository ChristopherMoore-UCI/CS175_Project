Stunned by the loss of innocent life in Friday's massacre, children and adults around the country were moved to pay tribute to the Sandy Hook schoolchildren, teachers and administrators who lost their lives. "He said he wanted to do something to honor those victims, and I said I had 27 tea lights, so we lit those." Redoing his Christmas lights display Suffolk University college sophomore Ryan Emrich photographed the light display he created to honor the Newtown school shooting victims as well as the shooter, who he believes was a victim of mental illness. People crafted memorials and school sports teams paid homage to lives cut short. Instead of celebrating his 12th birthday over the weekend with candles in his birthday pie, he decided that he wanted to pay tribute with candles for the Newtown victims. Using white Christmas lights, the 19-year-old arranged the lights to the number 27 on his front lawn in North Reading, Massachusetts.
