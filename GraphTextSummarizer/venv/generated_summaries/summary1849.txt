The vote was called to fill seats vacated by the promotion of parliamentarians to the Cabinet and other posts last year. For the first time ever, credible alternatives to the ruling party appeared on the ballot, including pro-democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi, who was serving the final days of her house arrest during the general election in November 2010, which was widely derided as a sham. Della-Giacoma stresses that the NLD does have competition, not least from the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), which was formed less than two years ago to contest the 2010 election by former general, and now president, Thein Sein, and a number of other former military leaders. In the weeks leading to Sunday's vote, Suu Kyi has traveled up and down the country, rallying support for her once-banned National League for Democracy party (NLD). As a member of parliament, Suu Kyi would also be expected to be free to travel outside Myanmar -- and more importantly to return -- something that wasn't possible during her long years of repression and confinement.
