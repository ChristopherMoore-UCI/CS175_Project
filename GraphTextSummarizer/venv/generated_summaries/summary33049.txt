During that time, family members of those lost on 9/11, rescue and recovery workers, active duty first responders from agencies that lost members in the attacks and survivors of the attacks -- as well as lower Manhattan residents and business owners -- will be able to visit the memorial and museum when it is best for them, the release said. The museum is built upon their incredible stories," 9/11 Memorial chair and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. When it comes to human remains, we have to treat them with as much dignity and respect (as) they deserve," said Lee Ielpi, president and co-founder of 911 Tribute Center. The remains, which are in the custody of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, will be kept behind a wall in an area off-limits to the public, said 9/11 museum spokesman Michael Frazier. The museum, located at the site of the original World Trade Center, will feature a core memorial exhibition that pays tribute to the 2,983 people killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks and in the February 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.
