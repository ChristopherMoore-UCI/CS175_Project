Interestingly enough, Samsung is producing chips for Apple, although the two companies still haven't resolved their patent war that has been raging on for months. Samsung's new $3.6 billion plant in Austin is the size of nine football fields (1.6 million square feet), and it's almost solely dedicated to producing Apple chips. -- Apple's A5 chip, which powers the iPhone 4S and the iPad 2, is now being produced in a Texas factory owned by Samsung, Reuters reports, citing sources familiar with the operation. According to the Austin Chamber of Commerce, Samsung's factory is the largest foreign investment in Texas, worth about $9 billion. Both Samsung and Apple declined to comment on the deal.
