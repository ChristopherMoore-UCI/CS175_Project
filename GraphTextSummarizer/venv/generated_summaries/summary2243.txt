The politicians who act after disaster reap the gratitude of the nation, like Rudy Giuliani amid the rubble of New York City. Suppose they had rapidly infused the banking system with emergency credit, gone off the gold standard when Britain did in 1931, and organized the mutual forgiveness of the enormous debts and reparations left over from World War I. Suppose that -- thanks to this wise action -- the world economy had begun to recover in late 1931. But those who successfully mobilize public action in good time? In such a case, the worst year of the Great Depression -- 1932 -- would have been a year of slow economic improvement worldwide rather than radical economic collapse. For every Sheila Bair urging early action about subprime mortgages, there are a hundred Glenn Becks urging Americans to stockpile nonhybrid seeds against the coming global apocalypse.
