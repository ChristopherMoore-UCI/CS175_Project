"Regal intends to play the film and respect the original R rating decision of the MPAA," says Regal spokesperson Dick Westerling. Meanwhile, The Los Angeles Times is reporting that Carmike and Cinemark theaters will not be screening "Bully," adhering to a long-standing tradition by major theater chains of not showing films that do not carry a rating by the MPAA. The move strikes a harder line than the one taken by AMC Theaters, which is allowing minors to see the acclaimed film -- which chronicles the epidemic of brutal adolescent bullying -- as long as they have written permission from a parent or guardian. The Weinstein Company decided on Monday that it would release the film unrated after the MPAA refused to lower the R rating it gave the film last month.
