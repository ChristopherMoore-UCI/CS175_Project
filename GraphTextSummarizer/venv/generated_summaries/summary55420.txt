The slumping Rory McIlroy was tied for 25th alongside U.S. Open winner Justin Rose, 14 shots behind Woods. " Choi, last year's U.S. Open winner, leads Japan's Miki Saiki by a shot, with overnight leader Morgan Pressel of the U.S. a further shot behind. With a sub 60 round in his sights, though, Woods shot at par the rest of the way, narrowly missing a birdie on the 17th but then avoiding a bogey on the 18th with a stunning putt. Through two rounds on the Old Course, Park trails fellow South Korean Na Yeon Choi by eight shots after registering a 1-over-par 73 in blustery conditions. "I just let the round build from there," Woods said in a television interview aired by Sky Sports.
