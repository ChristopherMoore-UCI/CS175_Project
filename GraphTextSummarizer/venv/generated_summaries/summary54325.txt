Its 2010 "Pink Buckets for the Cure" partnership with KFC raised concern among nutritionists and other health advocates about promoting junk food in the name of breast health. -- Karen Handel, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation vice presidentâ€”and lightning rod in the group's public relations storm over Planned Parenthood funding--stepped down from her position Tuesday. In interviews, Komen executives have denied that their corporate funders exert any influence over their policy decisions. While their chances of dying from the disease have improved very slightly in recent years, breast cancer incidence rose steeply over the course of the 20th century to one in eight today. When the Komen foundation last week bowed to pressure from anti-abortion activists to stop most of its funding of Planned Parenthood, the furor was swift and forceful.
