It is all too common that Jewish settlements in the West Bank are built on stolen Palestinian land, and all too common that Palestinian farmers are prevented from cultivating and collecting their rightful harvest anywhere near these settlements. In August, in a frenzy of unfounded fear of widespread Palestinian violence following a U.N. proposal on Palestinian statehood, Israel announced a new policy of arming and training settlers. In 2007, in a report based on the government's own statistics, the Israeli group Peace Now showed that the majority of settlements are wholly or partially constructed on private Palestinian land. The status of Israeli citizens who defy discriminatory government policies regarding Palestinian rights is steadily eroding. Thus perhaps a field can be plowed or olive tree picked if Jewish activists accompany Palestinian farmers as in Anatot.
