And while I have never considered this obsession that I share to be a life-threatening career, it is hard to escape the fact that this is now the world we live in, one where hooded gunmen kill journalists and cartoonists in cold blood because they are angered by printed words and drawings. I was fortunate enough this past fall to travel to Paris, and also to a little town called St.-Just-le-Martel in the countryside, where locals throw an annual bash celebrating France's long love affair with the art of cartooning, illustration and caricature. Under constant threat of death, Charbonnier was quoted in the French newspaper Le Monde as saying, "I would rather die standing than live on my knees." Since then, it has been reported that several of the editors and cartoonists have lived under the constant threat of death. The editors and cartoonists at Charlie Hebdo certainly could have done that at the first sign of trouble.
