"The modern domestic scene is shattered by the magisterial beast that is Frankel." Kirkbride painted the work, called "Armchair Ride," in egg tempura; a mixture of colored pigment and egg yolk which dates back to the 1st Century. Writer Blaine Ward's personal "Frankel moment" came earlier in the horse's stellar career, an experience which later paved the way for artist Kirkbride to paint his unusual surrealist work. " And so Ward enlisted Kirkbride, a lecturer at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London (RADA) to paint the champion horse powering into a suburban living room, knocking Ward and his wife from their chairs and spilling their afternoon gin and tonics to the floor. "I had been watching last year's 2000 Guineas race on TV when Frankel just pounded the other horses into the ground," said Ward. It was a special sporting moment and had a profound effect on Ward, who described Frankel's win as akin to watching boxer Muhammad Ali or footballer Lionel Messi in action.
