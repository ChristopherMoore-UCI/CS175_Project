While the number of Iraqis killed by U.S. and allied forces has declined since 2009, when American troops pulled back from Iraq's cities, "the rate caused by Iraqi state forces has increased," the site noted. " Iraq Body Count is an independent public database that uses media reports as well as figures from hospitals, morgues, nongovernmental organizations and official statements. The site has tracked Iraqi civilian deaths since the U.S. invasion in March 2003. "As observed in IBC's previous annual report, recent trends indicate a persistent low-level conflict in Iraq that will continue to kill civilians at a similar rate for years to come. Deaths attributed to Iraqi soldiers and police rose to 140 in 2011, up from 96 the previous year, it reported.
