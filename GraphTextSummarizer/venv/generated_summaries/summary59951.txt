A spokeswoman for the upscale Liberty of London department store told CNN it had seen a 14-fold increase in McQueen brand sales, with top sellers including his signature skull print scarf and main line collection. -- The fashion world was Friday mourning the death of celebrated British designer Alexander McQueen as questions were raised over the future of his multi-million dollar luxury clothing brand. Tim Gadoffre, CEO of luxury brand analyst Marival & Company, said McQueen's death represented a "disaster" for the brand and said there would be substantial doubts over the label's ability to survive its visionary founder's death. The designer was born as Lee Alexander McQueen in 1970 in London's East End, the son of a taxi driver. A manager at the Alexander McQueen store in New York, where similar memorial scenes of flowers and candles were reported, said the shop would also be closed in light of the designer's death.
