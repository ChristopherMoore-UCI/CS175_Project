"Under California law, an employer may require pre-employment drug tests, and take illegal drug use into consideration in making employment decisions." The U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2005 for the Bush administration giving it broad authority to crack down on illegal drug use was criticized by patient rights groups and the movement to legalize marijuana. The U.S. Supreme Court has said the Bush administration can prohibit the backyard cultivation of pot for personal use, because such use has broader social and financial implications. A federal appeals court last March said medical marijuana users can be subject to arrest and confiscation of the material, under federal anti-drug laws. The state supreme court said the law allowing use of marijuana for some patients is "modest" in scope, limiting the rights of some patients.
