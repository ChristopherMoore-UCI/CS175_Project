But it's the local icewines, dessert wines and fruit wines that are the area's main specialties, so make sure you come with a sweet tooth. You won't want to miss the multitude of top table wineries in Ontario's Niagara region or British Columbia's Okanagan Valley -- the country's leading producers -- but a visit to the smaller, often rustic wineries of Qu√©bec and the charming boutique operations of Nova Scotia and Vancouver Island's Cowichan Valley can be just as rewarding. Canada's wines have gained ever-greater kudos in recent years and while smaller-scale production and the industry dominance of other wine regions means they'll never be a global market leader, there are some truly lip-smacking surprises waiting for thirsty grape lovers. If your taste buds are piqued, consider checking out other Ontario wine regions like Pelee Island and Lake Erie North Shore. While many visitors to Canada -- especially those who think Canadians live under a permanent blanket of snow -- are surprised to learn that wine is produced in Canada, their suspicion is always tempered after a drink or two.
