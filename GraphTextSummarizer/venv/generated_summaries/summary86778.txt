But Israel agreed to ease the blockade on Gaza, open border crossings for more aid to pass through and extend the fishing limit off the coast to 6 miles, according to a senior Egyptian government official. The ceasefire agreed to Tuesday between Israeli and Hamas officials has no expiration date, unlike several previous ones. An Israeli soldier who was critically injured in fighting last month died Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces announced in a tweet. The U.N estimates at least 70% of the Palestinians killed were civilians, but Israel reports a higher number of militants among the dead. Shacar Shalev, 20, came almost a week after a new ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that ended more than seven weeks of fighting.
