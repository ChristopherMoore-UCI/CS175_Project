-- With a natural disaster playing out in slow motion as lava from Kilauea Volcano on Hawaii's Big Island inches towards homes and businesses in Pahoa, officials are preparing to begin evacuations. His mom and dad lost their dream Kalapana beach home to lava flow in 1991, and Hauanio never thought he'd see his home meet the same fate, he told the station. Alii Hauanio has started packing his things, including his parents' memorabilia, CNN affiliate KHNL reported. "Most people have vacated," Hawaii County Civil Defense worker Francesca Martin-Howe told CNN affiliate KHON-TV. "Our goal is to work with the residents and business owners, as the lava flow goes through their area," Oliviera said.
