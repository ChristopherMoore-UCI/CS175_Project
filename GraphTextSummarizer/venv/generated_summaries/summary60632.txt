While Petraeus called on the troops to "pursue the enemy relentlessly" and "seek out and eliminate" insurgents who threaten Afghan civilians, he also urged coalition forces to fight "with discipline" and be careful to avoid civilian casualties. To reduce that, NATO forces partner with Afghan troops in their operations. U.S. and coalition military officials told CNN that that Petraeus was not expected to reverse existing directives issued by the previous commander, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, but instead characterized the new directive as a clarification of the rules he put into place emphasizing protection of civilians on the battlefield. It will also serve to alleviate anxiety on the part of the local population and build confidence in Afghan security forces," the directive states. If the status of civilians is unknown, firing is prohibited except when certain types of risk to troops exist.
