The robbery is the latest in a spate of daytime thefts at jewelry stores and designer shops in London's exclusive shopping areas of Bond Street, which includes New Bond Street. A CNN camera crew filming in March on Oxford Street, near Bond Street, caught a group of thieves speeding away on motorbikes from a jewelry store they had just robbed. On Tuesday police released surveillance camera photos of two men sought for questioning over the heist as well as  images of some of the rings, bracelets, necklaces and watches taken from Graff Jewellers on central London's New Bond Street. Both men are thought to have spoken with London accents, Scotland Yard said. Groups of men or teenagers typically stage "smash and grab" robberies, in which they break the windows and steal anything they can get their hands on before speeding away in waiting cars or motorbikes.
