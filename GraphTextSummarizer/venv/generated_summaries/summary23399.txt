" Kittel, the star of the early stages of the Tour, used his raw sprinting power to match Nibali's four wins this year, edging out Norway's Alexander Kristoff with Ramunas Navardauskas of Lithuania third. Vincenzo Nibali became only the sixth man in history to win all three of cycling's major tours as he sealed victory in this year's Tour de France on the Champs Elysees Sunday. "My goals won't change in the future, especially at the Tour de France,"he told the official Tour de France website. Legends Eddy Merckx of Belgium, France duo Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault, Nibali's fellow Italian Felipe Gimondi and Alberto Contador of Spain are the only others to achieve the feat. Astana's Nibali joins illustrious company by adding to his earlier triumphs in the Giro d'Italia and Tour of Spain.
