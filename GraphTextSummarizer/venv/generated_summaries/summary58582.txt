The Red Cross issued a statement, saying it considers traditional CPR to be better, but that compressions without mouth-to-mouth "is an acceptable alternative for those who are unwilling, unable, or not trained to perform full CPR." But the authors -- and an accompanying editorial -- all said the findings support the idea that bystanders should be encouraged to do steady chest compressions on victims of apparent cardiac arrest, without pausing to give breaths. In Phoenix and Seattle, 911 dispatchers already teach callers to use chest compressions only, in cases of apparent cardiac arrest. In the Seattle-London experiment, patients receiving chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth were more likely to survive without brain damage. In Arizona last year, rescuers saved nearly a third of cardiac arrest victims who were considered "saveable" -- meaning that someone saw them collapse and their hearts still had at least faint electrical rhythms.
