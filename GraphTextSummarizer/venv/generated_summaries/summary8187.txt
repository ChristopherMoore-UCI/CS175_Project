But the vast majority of Americans have to pay for their own health care and most do it where they work; many employers arrange health insurance and partly subsidize the premiums. Under the current hybrid system, the U.S. Government pays for health care for ex-military, the extremely poor and the elderly. "Within a decade we will be spending one out of every five dollars we earn on health care," Obama said recently. "If you look at their plan, it really is a big government-run plan that will take control of the delivery of health care in America," said Republican congressional leader John Boehner. Health care is a $2 trillion-dollar-a-year industry that would have to expand to cover millions of people who are now uninsured.
