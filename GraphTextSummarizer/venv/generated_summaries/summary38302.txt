But within the past two weeks, agents with ICE's Homeland Security Investigations received information from Vancouver police that Singh, 33, might be in the Los Angeles area. Ninderjit Singh, a Canadian citizen who lives in San Jacinto, California, is being detained on a provisional arrest warrant, the first step toward extraditing him to Vancouver, where is wanted in the 1999 shooting death of Poonam Randhawa, according to a statement from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to Vancouver detectives, the program generated a number of leads, but the fugitive continued to elude capture. "In a world where everyone wants instant gratification, it is all too easy to abandon cases that aren't solved quickly," Vancouver Police Deputy Chief Warren Lemcke was quoted as saying in an ICE statement. According to authorities, Randhawa was last seen alive with Singh in a vehicle near her school in Vancouver, and her body was found a short time later on a nearby street.
