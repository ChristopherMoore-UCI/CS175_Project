-- Hashtags are coming to Facebook to help users better surface conversations. The social network wants to make it easier for users to find content already on Facebook, and functional hashtags are the first step. Facebook will roll out hashtags to more users in the coming weeks. According to Facebook, many users already post hashtags anyway, so why not make them work? Hashtags will be both clickable and searchable, so, for example, topics like #NSALeaks or #NBAFinals will now exist.
