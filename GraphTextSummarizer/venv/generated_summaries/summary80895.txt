Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. There have been longstanding tensions between Uyghur Muslims, a Turkic people, and Chinese Han people in Xinjiang. Police officers at the scene shot dead dozens of people in the mob. The incident -- called an "organized and premeditated" terror attack -- occurred Monday in northwestern China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Amnesty International said Uyghurs face widespread discrimination, including in employment, housing and educational opportunities, as well as curtailed religious freedom and political marginalization.
