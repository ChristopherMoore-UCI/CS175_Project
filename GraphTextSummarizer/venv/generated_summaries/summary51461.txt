-- A lawyer for former Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide scoffed Monday at a U.S. government warning that his client's planned return to Haiti from South Africa could disrupt elections scheduled for Sunday. "We would urge former President Aristide to delay his return until after the electoral process has concluded to permit the Haitian people to cast their ballots in a peaceful atmosphere," Toner told reporters at a State Department briefing unrelated to Haiti. " Kurzban was referring to a comment made by State Department spokesman Mark Toner, who said Monday, "Mr. Aristide has chosen to remain outside of Haiti for seven years. "We encourage the South African government as a committed partner to Haiti's stability to urge former president Aristide to delay his return until after the elections," Toner said. Aristide has long said that he was removed from Haiti in 2004 aboard a CIA plane in a coup carried out by the U.S. government.
