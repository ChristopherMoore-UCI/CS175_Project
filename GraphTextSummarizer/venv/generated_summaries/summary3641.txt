Irrational Games and Take Two announced Wednesday that "BioShock Infinite" will be delayed four months to allow developers more time to make tweaks to the game. It means a bit more waiting, but more importantly, it means an even better BioShock Infinite." Levine said developers will hold off on showing "BioShock Infinite" this summer at such gaming events as E3 and Gamescom. "Preparing for these events takes time away from development, time we're going to use instead to get the best version of Infinite into your hands in February. Creative director Ken Levine made the announcement on Irrational's website: "When we announced the release date of BioShock Infinite in March, we felt pretty good about the timing," he wrote. "I won't kid you: BioShock Infinite is a very big game, and we're doing things that no one has ever done in a first-person shooter," he added.
