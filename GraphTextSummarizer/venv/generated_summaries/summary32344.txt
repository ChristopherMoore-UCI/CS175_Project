Phelps returned to competitive swimming in April and raced for the United States in August at the Pan Pacific Swimming Championships, his first international meet since the Olympics (and two years before the next Games in Brazil). " The decision comes after he was charged last week with driving under the influence of alcohol, excessive speed and crossing double lines on Interstate 95 in Baltimore. -- Swimmer Michael Phelps, the most-decorated Olympian of all time, tweeted Sunday that he is taking a break from the sport "to attend a program that will provide the help I need to better understand myself." Last week's arrest is not Phelps' first run-in with the law "I'll make a million mistakes in my life, but as long as I never make the same mistake again, then I've been able to learn and grow," Phelps said in 2012.
