Well, on the YouTube blog, the video-sharing site explains that it's been beefing up its copyright protection tools of late, i.e. the Content ID system (which lets copyright holders have more control over their content). Do you think the extra five minutes will equate to better content, or merely more room to rant about video games, Twilight and the like? Therefore, it's less likely that users can, say, upload large chunks of movies and TV shows without permission. YouTube announced Thursday that it has increased its upload limit from 10 minutes to 15 for non-partners. In celebration of this added time, YouTube is also launching a contest of sorts called "15 Minutes of Fame."
