The only major tournament Nadal hasn't won -- apart from his majors, he possesses an Olympic gold in singles and has won multiple Davis Cups -- is the ATP's year-end championships. " The Serbian reached the China final for the fourth time in five years after beating French fifth seed Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-2 in Saturday's second semifinal, and will be seeking to add to his titles from 2009, 2010 and last year. Last year, he suffered a shock second-round loss at Wimbledon and went on to miss seven months with a knee injury. "(This is) a great year, one of the best years of my career without any doubt," Nadal said on the ATP Tour's official website after Saturday's semifinal opponent Tomas Berdych retired due to a back injury at 4-2 down in the opening set. Although Djokovic relinquished his No. 1 ranking -- he has held it for 101 non-consecutive weeks -- he will lead Serbia when it faces the Czech Republic in the following Davis Cup final.
