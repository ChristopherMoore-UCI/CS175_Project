"One morning he paid for my coffee, and I'd like to see him and pay him that back." Bradley has been charged with aggravated burglary, theft of property, aggravated robbery and kidnapping, Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder told reporters. After Betty Davis talked to police, they went to the couple's home and found Dean Davis tied up, police said. Authorities in Fayetteville arrested 60-year-old Paul Bradley on Thursday, three days after 73-year-old Betty Davis walked into a bank there and told a teller she had a bomb fastened to her ankle. He said Bradley strapped the phony bomb onto Betty Davis and took her to the bank to force her to withdraw money from her account. Her husband, Dean Davis, said he has known Bradley for some time.
