With the Sony Xperia S rumored to arrive January 30, it wouldn't be surprising if prices on 2011 Sony handset prices start dropping soon. Motorola dropped the price of its ultra-thin 16GB Droid Razr from $300 to $200, with contract from Verizon. At Verizon, the Droid Pro and Droid 3 are also on sale, priced at $0 and $100, respectively. In Motorola's case, it's time to make room for the new kid in town, the Motorola Droid Razr Maxx, which will be available starting January 26. You'd be safe, nay, smart to pick up one of these options if you're looking to make the big switch from a feature phone to a smart device, or perhaps you recently bore witness to the death of your Droid in a wave of spilled beer.
