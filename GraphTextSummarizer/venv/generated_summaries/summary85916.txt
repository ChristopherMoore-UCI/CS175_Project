That day, students from a teachers college in nearby Ayotzinapa were on their way to stage a protest in Iguala. When former Mayor Jose Luis Abarca and his wife learned the protest would disrupt an event led by the latter, they gave orders to Public Safety Director Felipe Flores Velasquez to send police forces to prevent the students from protesting. The attorney general said his office learned the information from interrogations of police officers and gang members detained in the last month and allegedly involved in the incident. "From the very first hours" of the disappearance, the governor said, "the state government took immediate measures to detain police officers who were directly involved and other individuals who were identified as participants in these criminal acts with the purpose of locating the missing students and pay the necessary attention to the victims." The case has become a political crisis, with opposition lawmakers asking President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to dissolve the entire Guerrero state government and take charge.
