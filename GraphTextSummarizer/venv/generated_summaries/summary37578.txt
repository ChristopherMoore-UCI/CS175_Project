Study shows rise of al Qaeda affiliate in Syria Elsewhere, a car bomb exploded in Jarmana in southern Syria, killing 18 people, including three children, and wounding dozens more, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) reported Tuesday. "Early dawn today, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and some rebel battalions took full control of the Menagh air base," the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said Tuesday. However, al Nusra Front -- a group inspired by al Qaeda that has fought alongside rebels in Syria -- has denied the existence of a merged group. The Syrian regime downplayed reports that opposition fighters -- whom it calls "terrorists" -- had taken over Menagh air base. Fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and various rebel battalions destroyed several tanks and killed a number of regime soldiers, the observatory said.
