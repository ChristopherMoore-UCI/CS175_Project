Baras stumps for money from evangelical Christians to support Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -- land she calls biblical Israel. They support Israel -- which to them includes Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank. Watch behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour for the making of the TV special "God's Warriors" Back in church, Baras told the congregation: "We need to stand together so that our governments will believe that the land of Israel, the entire land of Israel, belongs to the Jewish people." Baras said God called her to this work. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates 85 million evangelicals believe God tells them to support Israel -- more than six times the world's Jewish population. Now such historic anti-Semitism has given way to an urgent support of Israel among some evangelicals, many of whom believe that when Jews live in all of the Holy Land -- what they call Greater Israel -- only then will Christ return and true believers be raptured up to heaven.
