McKinnon, a British citizen, has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to U.S. government computers. A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity. "This is the wholesale destruction and bullying of a small individual by the United States and now our own government," attorney Karen Todner said in a statement. " McKinnon is thought to have acted alone, with no known connection to any terrorist organization, said Paul McNulty, the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. McKinnon, currently free on bail in England, has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs.
