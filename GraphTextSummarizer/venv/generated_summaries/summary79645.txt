The poll found that 49% of Americans say Obama has the legal authority to loosen deportation policies on his own, while 48% say he doesn't. Only 26% of Americans think Obama's plan for those immigrants goes too far, while 50% called it about right and 22% said it doesn't go far enough, according to a CNN/ORC poll out Wednesday of 1,045 adults, conducted Nov. 21-23 and with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. That improvement, though, didn't affect Obama's overall approval rating, which the poll found was at 44% -- little changed from October's 45%. Instead, 76% said the GOP should spend more time passing immigration reform legislation -- something Obama repeatedly prodded his Republican critics, especially in the House, to do -- while just 21% said the party should focus on overturning Obama's policies. Obama, meanwhile, got a boost from young people and minorities for his handling of immigration after he announced his executive order last week.
