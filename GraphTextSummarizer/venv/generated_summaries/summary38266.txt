Oaxaca is in southwestern Mexico and Chihuahua is in northern Mexico, on the border with Texas. Calderon's offensive was a major departure from the way Mexico dealt with drug cartels. Chihuahua state and Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, have emerged as the major battleground among cartels seeking access to lucrative drug-running routes into the United States. Nowhere in Mexico are the streets bloodier than in Ciudad Juarez, where there have been more than 4,300 slayings in less than four years. Juarez is the largest city in Chihuahua state, where the Juarez and Sinaloa cartels have been killing each other at a record pace.
