America Speaking Out recognizes that the wisdom and will of the American people are the only things strong enough to change the course our nation is on. The current approach in Washington is failing the American people, who deserve a Congress and a government that puts their priorities and everyday concerns first. That notion is the driving force behind America Speaking Out, an unprecedented initiative designed to engage the public in a discussion of your priorities for America. The disconnect between the American people and the agenda being advanced in Washington is growing by the day. Americans wanted jobs, but instead Washington passed a "stimulus" that has failed to keep unemployment below 8 percent as promised -- while producing countless instances of government waste.
