Prosecutors had accused Drake, 54, of leaking information to a reporter and charged him last year in a 10-count indictment of willful retention of national defense information, obstruction of justice and making false statements. In a statement of facts submitted in June, Drake admitted to accessing the NSA's intranet site, from approximately February 2006 through March 2007, where he "obtained information, and provided said information orally and in writing to another person not permitted or authorized" to receive it. According to the Washington Post, he was concerned about a $1.2 billion dollar data-sifting program called Trailblazer and about NSA efforts to collect Americans' e-mail and phone call information without court orders. But prosecutors decided they could not pursue those charges in the controversial leak case after a federal judge in Baltimore, Maryland ruled classified information would have to be presented in open court. Thomas Drake pleaded guilty to that misdemeanor charge in June after government prosecutors agreed to drop more serious charges -- some of which fell under the Espionage Act -- which carried maximum penalties of 35 years in prison.
