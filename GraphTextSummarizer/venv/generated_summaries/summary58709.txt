It addresses a variety of possible routes of food contamination including the manure used as fertilizer, water sprayed on crops, animals in the fields, whether workers wash their hands and how packing houses process foods. The other rule sets out guidelines for "preventive controls for human food" and would require companies to have plans for foodborne illnesses. The FDA says additional rules are expected, including those addressing foreign suppliers, animal food and third -party auditors. "It's basic common sense," said Michael Taylor, FDA deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine. "This is a really important step toward food safety standards that would prevent contamination whether it is produced in a food factory or being produced on a farm," said Chris Waldrop, director of the Food Policy Institute at the Consumer Federation of America.
