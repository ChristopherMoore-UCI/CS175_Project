On Thursday, separatist officials did not respond to additional requests from CNN about Skiba's welfare. Since his detention, CNN has attempted through a number of different separatist officials, including the office of the separatist Prime Minister Alexander Borodai, to secure Skiba's freedom. Armed men from the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic seized Anton Skiba outside a hotel in the separatist-controlled city of Donetsk after he had worked for one day with a CNN television crew. That has not happened to date, so CNN is now publicly asking those who are holding Skiba to release him immediately. In subsequent conversations with CNN, Kalyussky dropped the accusation that Skiba was offering cash rewards for assassinations.
