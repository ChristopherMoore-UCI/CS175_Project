The giant panda mama gave birth to the cub August 23, to the excitement of hordes of fans watching it on public panda cams. Mei Xiang was artificially inseminated by sperm from two different pandas, zoo officials said. The cub is the offspring of Washington's celebrity panda, Mei Xiang, and the father is Tian Tian, a 16-year-old, 264-pound male who lives in the same zoo, officials said. One was Tian Tian, and the other potential father was Gao Gao, a 20-plus years old, 174-pound giant panda from the San Diego Zoo. The zoo announced the gender Thursday morning, as well as the paternity of the giant panda cub born last month.
