Oilfield services giant Halliburton pleaded guilty Thursday to destroying test results that investigators had sought as evidence in the Deepwater Horizon disaster, and federal prosecutors announced a related charge against one of its executives. In 2011, BP accused Halliburton of destroying evidence -- including "inexplicably missing" computer modeling results -- "to eliminate any risk that this evidence would be used against it at trial. A federal report in 2011 concluded that BP, Halliburton and Transocean all violated federal offshore safety regulations and shared responsibility for the disaster. But prosecutors accused Halliburton of running computer simulations in May and June 2010 that showed "little difference" between the 21 centralizers it says it recommended and the six BP eventually used -- and then destroying the results. " Halliburton is the last of the three major players to admit criminal wrongdoing in the 2010 blowout and resulting oil spill.
