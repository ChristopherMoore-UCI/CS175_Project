While Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are busy with royal obligations, Prince George is cared for by what some would call a supernanny. The royal baby tagged along in April with his mom and dad on their first family trip abroad in New Zealand and Australia. The 9-month-old followed in the footsteps of his father, who was the first heir to be brought along on a royal trip at such a young age when his own parents toured Australia and New Zealand in 1983. Believe it or not, it has been almost a year since the birth of Prince George Alexander Louis, the son of Britain's Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton. The duchess, with Prince William present, delivered the baby boy at 4:24 p.m.
