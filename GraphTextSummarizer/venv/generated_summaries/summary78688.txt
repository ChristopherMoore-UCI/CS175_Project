-- FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told CNN he believes there is no on-field racism in football and that players who think they have been abused should simply say "this is a game. In his interview with CNN, Blatter, who was re-elected unopposed as the head of world football despite allegations of corruption surrounding the voting process for the right to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, championed his organization's commitment to tackling racism. Manchester United's Rio Ferdinand, brother of Anton, took to Twitter to say: "Tell me I have just read Sepp Blatter's comments on racism in football wrong .... On Wednesday the English Football Association (FA) announced they had charged Liverpool player Suarez over a clash with Manchester United's Patrice Evra during an English Premier League match in October. " The head of world soccer insisted FIFA had been tireless in their efforts to combat the specter of racism in football but suggested any player who is abused during a game should shake hands with their opponent upon the final whistle and move on.
