It wounded two more people, said police spokesman Haji Yaqoob of Khost province. The bomber attempted to enter a village where coalition forces were conducting training exercises with Afghan police, but officers at a checkpoint recognized his explosive vest and stopped him, police said. In a separate incident Saturday, a suicide bomber on a bicycle detonated himself at a gate to the Afghan defense ministry in Kabul hours after newly appointed U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel landed in the Afghan capital. The secretary is in Afghanistan to visit American troops and get the lay of the land in the restive country to better advise President Barack Obama.
