Consequently, Havel has cautionary words for the overheated acolytes of perpetual revolution and retribution. "Violence is well-known to breed violence, which is why most revolutions have degenerated into dictatorships, devouring their own offspring," he wrote, "not knowing that they were digging their own graves and confining society in a vicious circle of revolutions and counter-revolutions." This is the hallmark of Havel's writing -- challenges to power rooted not in imperious ideological rhetoric but harder-to-dismiss, human-size truths. There is this enduring wisdom as well: Havel's vision of an anti-totalitarian state ended up looking a lot like liberal capitalist democracy, with an emphasis on preserving pluralism and the uniqueness of a community. In an uncertain, always evolving world, I am certain of this: Vaclav Havel's words and example will endure and continue to provide inspiration, lighting a path forward, reminding us that history takes place in the here and now and that we all contribute to making it.
