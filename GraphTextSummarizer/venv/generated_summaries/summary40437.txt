Heavily armed militants staged an attack on a U.N. peacekeepers' base that was sheltering civilians in South Sudan on Thursday, killing at least 48 people and seriously injuring dozens more, a U.N. spokesman in the country said Friday. Any attack on U.N. peacekeepers is "unacceptable and constitutes a war crime," the Ban said in a statement released on Thursday. The attack on the U.N. base in Bor, the capital of Jonglei state, began when militants used rocket-propelled grenades to breach the compound, U.N. spokesman Joseph Contreras said. South Sudan erupted in violence in mid-December when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup to oust President Salva Kiir. Contreras said the gunmen then opened fire at the base, where peacekeepers had been hosting and protecting nearly 5,000 civilians.
