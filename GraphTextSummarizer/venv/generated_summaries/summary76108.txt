The measure sets up project monitoring, including a government-wide recovery program Web site, where all announcements for grant competitions, formula grant allocations and competitive grant awards must be listed. Restrictions added to the stimulus proposal would keep the money from zoo projects, among other things. In addition, government agencies must publish on the site, "a description of all infrastructure projects, and the total cost and the justification for using stimulus money." The stimulus package is already being taken up by key committees in the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid -- from casino-heavy Nevada -- said he is not concerned about the House restrictions on money going to casinos. "The purpose of this bill is to direct funding at projects that are primarily and clearly aimed at benefiting the economic conditions of communities and the public at large," the bill states.
