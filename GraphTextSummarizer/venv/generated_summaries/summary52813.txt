Duke, along with D. Channsin Berry, co-directed and co-produced "Dark Girls," which will be released on DVD September 24. " In this edited conversation, co-directors Bill Duke and D. Channsin Berry shared with CNN what they learned making the film and how the conversation began. I was at a theater, and an elderly lady -- beautiful woman -- stands up and says:  'Mr. Duke, I really appreciate your film, but why are you airing our dirty laundry?' But the more I started to do interviews around the country and around the world -- and this is the crazy thing I found out, it was so enlightening -- that all women around the world are "dark girls" at some point in time in their lives. The documentary begins by looking at the issues of intracultural colorism within the black American community, but also touches on issues of color in India and around the world.
