Pirates seized an Italian-flagged vessel off the Horn of Africa on Thursday morning, the European Union's anti-piracy taskforce said. The ship was seized 350 nautical miles southeast of the Omani port city of Salalah, in the eastern part of the Gulf of Aden, said the European Union Naval Force Somalia. On March 28, pirates firing small arms and rocket-propelled grenades seized an oil tanker in the same area. The UAE-flagged vessel was on its way to Singapore from Sudan when it was attacked.
