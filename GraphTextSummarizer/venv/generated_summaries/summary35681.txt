Keshi made big changes after Nigeria failed to qualify for last year's event in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon -- a turbulent period for the national team, which was suspended from international football by President Goodluck Jonathan before world ruling body FIFA threatened to intervene. "The President also believes that having conquered Africa, the new Super Eagles can go on to achieve even greater glory at the World Cup in Brazil next year. Burkina Faso, playing in the final for the first time, missed out on the $1.5 million first prize and the chance to represent Africa at this year's Confederations Cup in Brazil. "President Jonathan thanks coach Stephen Keshi and all members of the team who have worked very hard to make Nigeria the proud champions of Africa once again after 19 years of setbacks in the competition," his office said in a statement. " Stephen Keshi became only the second man to win the title as both coach and player, having been captain at the 1994 tournament when Nigeria won for the second time -- though he did not play in that final.
