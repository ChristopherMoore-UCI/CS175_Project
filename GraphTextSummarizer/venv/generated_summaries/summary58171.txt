Anti-riot police guarded major mosques in Muslim majority Bangladesh on Friday, the weekly holiday. -- Angry supporters of a Bangladesh Islamist party leader, given the death penalty for a war crimes conviction, continued clashes with police Friday in different districts, pushing the death toll to 45 since demonstrations began, police said. Thirty-seven of the 45 dead were killed Thursday as Jamaat-e-Islami movement supporters clashed with police after the court sentenced Delwar Hossain Sayedee, one of the party's top leaders, to death. "The situation is very much under control," the inspector general of Bangladesh police, Hassan Mahmood Khandker, told CNN. A huge contingent of police and paramilitary troopers was deployed to ward off further violence.
