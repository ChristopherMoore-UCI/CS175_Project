The World Low Cost Carriers Conference in London provides him with the opportunity to meet key CEOs including Tony Davis from Tiger Airways, Brett Godfrey from Virgin Blue and Tony Fernandes from Air Asia. End of the line: the commercial airline graveyard in the Mojave Desert outside Los Angeles Job losses, losing weight off aircraft, increasing fuel surcharges and retiring old aircraft are options being considered and implemented. Quest reports on how one particular airline is weathering the storm - Richard Branson's Virgin Group, and he also looks at the low cost sector. Host Richard Quest opens the program in the Mojave Desert, just outside Los Angeles, known as the aircraft graveyard, where retired airliners end up. Old vintage planes like Pan Am and DC-9s, as well as 747s and 737s are all gathered here, and the aircraft are dismantled before their parts are sold.
