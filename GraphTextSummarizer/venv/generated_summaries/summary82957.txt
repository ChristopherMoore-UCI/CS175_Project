"My career took an abrupt and radical left turn when Seth McFarlane created CIA Deputy Director Avery Bullock on 'American Dad,'" said Patrick Stewart, who will next appear on the big screen in "X-Men: Days of Future Past." -- Starz has picked up a two season, 20-episode order of half-hour scripted comedy series "Blunt Talk" from Seth MacFarlane ("Family Guy") and Jonathan Ames ("Bored to Death") and starring Patrick Stewart. "In the character of Walter Blunt, Seth, Jonathan and Patrick have found the alchemy that makes a borderline alcoholic, mad-genius-Brit the man you want fighting in America's corner," said Starz CEO Chris Albrecht. The series follows British newsman Walter Blunt (Stewart) on a mission to conquer American cable news by sharing his opinion and guidance, even when they are not wanted. "I'm beyond thrilled to be working with Jonathan Ames and Sir Patrick Stewart," said Seth Macfarlane in a statement.
