-- You don't have to be a motorcycle enthusiast to be wowed by the custom bikes created by Paul Teutul Sr. " Teutul, or "Senior" as he's called, left the U.S. Merchant Marine and eventually opened his first business, called "Paul's Welding," according to the Orange County Choppers website. After he grew his welding shop into a 30-employee business called "Iron Works," his passion for customizing motorcycles grew in leaps and bounds. Teutul says there's a long history of alcoholism in his family: "My uncle was an alcoholic, my mother was an alcoholic. "It's tough when you're not drinking and you've got two people on either side of you in a truck knocking down shots of Black Velvet (whiskey) and drinking beers and you're in the middle."
