An easy train journey from Brussels and Amsterdam and a mid-distance journey from London, Paris and several German stations, Maastricht is laden with good restaurants (there are four Michelin-starred eateries), shopping, history, public art and surrounded by pretty villages with woodland walking paths. The cathedral draws many pilgrims, with Pope John Paul II once a visitor in 1984. However, I would happily go to "church" at Maastricht's Kruisherenhotel on a daily basis. As proud locals tell my wife and me, there are plenty of empty churches in the area that could do with a similar makeover. The Kruisherenhotel, though, is only one of Maastricht's many gems.
