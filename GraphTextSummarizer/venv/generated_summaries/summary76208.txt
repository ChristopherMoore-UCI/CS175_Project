-- A fatal explosion last month in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, was caused by the accidental ignition of natural gas vapors that had accumulated inside a popular restaurant, according to a report from a joint city-federal task force issued Wednesday. At that time, authorities did not know what had caused the leaking gas to ignite, according to Rob Hack, chief operating officer of Missouri Gas Energy. The contractor, Heartland Midwest, did not have a permit for the excavation, Assistant City Manager Patrick Klein said days after the explosion. After the gas line nearby was ruptured, firefighters asked employees at JJ's restaurant "to put the flames out on the candles, stove and hot water heater" inside, said the report. A Missouri Gas Energy employee showed up about 20 minutes after the initial call and, after some initial readings on gas-measuring devices, called for backup, Hack said.
