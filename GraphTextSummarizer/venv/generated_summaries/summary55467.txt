"Thanks to all of you, near and far, old and young, who joined the Cassini mission in marking the first time inhabitants of Earth had advance notice that our picture was being taken from interplanetary distances," said Cassini project scientist Linda Spilker in a statement released by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Cassini took a picture of Earth as part of a larger set of images it was collecting of the Saturn system. People shared more than 1,400 images of themselves as part of the July 19 "Wave at Saturn" event, which was organized by NASA's Cassini mission. "While Earth is too small in the images Cassini obtained to distinguish any individual human beings, the mission has put together this collage so that we can celebrate all your waving hands, uplifted paws, smiling faces and artwork." The project originated because the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft, which was launched in 1997 and has been in orbit around Saturn since 2004, was going to be taking pictures of the planet and its rings during a solar eclipse.
