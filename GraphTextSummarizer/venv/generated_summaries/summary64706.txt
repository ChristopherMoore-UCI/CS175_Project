She and her husband, actor Dean McDermott -- along with the couple's children Liam, 3, and Stella, 2 -- star in their own reality TV show, "Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood." And we have this great, unbelievable opportunity to plan people's dream weddings and kind of navigate young couples through the process of getting married -- what their relationship is now and what they can look forward to and guide them through that." When asked about the return of "Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood," which just wrapped up its fourth season, Spelling told CNN, "No official pickup has been announced, but if the fans bring us back, I think there's a very good chance. "We're currently filming 'Tori & Dean: Weddings,' " she says, "which is really amazing because everyone knows I love planning a party, and I specifically love planning a wedding and I'm all about love. The fans are worried that this is a replacement, but we plan on doing both shows, so the great thing about that is they'll get two sets of 'Tori & Dean' two times a year instead of one set one time a year. In her book, Spelling said she had come to terms with the fact that, like all couples, she and McDermott were in an "ebb" phase, and that things weren't always going to "flow."
