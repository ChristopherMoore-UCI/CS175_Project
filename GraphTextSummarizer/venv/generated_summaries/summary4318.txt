On Thursday, Aldrin is hitching a ride aboard Air Force One to Cape Canaveral's Kennedy Space Center in Florida at the invitation of President Obama, White House spokesman Nick Shapiro said. In the letter, Aldrin writes, "As an Apollo astronaut, I know full well the importance of always exploring new frontiers and tackling new challenges as we explore space. But the White House is getting the message that a lot of people are worried about Obama's new direction in space exploration, so Obama is making the trip to Kennedy Space Center, with supporter Aldrin as his wingman. What this nation needs in order to maintain its position as the 21st century leader in space exploration is a near-term focus on lowering the cost of access to space and on developing key, cutting-edge technologies that will take us further and faster. ... ..." When asked if the president received Armstrong's open letter criticizing his new approach to human space exploration, a White House official said, "I don't think we ever got it."
