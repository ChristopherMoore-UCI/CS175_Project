Wet hop beers are the ultimate example of farm-to-glass, and are designed to celebrate the agriculture of beer. Warrior IPA -- Left Hand Brewing Probably the only wet hop beer on the list not featuring Pacific Northwest hops. Northern Hemisphere Harvest -- Sierra Nevada Sierra Nevada has been brewing up wet hop beers since 1996, so they have got it down. Vine to Victory Harvest Ale -- Victory Brewing Company A very ambitious undertaking by Victory to get a whopping six tons of fresh hops hauled in refrigerated trucks from Yakima Valley to their Downingtown, Pennsylvania, brewery for this fresh hop offering. These hops are referred to as "wet hops."
