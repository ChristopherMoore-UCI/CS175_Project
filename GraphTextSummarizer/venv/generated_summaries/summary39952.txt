The creation of the database, which does not require a legislative vote, was announced by state Rep. Joe Pickett, D-El Paso. Pickett is the chairman of the state legislature's Homeland Security and Public Safety Committee. In April, a fire at the facility operated by West Fertilizer Company set off two explosions that registered on seismographs as a magnitude-2.1 earthquake and were felt 50 miles away. -- With the deadly fertilizer plant explosions in the city of West on its mind, Texas will develop an online database that will allow residents to view local facilities that hold hazardous materials. The new database will not only list sites with high volumes of ammonium nitrate, but also other volatile chemicals, Pickett said.
