Desperate to contact her husband, or at least rule out the possibility that he was involved in the crash, Johnson reached out to Finn, like she had done many times before when trying to gather information about an accident. -- Trooper William Finn, a spokesman with the Washington State Patrol, was tweeting Wednesday under the handle @wspd5pio about an accident on Vancouver's Interstate 205. Finn was at the accident scene gathering information. At 2:20 p.m. PT, Johnson sent a tweet to Finn, "@wspd5pio do you have descriptions of involved vehicles?" "@ScanCouver sorry. About 10 minutes earlier, Caran Johnson, a local scanner aficionado and a follower of Finn's on Twitter, had learned about the accident.
