A 26,000-gallon tanker began leaking styrene monomer after a derailment at a train yard in Willard, City Manager Brian Humphress said Wednesday morning. The spill was contained around 4:20 a.m. ET Wednesday, and officials hoped to get people back into their homes by late Wednesday morning, Humphress said. Because the chemical is highly flammable, officials ordered the evacuation of more than 400 homes in and near the city -- in about a half-mile radius from the rail yard, Humphress said. State environmental officials were monitoring the scene, Humphress said. -- More than 400 homes were evacuated in a small northern Ohio community overnight after a train tanker began leaking a flammable chemical late Tuesday
