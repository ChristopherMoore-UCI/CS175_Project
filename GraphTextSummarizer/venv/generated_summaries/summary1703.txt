The 73-year-old Cianci lost a Providence mayor's race for the first time in seven runs on Tuesday, falling to political neophyte Jorge Elorza. He made both his records, mayoral and criminal, a centerpiece of his message in a race against a much younger and far less experienced opponent -- a race Cianci said was his "final rodeo." "You're not going to get a Pulitzer Prize or an Emmy by saying 'Buddy Cianci is a convicted felon,'" Cianci told CNN at his Providence headquarters recently. -- Buddy Cianci has been convicted twice, and twice he's been forced out as mayor of Providence, Rhode Island. Buddy II ended after Cianci was convicted on federal corruption charges. "In this mayor's two administrations, there has been more corruption in the city of Providence than in the history of this state," said Judge Ernest Torres.
