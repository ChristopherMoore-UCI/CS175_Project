In 2009-10, Terry became the first man to lead the Blues to a Premier League and FA Cup double. His rise to prominence continued in June 2003 when he made his first appearance for the England national team, as manager Sven Goran Eriksson introduced him as a second-half substitute in a 2-1 win over Serbia and Montenegro. Capello reinstated Terry as England captain in March 2011 as a result of an injury to United center-back Rio Ferdinand. The defender was named England captain by Eriksson's successor Steve McClaren, and scored in his first match wearing the armband -- a 4-0 defeat of Greece at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium. After a brief spell on loan at second division Nottingham Forest, Terry established himself in Chelsea's starting line-up as a 20-year-old during the 2000-01 Premier League season.
