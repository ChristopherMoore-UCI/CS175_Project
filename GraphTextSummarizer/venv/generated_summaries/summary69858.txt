Christina Lowden, co-owner of Trinity Yoga in New Port Richey, Florida, says, "yoga tends to attract like-minded people, so relationships blossom easily while chatting after class or at special events. Most yoga studios are affiliated with a charity, and often donate time to schools, prisons or shelters. That's where yoga comes in:  the ancient practice can provide the resources and support for a multitude of modern-day lifestyle changes. If you've set any of the top resolutions -- like being happier, getting healthier or sleeping better -- yoga offers ways to transform your resolutions into lasting reality. And it doesn't matter if you're a seasoned yogi or never stepped onto a mat, you can leverage yoga to realize your most ambitious lifestyle goals.
