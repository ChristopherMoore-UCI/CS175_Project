Michal and DeLaun are from very different backgrounds, but became friends as classmates in an Orion Center technology class. "Last year we had 2,057 young people," said Melinda Giovengo, the executive director of YouthCare, the organization that oversees Orion Center. On the street, Orion Center has a reputation for its pleasant and welcoming staff, and, as Kayla Wyatt puts it, a place to get a good "feed."

Through Orion House Center, she worked on her GED, and then joined one of the vocational training programs -- this one for baristas for local cafes and coffee shops.
