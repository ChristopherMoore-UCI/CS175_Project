One aide told me that Obama was planning to go out for a nice unofficial dinner with first lady Michelle Obama in Prague on Saturday night but it was canceled because they simply needed some sleep. A new CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll found that 79 percent of Americans surveyed feel that Obama has had a "more positive" effect on how people in other countries view the U.S. Only 19 percent of those surveyed thought he's had a "more negative" effect. But that money is being directed to the International Monetary Fund to help developing countries, not pumped into the large economies to stimulate growth as U.S. officials had hoped. President Obama speaks during a news conference after the G-20 summit in London, England, on April 2. Editor's note: CNN's Ed Henry traveled with Barack Obama to Europe on the his first overseas trip as president.
