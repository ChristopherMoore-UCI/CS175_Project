New U.S. captain Jim Courier will field Roddick in their opening World Group first round tie in Chile on March 4-6. The pair will now stop up their preparations for the opening grand slam of 2011 in Australia with Henin taking part in next month's Hopman Cup in Perth. The pair were playing in the Diamond Games in Antwerp with Henin testing herself after being out since mid-season with an elbow ligament injury. She won the first set 6-1 in just 25 minutes, but Henin recovered from falling an early break down to win the second 6-3 to level. Meanwhile, Andy Roddick has confirmed he will turn out for the United States Davis Cup team next year after being unavailable in 2010.
