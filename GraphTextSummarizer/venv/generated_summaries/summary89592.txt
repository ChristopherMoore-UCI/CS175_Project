A dozen people were packed into the 2003 GMC Envoy on Monday, on the way to a family outing at Splash Kingdom water park in Canton, Texas, according to Trooper Jean Dark of the Texas Department of Public Safety. Driver Federico Acuna lost control when the right rear tire exploded on Interstate 20 just outside Canton in Van Zandt County on Monday afternoon, Dark said. Saideth Acuna, 6, Omar Jaimes, 7, and Ulisa Acuna, 3, died at hospitals, Dark said. None of the children who died was wearing a seat belt, Dark said. While no charges have been filed against Acuna, who was wearing his seat belt and wasn't injured, there is the potential for five charges of criminally negligent homicide, Dark said.
