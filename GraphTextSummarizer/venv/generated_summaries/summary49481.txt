A year ago, the 28-year-old posted an iReport about what it was like to grow up in Tunisia under former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. Following the 28-day Tunisian revolt that toppled Ben Ali, revolt spread in other countries: Egypt and the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. "I am so glad that tyrant is gone." Ben Ali resigned and fled to Saudi Arabia in middle January 2011. "My son represents the new Tunisia," Ben Salah, a Tunisian native, recently told CNN. Fear left with Ben Ali.
