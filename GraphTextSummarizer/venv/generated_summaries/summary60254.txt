Republicans are trying to exploit Clinton's attempts to distance herself from the "Obama Doctrine." "Moving away from Mr. Obama may look good on paper, but it may not work so well," Rove wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal. "Hillary Clinton spent four years executing Barack Obama's foreign policy and in year five of Obama's term, it's ridiculous for Hillary to try to swindle voters into thinking what's happening around the world isn't a product of Obama-Hillary diplomacy," said Kirsten Kurkowski, spokeswoman for the RNC. In an interview with The Atlantic, Clinton trashed the Obama mantra that reflects his cautious approach to foreign policy: "Don't do stupid stuff." Much of this reached crisis stage after she left the State Department, but Clinton is on the hook for a lot of Obama's foreign policy legacy. "For one thing, Mrs. Clinton cannot point to any notable successes during her State Department tenure."
