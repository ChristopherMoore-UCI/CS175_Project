In the waiting room, I sit with many other cancer patients. Are we close to beating cancer? What if the chemotherapy and radiation caused some other form of cancer or did it cause a genetic mutation that's going to force me to be isolated from the human population and live in a clean room forever? After reading 16 magazines cover-to-cover, mostly about how to prevent cancer, and several rounds of counting the floor tiles, the nurse calls my name. In between appointments, any cough, ache or pain forces me to wonder whether it's cancer growing in my body.
