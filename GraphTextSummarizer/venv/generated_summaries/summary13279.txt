In January, Mandela completed his recovery from a lung infection and gallstone surgery and gradually returned to his normal routine, officials said at the time. Mandela was hospitalized for a lung infection in early December and a week later underwent surgery to remove gallstones. -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela has been hospitalized again, but officials say it's only for a routine checkup.
