" Paul de Zylva, head of international environmental organization Friends of the Earth has been working on the issue of the Games coming to London since 2003, two years prior to the city being awarded the Olympics. "There are all kinds of different habitats here and there are target species," John Hopkins, a project sponsor for the parklands and public realm at the authority, told CNN. "The plan they have come up with is about trying to create some of the old London habitat that used to exist there," said Da Zylva. So that's a good ambition." De Zylva also praised the honesty of London's organizers with regards to making information about the Games available. " London has held the Summer Olympics on two previous occasions, in 1908 and 1948 -- next year's event will begin with the opening ceremony on July 27 and conclude on August 12.
