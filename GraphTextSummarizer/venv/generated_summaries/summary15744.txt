So you can just imagine the mushy effect on your insides upon seeing this little group of African penguins (also called jackass penguins, no joke) waddling around dressed in tiny penguin-sized Christmas outfits at Everland Amusement Park in Yongin, South Korea. While their march was slated to go on twice a day every day until Christmas, the schedule has been unexpectedly cut short due to the drops in temperature in South Korea. "Today was the last day," said Everland's media spokesperson Kim In-chul. Some dressed like Santa, some like Christmas trees, they walked, marched and melted the hearts of every squealing, DSLR-toting onlooker twice a day since the beginning of December. " "It's exercise for the penguins and they are in a very safe environment with keepers they trust, so we don't believe it should be considered cruel in any way," said Kim.
