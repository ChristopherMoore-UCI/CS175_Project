"The cost of seeking office whether it's for state legislature or a governorship or a member of the U.S. House or Senate, these costs have been going up for decades," said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies elections and campaign finance issues. "There's always an instinct on the part of incumbent members -- incumbent office holders -- to build a war chest even if they may not need to use a penny of it, and as a consequence challengers, those who are trying to break through for the first time, face an increasingly daunting challenge in raising enough money to get themselves known," Mann said. "It takes a lot of money to run for office, but that's what it takes and like any businessman or whatever, you have to do what the job takes." A Wesleyan Media Project analysis of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG found that television ads for candidates running for Congress in 2010 racked up nearly 1.6 million airings at an estimated cost of $735 million, an amount that represents 61% increase over 2008. The high cost of running for federal office often puts newcomers facing well-known incumbents -- who often have more financial backing from supporters and political parties -- at a substantial disadvantage.
