"As producers of the film ... we would like to express our deep shock and sadness at the sentence imposed by the Iranian government against actress Marzieh Vafamehr and we continue to offer our support to Marzieh and her family by respecting their wishes to let the case and the appeal follow the proper legal channels," said Kate Croser and Julie Ryan. In August, the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran said it had interviewed the actress's husband, Iranian filmmaker Nasser Taghvai. The movie features Vafamehr playing an actress who is banned from working in Iran and then tries to leave, the Kaleme website said. -- An Iranian actress has been sentenced to a year in jail and 90 lashes for appearing in a film critical of the country's government, an opposition website said. The website did not offer specifics about what Vafamehr was convicted of or when she was sentenced.
