As Blake met Hasina, also present was former World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn, one of the founders of Friends of Grameen, an international forum supporting Yunus and his Grameen Bank. The Bangladeshi government has been asked to find a compromise to bring an end to the Grameen Bank crisis created by removing its founder, microcredit pioneer Muhammad Yunus. Yunus and nine directors of his Grameen Bank again filed two petitions with the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court seeking a stay of the High Court order. Earlier this month, the 70-year-old Yunus was removed from Grameen Bank, which he founded three decades ago. For their efforts, Yunus and Grameen Bank won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.
