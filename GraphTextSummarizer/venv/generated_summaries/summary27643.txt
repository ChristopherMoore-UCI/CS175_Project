Earlier this month, Britain's National Beef Association called for more specific labeling of meat products and asked that the words "United Kingdom origin" be printed on packaging. Police and health officials have raided a slaughterhouse and meat company in the United Kingdom as part of an ongoing investigation into horse meat that was labeled as beef, authorities said Tuesday. " "It's totally unacceptable if any business in the UK is defrauding the public by passing off horse meat as beef," he said. " Horse meat was discovered in products that are supposed to be 100% beef sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. "I ordered an audit of all horse-producing abattoirs in the UK after this issue first arose last month and I was shocked to uncover what appears to be a blatant misleading of consumers," said Andrew Rhodes, Food Standards Agency director of operations.
