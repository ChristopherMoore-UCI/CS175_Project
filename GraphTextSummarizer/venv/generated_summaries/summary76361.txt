Adan Perez worked for horse trainer Cecil Borel, the brother of three-time Kentucky Derby-winning jockey Calvin Borel. -- Wilson Perez believes his father's killer is one of the hundreds of stable workers who live and care for horses in an area known as the "backside" of the Churchill Downs horse racing grounds. The backside of horse racing tracks is the forgotten side of the horse racing grounds. The body was left in Barn No. 8, which backs up to the backstretch of the famed Churchill Downs horse racing track. It's an area that highlights the stark class structure of horse racing.
