-- Head football coach Joe Paterno and the university president have lost their jobs, effective immediately, over a child sex abuse scandal at Penn State, university trustees announced Wednesday night. Tom Bradley will be Penn State head coach in Joe Paterno's absence. The case has raised questions on how Penn State officials handled allegations. State Attorney General Linda Kelly said Monday that the alleged failure of Timothy Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, and Gary Schultz, 62, the university's senior vice president for finance and business, to report abuse claims "likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many, many years. "Schools and school officials have a legal and moral responsibility to protect children and young people from violence and abuse." Athletes, fans and students grappled with implications of the widening scandal.
