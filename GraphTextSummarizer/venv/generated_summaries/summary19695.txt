Meanwhile, Andrey Kashechkin of the Astana team and Cofidis' Yoann Bagot became the first two riders to withdraw from this year's Tour after suffering digestive problems and food poisoning respectively. -- Just a year and a half after making their debut, Orica-GreenEdge became the first Australian team to win a stage at the Tour de France as Simon Gerrans finished ahead of the pack in a tight sprint finish in Corsica. " Tuesday's team trial in Nice could see race favorite Chris Froome take the yellow jersey given the strength of Team Sky. "We didn't really find out what happened until we finished the first stage," said Gerrans, 33. Making their racing debut in January 2012, Orica-GreenEdge were founded the year before with the express intention of becoming Australia's first road race cycling team.
