-- A Yale University lab technician pleaded guilty Thursday to murder and attempted sexual assault in the killing of graduate student Annie Le in 2009. Clark was not a Yale student but had worked as a lab technician at the university since 2004, after graduating from high school. She had planned to marry Columbia graduate student Jonathan Widawsky on the day her body was found. A Yale faculty member described Clark's job as maintaining colonies for animals used in research. He lived with his girlfriend, who also is a Yale lab technician, according to police.
