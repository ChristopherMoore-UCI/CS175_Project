Obama gave no hints about possible replacements in his goodbye remarks to Holder, offering only a tidbit of what he's looking for in an attorney general: "I chose him to serve as attorney general because he believes, as I do, that justice is not just an abstract theory -- it's a living and breathing principle." While Attorney General Eric Holder had made clear that he wanted to leave the post before the end of Obama's second term, the announcement of his departure just before midterm elections took many by surprise and the timing could complicate the effort to replace him. Obama and Holder are good friends, and Holder is a part of the Obama inner circle that includes key adviser Valerie Jarrett, whom Holder thanked Thursday as someone who he had "been fortunate to work with since the beginning of what started as an improbable, idealistic effort by a young senator from Illinois. " Furthermore, the issues that Holder has championed -- voting rights, LGBT rights and reducing prison sentences for low-level drug offenders -- are important aspects of Obama's legacy, so this pick will, in all likelihood, be an incredibly important one for him. "We have been great colleagues, but the bonds between us are much deeper than that," Holder said Thursday in a joint statement with Obama, announcing his departure.
