As part of the 80th anniversary of Monopoly's first appearance in France, Hasbro is issuing a handful of special sets in that country with real euros in place of the colorful paper it usually offers. Mediterranean Avenue with no houses (assuming its owner doesn't also own Baltic Avenue). (Many of those sets substitute local landmarks for the familiar Atlantic City street names.) - There are 32 houses and 12 hotels in a standard Monopoly set. - San Francisco jeweler Sidney Mobell is responsible for the most expensive Monopoly set, a $2 million game with a golden board and diamond-studded dice.
