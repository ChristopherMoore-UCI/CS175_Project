Instead, it is the largest cockfighting bust in New York state history, resulting in more than 3,000 seized birds, 70 people taken into custody and nine felony arrests by Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman's Organized Crime Task Force. "Cockfighting is a cruel, abusive and barbaric practice that tortures animals, endangers the health and safety of the public and is known to facilitate other crimes," Schneiderman said in the release. "My office will keep working to hold these individuals accountable, and put an end to illegal cockfighting," said Schneiderman. A cockfight in Queens, a pet shop in Brooklyn, and a farm in upstate Plattekill were raided Saturday night into Sunday by the task force, with the help of New York State Police, the Homeland Security Department and the Ulster County sheriff's office, according to a news release from Schneiderman's office. The Ulster County sheriff's office and other local law enforcement helped OCTF investigators raid the 90-acre farm in Plattekill.
