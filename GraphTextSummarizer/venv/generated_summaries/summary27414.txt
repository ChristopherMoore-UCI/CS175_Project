Due to their overwhelmingly young audiences, who love to rush out to the theater on opening weekend, horror movies almost always open big and fall precipitously at the box office, but "The Devil Inside," with its utterly terrible "F" CinemaScore grade (some issue has been raised as to whether the grade is actually an "F" or closer to the "C" range), will likely plummet even more quickly. The 2012 box office got off to a fine start this weekend, as Paramount's "found footage" (riiiight...) horror movie "The Devil Inside," which the studio acquired for just under $1 million, earned a tremendous $34.5 million in its first three days, becoming the first breakout box office star since "The Lion King 3D." In fact, the strong debut marks the third-best January opening of all time behind "Cloverfield" ($40.1 million) and a re-release of "Star Wars" ($35.9 million). "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" finished the frame in fourth place with $11.3 million, dipping only 24 percent, the smallest drop in the Top 10. The next three spots were filled by holiday releases that never totally found their footing. But it's more likely a sign of the recent popularity of possession movies.
