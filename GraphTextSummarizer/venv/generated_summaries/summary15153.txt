Khartoum Police Chief Mohammad Othman Mohammad Noor said that "a defect" in the Sudan Airways plane caused it to catch fire as it touched down during a storm. The last airline disaster involving a Sudan Airways plane was July 8, 2003, when a Boeing 737 reported engine trouble after take-off from Port Sudan and missed its return approach to the airport. The Sudan Civil Aviation Authority said Wednesday the remaining 171 passengers on the Sudan Airways Airbus survived. -- Fourteen passengers are still missing after a plane burst into flames after landing in Sudan's capital Khartoum on Tuesday, killing 29 people. It was Sudan's worst air disaster.
