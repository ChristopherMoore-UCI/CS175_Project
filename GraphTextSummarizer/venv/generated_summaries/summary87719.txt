Another neighbor is Hungary, where the government recently forced local banks to let millions of homeowners repay foreign currency loans at below market rates. Some commentators have begun talking of Hungary as the "Greece of eastern Europe." And when Hungarian banks sneeze, Austrian banks catch cold.

As Austrians raced to retrieve their savings, and governments squabbled over a rescue package, panic spread quickly to other European countries.
