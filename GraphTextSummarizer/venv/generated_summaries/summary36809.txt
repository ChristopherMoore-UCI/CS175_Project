So until the Constitution changes and recognizes children as those aged 18 and above, and therefore puts marriage age at 18 giving many girls the opportunity to go to school and get educated, I will remain sad as I was 15 years ago. The spanner in the works is that since the Constitution allows marriage below the age of 18, the new law to the extent that it prohibits child marriage is invalid. So whilst many have celebrated the new law, I haven't, as girls remain shackled by a Constitutional provision that basically allows child marriage. What I know for sure child marriage is a guarantee for poverty among girls in my country and I want it to end. The Constitution also allows marriages of persons aged 18 and below and it does not have a cut-off point where marriage is actually prohibited.
