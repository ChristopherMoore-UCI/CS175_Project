That's the menu on board the Murder Mystery Lunch train, a luxury rail ride around the English countryside that pitches passengers into a cloak and dagger world worthy of Agatha Christie -- but with greater quantities of champagne. The train has barely left Victoria Station when a woman stumbles into our carriage and declares, "I've been stabbed!" By the time train slips back into Victoria Station everyone is swaying slightly as though disembarking from a boat. The next Murder Mystery Lunches on the British Pullman are on October 2 and November 13, departing Victoria Station at 11: 45 a.m. By now everyone is putting forward their theories, some wilder than others, in the hope of winning a take-home bottle of champagne.
