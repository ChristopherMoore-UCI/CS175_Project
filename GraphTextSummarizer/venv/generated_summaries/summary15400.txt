His comments came after a senior Thai security official had drawn a tentative link between the Bangkok blasts and attacks aimed at Israeli officials in India and Georgia, saying the materials used in the explosive devices were similar. But Ramin Mehmanparast, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, "condemned the blasts and said that Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts," Iran's state-run Press TV said on its website. -- The head of Hezbollah denied involvement Thursday in attacks this week on Israeli targets in India, Georgia and Thailand. A Thai police official said Wednesday that Israeli diplomats were the intended target of the Bangkok blasts. Iranian officials have openly antagonized Israel, and Israeli officials have described the regime in Tehran as an existential threat.
