Still, even for those who would like to see libraries kept open, it's worth asking: "At what cost?"Â Traditionalists are sure to be horrified at the news that, in a trend that seems to be growing in popularity, more and more public libraries in the United States are supplementing their supply of books on science, history and literature with video games and big-screen televisions. According to a study published last year in Library Journal, about 15% of libraries in the United States now check out video games to anyone with a library card. But when was the last time any of these traditionalists even stepped foot in a library?Â When I was growing up in the 1970s, libraries were where you went to read books and research papers. It works the same way with libraries, which -- without patrons -- are just large and imposing buildings full of dust and unread books, begging to be shut down by local officials the next time budgets are awash in red ink. And, in those libraries that have video games, books are being checked out at a rate that exceeds what it was before the gamers arrived.
