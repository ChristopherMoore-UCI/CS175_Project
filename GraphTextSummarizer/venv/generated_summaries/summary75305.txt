The weather system responsible for this flooding has been progressing very slowly across southern Europe this week, and has spawned tornadoes in Italy, Greece, and Turkey, including near Istanbul. -- At least 11 people have died in Varna, the largest Bulgarian city on the Black Sea, as a result of massive flash flooding and mudslides, the Interior Ministry said. The storm system was beginning to move off to the northeast, but some more light rainfall was expected for eastern Bulgaria for the next 24 hours or so. Friday was declared a day of mourning for the victims. The heaviest hit district is Asparuhovo, where most of the streets are impassable, filled with smashed and overturned vehicles and uprooted trees.
