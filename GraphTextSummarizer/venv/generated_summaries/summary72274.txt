Over and over Democrats called on House Republicans to bring up bipartisan immigration legislation for a vote. But as time is running out to avoid a potential crisis, the House voted Thursday to back a measure that's designed to let GOP opponents of President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration vent their frustrations. Obama said at a college summit Thursday that the House GOP bill would "force talented young people ... to leave our country." "It does not make sense for us to want to push talent out rather than make sure that they're staying here and contributing to society," he said. Instead Republican leaders argue that a vote on this separate bill puts the House on record, and positions them to fight back against the President's executive orders next year, when the GOP controls both the House and the Senate. House Republican leaders are still building support for their spending bill, and are eying a vote next week -- potentially Dec. 11, the same day as the deadline when agencies run out of funds.
