"I find additional inspiration playing for my country," added Djokovic, whose last loss in Davis Cup singles, not including a retirement, was against Nadal in 2009. Argentina is playing without Juan Martin del Potro and Davis Cup standout David Nalbandian. He boosted his Davis Cup record in singles to a near invincible 21-1, with his lone reverse coming in his first outing against Jiri Novak in 2004. -- They played in the U.S. Open final Monday but both Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic were back in action for their countries Friday. "Today is another victory after a long year and every victory is important," Nadal told the Davis Cup website.
