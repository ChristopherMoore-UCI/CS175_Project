This "John Carter" is a 19th century Virginian ex-Confederate captain who seems mildly perplexed to be transported from an Arizona cave to Mars, or Barsoom, as the locals call it. "John Carter" cast talks to iReport Elsewhere, Stanton's design seems under the spell of the enchanting anime movies of Studio Ghibli master Hayao Miyazaki ("Spirited Away," "Howl's Moving Castle"): There's an insatiable city that moves like a crab on legs that pump away like oil wells, a blue-tongued dino-dog scuttles after Carter at the speed of a cannonball and scheming mystical spirits shapeshift at will. In fact, Carter's only previous movie credit is 2009's "A Princess of Mars," starring Traci Lords (Antonio Sabato Jr. was Carter). With its Victorian flying machines, Western fixtures and archaeological fascination with runes and ruin, "John Carter" is a curious mash-up of antique pulp and cutting edge CGI spectacle -- though that isn't such an unusual combination these days, when digital effects increasingly take us away from the realism that dominated movies for the latter part of the 20th century. The geology -- and the atmosphere -- are not so different from where he came from, but Carter is bewildered to find he seems to have forgotten how to walk; the gravitational pull is so much weaker on Mars, he spends several minutes flopping about in the dirt.
