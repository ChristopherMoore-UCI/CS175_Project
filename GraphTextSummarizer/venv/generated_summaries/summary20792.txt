While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email. Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.
