"We don't actually understand (how circuits of neurons) generate all these interesting behaviors we have, like speech and language and thoughts and memory," said John Donoghue of Brown University's department of neuroscience. Parkinson's disease, for example, is being treated with deep brain stimulators, electrical devices in the brain that restimulate specific circuits of neurons that have become faulty. The sensor picks up a person's thoughts about moving, and transforms brain signals into movement signals. "If you understood how thinking emerges from the interaction of many neurons, then you would have ideas about what a disordered thought would look like," Donoghue said. A big goal of the initiative is to create ways of stimulating neurons that are less invasive than what's currently available, said Church.
