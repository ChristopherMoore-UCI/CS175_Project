Historically cold arctic air mass This being winter, after all, there's more snow coming -- and perhaps more delays, more accidents, and more headaches. Temperatures in parts of New York City, where as much as 8 inches of snow fell, were predicted to drop to zero Friday night for the first time since January 1994. The CNN iReporter spent part of Friday trying to clear the driveway around his home in Boxford, Massachusetts, where the weather service said more snow -- 23.8 inches -- fell than in any other community hit by the Thursday-into-Friday nor'easter. "We are doing everything possible to get back up and running as soon as possible," Southwest Airlines spokesman Dan Landson said on Friday afternoon. Flights resumed by late Friday morning in much of New England, though delays were common, and ticket holders were urged to check with their airlines.
