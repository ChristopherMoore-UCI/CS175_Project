"That was his chief strength," says Robert Hilburn, the author of a new Cash biography, "Johnny Cash: The Life." "Folsom Prison Blues," "One Piece at a Time," "The Beast in Me" -- whether Cash wrote them or not, he made you believe. When Hilburn asked Cash manager Lou Robin how much of the Cash story had been told, Robin replied, "About 20%." "Johnny Cash: A Life" attempts to clear the air. This is not to diminish Cash's faith and character, but it proved a challenge in writing a biography, says Hilburn, a longtime music reporter who interviewed Cash several times and witnessed the famed 1968 Folsom Prison concert. Hilburn quotes George Jones -- admittedly a pretty good tale-spinner himself -- who once got in an argument with Cash and went on a spree.
