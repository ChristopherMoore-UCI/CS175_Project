Smith said the 22-year-old woman received emergency medical treatment after hitting her head on Christmas Day and was transported to Yale-New Haven Hospital. "AMR takes very seriously our responsibility to provide safe care and transport for our patients, and we do not tolerate any kind of abusive behavior," said Charles Babson, General Manager of American Medical Response. Mark Powell, 49, was charged with first-degree sexual assault and unlawful restraint after he turned himself over to authorities Thursday, according to Hamden Police Capt. It was during that time in the ambulance that the alleged victim, who was strapped to a stretcher, was assaulted, Smith said, citing the woman's account. The woman said she waited three days to report the incident because she was embarrassed and afraid, according to Smith.
