Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is threatening to kill the 73 Yemeni troops it is holding hostage if the government does not release al Qaeda prisoners. President Abdurabu Hadi vowed Thursday to step up government efforts to fight al Qaeda, saying he will not allow Yemen to fall into the hands of extremists. In the Haradh governorate, north of the capital, Sanaa, tribal clashes over the past three months have displaced about 52,000 people, Yemeni authorities have said, according to the spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Adrian Edwards. The United Nations refugee agency said Friday that tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing tribal clashes in the north and fighting between government troops and militants in the south. The threat of more killings came as Yemen mourned the approximately 200 troops killed this week by al Qaeda in three Yemeni provinces.
