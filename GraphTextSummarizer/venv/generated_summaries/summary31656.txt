YouTube commenters are not known for keeping their opinions to themselves. Eighty percent of YouTube commenters had already connected to a Google+ account before the update took effect. When YouTube announced the Google+ integration, YouTube product manager Nundu Janakiram said users would never be forced to use their real names. There are also multiple Change.org petitions asking YouTube to revert to the old commenting system. Most are angry complaints and, in classic YouTube form, include obscenities, fights and ASCII drawings of phalluses.
