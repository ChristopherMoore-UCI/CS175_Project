They were right, but scientists are still investigating the details, said Dr. Bill Cooke, lead for NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The fireball that Texans spotted Saturday night could have come from the North Taurid meteor shower, which is going on right now and is known for producing bright fireballs, Cooke said. " Based on data from NASA's camera, Cooke estimated that the meteor was at least four feet wide, weighed about 4,000 pounds and burned five times brighter than a full moon. "We're going to have to wait until we get more data to discriminate between the two of them," Cooke said. Fireballs aren't uncommon, Cooke said.
