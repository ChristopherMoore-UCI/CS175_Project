Before she took the stand in February 2014, the defense reminded the jury that Brooks was not on trial "because she was the editor of a tabloid newspaper" or for working for media baron Rupert Murdoch or for "any political views she may hold" or for "the support newspapers she edited gave to one party or another." Rather, the defense said, her trial hinged on whether she knew about and endorsed a "practice of phone hacking at News of the World during her editorship"; whether she had encouraged a Sun reporter to pay a public official; and whether she had asked her husband, Charlie Brooks, and her personal assistant, Cheryl Carter, to "get rid of things ... to cover up the practice of phone hacking or of paying public officials." In the same year Brooks and Kemp divorced and she remarried horse trainer Charlie Brooks. As politicians became engulfed in the scandal, with allegations that ministers acted improperly in their dealings with News Corp., Prime Minister David Cameron -- a family friend of Brooks' husband -- admitted he had ridden the horse. Asked by her lawyer if she was ever asked to sanction the practice of phone hacking while editor of News of the World, from 2000 to 2003, Brooks said: "No." She married soap star Ross Kemp, famous for his hard-man role as Grant Mitchell in long-running British TV show "Eastenders." In 2003, she was promoted again, becoming editor of the Sun, a post she held until 2009 when she was handpicked for the role of News International chief executive by Rupert Murdoch.
