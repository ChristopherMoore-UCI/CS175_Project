"I know that day he jumped into the river to try to save his comrade was because he didn't just see another soldier in the water; he saw his brother," said Sherman's sister, Meredith, in a statement to CNN affiliate WCVB in Boston, Massachusetts. Both men -- from the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division -- disappeared in the Morghab River near Afghanistan's border with Turkmenistan. Military divers have found the body of a U.S. paratrooper who went missing last week in a river in western Afghanistan. Family members identified the recovered body as that of Benjamin Sherman, 21, of Plymouth, Massachusetts. The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said the soldier was found close to where he disappeared November 4.
