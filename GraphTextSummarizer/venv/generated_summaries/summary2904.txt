So starts the trailer to Tickell's new film "FUEL," which charts the history of oil dependency in the United States, examines the current energy crisis and, most importantly, how you and I can change how we source and use energy. Director Josh Tickell holds a jar of bio-diesel ijn front of his "Veggie Van." "An Inconvenient Truth" gave us shocking revelations about the problem of global warming. But despite this rapturous reception, audience feedback prompted Tickell to re-edit the film incorporating many more alternative energies. Branson has been particularly supportive of both Tickell and the film's producer Rebecca Harrell. He began lecturing on the subject and started traveling the world in search of new energy technologies.
