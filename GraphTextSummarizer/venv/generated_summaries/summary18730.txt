The power struggle between the hard-line Revolutionary Guards and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's more moderate faction is alive and well -- and the hard-liners currently control Iran's Syria policy. Iran's unmatched influence over the Assad regime therefore makes it a critical player in negotiating a political solution to Syria's civil war. Both of de Mistura's predecessors, Lakhdar Brahimi and Kofi Annan, as well as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon have also pressed for Iran's inclusion in negotiations to end the Syrian civil war. Indeed, the report went as far as to say that, because Iran is so influential in the Syrian civil war, "another international meeting would be fruitless" if talks don't include Iran as well as the Syrian government. A final accord to rein in Iran's nuclear program could bring diplomatic options to stabilize the Middle East that were never previously on the table.
