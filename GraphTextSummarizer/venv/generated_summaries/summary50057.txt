"If indeed Shekau's statements are true, it's probably likely that they have been married to Boko Haram fighters or to Boko Haram supporters," she said. On October 27, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report on Boko Haram violence against women and girls in Nigeria after interviewing kidnap victims including 12 of the Chibok girls. " HRW documented eight cases of sexual violence by Boko Haram combatants saying "most cases of rape occurred after the victims were forced to marry. " Sesay said the report suggest that the girls have likely been married off to Boko Haram combatants, who are believed to number around 10,000. "The victims were held in eight different Boko Haram camps that they believed to be in the 518-square-kilometer Sambisa Forest Reserve and around the Gwoza hills for periods ranging from two days to three months," the report said.
