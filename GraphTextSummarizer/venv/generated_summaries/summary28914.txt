At least 52 officers have been wounded since pro-British protests erupted in the Northern Ireland city of Belfast last month, police said. -- Petrol bombs, smoke canisters and hurled bricks have injured dozens of police during weeks of violence in Northern Ireland, officials said Sunday. On Sunday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland said officers were prepared for more violence. The meeting came a day after the Police Service of Northern Ireland said its officers deployed water cannons and fired plastic bullets Saturday night at a crowd of more than 100 demonstrators who were hurling fireworks and bricks at them. The recent violence follows more than a decade during which Northern Ireland has made steady progress toward lasting peace and stability.
