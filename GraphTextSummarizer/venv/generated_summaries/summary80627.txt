Other supporters include celebrities Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte; world leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu of Cape Town, South Africa; and former and current U.S. lawmakers Bob Barr, Carol Moseley Braun and John Lewis. Troy Davis' case has earned the support of leaders including the pope and former President Jimmy Carter. Witnesses claimed Davis, then 19, and two others were harassing a homeless man in a Burger King restaurant parking lot when the off-duty officer arrived to help the man. Davis has always maintained his innocence in the 1989 killing of Officer Mark MacPhail. The high court's latest delay means Davis will continue to sit on death row.
