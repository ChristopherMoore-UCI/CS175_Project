Eight days before Camp Lawton was evacuated as Union forces closed in, Knox wrote to his wife, Frances, saying she might consider selling the family cow to raise money. Charles H. Knox was concerned about his wife and small child back home in upstate New York. Knox, a member of the 1st Connecticut Cavalry captured by Confederate forces in May 1864 during the Wilderness Campaign in Virginia, was returned to the notorious Camp Sumter, commonly known as Andersonville. Knox's letter: Lawton Prison, Ga November 14th, 1864 Dear Wife, haveing a chance to send a line into God's Land-- & hopeing you may hear from me by it I write a few lines hopeing they will reach you in safety -- I have written to you every month since I was captured the 5th of May, last & have seen hard times since, but now hopeing the scene may soon change, for we all look for an exchange of most if not all of the Prisinors that are here -- God knows I hope so... for I am tired of (Cecesia) I have been a Prisnor 6 months & 9 days & I think that will do for this time, but I must change the subject .. affectionately C.H.
