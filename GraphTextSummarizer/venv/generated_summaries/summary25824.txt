Since my TED talk on Chinese factory workers was posted online, I have been accused of working in league with the technology industry to perpetuate the enslavement of Chinese workers. "You sicken me with your effort to discount the negatives of factory workers in China by making it sound like the workers want this," one person wrote. A widespread fear of China—a monolithic force that is taking over the world and stealing American jobs—blinds people to the complexities of life there. I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers in the south China factory city of Dongguan. Income from migrant work is the biggest source of wealth accumulation in rural China.
