While it's true that economic and social development leads to women having smaller families, the converse is also true -- that the gains that contraception has made possible in women's health make family planning one of the most successful international development stories. Clearly 'unmet need' for contraception is a wasted opportunity to boost development and stabilize population growth through something women want and need: the ability to decide when to become pregnant. That's why I believe women must be empowered to be able to make their own decisions free from fear of coercion or pressure from partners, family, and society. Women are often required to have large families to improve their social standing and ensure their economic survival. After years of neglect, there is a renewed interest in family planning as a driver for development.
