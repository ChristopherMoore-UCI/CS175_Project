Hamilton, who had overtaken Rosberg under similar circumstances to take the checkered flag in the U.S. Grand Prix in Texas last week, was left to rue a mistake just before the second round of pit stops on lap 28 at Interlagos. -- Nico Rosberg boosted his world title hopes ahead of the season finale in Abu Dhabi by holding off Mercedes teammate and championship leader Lewis Hamilton to win the Brazilian Grand Prix Sunday. But a second-placed finish in Abu Dhabi will ensure Hamilton repeats his 2008 title triumph with McLaren. Rosberg, who started from the front of the grid after his 10th pole of the season, maintained his advantage over Hamilton throughout, the pair finishing over 40 seconds clear of third-placed Felipe Massa. Staying out an extra lap in an attempt to leapfrog Rosberg through the tire changes, he spun off and lost several seconds.
