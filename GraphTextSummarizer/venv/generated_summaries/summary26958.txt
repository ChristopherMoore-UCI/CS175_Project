In 2006, San Francisco became the first city to required companies to provide paid sick days, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families. Some businesses will be exempt from the requirement to pay employees for sick time, but will still be required to provide time off without penalty to employees. "People who are sick or who need to care for a loved one should be able to take time off without the fear of losing their job or not having money to pay the bills," City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn said. Currently there are no federal legal requirements for paid sick leave, according to the U.S. Department of Labor website. -- The New York City Council has joined governments of at least five other major U.S. cities and one state in passing legislation requiring private employers to provide paid sick time.
