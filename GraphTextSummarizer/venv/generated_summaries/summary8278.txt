Incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen edges out Republican challenger Scott Brown in a WMUR poll out Sunday while Brown is barely ahead of Shaheen by a one point margin in a New England College poll also out Sunday. Brown has also run several ads playing up the Ebola crisis and the threat from ISIS, saying in a September ad, "President Obama and Senator Shaheen seem confused about the threat, not me." The last word from the WMUR poll of 757 likely voters calls the race at 47% for Shaheen to Brown's 45% -- but 6% of voters say they remain undecided. While the race has tightened in Brown's favor, a larger share of voters' polled by WMUR said they believe Shaheen is most likely to pull through with a win -- 55% of respondents said Shaheen would triumph compared to 49% in October. Shaheen, meanwhile, who has served as both governor and senator in New Hampshire has touted her in-state credentials while branding Brown as an outsider.
