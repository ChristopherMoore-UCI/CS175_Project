-- Phillip and Nancy Garrido have started serving sentences in separate California prisons for their roles in the abduction and rape of Jaycee Dugard, the state's corrections department announced Thursday. Authorities received Phillip Garrido on Thursday at California State Prison-Corcoran in Kings County. Dugard was abducted from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991. During those years, the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound on their home's grounds in Antioch, California. They pleaded guilty to charges of kidnapping and sexual assault in late April.
