Brown Panther showed the sort of turn of pace with which Owen used to bedevil defenders during his playing days amid a world class field, including Ascot Gold Cup winner Leading Light, trained by Aidan O'Brien. The Tom Dascombe-trained stallion had finished third at the same race at the Curragh in 2012, but this time his rivals failed to match his pace heading to the winning post as Brown Panther added to previous victories at both Ascot and Goodwood. "The first thing to say is he [Richard] gave him a brilliant ride," said Dascombe, who hinted Brown Panther is now likely to compete at the Long Distance Cup race at British Champions Day next month at Ascot rather than return to the Melbourne Cup where he was eighth a year ago. Seven years ago Owen set up his own yard -- Manor House Stables -- and on Sunday he witnessed his first top-flight success as Brown Panther, a horse he also bred, romped to victory over a stellar field in the Irish St Leger at The Curragh. As such, Owen proved the star turn of Irish racing at the weekend, a fitting result following the death just two months earlier of Treble Heights, the mother of Brown Panther.
