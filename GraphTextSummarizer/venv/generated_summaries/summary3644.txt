Indeed, given the President's vulnerabilities on foreign policy, she can't afford to be seen as Obama's third term. Clinton's biggest challenge on the campaign trail and in office should she win is whether she can develop a foreign policy vision and an effective approach to the world that strikes a better balance between the risk-readiness of George W. Bush and the risk-aversion of Barack Obama. Clinton will face a harder balancing act: how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in Obama's first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak, vacillating and fairly or not, responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse, especially in the Middle East and with Russia, than when President Obama took office. Unlike President Obama, the Clintons have strong credentials on the Israeli issue. There's another one, too: the first secretary of state to become president since James Buchanan.
