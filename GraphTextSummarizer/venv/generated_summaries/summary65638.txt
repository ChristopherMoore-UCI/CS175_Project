On Monday, Mike Davis -- the editor of a site devoted to horror writer H.P. Lovecraft and Lovecraft's "Cthulhu Mythos" -- published a long conversation with Jon Padgett, who oversees a website devoted to the reclusive horror writer Thomas Ligotti. Mr. Pizzolatto has been nominated for an Emmy for writing 'True Detective,' while Thomas Ligotti labors in near obscurity. He's freely admitted Ligotti's influence in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, as well as that of other authors. Of course, as Sean O'Neal of the Onion A.V. Club observed -- channeling Ligotti, Nietzsche and other philosophical wet blankets -- "who's to say what is 'theft' in a cold and empty universe?" For their part, the Redditors are already pessimistically downgrading their expectations for Season 2, which some noted has similarities to the movie "Chinatown." have proved meaningful to one online author -- and he's accusing "True Detective's" writer, Nic Pizzolatto, of plagiarizing from other sources.
