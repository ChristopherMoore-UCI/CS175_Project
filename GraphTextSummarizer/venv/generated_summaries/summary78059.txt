Although it's been nearly three months since oil has last been released into the Gulf, Zukunft said the effects of the disaster remain substantial. Zukunft said even though the highest concentrations of oil detected in the water column is in the parts per billion, the Gulf of Mexico seafood industry is suffering from an unfair stigma attached to its product. In the meantime, Zukunft said, oil spill response teams will be in place to clean up any residual oil as necessary. As for the search for existing oil still within the Gulf of Mexico, NOAA scientist Sam Walker said Wednesday there is an "aggressive program" of work being conducted both offshore, near-shore and within the water to locate hydrocarbons. Christine Patrick, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service, said out of more than 2,700 seafood samples that went through rigorous sensory and chemical testing, none have come up positive for the presence of oil or dispersants.
