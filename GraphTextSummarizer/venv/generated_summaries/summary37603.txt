Buying Madonna's house: A tale of fame and misfortune "We design and build more robots than any other city in North America, and Rochester Hills residents and businesses have been granted over 900 patents, nearly one a day, over the last three years. In a 1987 interview with Jane Pauley, she called Bay City, Michigan, where she was born, a "little smelly town in northern Michigan." The mayor of Rochester, Michigan, has written an open letter to the venerable pop star, taking her to task for saying she never wanted to go back the town where she went to high school. Small towns AREN'T for everyone, dummies." Of course, Madonna is no stranger to controversy, and she's angered organizations a lot bigger and more powerful than Rochester City Hall. Not surprisingly, some Rochester Hills citizens weren't thrilled with Madonna's comments.
