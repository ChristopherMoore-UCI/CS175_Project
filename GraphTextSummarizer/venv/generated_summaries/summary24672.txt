The commission found Terry's evidence at the hearing "improbable, implausible and contrived" as they gave the reasons for his four-match ban and large fine for remarks aimed at QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in an EPL game last season. Goals from Fernando Torres, his 99th in English football, Frank Lampard and Eden Hazard put them 3-1 ahead by half time. Chelsea have opened up a four-point lead over defendiing champions Manchester City, while Norwich are winless in the league this season. Earlier Saturday, City accounted for Sunderland 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium, set on their way by a first half strike from Aleksandar Kolarov. He has until October 18 to appeal the decision or accept a ban which would rule him out of crucial games.
