Goodman received the maximum allowed by law for misdemeanor DUI, Strophy said. But Washington state law doesn't allow for such a felony because Goodman didn't accumulate four DUIs in the past 10 years, Strophy said. The defense Goodman declined to comment, but Strophy said his client "did not receive special treatment." "There's definitely a benefit to society allowing people even such as Mr. Goodman to do work release when they're serving a jail sentence. " In February, a judge even gave Goodman permission to travel to New York and attend the Super Bowl while his case was being adjudicated, said Paul Strophy, the attorney for Goodman.
