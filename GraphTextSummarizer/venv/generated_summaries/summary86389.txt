The tourists -- mostly from Europe -- were on what was supposed to be an exotic getaway: a cruise from west to east, departing from Lombok in the province of West Nusa Tenggara and ending in Labuan Bajo, in East Nusa Tenggara, with a number of stops along the way. They were retrieved by local fishermen on Sunday evening, in the waters of Sape, a town in East Nusa Tenggara province, and are currently being treated at a hospital there. Budiawan says authorities were first notified of the incident on Sunday morning, and immediately deployed crews to the site. Budiawan, head of the rescue mission, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, says it's believed the boat hit rocks off the volcanic island of Sangeang, at about 1 a.m. on Saturday morning. The head of the rescue mission says the search will resume on Tuesday morning.
