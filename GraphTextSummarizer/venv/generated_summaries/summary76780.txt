But in the early 1990s, a study was done to find why none of the more than 400 World War II Medal of Honor recipients was black. The study found "a racial disparity in the way Medal of Honor recipients were selected." Seven African American heroes from World War II were chosen to receive the Medal of Honor from President Bill Clinton. -- Vernon Baker earned a Medal of Honor for his actions during World War II. After spending the better part of a day putting his life at risk to lead his unit, Baker was back in action the next evening: "On the following night Lieutenant Baker voluntarily led a battalion advance through enemy mine fields and heavy fire toward the division objective." Baker, one of only seven African-Americans to receive the nation's highest military honor from World War II, died Tuesday at his home in Idaho, according to his hometown police and coroner's offices.
