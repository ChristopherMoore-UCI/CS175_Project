"We will also be conducting a thorough analysis of computers we have recovered to establish any evidence of a blueprint on how to construct such a weapon." U.S.-based tech blog Gigaom reported that it appeared the items police suspected of being gun components were in fact spare parts for the 3D printer. An initial news release from Greater Manchester Police said officers had found "a 3D printer and what is suspected to be a 3D plastic magazine and trigger which could be fitted together to make a viable 3D gun" when they searched locations Thursday in the Baguley area, near Manchester in northwest England. "Clearly the fact we have seized a 3D printer and have intelligence about the possible production of a weapon using this technology is of concern. " Printing instructions Others have also raised concerns about the potential for 3-D printing to be used to create weapons. The raid that netted the items was part of a planned week of action against criminal gangs in Manchester, police said.
