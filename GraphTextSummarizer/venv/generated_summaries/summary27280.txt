Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had pushed for the ban on sugary drinks larger than 16 ounces as a way to fight obesity and other health problems. In a statement, Bloomberg's successor, Mayor Bill de Blasio, expressed disappointment with the decision. -- New York's Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that New York City's ban on large sugary drinks, which was previously blocked by lower courts, is illegal. "The negative effects of sugary drink over-consumption on New Yorkers' health, particularly among low-income communities, are irrefutable," the statement said. With this ruling behind us, we look forward to collaborating with city leaders on solutions that will have a meaningful and lasting impact on New Yorkers and families across the country."
