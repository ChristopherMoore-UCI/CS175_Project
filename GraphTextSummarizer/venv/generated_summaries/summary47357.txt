Fedo said residents who were returning to Jisr al-Shugur were reporting arrests and killings by security forces. Both activists said they had received reports from residents who said Syrian security forces had entered two towns, Najay and Habosh. Haddad, the military spokesman, told CNN the military did enter Habosh but there was no evidence of violence, arrests or casualties. Syria's military spokesman says more than 400 members of security forces have been killed in the months-long unrest that has taken hold in the country, a charge that came as videos surfaced allegedly showing children killed in the violence. He denied security forces entered Najay.
