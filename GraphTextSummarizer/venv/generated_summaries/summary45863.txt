These changes are already being touted to current users of Microsoft's e-mail service in a banner that urges them to look out for "the new Hotmail." Dick Craddock, who manages the group responsible for Microsoft's Web-based e-mail service, can still recall the day of celebration in 2004 when the Hotmail division had just posted a stunning financial quarter. " After a few years of lightning-fast growth for Gmail following its launch and at the expense of Hotmail, Microsoft reversed course. Gmail gave users a gigabyte of file storage for free, while Hotmail presented a few megabytes and required users to pay for more. "We set out to really invest in Hotmail and really, to rebuild it from the ground up," said Chris Jones, a vice president who oversees several of Microsoft's Internet applications.
