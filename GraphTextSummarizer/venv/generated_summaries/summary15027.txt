Two Coast Guard ships, two planes and a helicopter had been searching an area of more than 1,200 square miles about 75 miles south-southwest of Pensacola, Florida. A U.S. Coast Guard spokesman told CNN the search began after a crew member heard a loud splash near the vessel late Monday. Vilborg is believed to have fallen about 10:30 p.m. Monday, and boats were launched from the cruise ship to search nearby waters. The Holiday, which sailed from Mobile, Alabama, stopped and passengers were told to return to their cabins for a head count, a passenger said. Passengers on the Carnival cruise ship Holiday were told that the missing person had not been found.
