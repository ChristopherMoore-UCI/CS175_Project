But apart from discovering the majesty of the Sahara, Jibunoh also witnessed how drought, deforestation and human intervention were turning fertile land into desert and condemning people to acute poverty. Now a prominent environmentalist, he started giving lectures, speaking at summits and visiting other deserts around the world -- from the Gobi in China and the Negev in Israel, to Arizona and Las Vegas -- to study how people across the world had succeeded in taming the desert and dealing with drought and famine. "I saw the fact that it was depriving people of their farmland, I saw that it was also affecting water supply; in some areas of the desert they don't have rainfall for about six-eight years, so I saw a completely different life and that was what led me into starting some kind of advocacy that will bring this whole thing to the global arena. "The FADE issue became a topical one because people were now able to see that you can actually recover land from the desert by doing some, what we call, land reclamation arrangement," says Jibunoh, who also runs a museum in central Lagos. Jibunoh's desire to take more direct action against the problem also prompted him to launch the Fight Against Desert Encroachment (FADE) initiative and set up a pilot project in the desert area of northern Nigeria.
