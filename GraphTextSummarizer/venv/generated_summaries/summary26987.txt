-- An extradition hearing will be held Friday for the boyfriend of a Michigan woman whose body was pulled from a swamp in Indiana, authorities said. Police believe he killed Fital in Michigan, then drove across state lines, where he dumped her body in Indiana. He will appear for an extradition hearing at the Lake County magistrate court jail Friday morning. Michigan prosecutors have charged the suspect, who is being held in Indiana, with murder. Her legs, arms and head were bound with duct tape, said Rob Arnold, a spokesman for the Lake County police.
