-- Premier League big-spenders Manchester City are set to fine record signing Robinho for his training ground walk-out in Tenerife last week. Manchester City have confirmed Robinho will be fined following his Tenerife walk-out last week. It is expected he will line-up alongside new arrivals Craig Bellamy and Nigel de Jong when City entertain Newcastle in the Premier League on Wednesday evening. The 25-year-old striker made an unscheduled departure, flying home to Brazil without telling City manager Mark Hughes that he had to attend to some "urgent family business". "I've had a talk with Robinho," Hughes told the UK's Press Association.
