"I don't believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls. yes I said men -- to use women's and girls' restrooms, locker rooms, showers, sleeping areas and other areas that are designated for females only," the petition reports Duggar as saying on the robocall. "The claim that this ordinance would provide predators with access to women's restrooms in order to assault or leer at girls or women is nothing more than fear-mongering and spreading ignorance and hatred." " The petition says Duggar's words "reek of ignorance and fear mongering." "Just because someone is transgendered doesn't mean they are a child predator or a rapist," the petition says. According to the petition, Michelle Duggar's voice can be heard on a recorded call from this past summer urging the citizens of Fayetteville, Arkansas, to vote to repeal a law that forbids business owners and landlords from evicting and firing people based on gender identity.
