Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole drafted the proposal in response to a situation that developed last year when Georgia Rep. Jack Kingston, who chaired a key Appropriations subcommittee, ran for Senate, according to two House Republican sources. Ryan has made no secret that he views that post, which would make him the lead to craft health care changes, tax reform and other major legislation, as his dream job. Kingston didn't win the GOP Senate nomination, and Cole and other members on the Appropriations committee, felt that the lack of action hurt the overall effort to put together the full series of funding bills for the year. Given his close ties to House Speaker John Boehner and others, it's likely he could get one. Rep. Paul Ryan might have to decide which job he wants more -- running the powerful House Ways and Means Committee or running for president in 2016.
