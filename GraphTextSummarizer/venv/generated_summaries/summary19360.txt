-- "Real Housewives of Atlanta" husband Apollo Nida has reported to prison to start an eight-year federal sentence for a fraud conviction, despite a side trip to have a final word with his wife. Agents recorded phone calls St. Julien made to Nida, during which he discussed details of pending fraudulent auto loans and "details of future auto loan checks that he was expecting to receive any day now from in the mail," the affidavit said. St. Julien, who previously served prison time for identity theft, told agents that Nida "only paid her 'scraps' " for her work, "compared to the amount of money he made from the fraud schemes," the filing said. Along with the fraudulent auto loan checks, Nida stole U.S. Treasury checks, "retirement checks issued to Delta Airlines employees, and checks in the names of real people that were owed unclaimed property from various state and federal government agencies," the complaint said. This is the second prison stint for Nida, who served five years in a federal prison for auto title fraud before marrying Parks in 2009.
