In a video of the incident that was posted on YouTube and Deadspin.com, MacDowell, Nugent and Sacco were seen getting into a verbal argument with Paschke inside MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, during Sunday's New York Jets vs. New England Patriots game, police said. Amanda MacDowell, 25; Jaclyn Nugent, 26; David James Sacco, 28; and Kurt Paschke, 38, were all charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct on Tuesday, according to a statement released by New Jersey State Police. Paschke, a New York resident, was wearing a Jets jersey. "Even a quick review of the video and just talking to a couple witnesses, you can see Kurt was defending himself and (he)shouldn't have been charged at all and certainly won't be convicted," said Paschke's lawyer, Bruce Barket. MacDowell and Nugent then began kicking and punching Paschke in the body and head.
