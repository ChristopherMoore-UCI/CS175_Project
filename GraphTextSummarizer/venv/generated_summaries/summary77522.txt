" We're Greenpeace and the Yes Men, and we're ready to sit down with Shell any time to debate the ethics of Arctic drilling. This reaction from the public shows Shell has serious problems in the court of public opinion, and that it ignores Arctic defenders at its peril. An oil spill response barge, the Arctic Challenger, which Shell promised the U.S. Coast Guard was "Arctic ready," is in Washington state, beset with technical problems.

Shell has been relentlessly conducting its own PR campaign to distort the truth about what the company is doing in the Arctic.
