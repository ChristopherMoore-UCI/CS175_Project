Nevertheless, there's a website called Block Zuck that acts as a sort of catharsis for people fed up with some of Facebook's recent choices, such as allowing your friends to location-tag you in Facebook Places by default with no confirmation from you. You'll get an error message that says, "General Block failed error: Block failed." You can't block CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook. Maybe you'll want to block Zuckerberg after you see the fictionalization of his early years at Facebook in the upcoming movie "The Social Network" just for the principle of the thing. We don't know whether it's a bug or an intentional inside joke, but Facebook's developers have created jokes and pranks in the past, so we wouldn't put it past them.
