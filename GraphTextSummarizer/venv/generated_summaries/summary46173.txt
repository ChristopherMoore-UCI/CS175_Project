In short, the House appeared unable to speak with clarity on President Barack Obama's controversial effort to oust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. White House press secretary Jay Carney expressed disappointment in the first House vote, and told reporters the "writing is on the wall" for Gadhafi.

Much of the House's disapproval of the Libya campaign has been fueled by a belief that Obama failed to sufficiently consult with Congress before committing to military engagement. The second measure was strongly supported by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and other top GOP leaders.
