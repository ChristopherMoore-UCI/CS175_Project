New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that the long, snowy winter had left New York City and Long Island with salt shortages, prompting the state Department of Transportation to move 3,500 tons of road salt to those areas from state stockpiles, according to a statement. In Bergen County, New Jersey, officials in the past have used a mixture of salt and water that resembles pickle juice and costs significantly less than salt, former county Public Works Director Joe Crifasi told CNN affiliate WCBS in 2011, which was also an exceptionally snowy winter. Other alternatives to salt have included liquid from byproducts, including beer waste and beet juice, according to a study by the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, a New York state-based environmental group. -- With snow in the forecast almost daily, municipalities in much of the country have been sprinkling roads and sidewalks with salt for safety. While salt is essential to making the roads safer, New Yorkers should take news of shortages with a grain of, well, salt because alternatives are used throughout the country.
