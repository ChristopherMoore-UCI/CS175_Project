The affected products are TREN-Xtreme, MASS Xtreme, ESTRO Xtreme, AH-89-Xtreme, HMG Xtreme, MMA-3 Xtreme, VNS-9 Xtreme, and TT-40-Xtreme, the agency said. The agency sent a warning letter to American Cellular Laboratories Inc., saying it markets and distributes products that are labeled dietary supplements, but that violate the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because they do not meet the definition of dietary supplement. "Due to the potentially serious health risks associated with using these types of products, the FDA recommends that consumers immediately stop using all body-building products that claim to contain steroids or steroid-like substances," the agency said in a public health advisory. "Products marketed for body building and claiming to contain steroids or steroid-like substances are illegal and potentially quite dangerous," said the agency's commissioner, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, "The FDA is taking enforcement action today to protect the public." Another 15 events were attributed to this type of product in general, it said.
