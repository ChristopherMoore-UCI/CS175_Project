NASA commentator Rob Navias said it was noticed at the same point in the mission as Wednesday's leak -- during the repressurization of the crew lock, the area from which astronauts enter and exit ISS while in space. NASA previously said the suit worn by NASA astronaut Virts has a history of "sublimator water carryover." Between 1 and 1.5 liters of water backed up in the suit and helmet, prompting fears Parmitano could drown in his own helmet. Water in the sublimator cooling component can condense when the suit is repressurized after a spacewalk, causing a small amount of water to push into the helmet, NASA said. The spacewalk was cut short, and NASA implemented some changes to its suits, including the addition of absorbent padding in helmets.
