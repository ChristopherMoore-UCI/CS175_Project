"It's mating season for turkeys, and we're attributing the aggression to that," Lt. John Schwartz told WCBS. -- A large turkey unexpectedly arrived at a New Jersey home one morning in August, but the homeowner wasn't giving any thanks.

Turkeys are not able to recognize their own image and will respond to a reflection as they would to an intruding or competing turkey, according to the New Jersey Wildlife Control Operators Association. When officers went in with a blanket to catch the turkey, it ran off into the kitchen and smashed through a 5-by-5-foot picture window, according to Sgt.
