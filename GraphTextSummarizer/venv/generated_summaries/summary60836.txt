Representatives for Fox, who was in Cleveland to film a movie, never responded to repeated CNN calls for comment on the allegations. -- Matthew Fox is off the hook for an early morning incident last month after which a party-bus driver accused him of assault, according to the spokeswoman for the Cleveland, Ohio, mayor. Heather Bormann, 29, filed a complaint against Matthew Fox on August 30, two days after the "Lost" actor allegedly punched her repeatedly in an incident outside a Cleveland nightclub. "He got me pretty good," Bormann told CNN as she described the fight with Fox. The fight started when Fox tried to board her bus, which had been rented for a bachelor party that he was not part of, Bormann said.
