She now has her own company, "Mini-Popstars," with other small impersonators, including "Mini-Beyonce," "Mini-Michael Jackson" and "Mini-Vanilli." Such quips are definitive Jolé, a petite chanteuse who is as self-deprecating as she is earnestly committed to her career as "Mini-Gaga," an impersonator. She has met Britney Spears (who Jolé says couldn't have been sweeter) and a quick search of the Web turns up a picture of Lindsay Lohan hanging with Jolé in her Mini-Britney gear. Even though Jolé sometimes gets confused with other little people like Amy Roloff, the mother on TLC's "Little People, Big World," the singer says she enjoys a healthy fan base, especially in the gay community. "Gaga is so exciting to me because she's like an animal," Jolé says.
