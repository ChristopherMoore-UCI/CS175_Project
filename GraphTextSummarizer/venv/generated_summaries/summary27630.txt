CNN's Becky Anderson explored these business connections with Panama's vice minister of foreign trade, Jose Domingo Arias and Oussama El Omari from the UAE's Free Trade Zone Authority. "Amar" and "Kurt" wrote in to say both countries are large financial centers, while Angelo Pereira from Costa Rica got in touch via iReport to say that both countries have free trade economic areas. It was a link that students at the Balboa Academy in Panama City also made in their video of connections which they posted on YouTube. But Global Connections viewer Fahima Karmostaji, who lives in Dubai, says that Panama also has many construction projects underway. Last week, Global Connections asked you to find links between Panama and the United Arab Emirates.
