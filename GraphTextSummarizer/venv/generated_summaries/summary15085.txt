Swizz Beatz and Keys have been friends for several years and worked together on one song for her current album, "The Element of Freedom," the publicist said. Swizz Beatz, 31, -- whose real name is Kasseem Dean -- has one son from his marriage to Mashonda Tifrere. Weeks of photos have shown Keys noticeably fuller in the mid-section and sporting a collection of loose-fitting black tops. The father is Keys' fiance, producer/DJ/rapper Swizz Beatz. The 29-year-old R&B singer is pregnant with her first child, her representatives confirmed.
