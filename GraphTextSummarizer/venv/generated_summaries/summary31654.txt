In 1955, Marilyn Damman took her toddler, Steven, and his baby sister, Pamela, to a bakery in East Meadow. Steven Damman and his sister disappeared from outside a bakery in 1955. Within the last six months, the unidentified man contacted Nassau County, New York, police and said he had credible evidence that would link him to the case of the missing toddler, according to police Detective Lt. Kevin Smith. Now, 54 years later, a Michigan man claims he is the missing child whose name was Steven Damman. So far, authorities will not release the Michigan man's identity and won't say why he believes he is Steven Damman.
