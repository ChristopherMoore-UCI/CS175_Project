"The defendant stated that they committed the murder because they just wanted to murder someone together," police said, referring to Elytte Barbour. According to the police affidavit, this is what happened: Miranda Barbour told police she would use Craigslist to meet men -- "men who wanted companionship," and were willing to pay her for it. He was "choking and gasping for air," Miranda Barbour told police. Barbour told police he and his wife had tried to kill others.
