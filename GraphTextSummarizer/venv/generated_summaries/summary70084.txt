"The Dark Side of the Moon," the band's 1973 classic, which still holds the record for longest run on the Billboard album charts, will be issued in three versions: a single CD, a two-disc "Experience Edition" that includes a live album, and a six-disc "Immersion Edition" boxed set. But I think stadiums make quite a lot of bands feel a little uneasy. There's been the label placed on Floyd as "space rock." I think arenas are fine -- I think arenas are really suited for rock concerts. But then you get married and have children, and being rock and roll often the marriages break up.
