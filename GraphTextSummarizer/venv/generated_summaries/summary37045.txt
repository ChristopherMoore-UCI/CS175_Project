Animated map: U.S. drought in 2012 And the past 12 months have been the warmest of any such period on record, topping a mark set between July 2011 and this past June. The July heat wave that wilted crops, shriveled rivers and fueled wildfires officially went into the books Wednesday as the hottest single month on record for the continental United States. U.S. forecasters started keeping records in 1895. That's battered American farmers' corn and soybean crops, driven farmers to sell or slaughter cattle they can't feed and spurred the U.S. Department of Agriculture to designate more than half of all U.S. counties as disaster zones. In addition, the seven months of 2012 to date are the warmest of any year on record and were drier than average as well, NOAA said.
