"A day that changed us forever," as former President Bill Clinton said at 10th anniversary observances last year. Principal Frank DeAngelis attended a teary prom last weekend when Columbine crowned a king and queen with special needs. The scrolling list of online student activities for Tuesday, April 20, lists a spring play rehearsal, a talk by "famous photographer, John Fielder" -- and "NO SCHOOL." A Columbine memorial dedicated in 2007, is sure to be visited Tuesday. Castaldo, a junior at Columbine in 1999, suffered five gunshot wounds to his chest, back, arm and colon that left him paralyzed from the waist down.
