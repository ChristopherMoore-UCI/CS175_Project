It has been 42 days since the last known case of B3 strain of measles, the equivalent of two successive incubation periods, said Dr. Karen Smith, director of the health department. "Prompt investigation of cases, interviewing hundreds of contacts of infected people, vaccinating hundreds of at risk people, and increasing awareness among health care providers about measles, helped to control this outbreak," Smith said. A measles outbreak that affected more than 130 Californians since December is over, the California Department of Public Health declared Friday. Two patients with rashes have been identified in April, but they have a different measles genotype. It can cause deadly health complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.
