"We've talked it out" In 2010, James and marquee free agent Bosh left their teams to join Wade in Miami -- with James, looking for NBA championships, famously announcing his move in an ESPN special called "The Decision." After reaching four straight NBA finals with Miami, James exercised his contract option this summer to become a free agent two years early. But his 2010 departure -- and the way he did it, telling ESPN that he was "taking my talents to South Beach" -- rankled the people of Cleveland, with fans burning James jerseys and stomping on his likeness. LeBron James won titles in Miami but his heart was in Cleveland, and he's ready to go home. When asked, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said he didn't know if noted NBA fan President Obama had a reaction to James' move. His move marks the end of a four-year partnership with stars Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh in Miami -- a run that saw James get his first two NBA titles.
