-- Former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky faces additional child sex charges involving two more alleged victims, bringing the total to 10, according to Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly. "Today's criminal charges were recommended by a statewide investigating grand jury, based on evidence and testimony that was received following the initial arrest of Sandusky on November 5th," Kelly said in a news release. An attorney for some of the alleged victims Monday blasted Sandusky's recent interview with The New York Times in which he attempted to clarify his relationships with young people. "If I say, 'No, I'm not attracted to young boys,' that's not the truth," Sandusky said, according to the interview published Saturday. The alleged victims -- identified by authorities as Victim 9 and Victim 10 -- are believed to have encountered Sandusky at The Second Mile charity, a nonprofit organization he founded for underprivileged children.
