McIlroy's Northern Ireland colleague Graeme McDowell, who is leading the European Tour's Race to Dubai, finished on the same mark, while Donald, who went to No.1 in the rankings last season with his second straight title at the tournament, was a further shot adrift. Molinari's superb four-under 68 in testing conditions has left the Italian Ryder Cup star one shot clear of South Africa's George Coetzee, Scotland's Marc Warren, Mark Foster of England and Spaniard Alejandro Canizares. Donald, who was on antibiotics, may have had an excuse in the freezing wet conditions on the West Course, and battled to a level-par 72 in his second round after a sorry 78 on the first day. -- Slumping World No.2 Rory McIlroy and defending champion Luke Donald will not be contesting the weekend action at the European Tour's flagship event at Wentworth. "Six under is a good score given the conditions - I live over here now so I am used to it - and I'm in a great position going into the weekend," he told the official European Tour website.
