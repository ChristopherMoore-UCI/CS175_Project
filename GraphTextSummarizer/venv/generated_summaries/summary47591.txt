In it, he describes in detail how WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange gave him the password to unlock the massive archive of diplomatic cables. -- More than 250,000 secret U.S. diplomatic cables are now available in full and unfiltered online, exposing scores of U.S. diplomatic sources and informants that were meant to be protected often for their own safety, according to the website WikiLeaks. WikiLeaks itself promised to publish all of the diplomatic cables on its website but only after vetting the documents and conducting its own "harm minimization" policy of removing any information that might endanger diplomatic sources and informants. In November, WikiLeaks announced that it would begin releasing the diplomatic cables together with select media partners, including the Guardian, Germany's Der Spiegel, France's Le Monde and Spain's El Pais, among others. WikiLeaks now says it has more than 90 participating media and human rights partners.
