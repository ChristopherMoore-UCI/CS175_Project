" With help from Los Angeles and the Humane Society of the United States, the county's 30 animal services officers have been answering calls from people who left their pets and livestock behind as well as those who have seen animals left in evacuated areas. For the County of San Diego Department of Animal Services, it's nonstop work to save as many lives as possible, said Lt. Daniel Desousa. Horses stand in a pen as fire threatens the Bonita neighborhood in San Diego, California. The Humane Society's Curtis Ransom is stationed at an emergency campground in San Diego County where people have taken refuge with their dogs, cats, horses and even goats. At a fairground in San Diego County, 2,000 horses are being boarded, but Desousa said it seems like horses are being housed everywhere -- even mall parking lots -- with their anxious owners standing next to them.
