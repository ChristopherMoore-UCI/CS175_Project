But Silva's late strike sealed a 2-1 aggregate win for Boca and Julio Cesar Falconi's team will play Chile's Universidad de Chile or Paraguay's Libertad in the semifinals. Argentina's Boca Juniors, six-time winners of the continent's premier club competition, snatched a 2-1 aggregate win over Brazil's Fluminense thanks to a 90th-minute goal from Uruguayan Santiago Silva. Having lost the first leg 1-0 in Buenos Aires, Fluminense leveled the tie in front of their own fans when Thiago Carleta's deflected shot found its way past Boca goalkeeper Agustin Orion. In an all-Brazilian tie, Corinthians defeated Vasco da Gama 1-0 on aggregate as the Sao Paulo club continued their bid for a first Libertadores crown. That tie is level at 1-1 ahead of Thursday's second leg at Universidad's Estadio Nacional in Santiago.
