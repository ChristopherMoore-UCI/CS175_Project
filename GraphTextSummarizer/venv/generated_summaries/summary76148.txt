The younger Gomez -- who admitted to the murder, according to the Sheriff's Office -- was apparently fed up with his mother's "nagging" over the previous two days about moving some boxes into the attic, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told CNN. Responding deputies found the decapitated body of 48-year-old Maria Suarez Cassagne alongside garbage cans outside of the Tampa-area home, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. When the cops showed up to a subdivision Wednesday night in Oldsmar, Florida, it wasn't to break up a loud party or for any sort of bacchanalian revelry typical of New Year's Eve. Christian Gomez, 23, has been charged with first-degree murder and is in the Pinellas County Jail. The Sheriff's Office said it found the 23-year-old some 30 minutes later on a bicycle about a mile from his home and took him into custody.
