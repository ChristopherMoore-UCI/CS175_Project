Saying war crimes have been committed on a massive scale in Syria, members of a United Nations commission indicated Friday they may soon publish a list of people suspected of atrocities during the protracted civil war. In their report, the four commissioners said: "Missed humanitarian opportunities have been aggravated by the exponential rise in the perpetration of war crimes, crimes against humanity and human rights violations." The commission may release the list of alleged war criminals at a meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on March 17. Four lists have already been compiled but have been kept secret because the alleged perpetrators should be given due process, said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a member of the U.N. commission of inquiry on Syria. To set up a tribunal would take the approval of the U.N. Security Council, said Mark Lyall Grant, the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United Nations.
