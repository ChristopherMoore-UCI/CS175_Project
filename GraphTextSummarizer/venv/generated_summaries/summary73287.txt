A Pew Research poll found that last year disapproval of Obamacare among Hispanics increased 11 points from September 2013 to December 2013. We need real health care reform that actually expands access and lowers costs -- not "reform" that makes life more expensive. The law has made it harder for businesses to hire more workers, and full-time workers have seen their hours reduced to part-time. Fusion, a new English-language Latino TV network, illustrated the trouble with the health care law when they interviewed a 28-year-old Obama supporter who says he won't sign up for coverage because "he'd rather spend the money on his business, rather than spend it on insurance he says won't even help him that much." Besides the affordability and enrollment problems for young people, our abuelos -- grandparents -- will be hurt by the new health care law as well. Hispanics came to this country in search of the promise of individual freedom and opportunity, but Obamacare is undermining that promise.
