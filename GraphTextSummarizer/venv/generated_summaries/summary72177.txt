-- A court sentenced former Uruguayan President Juan Maria Bordaberry to 30 years in prison on Wednesday for the coup that consolidated his power in 1973 and for human rights violations. Judge Mariana Mota convicted Bordaberry of violating the constitution, nine counts of "forced disappearance" and two counts of political homicide. In 1973, he backed a military coup that kept him in power, and dissolved congress and suspended the country's constitution. Journalist Dario Klein contributed to this report for CNN Bordaberry assumed office in 1972 following an election that has since been questioned.
