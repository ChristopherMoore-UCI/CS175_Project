The 40-year-old former Dutch international has been at Old Trafford since 2005, winning three English Premier League titles and helping them to their Champions League triumph in 2008. He subsequently had a spell in Italy with Juventus before joining United's fellow Premier League side Fulham. Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar will retire from football at the end of the season, he announced Thursday. Van der Sar, whose brilliant save from Nicolas Anelka clinched their penalty shootout win over Chelsea in the 2008 Champions League final in Moscow, has remained in fine form during United's unbeaten start to the season. "It's been coming for a while," van der Sar told the official Manchester United website.
