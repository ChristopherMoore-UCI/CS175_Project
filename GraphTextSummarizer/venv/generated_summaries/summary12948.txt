The Inter Milan player will be up against 2006 winner Didier Drogba and the Chelsea forward's Ivory Coast teammate Yaya Toure, Ghana midfielder Michael Essien and Seydou Keita of Mali. Keita is the nephew of former winner Salif Keita. Last season Eto'o helped Spanish and European champions Barcelona to an unprecedented treble of titles, along with his former clubmates Toure and Keita. Essien has finished in the top three every year since 2005, being runner-up to Frederic Kanoute in 2007. Drogba and his clubmate Essien both also helped their countries to qualify for the World Cup finals, and won the English FA Cup with Chelsea as well as finishing third in the Premier League.
