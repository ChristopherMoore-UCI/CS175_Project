Barclays' own group tax affairs were thrown into the spotlight twice in recent months, first over the use of a tax loophole that the Treasury retrospectively closed, then over a "tax equalisation" payment to Mr Diamond of about Â£6m. Speaking to analysts and investors, Mr Jenkins also repeated an earlier promise to report back on his strategic plan -- including details of which businesses would be shrunk -- by the first quarter of next year. " Barclays' board last month drafted in City grandee Sir David Walker as the bank's new chairman and elevated Mr Jenkins to chief executive three weeks later, in an effort to stabilise the group following Mr Agius and Mr Diamond's resignations. There had been a widespread expectation that Mr Jenkins would shift Barclays' focus away from investment banking, which has traditionally generated two-thirds to three-quarters of group profits. Mr Jenkins reaffirmed Barclays' commitment to its investment bank more broadly, silencing predictions he would significantly reduce its size. Mr Ricci also signalled a likely withdrawal from selling derivatives products to consumers and small business customers, following an industry-wide scandal over the mis-selling of interest rate hedging contracts to SMEs.
