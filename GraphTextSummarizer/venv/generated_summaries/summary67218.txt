Often muggers or snatch-and-run phone thieves just try to sell stolen phones for cash -- but the people who buy them may try to access your data or services. But we did learn a lot about the kind of stuff people try to do with phones they find. Even though about half of the finders made some attempt to return the lost phone (a contact e-mail and phone number for the "owner" was listed in the contacts app on each decoy phone), the vast majority of these people also tried to access data on the phone. Two-thirds of phone finders tried to do this. People who find or acquire your phone may use it to make a lot of international phone calls, running up your bill.
