The three men, all in their early 20s, were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting a fire, said police Chief Tim Staab of Glendora. The Colby wildfire, as it is called, continued to burn Saturday on about 1,863 acres of foothills of Los Angeles County near Glendora. " The Colby fire began before dawn Thursday and allegedly originated with three men camping in the foothills near Glendora, authorities said. One area resident, Korey Rowe, who moved to Los Angeles just six days, photographed the blaze and firefighting helicopters for a CNN iReport. An illegal campfire apparently ignited the wildfire, and fire officials cited drought conditions as contributing to the blaze.
