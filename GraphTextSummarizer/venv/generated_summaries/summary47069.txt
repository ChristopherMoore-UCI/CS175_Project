The location where the man was found on fire is about six blocks from the U.S. Capitol, where a high speed car chase on Thursday ended with a woman being shot and killed by law enforcement officers. Authorities haven't been able to identify him due to the extent of his injuries, so they will conduct DNA tests and use dental records, said Officer Araz Alali, spokesman for D.C. CNN's Carol Cratty, Brian Todd and Skip Nocciolo contributed to this report. The man was taken to a hospital Friday night after officers rushed to the scene and found the man engulfed in flames. "I saw a man sitting in flames," Stifel told CNN.
