Honor for Cushing is a long time coming Tuesday's announcement culminates years of lobbying for the honor. Cushing received a waiver of a requirement that the Medal of Honor must be recommended within two years of the event and presented within three years, Laura Jowdy, archivist with the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, said Wednesday. " Those words on the West Point headstone of 1st Lt. Alonzo H. Cushing succinctly enshrine the determination of the man who helped turn the tide at Gettysburg during the Civil War. More than 151 years after his stand, Cushing will receive the Medal of Honor posthumously, the White House announced Tuesday. A first sergeant in the battery years later received the Medal of Honor, while several surviving comrades kept alive Cushing's bravery.
