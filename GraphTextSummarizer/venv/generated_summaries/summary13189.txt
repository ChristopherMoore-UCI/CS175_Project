-- Aaron Douglas, better known as "Chief Tyrol" on "Battlestar Galactica," is a Dragon*Con veteran. So when I'm at ComicCon or Dragon*Con I'll switch shirts throughout the day, so people get pictures. Well known for being open with fans and the life of the Dragon*Con party, Douglas made a pit-stop at CNN to answer some of our BSG-fan questions. CNN: You were at Dragon*Con last year, right? CNN: What's your favorite part of Dragon*Con? Douglas: The best times are usually in one of our rooms, where we're all just sitting around having a drink and just laughing our faces off.
