The agent, who was turned over to the Drug Enforcement Administration, was being held in the Yuma, Arizona, County jail, said Kenneth Quillin, supervisory border patrol agent. The agent, who has three years' experience with the border patrol, was arrested after two other Border Patrol agents on Monday were patrolling along the U.S.-Mexico border and saw the suspect agent with "numerous bundles of marijuana inside a marked Border Patrol truck," Quillin said in a statement. Rodolfo Karisch, acting chief patrol agent for the Yuma Sector, said he was "proud of the swift and appropriate actions taken by the arresting agents. -- A U.S. Border Patrol agent was arrested Tuesday on narcotics smuggling charges, but the federal agency declined to release his name, a spokesman told CNN. The agents reported the incident to a supervisor, and the suspect agent, along with the marijuana, was placed in the custody of the DEA, Quillin said.
