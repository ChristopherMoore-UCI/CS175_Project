" The gunfight came two days ahead of Modi's visit to Indian Kashmir to campaign for the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, which is making its presence felt in the Muslim-majority Kashmir for the first time. Eight Indian army soldiers were killed Friday in a gunfight with militants in Indian-controlled Kashmir ahead of a visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Attacks on the army camps by militants have been occurring in Indian-administered Kashmir, which has been in the throes of separatist violence since 1989. In a predawn attack, heavily armed militants stormed an Indian army camp 85 kilometers (about 52 miles) from Srinagar in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The militants opened fire at the camp near the Line of Control, the defacto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir.
