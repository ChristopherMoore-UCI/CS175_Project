The U.S. State Department said Saturday it would donate $3 million to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) as part of a joint U.S.-IOM partnership to help get home thousands of Egyptians and other nationals from Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. -- U.S. military planes headed for Cairo took off from Tunisia Saturday, evacuating Egyptians fleeing the Libyan conflict, a deadly war spurring a massive refugee flight. All four U.S. planes are expected to arrive in Cairo by Saturday night, U.S. officials said. Raoul Gernali, a Filipino engineer who had been working on a Libyan water project, said Libyan soldiers at the Tunisian border stole his laptop, money and mobile phone. Hovig Etyemezian, a field officer for the U.N. refugee agency, attributed the drop in part to fear and the manipulation of the flow of refugees by Libyan authorities.
