An Ohio man with a knife was shot and killed Wednesday after lunging at one airport police officer and acting in a threatening manner toward another officer, a Columbus police sergeant said. As he made his way toward the terminal, backup officers approached. Rich Weiner said the man tried to buy a ticket with a woman's identification at Port Columbus International Airport, then with his own ID, but was refused. "It's too early to talk about terrorism," Weiner said when asked by reporters about possible motives. The man and the officer were talking, police said, when the suspect pulled a knife and tried to attack the officer, who opened fire.
