Only Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal have achieved the feat of claiming a full set of grand slam titles and backed it it with Olympic gold in the singles. Federer, desperate to add Olympic singles gold to his 17 grand slam titles, struggled to cope with the giant Isner's service but still emerged as a 6-4 7-6 winner on Centre Court. -- Roger Federer remained on course to complete a career golden grand slam after brushing aside John Isner of the United States in the quarterfinals Thursday. The Scot, roared on by a partisan home crowd on Centre Court, was never seriously troubled but will have to get past Serbia's Novak Djokovic to get his chance of golden revenge. Federer beat Britain's Andy Murray to win the Wimbledon crown last month and return to top spot in the world rankings.
