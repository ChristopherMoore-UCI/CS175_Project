Long Beach Police Chief Robert Luna admits that investigators do not have enough information to answer the key questions in the case, but are confident that witnesses can fill in the gaps. "I made this motion in collaboration with the Long Beach Police Department to support their aggressive work to bring to justice the person(s) who committed this heinous crime," Los Angeles County Supervisor Don Knabe sad in a statement. The baby's body was found the next day, more than 100 miles away, in a strip mall dumpster in Imperial Beach. "We need to get the coward who committed this violent, senseless act off the street," Luna said at a news conference Monday. Three-week-old Eliza Delacruz was abducted from a home in Long Beach on Saturday night after her mother, father and uncle were shot.
