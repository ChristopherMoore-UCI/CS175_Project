"If you're presenting pop music on TV, in some way Dick Clark is the person who opened the door," says Joe Levy, editor of Billboard magazine. But it was Clark who saw the promise in combining pop music, television and the marketplace -- an audience of teenagers and their parents. When "Bandstand" proved to be a valuable tool for promoting new artists -- and, not incidentally, sanitizing them for Mom and Dad's approval -- Clark made sure it did its job, especially after it went national as ABC's "American Bandstand." When the payola scandals of the late '50s engulfed the music industry -- DJs and music business types were given bribes to play certain records -- both Freed and Clark were subjects of scrutiny. In that respect, he inspired a number of contemporaries and followers, including Don Kirshner, who started as a song publisher and later expanded to record labels, TV shows and other programming; Don Cornelius, a onetime salesman and journalist whose "Soul Train" became the crown jewel of his own broadcasting empire; and, of course, Ryan Seacrest, who started as a disc jockey and now hosts and produces television shows.
