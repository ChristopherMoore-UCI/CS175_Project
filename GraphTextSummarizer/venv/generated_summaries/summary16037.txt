Although it's not known for sure how much benefit a surgical mask has in preventing the transmission of swine flu, people who have the illness may consider wearing one as a way to reduce the amount they cough and sneeze onto others, said Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of the epidemiology division at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Public Health. A mother and son wear face masks as protection from swine flu at Sydney international Airport in Australia. Watch for more on staying safe from swine flu Â» The World Health Organization (WHO) also warns against relying on face masks, especially for those not infected with the virus. "We would not recommend that people generally wear masks in their workplace as a precautionary measure," he said. But people in the United States should generally not have to wear masks because the cases are localized, he said.
