The Berkeley (London) Granted, London's weather might not be ideal for al fresco poolside lounging -- hence the prevalence of subterranean pools -- but on beautiful summer days, nothing beats lounging by the only rooftop hotel pool in the city at The Berkeley. Hotel Santa Teresa (Rio de Janeiro) Business travelers looking for an alternative base might be tempted to make a beeline to the sexy shores of Copacabana or Ipanema, but for another side of Rio, there's the winding pebbled streets and bohemian neighborhood of Santa Teresa. Ever since it first opened in 1929 as a public swim and socializing hotspot, this art deco-meets-industrial chic hotel has been synonymous with fab pools. The boutique Hotel Santa Teresa was once a colonial coffee ranch. Hotel Santa Teresa, Rua Almirante Alexandrino, 660, Santa Teresa, Rio de Janeiro; +55 21 3380 0200 7.
