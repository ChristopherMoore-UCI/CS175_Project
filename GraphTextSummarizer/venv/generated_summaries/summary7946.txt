" With "Rising" shelved, Kojima and his teams continued to work on their various other "Metal Gear" projects, including a high-definition remaster of older games that hit stores in November and a mysterious open-ended game that Kojima is reluctant to talk much about. Developers at Konami and Kojima Productions had initially spearheaded the project, then called "Metal Gear Solid: Rising," as they've done for most games in the franchise. After "Rising," Kojima expects more "Metal Gear Solid" games to be made, but he hasn't decided whether he will design them, he said. -- The name he chose for the next installment in his "Metal Gear" video game series makes Hideo Kojima seem prescient. As the famed shepherd of the spy franchise he created 25 years ago, Kojima remains deeply involved in the game development process.
