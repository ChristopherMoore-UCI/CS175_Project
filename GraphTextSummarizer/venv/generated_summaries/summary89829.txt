Do your Wurst Luckily, Oktoberfest food -- make that German food, in general -- seems designed to protect the stomach, and reputation, against excessive wheat beer consumption. Bavarian bonding is about sing-alongs, and one such tune you'll hear time and again at the festival is "Ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit." Learn to belt out "Ein Prosit der Gemütlichkeit" Fitting in at Oktoberfest is all about getting the balance right. The restaurants page on Muenchen.de has a selection of traditional Bavarian restaurants in Munich. But bet you don't know why "Gemütlichkeit" is untranslatable (let alone unpronounceable), what false teeth were doing in the lost property bin last year and whether the yodeling or oompah tent would best suit your personality.
