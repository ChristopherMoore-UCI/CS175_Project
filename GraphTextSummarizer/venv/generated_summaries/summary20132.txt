Although the absence of high-speed technologies in this country means that rail travel is not an attractive option for certain long-distance journeys and contributes to higher levels of pollution and road congestion in places, it doesn't really make rail travel any less safe. Despite extensive and popular programs of high-speed rail, both Spain and France have had their share of train accidents. Don't we have technologies that can prevent trains from gathering and maintaining such speed at dangerous curves --  or technologies that can automatically deploy the brakes if they do? Europe's investments in its intercity networks are typically older and more established than those of China -- but they are not immune to rail tragedy either. Mandated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, tens of thousands of track side devices are being connected to rail signals and switches to communicate wirelessly with retrofitted locomotives up and down the country's major rail thoroughfares.
