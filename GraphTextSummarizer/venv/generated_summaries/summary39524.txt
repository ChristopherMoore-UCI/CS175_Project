According to Nintendo: "In the future, the Wii U console will support, depending on the software, two Wii U GamePad controllers." But the Deluxe also includes 32 GB of internal storage (the Basic only has 8 GB, and roughly 4 GB of that is earmarked for system data), a Wii U GamePad charging cradle, a Wii U GamePad stand and a Wii U console stand. Not on day one, but Nintendo has publicly committed to having more Wii U units in stores during the first week than it did for the Wii six years ago, and it's doubled down on that claim by stating it'll replenish systems "much more frequently" during the holiday than it did for the Wii. If you're secretly tired of the compulsive, competitive achievement grind, the Wii U offers liberation â€” a chance to go back to playing games for love of the games instead of an arbitrary number. Wii U games will sell on average for $60.
