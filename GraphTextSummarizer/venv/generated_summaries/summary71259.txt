"The human rights environment in Angola is not conducive for free, fair and peaceful elections," said Leslie Lefkow, deputy Africa director for the rights monitoring group. UNITA has alleged fraud in previous elections and again voiced concerns about apparent irregularities in election campaigning this time around. After independence, Angola suffered through 27 years of civil war. Over the last few months, civil war veterans have taken to the streets to demand overdue subsidy payments, and disgruntled youths and civil rights activists have staged rallies to voice their concerns about the lack of jobs and opportunities. With almost 70% of the vote counted, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) had almost 75% of the vote.
