Sure Lance had tried the denials, told us all about the tests he had passed and convinced most people -- who didn't have the knowledge of just how tainted cycling was -- that he was clean. Approaching Lance Armstrong's interview with Oprah Winfrey, I had been thinking the American -- in his type of language -- was "done with cycling."
