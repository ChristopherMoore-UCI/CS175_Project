Some luxury hotels offer Internet access for members of loyalty programs, like Ritz-Carlton's Club Level, although some Ritz-Carltons provide free Internet access in hotel lobbies. The anger is rooted in this cultural shift: We're at a tipping point where hotel guests value Internet access as they would a bed and hot water, says Greif. Other top hotels in their categories included Omni Hotels & Resorts, Homewood Suites, Drury Hotels, Hilton Garden Inn and Holiday Inn. Rules and rates for luxury hotel Internet access are far from universal. Fifty-five percent of hotel guests use the Internet during their hotel stay, the study says, up from 20% in 2006.
