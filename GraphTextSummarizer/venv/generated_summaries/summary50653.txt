-- Fighting continued Monday as rival Libyan militias battled for Tripoli International Airport and the interim government said it was considering asking for international military help. The government in a written statement said early Tuesday that it discussed at an emergency session "a potential request for international forces to solidify the state's capabilities" at an emergency session. It said it could only provide limited emergency services to U.S. citizens. Other militias have tried to wrest control of the airport from the Zintan brigades for years. While Libyan officials have called for calm, the government is weak and militias outnumber and outgun its security forces.
