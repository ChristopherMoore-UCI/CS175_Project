Royal baby slightly more likely to be female, scientist says Catherine's commoner genes might lead to a somewhat darker-skinned baby, Saggar said. While hair color might be debatable, one physical trait seems pretty clear: William and Catherine's child will likely be quite tall. "It's very good that they're bringing in new genes," said Dr. Anand Saggar, a consultant in the South West Thames Regional Genetics Department at St. George's Hospital Medical School in London. Less is known about Catherine's heritage, but assuming it's similar to the genes of other British people, he calculates there's a 6% chance the baby will have red hair. Will he or she turn out to have blue eyes like Prince William or green ones like Catherine?
