Saleh has promised not to run for president in the next round of elections, and he has said he supports the creation of a national unity government to oversee upcoming parliamentary elections. -- Thousands of demonstrators, mostly students, lined the streets Friday outside Sanaa University as anti-government protests continued. The protest in Sanaa, the capital, was countered by a pro-government demonstration on Tahrir Square, where thousands waved flags and held up pictures of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Anti-government throngs also hit the streets in Aden in southern Yemen, according to eyewitnesses. The protesters also cite government corruption and a lack of political freedom.
