Investigators have found a red Dodge van recorded on surveillance cameras leaving the Beulah, Florida, home of Byrd and Melanie Billings, who were found dead in their home Thursday, Sheriff David Morgan said. Emergency personnel and police went to the home after receiving a call just before 8 p.m. Thursday about shots being fired, said Escambia County Police spokesman Sgt. But the sheriff said investigators can tie the pair "to enough significant events and instances in this case that would lead a reasonable person to believe that they have an association with these murders." A third person sought for questioning had not been found, Morgan said. -- Detectives are questioning two people in connection with the killing of a Gulf Coast couple known for adopting special-needs children, the Escambia County sheriff said Saturday. No arrests have been made, and Morgan would not discuss whether the "persons of interest" had any connection to the Billings family.
