Greece has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. If a unity government can't be formed by Thursday, Greece must call new elections. Samaras said any new elections would mark a battle "between the pro-European parties and the anti-European left." Tsipras said Greece is no longer bound by austerity promises made in return for rescue loans. Last year, Greece's debt threatened to force it to drop Europe's common currency, the euro, prompting the European Central Bank and other lenders to swoop in with emergency funding.
