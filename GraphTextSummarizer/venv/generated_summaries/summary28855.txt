New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio emerged from the depths of the nation's largest transit system Thursday to assure commuters that trains are safe in the wake of reports of an ISIS terrorist plot against U.S. subways. From Washington to New York, a flurry of denials followed media reports that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi told reporters at the United Nations that his country's intelligence agency had uncovered an imminent ISIS plot against United States and Paris subways. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said state officials were treating the report with "utmost precaution" and "coordinating at a high level with local, state and federal partners. " Intelligence and law enforcement agencies have no indications of an ISIS terror plot against U.S. transit systems, two U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN earlier. "New York City normally operates at a heightened level of security and we adjust that posture daily based on our evaluation of information as we receive it," he said.
