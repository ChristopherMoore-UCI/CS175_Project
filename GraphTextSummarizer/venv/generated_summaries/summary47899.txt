Let her dance with James Brown, Michael Jackson, and rejoice with Mahalia Jackson. Her poetry spanned our journey, chronicled our hearts and documented our struggles as we moved from the orations of Martin Luther King to the presidency of Barack Obama. Once, my friend Minyon Moore hosted a luncheon in honor of Betty Shabazz, Cicely Tyson, Coretta Scott King and Maya Angelou. And the amazing thing about Maya Angelou was that, although she was a black woman, her poems touched the souls of all Americans. Opinion: How Maya Angelou gave me life Maya, we didn't tire of you.
