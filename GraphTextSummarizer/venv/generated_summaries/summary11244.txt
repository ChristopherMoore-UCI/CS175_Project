I use my iPad more and more for processing photos (courtesy of Photogene and FX PhotoStudioHD), and until I can send direct from my camera via Eye-Fi, a slot is a lot more convenient than yet another dongle in my bag. The likeliest candidate for a replacement is Light Peak, or Apple's rumored implementation of it, Thunderbolt, which might show up in this week's new MacBook Pros. -- Apple will announce the iPad 2 next Wednesday, as made rather obvious by invites sent out to press this morning. One of the things I took away from all the tablets I tried at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last week was just how good a camera is on a big device. The single iPad speaker isn't bad, but for movies and music you really want something beefier, and preferably in stereo.
