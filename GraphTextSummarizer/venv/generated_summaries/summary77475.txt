-- The toll in the raging gunfights between the militants and Indian army in the Indian administered Kashmir rose to 19 Monday with the killing of four more Indian army troopers and five militants. "The thorough combing operation is in progress, and it is expected that a few more terrorists may be holed up in the area including an isolated house," Lt. Col. J.S. Brar, the spokesman of the Indian army in Srinagar said Monday evening. "Four more soldiers of the army and five militants died Monday in this raging encounter that has been going on in the densely forested Shamswari mountain range in north Kashmir Kupwara border district today," Brar told CNN. Indian soldiers stand guard in Srinagar. In a separate incident one militant was killed in an encounter with police in south Kashmir's Shopian district Monday.
