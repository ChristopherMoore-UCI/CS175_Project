Italian football expert Gabriele Marcotti told CNN that rumors of former AC Milan coach Leonardo taking over from Benitez are true. Benitez received a reported $6 million payoff when he left English club Liverpool on June 3, and is now expected to receive more compensation for the rest of his two-year deal with Inter. "Right now, the front runner seems to be Leonardo, who managed AC Milan last year.
