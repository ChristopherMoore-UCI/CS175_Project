Madrid's Metro handles an average of 2 million passengers a day, but this is believed to be the first time that one of them was carrying a $2 million check, the police spokesman said. We're trying to locate this person," a National Police spokesman in Madrid told CNN on Thursday. A maintenance worker for Madrid's Metro, or subway system, found it Wednesday. The train was sent to a maintenance yard, following protocol, and a worker who inspected the doors found a brown leather wallet that contained the $2 million check, the California driver's license and some credit cards, a Metro de Madrid spokeswoman said. And it was found in a subway car in Madrid, police say.
