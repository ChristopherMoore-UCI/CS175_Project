Gay marriage is not going to determine the outcome of presidential election like it did in Ohio," said GOP strategist Tara Setmayer, referring to the surge of Republicans who showed up to the polls to approve same-sex marriage bans in nearly a dozen states a decade ago. He seemed to soften his tone a little bit, writing in his newly released book that the idea that "same-sex marriage is destroying society is actually greatly overstated," adding that Christians who get divorced "have as much to answer for as do those who militantly push to redefine marriage." The Supreme Court jumped into the same-sex marriage debate again, deciding Friday to hear arguments this spring on the question of whether states have the right to ban same-sex couples from getting married. On the national level, the party is increasingly reluctant to focus on social issues, especially after the 2012 debacle over Todd Akin's rape comments and as polling continues to show a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage. Still, while conservative candidates are more vocal about standing on principle, strategists say it's not as likely that they'll start a war over same-sex marriage in the face of issues involving the economy, terrorism, and health care -- especially when the tide has rolled in favor of same-sex marriage at such a rapid pace in the last couple of years.
