U.S. marshals were asked to join the search by Harris County authorities after Tata left the Houston area. At a news conference Monday, U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee said Tata turned herself in to authorities after a "monumental" effort between the U.S. and Nigerian governments, along with Tata's family in Lagos. Tata was taken into custody Saturday in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, by Interpol and U.S. diplomatic security agents, officials said. Tata arrived in Atlanta Monday morning and was booked into the Fulton County Jail, officials said in a statement. On Sunday, Lee gathered with Houston's Nigerian community for a memorial service in honor of the four children lost in the fire, where ministers "pleaded" for Tata to return home.
