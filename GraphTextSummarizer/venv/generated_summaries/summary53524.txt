"Because it came from such a clear space that the energy was absolutely uninterrupted by anything other than allowing it to flow from heart to heart." It's hard not to get swept up in the emotion of singer/rapper/producer Pharrell Williams as he breaks down while discussing his hit song "Happy" with Oprah Winfrey. Appearing on Winfrey's "Oprah Prime" show on the OWN network, Williams said the song didn't get much traction until he released a music video in November. "I get that." After Williams' clearly genuine reaction, Winfrey also had some thoughts as to why the song has become so popular. Winfrey then showed a compilation video of fans around the world displaying what "Happy" meant to them.
