-- The White House and House Speaker John Boehner's office announced Thursday they reached agreement for President Barack Obama to address a joint session of Congress on September 8, resolving a dispute that temporarily overshadowed the focus of the planned speech -- job creation and economic growth. " Obama decided this week that he wanted to deliver his speech on job creation to a joint session of Congress, and September 7 was the first day that both the House and Senate would be in session after their summer recess, Carney said. On Wednesday night, the White House agreed to move Obama's address back one day -- from September 7 to September 8 -- after Republican complaints and follow-up consultations with Boehner. " Meanwhile, an aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Boehner didn't consult with House Democratic leaders about seeking a new date for Obama's speech. " White House Press Secretary Jay Carney downplayed the dispute to reporters, saying the American people "do not give a lick about what day next week the president speaks before Congress.
