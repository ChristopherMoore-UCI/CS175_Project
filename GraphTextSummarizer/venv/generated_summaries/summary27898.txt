At the same time, it would enable Turkey to galvanize her control over Kurdish heartlands, which given the local state of anarchy, have become fertile grounds for the growth of Kurdish insurgency. Turkish boots on the ground are no alternative then to proxies with local social bases who would be jointly trained, equipped and empowered by Arab and Western partners -- proxies who could not only effectively undermine ISIS' centers of gravity but also herald the socio-political changes necessary for building sustainable security and stability in the region. Turkish infantry and tanks have taken up position along the border with Syria waiting for a go-ahead from Ankara where Parliament voted on Thursday to provide the Turkish government with a mandate to militarily engage ISIS -- if necessary with boots on the ground. The question now is whether Turkish armed forces can be the strategic game-changer in the international coalition's war against ISIS. It is highly unlikely that Turkish forces would advance deep into the jihadists' heartland around Raqqa or Mosul, leaving ISIS with enough space to maneuver.
