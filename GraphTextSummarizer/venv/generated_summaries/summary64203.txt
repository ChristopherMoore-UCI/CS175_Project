-- President Obama commended the progress of African-Americans in a speech on the 100th anniversary of the NAACP, but said there was still much work to be done. NAACP President Ben Jealous said that while Obama's presidency is a big milestone, it's just the next step on a long road. "What we celebrate tonight is not simply the journey the NAACP has traveled, but the journey that we, as Americans, have traveled over the past 100 years," Obama told a star-studded crowd that included music producer Sean "Diddy" Combs and poet Maya Angelou, to name a few. Speaking at the organization's annual convention in New York, the city where the organization was founded, Obama evoked symbols of the civil rights movement to describe the NAACP's influence on race relations in the United States.
