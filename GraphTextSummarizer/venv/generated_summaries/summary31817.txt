Jordan Spieth fired a second-round 63 at Torrey Pines' North course on Friday to move one shot ahead of first round leader Stewart Cink, who backed up an opening round 64 with a one-under 71. Lee Westwood had a better day on Friday carding a 68 after a disappointing opening round of 73 -- the Englishman is now tied for 22nd on three under with, among others, Keegan Bradley who added a 72 to an opening round of 69. Westwood's compatriot Ian Poulter will feel he still has an outside chance of victory after repairing the damage of an opening round 75 with an impressive five-under par 67 to leave him on two-under. Closer to the top, Belgium's Nicolas Colsaerts has a good chance of breaking his duck on the PGA Tour after a second round 67 took him up to third place at eight under. His compatriot Jason Day had a disappointing second round, limping to a one-over par 73 and drop down into a nine-way tie for 11th on five-under par.
