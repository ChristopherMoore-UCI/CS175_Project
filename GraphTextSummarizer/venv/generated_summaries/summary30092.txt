At least 12 people were injured by that vehicle, said police in Dijon, a city in eastern France. It was not immediately clear whether the incident was related to one Sunday in Dijon, France, in which witnesses said a man shouting "God is great" in Arabic rammed his vehicle into pedestrians. A van plowed into shoppers at an outdoor Christmas market Monday in Nantes, France, injuring at least nine people in addition to the driver, police said. On Saturday, a man stabbed three police officers in central France while allegedly calling out the same phrase. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve will head to Nantes Monday evening to meet with the families of the victims and rescue officials, Brandet told CNN affiliate BFM-TV.
