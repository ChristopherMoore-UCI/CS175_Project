Haleh Esfandiari talks to Iranian media in front of Evin prison after her August 21 release. In prison, Esfandiari was interviewed for an Iranian state television documentary, in which she allegedly linked U.S. think tanks and nongovernmental organizations with a "soft revolution" against the Iranian government. Over the next two weeks, Iranian media reported that Esfandiari was accused of trying to topple the Iranian government. -- To combat the depression and despair during her 105-day stint in Iran's notorious Evin prison, Haleh Esfandiari welcomed all distractions and blocked thoughts of her beloved home and family. Though she said she's unsure why she was jailed in Evin's political wing, Esfandiari believes her Iranian captors wanted to know more about the Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars, the Washington-based think tank where she heads the Middle East program.
