Most blacks continue to live in Southern states, though changing population dynamics appear in other parts of the country, particularly the Pacific Northwest and the Southwest, the census figures showed. Black populations also increased in the Pacific Northwest, California, the Southwest, Florida and the Northeast but decreased in many Southern states. According to the latest census, white Hispanic populations showed the greatest increase in the Pacific Northwest, parts of California, the Southwest, Texas, Florida and the Northeast. For example, respondents could identify themselves as white Hispanics, black Hispanics or as Hispanics in any of the other racial categories. In addition, the white population grew at a slower rate -- 6% -- over the past decade than the total population, which increased by almost 10%, according to census officials.
