Fake applicants got Obamacare subsidies The problem lies buried deep in the text of the Affordable Care Act, which provides federal subsidies only to taxpayers who enroll in exchanges "established by the state." Such questions of legislative history are irrelevant when the text is clear, but there's actually a simple answer: the Affordable Care Act's drafters wanted to give states an incentive to set up exchanges. First, in Halbig v. Burwell, the D.C. Circuit -- the federal appellate court that oversees executive agencies -- held that the IRS broke the law in issuing tax credits for people to buy policies from federal insurance exchanges. That's not uncommon; for example, only residents of cooperating states get Medicaid assistance. The sooner the administration is forced to fix Obamacare, the better for the country and its battered rule of law.
