A lot of the cars that pull in to Luscious Garage are Toyota Prius hybrids, which Coquillette calls, "the Volkswagen Beetle of our times." Although the current batteries are "durable and reliable," Hartline said lithium ion batteries pack more energy into a smaller space. Coquillette expects to begin conversions to even more efficient lithium batteries soon. And with gasoline approaching $5 per gallon in the San Francisco Bay area, "plugging in cars make a whole lot of sense right at the pocketbook," said Korthof, who works for Energy Efficiency Solar. Drivers of gas-sipping hybrid vehicles are increasingly interested in converting their vehicles from gasoline powered to electric, according to garage owner and lead technician Carolyn Coquillette.
