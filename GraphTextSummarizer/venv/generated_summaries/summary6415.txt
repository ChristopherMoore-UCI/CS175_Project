" Max Parker, a video game columnist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, noted that the more inclusive presentation was a bit of a switch with Microsoft, which last year focused on the Xbox's entertainment potential while, in some eyes, giving games less than their due. "Sony pulled a 180 and switched roles," Parker said. But Sony's presentation included new hardware and non-gaming services as well as promises of exclusive titles and titles that will launch on PlayStation before coming to other consoles. Already available in Japan as PlayStation Vita TV, the $99 micro-console will allow users to play more than 1,000 games on their television and stream music and video from sites like Hulu. Other announcements included a partnership with YouTube that will let players automatically upload video to the site, a video-streaming service (PlayStation Now) and two pieces of original entertainment -- a movie based on the "Ratchet & Clank" series and an animated series based on the graphic novel "Powers." "The thirst for innovation at PlayStation is tremendous," said Shawn Layden, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America.
