Watch why Bush withdrew the pardon Â» Toussie and his father, also a developer, are defendants in a lawsuit filed in New York federal court on behalf of more than 400 minority home purchasers who allege a conspiracy involving racial steering, racketeering and fraud related to homes the Toussies built on Staten Island, attorney Peter Seidman told CNN. Perino said Toussie's pardon was withdrawn before it reached the final stage of the process. Toussie was sentenced in September 2003 to a five-month prison sentence in the Long Island case, as well as three years of supervised release. Why did White House Counsel Fred Fielding circumvent the typical pardon application process by directly considering Toussie's clemency request instead of leaving it to the Justice Department? Bradford Berenson, Toussie's lawyer, issued a statement saying Toussie "remains confident" that the pardon attorney will find in his favor.
