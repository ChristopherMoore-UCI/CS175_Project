Agriculture Department spokeswoman Denise Feiber says the menacing creatures also carry a human parasite called rat lungworm, which is a form of meningitis and potentially deadly. So far, no human cases have been reported in Florida, Feiber says. The snails have another trait in common with rats: They can multiply very rapidly -- and grow to adulthood in a year, Feiber says. Sounding like something out of a 1950s B-movie, these giant African land snails eat their way through some surprising stuff, including stucco, plastic recycling bins, signs and more than 500 species of plants, says the Florida Department of Agriculture. Officials are hoping to prevent a worst-case scenario, where the snails would threaten Florida crops.
