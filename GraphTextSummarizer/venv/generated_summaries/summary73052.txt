The victim's family, including her father Ricardo Flores, had pushed for stiffer charges and claimed that van der Sloot hasn't looked "remorseful" in court appearances. Besides the Flores' murder trial, van der Sloot also faces extradition charges to the United States. It has been widely reported that van der Sloot killed the woman after he believed she saw something on the Internet relating to Holloway. "He is a young man ... who has practically lived persecuted for a crime he says he did not commit ... or for a disappearance that he cannot explain," the lawyer said of van der Sloot. This round of the case could include testimony from the accused, though Navarro said that van der Sloot likely wouldn't give a statement Friday though he may answer questions from judges.
