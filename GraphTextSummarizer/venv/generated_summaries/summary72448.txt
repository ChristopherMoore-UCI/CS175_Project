" Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said Wednesday investigators are trying to determine why Frein may have attacked in the small, central Pennsylvania town of Blooming Grove. " Nearly 200 officers are scouring eastern Pennsylvania for Frein. But they know that, generally, Frein "has made statements about wanting to kill law enforcement officers and also to commit mass acts of murder," Noonan said. Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens said Frein has an apparent fascination with Eastern European armies, their history and attire. Frein is a survivalist with an extensive shooting background and a grudge against law enforcement, officials said.
