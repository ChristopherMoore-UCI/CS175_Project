Lipkis, who is fond of holding up a glass of water and announcing that he's drinking "dinosaur pee," likes to emphasize that water resources are finite and that nature is water's best recycler. Lipkis' organization estimates that the city lost 28 billion gallons of water that year, or 6,500 gallons per L.A. resident. "People think we're crazy when I say we're working on building a new water supply that produces as much as half of L.A.'s water from local rainfall. And along the way it's become an unlikely model for conservation; Los Angeles now uses less water than it did in 1970, despite a surge in population. For one project, Elmer Avenue, the result was enough water saved yearly to supply 30 households.
