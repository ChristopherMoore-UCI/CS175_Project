Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said the case was "a tragedy on every level." "Not only did the family of Sherri Rasmussen lose a wife and a daughter, a life that can never be returned, but also the LAPD family felt a sense of betrayal to have an officer commit such a terrible crime," Beck said in a statement. When Lazarus became a suspect, homicide detectives faced "special challenges as Lazarus' office was located next door to the detectives who were now investigating her," a police department statement said Thursday. In their investigation of an officer within their own ranks, Los Angeles detectives solved the 23-year-old cold case after DNA testing in 2009 revealed a bite mark on the murder victim's left forearm came from Lazarus, authorities said. Lazarus faces 27 years to life in prison, prosecutors said. Prosecutors argued that Lazarus was in love with Ruetten and distraught when she learned he was marrying someone else.
