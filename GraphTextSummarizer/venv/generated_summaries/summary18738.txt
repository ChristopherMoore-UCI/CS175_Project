The Sri Lankan government said Thursday it has made more inroads into the remaining territory held by ethnic Tamil Tiger rebels after troops seized their command center in the north of the country. Sri Lankan workers bury the bodies of some 38 suspected Tamil Tiger rebels killed in recent fighting. Earlier this month, troops regained control of the northern town of Elephant Pass, the point at which mainland Sri Lanka links to the northern Jaffna peninsula. The LTTE, or the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, are commonly known as the Tamil Tigers. The re-capture enabled the government to use a highway linking the mainland to the peninsula to move troops and supplies.
