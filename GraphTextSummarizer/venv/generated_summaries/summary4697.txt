Culver planned to tour the affected areas Sunday afternoon, helping set sandbags out to stave off the rising Maquoketa River. The Lake Delhi dam, about 45 miles north of Cedar Rapids, failed Saturday as a result of "massive rain -- a very unusually high amount this season," according to Jim Flansburg, communications director for Gov. Chet Culver. Video on Saturday showed massive amounts of water violently gushing from the pool behind the dam into the Maquoketa below. It was unclear how many of the structures impacted by the ensuing floodwaters were residential homes, Flansburg said. a spokesman for the governor said Sunday.
