-- Film director Roman Polanski has been released from custody in Switzerland and placed under house arrest, Swiss justice authorities said Friday. It's not clear whether Polanski completed paying the debt to Geimer, although the court papers document efforts by her lawyers to garnish residuals and other payments owed to Polanski by the Screen Actors Guild, movie studios and other Hollywood businesses. She claimed that Polanski plied her with alcohol and Quaaludes during a photo shoot at the Hollywood Hills home of actor Jack Nicholson. A judge ruled last week that Polanski could be freed -- under house arrest -- if he posted bail of 4.5 million Swiss francs ($4.5 million). He is under house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, Switzerland, the department said.
