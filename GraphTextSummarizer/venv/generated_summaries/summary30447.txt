Part of what's hindered the success of the 7-inch tablet, until now, is that they are perceived to be more like an over-sized mobile phone than a tablet, "and that appears to be the Achilles' Heel of the mini-tablets," Nudelman says. "With a 7-inch device, you can easily take your Kindle Fire with you and hold it in one hand for gaming and movie watching," Amazon representative Kinley Campbell said via e-mail. And now that Amazon has made that distinction clear, other 7-inch tablet makers can at least attempt to capitalize on that extra portable, media-consumption angle, rather than marketing them against the iPad. Its direct competition is more likely to be the Barnes & Noble Nook Color, which also runs Android and touts a similar form factor, than Apple's iPad. Apple has been tremendously successful with its 9.7-inch iPad, which flew off shelves shortly after its debut and has continued solid sales since.
