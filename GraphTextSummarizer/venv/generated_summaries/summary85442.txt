All 12 jurors had previously heard about Simpson and all but one knew about his acquittal 13 years ago in the Los Angeles, California, stabbing deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. Four jurors had previously lived in California; one for 55 years and was a resident during Simpson's murder trial. A couple of others mentioned Simpson's arrest in Los Angeles. One remembered Simpson from his 1968 Heisman Trophy days as a running back at the University of Southern California. After 13 hours of deliberation Friday, the jurors found Simpson guilty on 12 charges of armed robbery and kidnapping in connection with the 2007 attempted heist of memorabilia he said had been stolen from him.
