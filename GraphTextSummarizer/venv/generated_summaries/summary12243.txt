U.S. Ryder Cup captain Davis Love came through Monday's qualifying and will line up alongside Ireland's three-time major champion Padraig Harrington and fellow American veteran David Toms. Top-ranked Luke Donald will line up with defending champion Rory McIlroy and No. 3 Lee Westwood for the first two rounds at San Francisco's Olympic Club next Thursday and Friday. And in another stellar group, 14-time major winner Tiger Woods will play with Masters champion Bubba Watson and five-time U.S. Open runner-up Phil Mickelson -- ranked fourth, fifth and 12th respectively. Woods comes into the tournament on the back of his 73rd PGA Tour victory at the Memorial Tournament, where he tied its host Jack Nicklaus in second place on the all-time list behind Sam Snead. Donald has taken a break this week after finishing 12th at the Memorial, and he will be seeking his first major along with fellow Englishman and former world No. 1 Westwood.
