Chan's lawyers are said to be seeking to reopen the case, a controversial move that faces legal resistance from Indonesia's Supreme Court, according to Indonesia law expert Tim Lindsey. "While Australia respects Indonesia's sovereignty, we are asking that Indonesia reconsider its decision to execute two Australian citizens," Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in statement. Australia has again appealed to Indonesia's new president to spare two of its citizens who face execution by firing squad. So as it stands, the Constitutional Court says this application is acceptable and the Supreme Court says it's not," Lindsey told the ABC. Widodo had already turned down an appeal for clemency from Myuran Sukumaran, Chan's collaborator in the scheme, which included seven other people who are serving lengthy prison sentences.
