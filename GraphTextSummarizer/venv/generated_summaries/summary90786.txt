The strategy was announced last week at the end of a two-day summit in Ghana that brought together ministers from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Uganda with health experts, Ebola survivors and WHO representatives. "It's time for concrete action to put an end to the suffering and deaths caused by Ebola virus disease and prevent its further spread," he said. "These are very high-risk practices leading to extensive exposures to Ebola virus in the community," the statement said. WHO says there has been a reduction in the number of new cases reported in Guinea. WHO reports there have been 844 cases, including 518 deaths, in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia as of July 6.
