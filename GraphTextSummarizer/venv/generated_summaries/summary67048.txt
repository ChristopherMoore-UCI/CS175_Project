When Morgan asked Kourtney and Kim if they would have any talent if they were to appear on "America's Got Talent," Kim Kardashian said, "I would absolutely say that marketing is a skill." In an interview to air on Thursday's "Piers Morgan Tonight," Morgan pointed out that all three are in the top 100 list of people being followed on Twitter worldwide: Kourtney is number 72, Khloe is number 47, and Kim is the sixth-most followed. Morgan, who has only been on Twitter for six weeks, has more than 200,000 followers, and asked Kim and Kourtney to help him gain more, pointing out that the sisters' influence was "fascinating." Kim also said that "fashion" was a skill, pointing out that the sisters all worked as stylists at some point and that they currently own "three successful clothing stores." The Kardashians pointed out that much of their brand revolves around promoting a healthy body image and that none of the three sisters are "stick skinny." Kim also said she often uses body shapers, masking tape, and other under-clothing body smoothers to boost her confidence -- particularly on the red carpet.
