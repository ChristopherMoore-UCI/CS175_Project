-- Interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour sent a letter to the family of jailed Al Jazeera journalist Mohamed Fahmy on Sunday telling him that Fahmy "will enjoy all his rights guaranteed by Egyptian law." He said he and his colleagues -- Al Jazeera correspondent Peter Greste and producer Baher Mohamed -- were in good spirits. " Fahmy, a former CNN producer, injured his shoulder before his arrest in December while working as bureau chief for Al Jazeera English in Cairo. Fahmy said he wanted more time outside his windowless cell with his colleagues. " Fahmy, Greste and Mohamed have been detained for almost three months after security services raided their workspace at the Marriott hotel.
