In fact, there were so many vegan options, we hit Eis Greissler, an ice cream store that features several vegan flavors, for a cone of mindblowing vegan chocolate ice cream even before hitting our main meal! On our last day, before tackling the massive and astounding Schonbrunn Palace and its sweeping gardens, we filled up at Deli Bluem, which offered a buffet of hearty plant-based dishes from red lentils with millet, apples, spinach and radicchio to eggplant with pomegranate, pine nuts and basil. But the one that will always stand out was our lunch at the sumptuous Tian, a white glove vegetarian restaurant near Vienna's renowned Belvedere Palace. I have long used the Happy Cow app in the U.S. to find vegan restaurants. Surely, I thought, there's no way we'll find vegan options in this place.
