Because of his strong performances with Standard, Onyewu was constantly linked with a number of leading European clubs, but finally had his chance when sent out on loan to Newcastle United in the English Premier League. Onyewu claimed Anderlecht defender Jelle Van Damme called him a "dirty ape" and persisted despite being reported to the referee. Onyewu is the second U.S. international to play in Serie A. Former national captain Alexi Lalas played for Padova in the 1990s. Newcastle decided not to make his loan move permanent and Onyewu returned to Standard to help them win successive Belgian league titles. -- Oguchi Onyewu, who made his AC Milan debut in a 2-1 friendly defeat to Mexico's Club America, is the first player from the United States to be signed by the Serie A giants and is a rising talent in world football.
