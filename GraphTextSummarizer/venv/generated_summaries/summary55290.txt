But nothing could have prepared American climber Jon Reiter for last week's avalanche, the deadliest accident in the history of the world's highest peak. At the end of a 16-hour day, Dawa Sherpa came by Reiter's tent before heading to bed to see if he was all right. Radios began squawking, and Reiter heard terror in the Sherpas' voices as they spoke. Reiter doesn't think any of the climbers at the base camp would be able to reach the top of Everest this year. Reiter was one of the fortunate ones.
