" Along with the increased hospitals and physicians, the measure will allow veterans in remote or rural areas more than 40 miles from facility and those unable to get care "in a reasonable amount of time" to see private doctors, Obama noted. " McDonald, who attended the signing, will begin visiting VA hospitals and clinics around the country starting Friday, beginning in Phoenix, Obama said.

It also makes it easier to fire or otherwise discipline senior VA officials.
