In recent weeks, the area around the university has become a battleground for clashes between police and Muslim Brotherhood supporters. Morsy and other Brotherhood leaders were rounded up soon after his removal from office. Since Morsy's ouster, more than 1,000 people have been killed and thousands of Brotherhood members have been detained in a crackdown by the interim authorities. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but Islamist militants have carried out similar operations in a fast-growing insurgency threatening Egypt, which will hold presidential elections on May 26-27. Attacks targeting security forces have become increasingly common in Egypt since the army deposed Islamist President Mohamed Morsy, who hails from the Muslim Brotherhood, in July following mass protests against his rule.
