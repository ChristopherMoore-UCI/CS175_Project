The dispute surrounds the decision by oil giant Total to award Italian company IREM a contract to build a new hydro desulphurization facility at its Lindsey Oil Refinery in North Lincolnshire. -- Hundreds of energy workers across the UK have taken strike action Friday in protest over the use of foreign workers on a multimillion-dollar oil refinery project on the northeast coast of England. We will continue to put contracts out to tender in the future and we are confident we will award further contracts to UK companies. There are also between 200 and 1000 contractors working at the refinery, the vast majority of which work for UK companies employing local people. Protesters gather outside the Total Lindsey oil refinery in north-east England on January 30.
