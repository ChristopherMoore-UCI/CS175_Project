The XShot This month CNN's Richard Quest road tested the XShot, a telescopic stainless-steel rod that allows you to take pictures and videos while keeping yourself in the frame. -- This section of CNN Business Traveller aims to keep you up to date with the latest developments in the high flying world of the road warrior. After roping in a succession of tourists to try out the XShot, he decided it was easy to operate and compact, and worthy of a thumbs up from Smart Traveller. Quest tested the gadget against the beautiful alpine views from Mount Stanzahorn, near to the Swiss town of Lucern. Once in position all you need to do is hit the camera's self-timer or remote, hold the stick out and say "cheese."
