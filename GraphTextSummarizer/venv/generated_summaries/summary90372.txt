The hour revolved around Shawn (Roday) trying to find a way to break the news to best friend Gus (Dul√© Hill) that he was leaving him and Santa Barbara to go to San Francisco to be with Juliet (Maggie Lawson). After "Psych's" series finale on Wednesday, star James Roday spoke to Entertainment Weekly about the "big get" and that pitch-perfect ending. In the end, Gus quit his job and followed Shawn to San Francisco to live a life of adventure.

Before we get to the ending, let's talk about those three casting Easter Eggs: Deon Richmond played Gus' boss.
