In a news conference Tuesday in Tripoli, NTC Chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil denounced the declaration as a move to divide Libya, "a danger that threatens national unity." Tuesday's move in Benghazi "puts the country in danger because the international community will not allow Libya to be divided, unsafe and undemocratic," he said. "We are not looking to split the country," said al-Senussi, 79, who said he was jailed for 31 years during the regime of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi for leading a failed coup d'etat in 1970. "We're talking about the whole eastern region of the country," said Ahmed Zubair al-Senussi, a member of the ruling National Transitional Council, in a telephone interview with CNN from Benghazi. He called on all Libyans "to rally around the NTC that has international legitimacy."
