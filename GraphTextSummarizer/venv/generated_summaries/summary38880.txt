Abror Habibov, Akhror Saidakhmetov and Abdurasul Juraboev are accused by the federal government of attempting to join ISIS and of fostering plans to kill the President and shoot law enforcement officers. In August, court documents say, Juraboev was active on an Uzbek-language website that promoted ISIS. Court documents say Saidakhmetov once posted some comments on video of ISIS executing Iraqi forces. In one from November, Saidakhmetov told Juraboev that he wanted to join the U.S. military so he could share information with ISIS. Juraboev admitted that he'd posted the message and that he believed in the ISIS agenda.
