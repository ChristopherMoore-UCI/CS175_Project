Frida Kahlo was born in this house and lived in it with her husband, Diego Rivera. The couple's love for traditional Mexican art can be seen throughout the house, from the large fireplace designed by Rivera that dominates the first room, resembling a step pyramid like the ones built by the Mayas and Aztecs, to Kahlo's paintings and the couple's collection of smaller sculptures. As visitors move through the museum, it is the remnants of Kahlo and Rivera's private life that begin to tell their story. It was because she began painting that Kahlo met Diego Rivera, who was at the time a famous Mexican muralist. It was painted that way because Kahlo and Rivera felt that the bright colors represented Mexican culture better than the original white paint.
