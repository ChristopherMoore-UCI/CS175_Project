Officer Stephen Stem was dismissed from the Hearne Police Department on Saturday after the city council voted 6-0 to take disciplinary action against him, said Jessica Vega, Hearne Police Department communications supervisor. Hearne City Attorney Bryan Russ Jr. said Stem told Golden to drop her weapon at least three times. In a statement released to CNN affiliate KBTX on Friday, Stem's attorney Robert McCabe said he is "fully confident that Officer Stem's actions were immediately necessary and legally justified" and plans to meet with Stem next week to discuss his job termination. Stem fired three times, and Golden was hit at least twice, he said. Stem was advised by his attorney not to attend the council meeting, according to CNN affiliate KBTX.
