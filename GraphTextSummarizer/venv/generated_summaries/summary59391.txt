But Real's depth in attacking strength finally told seven minutes after halftime, when Angel Di Maria followed up to equalize after goalkeeper Juan Calatayud failed to deal with Ronaldo's long-range dipping shot. Third-placed Villarreal trail Real by four points ahead of Sunday's trip to Sporting Gijon. Former France World Cup winner David Trezeguet headed home David Cortes' right-wing cross to continue his good scoring run since joining from Italian club Juventus as promoted Hercules raised hopes of repeating their upset wins over Barca and Sevilla earlier this season. The Argentina forward forced a shot home in the fourth minute as Sevilla struggled to keep Barca at bay, and netted a fine individual effort on 67 after winning the ball just inside the visitors' half. Messi has 14 goals in 12 appearances following his double in Barcelona's 5-0 thrashing of 10-man Sevilla, who were left in sixth place -- nine points off the lead.
