It's believed that 15,000 widows live on the streets of Vrindavan, a city of about 55,000 in northern India. "Widows don't have many social rights within the family," says Ranjana Kumari with the Center for Social Research, a group that works to empower women. -- Ostracized by society, thousands of India's widows flock to the holy city of Vrindavan waiting to die. Dr. Mohini Giri has formed an organization called the Guild of Service, which helps destitute women and children. Hindus have long believed that death in Vrindavan will free them from the cycle of life and death.
