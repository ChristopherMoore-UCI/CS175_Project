-- Pakistan's Supreme Court has ordered Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to face a contempt of court hearing this week Government officials and members of Gilani's Pakistan Peoples Party defended the prime minister Monday. "The army and the judiciary, they both have to protect democracy in Pakistan," Gilani said in a televised speech Monday night. But if he is convicted, the court could disqualify Gilani as a member of Parliament, which would make him ineligible to be prime minister, Mehboob said. Even before Gilani's speech, Pakistan's government said the prime minister would comply with the order.
