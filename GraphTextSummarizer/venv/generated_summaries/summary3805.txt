"Children in the White House have always held a great fascination with the American people," said Nathan Raab, vice president of the Raab Collection. Mary Todd Lincoln ended up not going to the Baltimore event, likely too burdened with preparations for a reception the next night, the final White House reception of the season, Raab says. A newly published letter from Mrs. Lincoln requesting a sitter gives rare insight into the family's life inside the Lincoln White House, showing one way the family had to juggle their busy schedules, just like everyone else. Forbes and the president's guard then left for a drink, leaving Lincoln unattended, Raab says. The letter is being offered for sale by the Raab Collection, a dealer in historical documents, valued at $15,000.
