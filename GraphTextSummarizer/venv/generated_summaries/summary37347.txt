The Lampre team rider came home in three hours 34 minute and 55 seconds to edge out New Zealander Julian Dean and Norway's Edvald Hagen Boasson, with Australian Robbie McEwen fourth and South Africa's Robert Hunter fifth. -- Italian veteran Alessandro Petacchi won his second stage of the 2010 Tour de France on Wednesday as cycling's premier event returned to less testing terrain after two days of crash-marred racing. British rider Cavendish, who won six stages last year, had a better day after struggling in the wet and on the cobble stones of previous runs but will be disappointed after being forced out of contention at the final sprint. Hushovd retained the sprinters' green points jersey that he won overall last year and in 2005, but had his margin trimmed to 10 points by Petacchi and acknowledged the threat posed by the 36-year-old -- back at the Tour for the first time since 2004. Petacchi triumphed in the fourth leg from Cambrai to Reims as last year's top sprinters Thor Hushovd and Mark Cavendish could manage only ninth and 12th respectively.
