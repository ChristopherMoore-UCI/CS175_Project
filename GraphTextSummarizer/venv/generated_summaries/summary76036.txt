But the justices offered no clear indication of how they will rule in the case of a man who is on Louisiana death row for raping a child. Texas enacted a version in June, but no defendant has been designated death-eligible for child rape in any state but Louisiana. "It gives tremendous discretion to the prosecutor to pick and choose who should be executed," Breyer said, summarizing the position of death penalty opponents. " In their appeal, Kennedy's lawyers repeatedly raised the issue of skin color and whether that has played a factor in the political and legal debate over expanding capital crimes to include rape. " Florida, Montana, Oklahoma and South Carolina have long had death-penalty laws for rape but have not applied them in decades.
