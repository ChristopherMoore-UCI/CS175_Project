These laboratory findings bear out in all kinds of epidemiologic studies showing that a diet containing higher levels of trans fats carried greater health risk than a diet similarly high in saturated fat. In 2006, the FDA started mandating that food labels list the amount of trans fats in foods in order to make consumers aware of their hazard. Because of this, the negative effects of trans fats are about double those of saturated fat (which isn't that good for you, either). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that removing trans fats from the U.S. food supply could prevent about 20,000 heart attacks a year and 7,000 deaths from cardiovascular disease. By the 1990s, evidence was building that trans fats carried a significant risk for increasing coronary heart disease.
