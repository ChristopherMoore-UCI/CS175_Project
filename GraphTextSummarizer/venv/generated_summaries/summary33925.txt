To add a status update, photo, place check-in, or life event to your Timeline, simply hover the mouse over the line in the center of the page until it turns into a plus sign, and reveals the option to add one of those four types of posts. This ultra-illustrative, chronological listing of posts, photos, shared links, check-ins, and more is a radically different arrangement than the Facebook profile you've been used to. There you'll find posts and information you need to review before it publishes to your profile, as well as a complete look at your interactions on Facebook. When you add a friend or follow someone's public updates, Facebook automatically sets the level of posts you see to "Most Updates." You can choose to see only your posts, posts by others, posts from specific Facebook apps ("Hmm, let's look at my past Farmville accomplishments"), photos and more.
