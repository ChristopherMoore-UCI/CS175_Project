"Those not able to consume these foods should consider taking supplements containing fish oil or lutein." Seddon and her colleagues first reported findings linking omega-3 fatty acids and fish intake to lower AMD risk in 1994. "The studies are notable for that alone," says John Paul SanGiovanni, a staff scientist with the National Eye Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who published 12 years of follow-up data on omega-3 fatty acids and AMD risk earlier this year with very similar results. Some people with early AMD (but not all of them) will develop late AMD, in which a person has larger drusen and a blurred area at the center of their visual field. In a group of 2,454 men and women followed for up to a decade, Dr. Jennifer S. L. Tan and colleagues from the University of Sydney found people who ate a serving of fish every week were 31 percent less likely to develop early AMD than those who did not. Dr. Chong and her team also found people who ate the most trans fat were 1.76 times more likely to develop late AMD during the study's follow-up period.
