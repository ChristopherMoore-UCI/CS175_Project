-- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was sworn in for a second four-year term Saturday, extolling her country's economic stability during a time of global crisis. Her presidential campaign was also the first she had to wage without her late husband and former president, Nestor Kirchner. While she talked a lot about specific economic indicators, Fernandez did not abandon her populist side. "We are a new Argentina, but we are also in a new world with more challenges and more decisions to be made in the best interest of our people and society," she said. He was president from 2003 to 2007, when Fernandez succeeded him.
