According to manufacturer Hitachi, special technology will regulate air pressure within the car to keep your ears from getting blocked as you fly skywards. "Rollers" will keep the car from swinging wildly from side to side. Newly developed brakes are high able to resist extreme heat -- up to 300 degrees Celsius, says Hitachi. And even that building will be dwarfed by the upcoming Kingdom Tower in Saudi Arabia, expected to pierce the skies at 3,281 feet (1 kilometer) high. The elevator will operate in a new supertall skyscraper being built in Guangzhou, China.
