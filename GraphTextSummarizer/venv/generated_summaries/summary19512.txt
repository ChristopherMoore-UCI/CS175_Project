"We want to find a new driver from the very poor slums of Venezuela and give him the opportunity to become a race driver in the future in F1," Maldonado, who was encouraged into motorsport by his father and uncle, explained. Traditionally governments have invested in F1 by stumping up cash to stage races but now they are cutting deals with drivers and teams. "You know, F1 after my victory last year became a very popular sport," Maldonado explained. As well as the traditional logos prominently painted on the car's livery, Venezuela now gets a mention every time Maldonado is strapped into a car. " Maldonado was not the first F1 pilot from Venezuela -- that honor went to Italian born Ettore Chimeri in 1959 -- but he became the first Venezuelan to win a grand prix in Spain during the 2012 season.
