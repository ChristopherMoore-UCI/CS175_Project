Research from the China Europe International Business School suggests that within 10 years, China will invest $1 trillion in Europe -- but it will likely be more in the form of direct investment in companies rather than buying government debt, Quench said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, in a visit to China earlier this month, had lobbied China Investment Corp., the state-owned $410 billion sovereign wealth fund, to invest in euro debt bonds. -- A China-EU summit ended Tuesday with promises for more support from Beijing for debt-straddled Europe, yet no concrete cash pledges to buy euro debt. Encouraging China to buy bonds for Greece or EU debt would not only help the nations, but would bolster market sentiment for purchasing the bonds, and could help bring down borrowing costs for Europe. Indebted nations have made repeated entreaties to Chinese leaders for bail out help in the form of buying government debt bonds or direct investment.
