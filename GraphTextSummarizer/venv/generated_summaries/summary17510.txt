Rovio CEO Mikael Hed told Finnish TV station Yle that the latest game "has an educational element and centers on the main character Alex, a curious young boy who loves to build things." Rovio Entertainment, known for its intense focus on one mega-successful game title, "Angry Birds," is looking to diversify with another new mobile game called "Amazing Alex." Rovio announced the billionth download of "Angry Birds" last week. The company, which released the game in 2009, offers four different versions of the game -- "Angry Birds Space" is the latest. "Casey's Contraptions" is another physics-based game along the lines of "Angry Birds."
