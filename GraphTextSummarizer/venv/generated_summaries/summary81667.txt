Human Rights Watch last month urged the contest's organizers and other nations to put pressure on Azerbaijan's government to prevent "violence against journalists, social media activists, and human rights defenders; refrain from using politically-motivated criminal charges against journalists and others; release people imprisoned on politically-motivated charges; and allow peaceful assemblies." At present, Azerbaijan "remains hostile towards free media and other forms of free expression," the group said. But this year, human rights activists have questioned whether Azerbaijan, formerly part of the Soviet Union, should have been allowed to host the contest given what they describe as its poor record on freedom of expression. Emin Milli, a former political prisoner in Azerbaijan now studying in London, accused the government of detaining a few individuals on politically-motivated grounds in order to scare other people. Despite the "Euro-" prefix, contestants can come from any member country of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) that includes numerous non-European nations, some, like Azerbaijan, from central Asia.
