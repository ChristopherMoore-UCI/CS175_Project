Thomson finished just over two days behind winner Francois Gabart of France after 80 days of racing, setting a British record for a solo round the world race in the process. There are still two and a half years to the start of the next Vendee Globe race in Les Sables-d'Olonne in southwest France, but for Thomson it cannot come around fast enough. His daredevil stunts have attracted over 3.5 million hits on YouTube and reached uncharted waters for sailing, but for his next trick Alex Thomson just wants to get back to doing what he does best -- circumnavigating the globe faster than anyone else. But the race provided a welcome boost for Thomson's long-term aspirations as Spaniard Pepe Ribes and his replacement -- American Ryan Breymaier -- took line honors after just over 14 days at sea. British ambition Ainslie, who won his Olympic golds in dinghy classes, has announced he will lead an ambitious $134 million British bid to win the America's Cup in 2017.
