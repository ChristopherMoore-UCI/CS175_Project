Last week, Maryland Lottery officials were responding to a flurry of questions from the media after a Baltimore-area woman told the New York Post that she had one of the winning tickets. -- The holder of one of three winning tickets in a record $656 million Mega Millions drawing has come forward to claim a share, Maryland Lottery officials said Monday. The Kansas winner, who was the first to officially come forward last week, chose to remain anonymous -- as will the holder of the ticket sold in Maryland, said Everett. " "She claims she won," Everett said last week. However, in a bizarre twist of the story, Mirlande Wilson, a 37-year-old single mother of seven who works at McDonald's, told the Post she wasn't sure where she last had the ticket.
