Brakes in hybrids such as the Prius operate differently from brakes in most cars. Toyota officials described the problem as a "disconnect" in the vehicle's complex anti-lock brake system (ABS) that causes less than a one-second lag. The Japanese government has warned Toyota to take seriously mounting complaints with the Prius. The Prius is Toyota's third best-selling model in the United States, ranking behind the Camry mid-size sedan and the Corolla compact car. Toyota Vice President Shinichi Sasaki met with Japan's transport minister on Wednesday.
