(EW.com) -- "Maleficent" managed to enchant audiences and take flight opening weekend while Seth MacFarlane's sophomore effort, "A Million Ways to Die in the West," stumbled out of the gates. Maleficent — $70 million (domestic total: $70 million) 2. Disney's gothic fantasy, a PG-rated re-imagining of the classic Sleeping Beauty villain starring Angelina Jolie in the titular role, netted an estimated $70 million from 3,948 locations — $6.7 million of which was from the 347 IMAX screens. For comparison's sake, "X-Men: The Last Stand" fell nearly 67 percent in weekend two, while X-Men: First Class fell only 56 percent. "We're feeling great," Dave Hollis, Disney's distribution head told EW.
