A recent report from the European Environment Agency (EEA), for example, has predicted that greenhouse gas emissions from household waste will drop by more than 80 percent by 2020 -- largely because of increases in recycling levels which are diverting waste away from landfills. BIR says producing paper from recycled paper as opposed to wood can slash air pollution by as much as 74 percent and water pollution by 35 percent; while manufacturing recycled steel results in 86 percent less air pollution. "Where a scavenger mentality, grassroots recycling and sheer necessity can lead to imaginative leaps in redeploying waste." Looking at it another way, according to the National Recycling Coalition, the amount of energy saved in one year by Americans recycling their soda cans, plastic containers, newspapers and packaging represented the energy equivalent of: Not surprisingly, recycling also impacts pollution levels. -- As a concept, recycling has lived and died many times throughout its 4,000-year old history.
