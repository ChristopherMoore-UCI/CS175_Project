McIlroy had labeled the contract he had signed with Horizon as "unconscionable." "The legal dispute between Rory McIlroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties who wish each other well for the future," said a joint statement from McIlroy and Horizon. The World No.1 avoided a potentially long and drawn out court case in Dublin, Ireland, after attempting to sue Horizon Sports Management, who in turn were counter-suing the golfer  by claiming the Northern Irishman owed them millions of dollars in commission on contracts up to 2017. McIlroy terminated his contract with Horizon in 2013 to set up his own company. The 25-year-old had claimed that the fees charged by Horizon were excessive, while simultaneously being accused of breaching his contract and owing outstanding fees. The period under dispute coincided with McIlroy's sponsorship deal with Nike, which was reported be worth around $100m. McIlroy, who won the Dubai Desert Classic last weekend, was not in court when the settlement was announced, though he did make a brief appearance on Tuesday.
