Yet this "comedy" about two TV guys tasked with assassinating North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has sparked a cyberterror campaign that amounts to extortion. Proof positive of the essentially cowardly nature of Hollywood is that executives reportedly screened the ending of "The Interview" for the State Department -- and won official blessing. But it should never be forgotten that North Korea has financed terrorism in the past, including the bombing of passenger jets. But serious films about the shocking homophobia of the African continent, anti-religious persecution in China or the obvious evil of North Korea are strangely few and far between. Thus totalitarianism crops up in U.S. cinema either as fantasy (the Empire in "Star Wars") or as something to laugh at ("Team America" also tackled North Korea, albeit with genuine wit).
