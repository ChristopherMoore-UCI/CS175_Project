-- Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton has become the latest high-profile British sports star to regret a hastily dashed off tweet after lashing out at McLaren teammate Jenson Button on Twitter Hamilton accused fellow Briton Button of "unfollowing" him -- not subscribing to his tweets -- on the micro-blogging site, before later discovering his colleague had never followed him. Cole was reacting to an FA report which outlined the reasons why the organization hit Chelsea captain John Terry with a four-match ban and a $356,000 fine for racially abusing Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand. The 2008 world champion Hamilton will leave McLaren at the end of the 2012 season to join German team Mercedes in a three-year deal. It is not the first time Hamilton has fallen foul of an over eager tweet. Meanwhile Alonso's Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa hopes his first podium finish since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix will help him to secure his place at the Italian team for next season.
