Unrest has gripped Burkina Faso -- a key ally for the West in the fight against al Qaeda -- as protests against President Blaise Compaore's government turned violent, culminating Thursday with demonstrators storming the Parliament and setting fire to the building. " "An interim authority will be set up in order to prepare the conditions for the return to normal constitutional order within a period of 12 months at the latest," Traore said. -- The military in the West African nation of Burkina Faso seized control of the government on Thursday and set a dusk-to-dawn curfew in what one general described as an effort to protect lives and restore order. " The West, particularly France, considers Burkina Faso a key ally in the fight against al Qaeda. The incident followed reports that a large group of protesters had stormed the Parliament building, where lawmakers were set to vote on a motion to allow Compaore to extend his 27 years of rule.
