"To protect the anonymity and privacy of those responsible for providing information which directly led to the arrests of Mr. Bulger and Ms. Greig, the FBI will not comment further regarding this matter," the FBI said in a statement. As part of the media campaign, the FBI said it would place images of Greig and Bulger on digital billboards in Times Square in New York and in other cities. According to an indictment, Greig and Bulger posed as a married couple under different false identities and claimed to be from states other than Massachusetts. Greig, 60, allegedly assisted Bulger from January 1995 until late June, when the pair was arrested in California, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. The FBI offered a $2 million reward for Bulger's arrest and $100,000 for the arrest of Greig.
