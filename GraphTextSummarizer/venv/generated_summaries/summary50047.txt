On Wednesday, McDonald's in Japan rolled out Tofu Shinjo McNuggets, a doppelganger of the Chicken McNugget made from a mishmash of minced white fish, tofu and vegetables including edamame, soy beans and carrots. The tainted meat supply from the food processing plant of Shanghai Husi Food, has been found to reach across China, all the way to Hong Kong, and to Japan -- where it affected 20% of their meat for chicken nuggets triggering sporadic shortages over the weekend. On Tuesday, McDonald's Japan CEO Sarah Casanova apologized and promised to strengthen food safety measures, including more transparency in the country of origin for its products. Last week, a video surfaced in Chinese media, showing appalling practices in a Shanghai food-processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands including McDonald's, Starbucks and Yum Brands. But it may run out of chicken products for its Chick Crisp Muffin and Chicken Egg Muffin, the company told CNN.
