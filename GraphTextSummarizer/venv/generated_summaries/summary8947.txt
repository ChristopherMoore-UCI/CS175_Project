Dortmund is seeking to reclaim the Bundesliga crown from Bayern Munich, which raced to the 2012/2013 title in record time by clinching top spot in early April. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, brought in to beef up the attack after Gotze was sold to rival Bayern Munich, netted a hat-trick on his Bundesliga debut as the league and Champions League runner-up began by beating Augsburg 4-0. Under new boss Pep Guardiola, Bayern lost the German Super Cup 4-2 to Dortmund but began the new Bundesliga campaign with a 3-1 home victory Friday against Borussia Moenchengladbach. Bayern Munich beat Dortmund 2-1 thanks to a late goal in an entertaining Champions League final in May and completed the treble by capturing the German Cup a week later. -- If Saturday is any indication, Borussia Dortmund won't miss Mario Gotze.
