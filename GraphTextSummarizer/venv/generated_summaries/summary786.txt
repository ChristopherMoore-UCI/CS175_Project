Acclaim for the intense and harrowing 12 Years a Slave has already secured it a solid place in the running for this year's Best Picture Oscar, and Spirit nominations were expected for director Steve McQueen, screenwriter John Ridley, cinematographer Sean Bobbit, lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofor, and supporting actors Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender.
