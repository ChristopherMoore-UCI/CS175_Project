Catherine's first appearance since royal baby was born The design of the coins, to be produced by the Royal Mint in a range of sizes and materials, has been approved by his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and his great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, the Royal Mint said. -- Special coins designed to mark the christening later this month of Prince George, the baby son of Prince William and his wife, Catherine, go into production Tuesday in Britain. He is third in line for the throne after his grandfather, Prince Charles, and father, Prince William. The inscription on the coin reads, "To celebrate the Christening of Prince George of Cambridge 2013" and is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. Prince George, who was born in July, is the first royal baby to be honored with a christening coin from the Royal Mint.
