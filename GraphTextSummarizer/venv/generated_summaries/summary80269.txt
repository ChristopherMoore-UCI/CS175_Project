-- Former President Bush said that if Laura Bush hadn't been his wife, he isn't sure he could have counted on her vote. Laura Bush's "patience and her enthusiasm ... made our marriage a really good marriage," President Bush said. And it's much harder to be the father of the president than to be the president," he said in a reference to his dad, former President George H.W. Bush. Bush will take the stage Friday night with former President Clinton in Toronto, Ontario, for what's being termed a "conversation." "I was pleased to have someone serve as my vice president who was not running for president, because someone who is running for president, at times, will try to distance themselves," Bush said.
