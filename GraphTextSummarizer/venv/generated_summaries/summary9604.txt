-- AC Milan captain Gennaro Gattuso has apologised for head-butting Tottenham assistant manager Joe Jordan at the end of Tuesday's stormy Champions League clash at the San Siro. Gattuso had already had an altercation with 59-year-old Jordan, who ironically starred for Milan during his playing career, earlier in Tottenham's 1-0 win, before the two went head-to-head again at the final whistle. " Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp added: "Gattuso had a flair-up with Joe Jordan. And European football's governing body UEFA have already issued a statement saying: "UEFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against Gennaro Gattuso after the incidents that took place after the match between AC Milan and  Tottenham. Why Gattuso has to lose his cool "I was annoyed about the words I'd exchanged with Jordan earlier.
