In Beyond Batman, Russel writes about a New Year's Eve 2012 conversation about a potential Justice League movie that he had with a friend who worked at Legendary Pictures during the making of the Dark Knight films: "'Why would Christian Bale walk away from what is certainly going to be either the first or second highest grossing movie in the history of cinema," he asked, when the subject of Justice League was raised. Fans of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy and Bale's dark portrayal of the Caped Crusader immediately rejoiced, convincing themselves that Bale's previous denials and his desire to pass the torch to another Batman could quickly be erased by cold hard cash. Sources close to Christian Bale have reportedly begun expressing their suspicions that Bale now views the Batman films in the same light that Robert Downey, Jr. views the Iron Man films. Conceivably, he could return as Batman for one epic battle with Superman, really die the noble death he faked in Dark Knight Rises and then hand the keys of the Tumbler over to his new successor, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, for the subsequent Justice League movie â€” STOP!!! Instead, the tabloid was blindly relying on a new ebook titled Beyond Batman: The Unauthorized True Story of Christian Bale and His Dark Knight Dilemma.
