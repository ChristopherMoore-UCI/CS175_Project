Most Indian women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations. The December rape gripped India and led to calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women. The gang rape, and the woman's subsequent death from injuries, prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks. Last year, the prison recorded 18 deaths, including two suicides, according to CNN affiliate CNN-IBN. One of the men accused of gang raping and fatally beating a woman on a New Delhi bus was found dead in his jail cell Monday.
