The Gang of Six negotiations focus on a deficit reduction plan compiled last year by a commission appointed by Obama that calls for increased revenue through tax reform, spending cuts in all areas and reforms to all the entitlement programs. "I will vote 'no' on raising the debt ceiling unless we have comprehensive, dramatic, effective and broad- based cuts to federal spending, including the reform of entitlement spending," Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Illinois, said on the CBS program "Meet the Press." President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders oppose linking the debt ceiling measure to political issues, warning that a failure to raise the debt limit would amount to a U.S. default that would shake global markets, raise interest rates and stall or reverse economic recovery. -- A leading Senate conservative said Sunday he can accept tax reform that increases overall tax revenue as part of a comprehensive deficit reduction plan. And the administration knows that." So far, House Republicans have passed a 2012 budget proposal that would slash nonmilitary spending and overhaul Medicare and Medicaid while lowering tax rates with no revenue increase. Obama and Democrats reject the Republican plan as an imbalanced approach that would put the burden of deficit reduction on senior citizens and the poor.
