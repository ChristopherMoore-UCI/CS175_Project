However, Boko Haram has been tied to violence in Jos before, including a double car-bombing at the same market in May that killed 118 people. Located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) northwest of Abuja, the nation's capital, Jos is in an area that has been beset by violence in recent years. Much of that fighting has pitted Nigerian troops against Boko Haram, the Islamist terror group trying to impose its strict version of Sharia law across the African nation. Two bombs explosions at a market in the central Nigerian city of Jos left 32 people dead, a government agency reported, marking the latest instance of violence to hit the volatile region. Nigeria's state broadcaster NTA reported the explosions took place Thursday at the terminus area of the Jos market.
