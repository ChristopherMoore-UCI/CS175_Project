The swollen Balonne River, which cuts through the heart of the town of St. George in the eastern state of Queensland, reached 13.85 meters (45.4 feet) Tuesday morning and was expected to peak around 14 meters later in the day, said Steve Gollschewski, assistant commissioner of the Queensland Police. Dozens of homes in southeastern Queensland have been inundated by the floods and hundreds of people have taken shelter in evacuation centers. "Your safety is primary to our decision making." Queensland has been deluged with heavy rains over the past week even as some parts of the region are still struggling to recover from devastating floods that took place about a year ago. The cleanup from the flooding in Roma, Mitchell and Charleville -- three towns near St. George -- was in danger of being hampered by more bad weather Tuesday. "The clear message for all of the residents of St. George is there will be no return today," said Ian Stewart, deputy commissioner of the  Queensland Police.
