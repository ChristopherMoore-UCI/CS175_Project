In one of the plans, Acord wrote that he wanted to go to first period then take a few hours in the parking lot to prepare for his attack, during which he would "shoot and throw bombs throughout the school." The prosecutor said Acord wanted to outdo the Columbine High School shootings, which left one teacher and 14 students dead, including the two gunmen. Those symptoms can be accompanied by anxiety attacks, irritability, extreme mood swings, temper tantrums, immaturity, hyperactivity, handwriting changes and problems in school, the NIH says. The writing said he planned to pack his truck with the bombs and guns at home, go to West Albany High School and slip out of class after first period. When the judge entered, Acord snapped to attention in front of a microphone.
