Ahead of Bopha's arrival on Tuesday, government agencies relocated more than 50,000 people to evacuation centers. A landslide in eastern Mindanao blocked a national highway, the news agency reported, leavening hundreds of people in buses, vans and cars stuck on the road. But local authorities have done a good job of relocating people out of vulnerable areas and preparing evacuation centers, said Gordon of the Red Cross. The typhoon has affected more than 213,000 people, demolished houses and stranded people in two Mindanao regions and parts of the Visayas region, according to the disaster agency. Bopha, the most powerful typhoon to hit Mindanao in decades, had top winds of 175 kph (110 mph) as it came ashore over the city of Baganga early Tuesday.
