The woman's two lawyers allegedly called Albalwi's father, Sheikh Monsur Albalwi, in June with offers of ending the criminal case against his son for a large payment, a release from District Attorney Jackie Lacey said. Leyla Ors, 33, told Los Angeles detectives last March that Thamer Albalwi, 23, had raped and tortured her. On the same day, attorney Joseph Gerard Cavallo told Sheikh Albalwi, one of the wealthiest men in Saudi Arabia, that the demand was for $20 million to be transferred to a Swiss bank account that Hudson would set up, the complaint said. Â  Â Ors, Hudson and Cavallo face charges of attempted extortion, conspiracy to commit extortion, conspiracy to receive a bribe and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He was arrested and charged with four counts of sexual assault based on her story and a physical exam, according to the Los Angeles district attorney.
