The Clinton friend and former aide told CNN last week that the best way to go after Clinton is to use this against her: "If you like Obama, you will love Hillary." " Clinton tried to create some distance between herself and Obama earlier this month on foreign policy during an interview with The Atlantic. "Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle," Clinton told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, knocking Obama's mantra on avoiding overseas pitfalls. " Others in Clinton's current and former orbit see the "third-term Obama" question as a possible issue. Their goal is simple: Republicans want voters to think Obama and a third term, not the third term of Bill Clinton, who left office scandal-plagued but is more popular now.
