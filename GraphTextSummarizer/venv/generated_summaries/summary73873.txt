Messi treble puts Barca into the last 16 "AC Milan, according to medical reports of the Policlinico in Milan, have said that Antonio Cassano has experienced ischemic cerebral damage," read the statement on the 18-time Serie A title winners' official website. -- Italian football champions AC Milan have announced that Antonio Cassano will undergo heart surgery, after the striker was hospitalized following last weekend's 3-2 win against Roma. Following an unhappy spell ruined by injury and a falling-out with coach Fabio Capello, Cassano returned home to Sampdoria in 2008 after a season's loan before joining Milan in January this year -- a move prompted by another dispute, this time with the Genoa side's chairman Riccardo Garrone. The condition was caused by a malformation in Cassano's heart, resulting in poor blood flow to the brain -- which can lead to possible vision, movement and speech restrictions. He will be hoping to recover in time to be part of Cesare Prandelli's Italy squad for next year's European Championship in Poland and Ukraine, which starts in June 2012.
