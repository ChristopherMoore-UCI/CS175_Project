The experts will conduct more research to assess the full global impact of Asian pollution, including creating more climate models, monitoring storm patterns by satellite, and conducting measurements in the atmosphere. If this system is changed by air pollution from Asia, then global heat distribution will also be changed. -- A study finds that air pollution from Asia directly affects the storm pattern over the Pacific Ocean. Smog central Reports of high levels of air pollution regularly emerge from the Asia region. If you provide too many seeds, then you fundamentally change cloud patterns and storm patterns," says co-author of the study, Renyi Zhang, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University in College Station.
