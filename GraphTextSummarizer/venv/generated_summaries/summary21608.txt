A pilot program several years ago in Ghana found that the Worldreader program boosted reading test scores for primary students by up to 7.6%, although benefits for older students were less clear. Carrying heavy loads of books is not practical for Kenyan students who often have to walk miles to and from school. They're lightweight and portable and give students access to entire libraries, including books from African publishers. As McElwee sees it, it's not enough to just provide books; they must provide books that students want to read. The organization also created an app that allows students to read books on their cell phones (cell phone penetration is as high as 80% in developing countries; in Kenya, cell towers are everywhere).
