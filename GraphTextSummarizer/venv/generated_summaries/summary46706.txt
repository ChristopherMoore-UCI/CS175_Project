Suarez was playing in his first league game since serving a 10 match ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic last April. In Sunday's first Premier League match, Norwich City earned a 1-0 away win at Stoke City thanks to a solitary goal from Jonathan Howson. After collecting Daniel Sturridge's pass across the box to slot in his first goal, Suarez lifted his Liverpool top to reveal a t-shirt dedicated to his wife, daughter and new son "Benja." Sunderland, playing their first match since manager Paolo di Canio was axed seven days ago, may have felt luck was not quite on their side. France midfielder Paul Pogba nodded in a second half header to keep Juve level on points with Serie A leaders Napoli.
