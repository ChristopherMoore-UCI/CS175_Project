World titles The accident happened while Schumacher was off-piste -- meaning he was on unmarked slopes -- in the mountains between Georges Bauduis Piste and La Biche Piste, resort director Christophe Gernignon-Lecomte said. On Monday night, doctors carried out a surgical intervention on Schumacher that allowed for some pressure to be relieved on his brain in a way that was "gradual and effective," said Jean-Francois Payen, head of anesthesiology at the University Hospital Center of Grenoble. The surgery came after a scan showed a surprising improvement in Schumacher's condition Monday afternoon, Payen said. But Payen warned that it was too soon to speculate on Schumacher's prognosis. Kehm said a journalist tried to sneak into Schumacher's hospital room disguised as a priest.
