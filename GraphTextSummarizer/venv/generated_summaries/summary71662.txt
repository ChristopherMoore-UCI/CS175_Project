In Pomona, California, a wrong-way driver crashed into two other vehicles on State Route 60, known locally as 60 Freeway, leaving six dead, according to California Highway Patrol Officer Jennifer Cassidy. Cassidy said the driver was hospitalized in critical condition. Five people died in a crash on Interstate 275 in Tampa when a Ford Expedition, traveling south in the northbound lanes, collided head-on with a Hyundai, said Sgt. The other four other people killed, all men ages 20 and 21, were occupants in the Hyundai, he said. Two separate wrong-way wrecks killed 11 people early Sunday morning in Florida and California, officials said.
