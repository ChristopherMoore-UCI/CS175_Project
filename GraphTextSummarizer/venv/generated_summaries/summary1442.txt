Baltimore Sun television critic David Zurawik, who writes about the industry in the paper's "Z on TV" blog, said there may never be another collection of such talent in an ensemble drama on network television. It's a significant move for NBC in an age where sitcoms and dramas have increasingly given way to the less-expensive-to-produce reality TV shows. "What's so symbolic about 'ER' leaving is that that 10 o'clock Thursday night slot started out what I always called the beginning of the second golden age of television with 'Hill Street Blues'," said Robert Thompson, a professor and founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. "There's just no way in the business model of network television for a producer out in Hollywood to say 'Here's the concept, and I've got this star, this star and this star,' " Zurawik said. "ER" quickly attracted legions of fans and catapulted many members of the ever-changing ensemble cast to superstar status -- most notably George Clooney, who played hunky Dr. Doug Ross.
