Conservationists believe hundreds of gray wolves straying from Yellowstone in search of prey could soon be killed by hunters and ranchers. They transplanted dozens of wolves to Yellowstone from Canada. We have more wolves than we ever predicted and we have fewer problems than we ever predicted. Federal officials estimate there are 1,500 gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park. In the early 20th century, wolves were the targets of a massive government extermination campaign.
