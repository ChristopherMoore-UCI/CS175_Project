"I think we've seen Bode Miller race for the last time. TV analyst Brian Stemmle, a four-time Winter Olympian for Canada, tweeted this graphic image of Miller's leg. The US skier, a winner of four world titles alongside Olympic gold at Vancouver 2010, severed a hamstring tendon in a high-speed crash while racing at the World Championships in Beaver Creek, Colorado. Racing for the first time since undergoing back surgery in November, Miller had displayed characteristic bravery in what was -- up to the crash -- the fastest run of the day. Within hours of the crash, surgeons were working to repair Miller's tendon.
