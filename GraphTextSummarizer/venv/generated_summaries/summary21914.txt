Barz found the school has "a problem of sexual assault on and off campus." The Justice Department said it still was investigating the Missoula Police Department and the Missoula County attorney's office regarding allegations that they, too, failed to investigate complaints of sexual assault. Justice and the Department of Education began investigating the school last year, after allegations that 11 complaints of sexual assault involving students had not been investigated thoroughly because of gender bias. The federal investigation began after a university-commissioned review by a Montana Supreme Court justice, Diane Barz. Settlements with both departments will ensure that future complaints are addressed quickly and fairly and that students who bring them are protected from retaliation, officials said. -- The University of Montana will overhaul its handling of sexual harassment and assault complaints after a federal probe found "real and significant" problems, the Justice Department announced Thursday.
