Haftar also launched what he called an open-ended war on Islamist extremist groups and vowed to "purge" Libya of them. In an effort to try to ease tensions, Libya's electoral commission announced early elections will be held on June 25. -- Libya's interim parliament Sunday approved a new government, led by Prime Minister Ahmed Mitig, in a controversial vote that threatens to deepen the country's political and security crisis. His campaign has widened divisions in the country with Islamist and anti-Islamist camps. Shortly before the vote in parliament, the EU's special envoy to Libya described the situation as the country's worst crisis since 2011.
