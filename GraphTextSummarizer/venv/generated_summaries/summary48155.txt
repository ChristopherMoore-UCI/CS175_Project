Dallas Fire-Rescue Captain Johnny Bates said a chair caught on fire, KTVT reported. "One of our engine crews did enter the building but crew members with the AAC or concert put out the initial fire," Bates said, according to KTVT. CNN affiliate KTVT, citing attendees at the concert, said the fire apparently started from pyrotechnics that were part of the show. -- A fire broke out at a Rihanna concert in Dallas on Friday night, forcing the event to end early.
