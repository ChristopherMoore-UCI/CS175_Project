The letter submitted by Mexico makes no mention of granting Zelaya political asylum or any other legal status. -- A Mexican petition that would have granted deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya safe conduct out of the country was rejected by Honduran authorities because it did not meet legal standards, Honduran Government Minister Oscar Raul Matute told CNN en Español. Matute said the letter did not meet the necessary standards because it made no mention of under what legal status Mexico would accept Zelaya and his family. Rasel Tome, the Zelaya adviser who was named in the letter, said negotiators for Zelaya had spoken with presidents in several Latin American and Caribbean countries Wednesday, including Mexico. In an interview with CNN en Español, Zelaya said he is still the legitimate president of Honduras, and as such, would not ask for, or accept political asylum.
