Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman says the Turkish TV show "is being done with state sponsorship." Turkey has been Israel's strongest Muslim ally in the Middle East, and the move comes as relations between the countries have soured in recent days over the latter's decision to exclude Israel from scheduled military exercises. -- Israeli officials are seeking a meeting with Turkey's ambassador to protest a show on Turkish television that reportedly depicts Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian children. "Such a series which bears no connection whatsoever to reality, presenting IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers as murderers of innocent children, should not be broadcast even in hostile states -- and certainly not in a state that maintains full diplomatic relations with Israel," Lieberman said. Turkish lawmaker Suat Kiniklioglu, deputy chairman of the external affairs committee for the ruling Justice and Development Party, said that it isn't "state policy for Turkish television to portray Israel badly." It shows the painful stories of the people who lived on invaded Palestinian lands in 1948, especially women and children." Israel and Turkey have enjoyed close military and economic ties for more than a decade.
