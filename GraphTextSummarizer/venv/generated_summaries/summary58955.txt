Amnesty argues that Israel also limits access to water supplies by placing restrictions on the movement of people and goods, and by enacting "a complex system of permits which Palestinians must obtain from the Israeli army and other authorities in order to carry out water related projects" which effectively prevent the creation of needed water and sanitation projects. Amnesty's report made no conclusions about what amount or percentage of water should be made available to the Palestinians, but called on Israel to allow Palestinians "to access and extract an equitable share of water from the shared aquifers and surface water resources in the West Bank and Gaza." -- Israel is denying Palestinians access to adequate water supplies by controlling shared water resources, the human rights group Amnesty International said in a report released Tuesday. Amnesty's report notes the stark discrepancy in water use between Israelis and Palestinians, claiming that water consumption per capita for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza is about 70 liters (about 18 gallons) per day, while Israeli per capita use is 300 liters (79 gallons) per day. In the 100-page report, titled "Troubled Waters: Palestinians Denied Fair Access to Water," Amnesty says Israel restricts Palestinian access to water through various means while making it readily available to its own citizens.
