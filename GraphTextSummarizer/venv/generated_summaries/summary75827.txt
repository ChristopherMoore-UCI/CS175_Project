But if jurors decide to spare Sowell's life, the judge cannot impose a death sentence, said Greg Popovich, Cuyahoga County court administrator. During the sentencing phase, Sowell will be able to make a statement on his own behalf without being under oath or facing cross-examination from prosecutors, said Ryan Miday, a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office. -- An Ohio jury on Monday will begin the sentencing phase for convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell, ultimately deciding whether he should receive life in prison or the death penalty for killing 11 Cleveland-area women between 2007 and 2009. Many of Sowell's victims struggled with drug addiction at some point, and court records showed many resorted to stealing and prostitution to support their habits. At Sowell's trial, his defense rested without calling any witnesses or presenting any evidence, according to CNN affiliate WOIO.
