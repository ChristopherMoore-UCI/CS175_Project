-- Tensions between Turkey and Israel worsened Thursday when Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country would follow aid ships to Gaza trying to break the Israeli blockade. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since a raid on a Turkish ship carrying aid to Gaza last year when Israeli commandos killed eight Turks and one Turkish American. They took a turn for the worse when Israeli naval commandos intercepted the Turkish ship Mavi Marmara en route to breach the Israeli blockade of Gaza. It comes as Israeli officials said Turkey had expelled three diplomats from the Turkish capital of Ankara. A United Nations investigation into the incident found that the Israeli blockade of Gaza is a "legitimate security measure" in compliance with international law, but it said that Israel had used "excessive and unreasonable" force.
