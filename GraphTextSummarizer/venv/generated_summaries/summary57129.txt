Speaking at the Republican Governors Association annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, on Wednesday, Perry said "there's probably a very real possibility" that Texas could sue the White House if the administration takes executive action on immigration. President Barack Obama may have a phone and pen, but outgoing Gov. Rick Perry of Texas says he has the grounds for a lawsuit if he uses either. Perry will serve as until January, after which Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, also a Republican, will assume the governorship. Perry says that lawsuit would be in good hands with Abbott.
