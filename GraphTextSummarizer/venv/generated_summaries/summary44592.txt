By 2007, 100 million people were active on Peace Day and since then, Peace Day agreements by all parties to conflict in Afghanistan have resulted in the immunization against polio of 4.5 million children in areas hitherto unreachable or hard to reach due to conflict. On September 21 last year, Peace Day 2011, my organization, Peace One Day launched the 365-day countdown toward a global truce -- what we hope will be the largest reduction in global violence in recorded history, both domestically and internationally, and the biggest ever gathering of individuals in the name of peace. For Peace Day 2012, we are inviting all sectors of society to observe a day of Global Truce -- individuals in every country, at home, in schools, in the workplace, in our local communities, and those engaged in armed conflict on the international stage. By working together there will be Peace One Day. On Peace Day 2008, the U.N. Department for Safety and Security recorded a 70% reduction in violent incidents in Afghanistan.
