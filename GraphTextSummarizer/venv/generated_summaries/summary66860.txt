"The basic problem is we have lost leaders on both sides of the aisle, particularly at this point in history, on the other side of the aisle, who are more interested in governing than in posturing, more interested in problem solving than in partisanship," Clinton told an audience of business leaders at The Economic Club of Chicago on Wednesday night. -- Hillary Clinton lit into members of Congress on Wednesday night in Chicago, questioning their resolve to legislate as opposed to their desire to play politics. "I don't care what party you are, Democrats never did that to George W. Bush despite our deep differences with President Bush on taxes, on Iraq, on so many other things," Clinton said. Clinton, the former senator from New York and Democrats' presidential favorite, said this became clear for her during the 16-day partial government shutdown in 2013, when President Barack Obama had to cancel his trip to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia. "It is deeply distressing to me that we have people running for Congress, both House and Senate, who proudly go around their districts and their states proclaiming that you should send them to Washington because they will never compromise," Clinton said, pulling a line from previous speeches.
