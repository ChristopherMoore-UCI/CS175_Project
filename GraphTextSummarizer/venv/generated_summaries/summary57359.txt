Boko Haram has been running religious schools for years, but did not rise to national prominence until it attacked police stations and prisons two years ago. Radical Muslim sect Boko Haram, which aims to enforce a strict version of Sharia law, has claimed responsibility, said Reuben Abati, the government spokesman. " The group holds all government authority in contempt and wants to establish a Sharia state in northern Nigeria. He died in police custody. The attack targeted a building that housed 26 U.N. humanitarian and development agencies, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last week.
