The packaging features artwork by Boyd, who held his first solo art exhibit at Mr. Musichead Rock Art Gallery in Los Angeles last fall. Music draws from almost the identical place as art does, which really is that intangible -- it's like you're pulling from the ether. Oh, he also paints and makes music with his multiplatinum rock band, Incubus. CNN talked to Boyd about collaboration, the fulfillment of art and finding the perfect wave. Boyd: Painting and art are obviously in my focus, but I dream about getting a really big tube at the Bonsai Pipeline sometime in the near future.
