"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," a reboot of the 1960s TV series, stars Henry Cavill as an ace American secret agent in the 1960s. If the first peek of the haunted house horror flick is any indication, director Guillermo del Toro has a lot of frights up his sleeve for the film's October 16 release. If you're wondering where the comedy will be this summer, Amy Schumer makes her big screen debut on July 17 with "Trainwreck." The creepy trailer for "Crimson Peak" went viral after its Friday release, with two versions drawing close to 2 million views by Sunday. Another creepy trailer released last week is whetting moviegoers' appetite for horror.
