The movie, which premiered on March 2, 1965, went on to earn five Oscars -- including best picture -- and grossed more than $110 million in its initial run, equal to about $800 million in today's money. It even helped save 20th Century Fox two years after the studio's debacle with "Cleopatra." The Julie Andrews film, about the von Trapp family and its "problem" governess, Maria, is beloved enough to have spawned audience singalongs. The film even prompted a live NBC musical, which -- though it was roasted by critics -- still managed stupendous ratings. Fifty years after its premiere, "The Sound of Music" is still among millions of fans' favorite things.
