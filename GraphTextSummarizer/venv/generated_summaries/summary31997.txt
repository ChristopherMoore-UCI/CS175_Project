"Most American Catholic law schools were not formed to be elite institutions of lofty legal scholarship, but as way to respond to the fact that other law schools were excluding Catholics," said Richard Garnett, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School. Evangelical Protestant colleges, meanwhile -- including Regent University and Liberty University, founded by Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, respectively -- have opened law schools only since the 1980s. Today, Catholic law schools at Georgetown University, Fordham University, and Notre Dame are considered among the best in the country. And while Judaism and Catholicism have their own sets of religious laws that date back millennia, many branches of Protestant Christianity do not. Besides Stevens, who is Protestant, the current Supreme Court counts six Catholics and two Jews.
