-- David Haye says he would relish a fight against reigning World Boxing Council (WBC) champion Vitali Klitschko after beating fellow Briton Dereck Chisora at Upton Park football stadium in London on Saturday. Haye retired after losing to Vitali's brother, Vladimir on points in July 2011, but came out of retirement to fight Chisora after the British pair brawled at a press conference which followed Chisora's loss on points to Vitali in Munich last February. Former world heavyweight champion, Haye impressed on his return to the ring stopping Chisora in the 5th round of the much-hyped grudge match. The fight was a predictably lively affair, with Haye and Zimbabwe-born Chisora finally exchanging blows after trading a string of insults in the weeks leading up to the fight. Haye vs. Chisora?
