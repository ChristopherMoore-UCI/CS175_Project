-- As New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen accused former Sen. Scott Brown of "fear-mongering" on Ebola, Democrats strongly agreed, Republicans completely disagreed, and independent voters stayed neutral. Men and women both agreed when Brown criticized Shaheen for voting with Obama, but the genders diverged when Shaheen defended her support of the minimum wage, with women showing higher support. The highest volume of voting occurred after debate moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Brown whether he supports raising the minimum wage, and Brown referenced a time when he worked a minimum-wage job. "I still remember what the smell is." New Hampshire was represented well in the Pulse audience, with 63% of participants saying they are registered voters of the Granite State. Brown blasted President Barack Obama's handling of the Ebola outbreak, saying if Romney were leading the nation, he would have minimized the threat and would have had a "clear and concise plan."
