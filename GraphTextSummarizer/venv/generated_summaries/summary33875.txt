Aaron Cox never dropped Cara off at day care. A missing persons report was filed for Cara, and an arrest warrant was issued for Cox, who was charged with interference with child custody, the Sheriff's Office said. On Friday morning, U.S. authorities went to the remote area, arrested Cox and recovered Cara. He is waiting to be brought back to Volusia County on the interference with child custody charge. "The arrangement was that he would drop the child off at a day care, and then she would go to day care and pick the child up," said Brandon Haught, a public information officer for the Volusia County Sheriff's Office.
