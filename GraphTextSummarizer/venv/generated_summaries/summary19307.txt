Mexico state is bordered on the west by Michoacan and adjoins Mexico City on three sides -- north, east and west. On Sunday, Mexican President Felipe Calderon toured Valle de Chalco, another city in Mexico state on the eastern outskirts of the Mexico City metro area. In addition to Michoacan and Mexico states, unusually heavy rain in the past week also flooded parts of Mexico City, the nation's capital. The remaining 11 deaths resulted from a mudslide Saturday near the small town of Temascaltepec in neighboring Mexico state. The death toll from heavy floods and mudslides in Mexico increased Tuesday to 41, a government agency announced.
