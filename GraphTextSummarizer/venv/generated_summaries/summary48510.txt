"Someone on Reddit asked what it was like for me to train in hotel gyms or other unfamiliar gyms on the road," Schwarzenegger posted. " Schwarzenegger said he enjoys working out in unfamiliar gyms, even if sometimes he'd prefer to be at home. The actor trains every day for at least an hour to be in shape for movies like "Escape Plan," which releases in theaters tonight. "Based on the looks I've been getting in the hotel gym, people think something is seriously wrong with donkey raises," Schwarzenegger posted on Reddit earlier this month, referring to calf exercises that involve bending forward and lifting and lowering your heels. Fair warning to fans in New Orleans, where Schwarzenegger is filming "Maggie": The actor said he welcomes people who want to say hello to him while he's resting between sets, but "don't slow me down while I'm working."
