For his new film "African Cats," Scholey led a film crew documenting the lives of individual lions and cheetahs over the course of two and a half years. "A movie like this is a celebration of other lives that I hope will get people thinking, so when they next hear that tigers, lions, cheetahs, elephants, rhino are under threat, they do something about it." Explained specialist photographer Simon King: "It's their -- sometimes false -- sense of confidence, in everything. If they managed to find them, the crew would then follow their adventures through the 1510-square-kilometer reserve, one of the few remaining places where the three big African cats -- lions, cheetahs and leopards -- live in large numbers and in close proximity. Cheetahs, the world's fastest land animals, are endangered, while lions are classified as vulnerable.
