Party leader Tsipras made a radical speech last week against austerity. Papoulias called together the leaders of the three biggest parties Sunday, a week after indecisive elections and three failed attempts to form a government raised the possibility of new elections in the debt-stricken country. The talks with Papoulias came a week after elections in which angry voters punished mainstream parties by backing a range of fringe groups. Polls suggest that Syriza, which came second in voting last week, would come first if another round of elections is held. The president will hold talks with the leaders of smaller parties later in the day.
