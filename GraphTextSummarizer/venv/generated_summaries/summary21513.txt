Today, old neon signs are popular with many New Yorkers for their ability to evoke another era and most of all for their association with stalwart old independent neighborhood businesses. After the War, storefront signs in New York tended to become less inventive, while signs for Route 66-type motels and drive-ins became more flamboyant. Very sadly, old neon signs in New York are disappearing because many of the veteran businesses they advertise have had a hard time keeping up with the way the city has reinvented itself in the past 20 years. While neon signs are not unique to New York, at one point they proliferated in tens of thousands of storefronts throughout the city. Is there a time that one could consider the height of neon signs in New York?
