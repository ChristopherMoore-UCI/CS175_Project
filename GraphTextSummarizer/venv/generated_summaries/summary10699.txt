The trooper checked the vehicle tag on the car and it matched the tag being sought by Oklahoma police, Mangrum said. Durcho was driving because the trooper suspected a drunk driver, according to Erin Mangrum of the Canadian County, Oklahoma, sheriff's office. Officers found the bodies of Summer Rust, 25, and her children Monday in their apartment in El Reno, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City. CNN affilate KOCO reported that Durcho had been spotted Monday night in Clinton, Oklahoma. Mangrum said Durcho's car sped off, but he later wrecked the vehicle, and Durcho was taken into custody.
