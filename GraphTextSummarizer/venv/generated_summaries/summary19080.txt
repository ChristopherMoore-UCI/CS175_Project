The chase began in southeast Phoenix at about 5:15 a.m. and wound up on the city's west side, said Robert Bailey, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety. "The truck arrived into the U.S. just this morning from Mexico," said James Holmes, spokesman for the Phoenix Police Department. Meanwhile, the truck also happened to pull up next to another Department of Public Safety officer and took off again, using surface streets for a while and getting on and off the interstate, nearly running over a motorcycle officer, Holmes said. The truck pulled over, then took off as a Department of Public Safety officer approached. Authorities attempted to stop the truck after officers saw it tailgating other motorists on Interstate 10 westbound, Holmes said.
