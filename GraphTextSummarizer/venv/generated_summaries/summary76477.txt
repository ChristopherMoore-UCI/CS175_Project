Oniyama-Jigoku (Demon Mountain Hell) Also known as "Crocodile Hell," Oniyama is home to around 80 of the creatures, as well as alligators slithering around in murky water pouring in from a salt spring. Beppu, in central Oita prefecture, is home to more than 2,500 onsen -- hot springs. It's the world's second largest source of thermal spring water after Yellowstone National Park in the United States. At a fiendish 150 C, Tatsumaki also has the hottest water of all the hells and emits hot sulfurous gases. There are -- less hot -- hand and foot baths, drinking water at 80 C and jigoku-mushi: Vegetables and hard-boiled eggs cooked in the boiling water and steam.
