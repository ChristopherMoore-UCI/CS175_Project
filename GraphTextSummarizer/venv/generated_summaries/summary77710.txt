" Lee and his staff offer young Chinese entrepreneurs, engineers and project managers financial support and guidance to help them build companies and launch products for China's 400 million Internet users and 700 million mobile subscribers. That furor raised Lee's international profile, but the 48-year-old is now fully focused on the future, hoping to inject a new spirit of innovation into Chinese business with his investment and incubation company Innovation Works. Lee is the former president of Google in China who left the Internet search giant last Fall just months before the company's high profile scuffle with the Chinese government over censorship rules and alleged hacker attacks. "People expect Innovation Works to be magical," said Lee during an interview with CNN in June at his company's offices, located just across the street from Google's China headquarters. "An early stage entrepreneur who wants to build up companies will face a lot of trouble in China," Lee told reporters.
