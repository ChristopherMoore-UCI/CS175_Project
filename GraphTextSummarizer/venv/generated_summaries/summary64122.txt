-- Evangeline Lilly is in three of the highest-profile movies of the last few years: the last two "Hobbit" movies (the final one out this week), and next year's Marvel extravaganza "Ant-Man." When I started to work on "Ant-Man," it was a return to being an actor for a little while. Despite all this, Lilly's heart is really in writing. I thought that writing would be that. Lilly: I've been astounded to discover how good to their teams and crew that Marvel are.
