-- The latest celebrity breakup is a surprising one: Folk singer Jewel and her husband Ty Murray are going their separate ways. Jewel made the announcement herself on her blog on July 2, explaining that she and Murray, whom she calls her "husband, friend and partner of 16 years," preferred for the world to hear about their impending divorce directly. "Due to the spirit in which we have gone about this separation, we trust we can remain dear friends who hold each other in high esteem, which is so important to us as parents, as we wish only what is best for our son." "We have no desire to damage ourselves and each other in the process ... while we learn to redraw ourselves in whatever new shape we find as separate people who are still striving to be the best versions of ourselves- as humans and as parents." "Ty and I have always tried to live the most authentic life possible, and we wanted our separation as husband and wife to be nothing less loving than the way we came together," Jewel writes.
