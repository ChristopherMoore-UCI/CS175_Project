"We will have high-resolution images where we will actually peer into the center of what is going on in galaxies," van Haarlem said. Currently, that honor is held by the Very Large Array (VLA) in New Mexico, says Alastair Edge, from Durham University -- a leading UK center for astronomical research. "It will have a deep impact on the way we perceive our place in the universe and how we understand its history and its future," says Michiel van Haarlem, interim director general of the SKA project. "If it only tells us when the first stars and galaxies formed then it would have already contributed a huge amount to our understanding." Alastair Edge agrees. It's going to be very exciting," van Haarlem said.
