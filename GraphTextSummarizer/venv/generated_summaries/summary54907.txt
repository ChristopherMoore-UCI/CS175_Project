-- An Iranian judge has sentenced a man accused of stealing chocolate and cocoa from a candy shop to have his hand cut off, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported Saturday. In addition to the amputation sentence, the man was ordered to spend six months in prison for destruction of property and an additional six months for resisting arrest, according to Fars. "After the man was taken to a police station, a report of a robber at a candy store was received by police," Fars said. Such an amputation sentence is often handed down to habitual thieves in Iran who have prior convictions for theft and robbery. During the arrest, police recovered cash as well as chocolates and cocoa.
