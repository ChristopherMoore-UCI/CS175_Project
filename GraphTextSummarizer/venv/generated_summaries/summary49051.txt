Talk to school teachers and administrators and they will tell you that students as young as middle school are engaging in oral sex, and there is the belief that that really doesn't count as sex. I recall as an elementary student, as well as in middle school and high school, taking classes that dealt with sex. How in the world do we say it's OK for schools to teach our children about math, science, history, and numerous other subjects, yet then get high and mighty with righteous indignation when biology is taken a step further to focus on sex? I have nine nieces and four nephews, and I would be fully supportive of them being taught about sex education in school. The city of New York should be commended for not bowing to the blowhards and confronting the reality of sex in America by mandating a sex education curriculum beginning in 2012.
