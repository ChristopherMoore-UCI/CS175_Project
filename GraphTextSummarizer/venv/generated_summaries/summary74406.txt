Coke, 42, ran a Jamaica-based criminal organization called the Presidential Click, or Shower Posse, which had trafficked illegal weapons and drugs into New York and Miami, and to other Jamaica-area leaders, since the early 1990s, according to a release by prosecuting District Attorney Preet Bharara for the Southern District of New York. "For nearly two decades, Christopher Coke led a ruthless criminal enterprise that used fear, force and intimidation to support its drug and arms trafficking 'businesses,'" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara of Manhattan said at Wednesday's hearing, according to the release. Coke's group of Presidential Click members trafficked in narcotics, including marijuana, cocaine and crack cocaine, under Coke's direction, according to the formal charges Bharara presented at court. -- Christopher Coke, an international drug kingpin whose arrest and extradition to the United States was preceded by a horrific gun battle in Jamaica that left dozens of civilians dead, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to racketeering and assault charges. Coke, who had pleaded not guilty to the charges after his extradition last year, faces a maximum sentence of 23 years in prison with a maximum fine of $500,000 for two charges of racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to commit assault in aid of racketeering, according to the release.
