So with the help of friends and family, it has been moved to Saturday, not in a banquet hall, but in the family's backyard "because it may make Logan uncomfortable" to be in strange surroundings with so much noise. Life started to feel normal for Logan's family, but Christine's gut feeling returned when she saw Logan acting strange again. Just after Logan's first birthday, Christine noticed that he wasn't feeling well again, and his lips and fingernails had turned white. Christine says Logan shocked doctors at the Pittsburgh children's hospital. Sean and Christine learned more devastating news shortly after: Logan has a genetic disorder called Fanconi anemia, which most frequently results in death, most commonly from cancer, between the ages of 25 and 30.
