-- Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya returned Monday to the capital city of Honduras, where he said he is planning to meet with his critics to arrange for his return to power. The United States also said it was terminating all non-humanitarian aid to Honduras in a bid to pressure the interim government to end the political turmoil and accept the terms of the San Jose Accord, which was brokered by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias. At the United Nations, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Costa Rican President Oscar Arias expressed hope that Zelaya's return could break the impasse with the Micheletti government and restore the ousted leader to office. "Now that President Zelaya is back it would be opportune to restore him to his position under appropriate circumstances -- get on with the election that is currently scheduled for November, have a peaceful transition of presidential authority and get Honduras back to constitutional and democratic order," Clinton said. He said the de facto government "should make themselves responsible for the security of President Zelaya and of the Brazilian Embassy.
