The species has been pushed to the brink of extinction by farmers protecting their livestock and hunters who sell its fur and body parts, which are prized by some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. -- A trio of rare Snow Leopard cubs have made their public debut at a zoo in Switzerland this week. Mayhan, the cubs' mother, was paired with father Pator in 2009 as part of a Europe-wide zoo breeding program. Snow leopards are usually found in the Himalayan ranges of central Asia at altitudes of up to 6,000 meters. The as yet unnamed triplets, born in Basel Zoo eight weeks ago, were displayed on Wednesday with their proud parents.
