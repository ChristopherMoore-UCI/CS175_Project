Saturday's other game saw the mid-table clash between Torino and Sampdoria finish goalless. -- Napoli moved level on points with Juventus at the top of Serie A with a 2-0 against Catania at Stadio San Paolo on Saturday. "AS Roma wishes to announce that Mr Zdenek Zeman has been relieved of his duties as first-team coach," said a statement released on the club's official website Saturday. The 65-year-old rejoined Roma last summer -- he coached the Giallorossi between 1997 and 1999 -- but the team has struggled in recent weeks and currently lie 8th in Serie A, nine points behind locals rivals Lazio and without a win so far in 2013. Roma, who crashed to a 4-2 defeat at home to Cagliari on Friday, have sacked coach Zdenek Zeman.
