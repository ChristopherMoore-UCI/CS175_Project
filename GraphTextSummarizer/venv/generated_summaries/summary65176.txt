" Jonn Lilyea, one of the founders of the military blog "This Ain't Hell," wrote that he thinks it was an "ill-considered decision." Lilyea, a former sergeant who fought in Desert Storm, wrote that he is opposed to women in combat units, not because women are a distraction but because he thinks the Army and other services will be required to accept more women than are qualified or can be trained.

" U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii Democrat who served with her state's National Guard in Iraq, said the move is a "major step that is long overdue."

Gabbard was asked whether the move is merely semantics because front lines are constantly shifting and disappearing in today's world, and women already have been in combat situations. Rep. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, has said he doesn't think women are physically capable of combat duty.
