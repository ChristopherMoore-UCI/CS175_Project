Each tent is adorned with a name relating to the movement, such as "Freedom House" and "Foreign Force HQ." Nicholas Watmough, 26, followed the Hong Kong protests from his hometown of Manchester, England, and recently extended his visit at the hotel. Thompson says he has also hosted guests from mainland China, but only after they sent him messages saying they opposed Communist rule. Until then, pro-democracy supporters can continue reliving the protests in a tiny Causeway Bay apartment - having their own movement against Hong Kong's Chief Executive CY Leung, one flush at a time. "I feel Hong Kong is a kind of bubble of freedom and human rights in China," he says, which is why he found the 11-week-long, pro-democracy demonstrations so inspirational. "I literally got the keys and then the next day I went down to Admiralty (the main protest site) and the police were coming and I just grabbed as much as I could," says Thompson.
