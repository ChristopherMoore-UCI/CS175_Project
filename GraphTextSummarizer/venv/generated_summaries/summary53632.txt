-- Candidate Abdullah Abdullah on Wednesday demanded an immediate halt to the counting of ballots in Afghanistan's presidential runoff election, alleging widespread fraud. In a live news conference on Tolo TV, Abdullah said his campaign was suspending "engagement with the (election) commission" and recalling his party monitors from election commission offices. Fraud is taking place in every corner of the country and hurting the Afghan people." -- "Counting process should be stopped because this process is not transparent at all. " Saturday's runoff between Abdullah, the nation's former foreign minister, and former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani was marred by violence. Although once an ally of outgoing President Hamid Karzai, Abdullah has in recent years become an opponent and vocal critic of the Taliban.
