Decades ago, the existentialist philosophers brooded about life's meaninglessness; Alda wanted to find some meaning. "As a lot of people do who are given a second chance at life, I find myself thinking about things like this," he says in a phone interview from New York. He pays tribute to a number of people in the book, from his father -- a well-known stage actor -- to such figures as actor Ossie Davis, scientist Richard Feynman (whom Alda portrayed on stage) and manager Martin Bregman. Alan Alda rummages through his life in his new book, "Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself." So, in the spirit of the examined life, Alda has put his thoughts -- derived from commencement speeches, advice and life experiences -- into a book: "Things I Overheard While Talking to Myself" (Random House). There are also the pitfalls of celebrity itself, the blurring of boundaries between public roles and private life.
