Born into the hugely wealthy Rothschild banking dynasty and married to a French diplomat, the baroness, known as Nica, gave up a world of privilege for the love of jazz and devoted herself to Monk, who was considered one of America's great musical geniuses. To explore Nica's elusive past, Hannah Rothschild tells her great aunt's mysterious life story in her book, "The Baroness: The Search for Nica, the rebellious Rothschild". YouTube video of Thelonius Monk performing "Round Midnight" After hearing that record, the baroness' life changed forever, recalls Rothschild. In Monk's last years, he suffered from mental health problems and withdrew from playing jazz altogether by secluding himself in Nica's New Jersey home. That record was "Round Midnight," by a relatively unknown jazz pianist Thelonious Monk and hearing it would herald the start of a life-long friendship between him and heiress Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter.
