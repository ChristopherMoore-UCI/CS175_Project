"We were waiting 16 or 17 years to see it in 3D." The problem of 3D screens has been solved by digital cinema, and although the roll out of 3D-enabled cinemas has been dealt a blow by the economic downturn, exhibitors are continuing to install screens all over the world. The audience donned 3D glasses as they attended the premiere of Pixar's "Up," an animation in 3D, which marked the start of world's most prestigious film festival. Lasseter who co-founded the legendary animation studio behind animations "Toy Story' (1995), and "Monsters Inc." (2001), is one of many high profile 3D advocates. The festival's surprise choice, in the wake of the recent success of 3D pictures "Coraline" and DreamWorks' "Monsters vs. Aliens" earlier this year, is perhaps the boldest message yet that 3D is being embraced by the mainstream as the format of the future. "All of our films from now on will be made in 3D both at Pixar and at the Disney Animation Studios as well," he said.
