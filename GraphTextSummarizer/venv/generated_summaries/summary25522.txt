The bill creates mandatory life sentences for anyone who murders certain first responders, a provision that comes after two firefighters were killed in an ambush as they battled a blaze in upstate New York. That 1999 law grants New York judges the authority to require residents to undergo psychiatric treatment if they meet certain criteria. Lawmakers in at least 10 other states are reviewing some form of new gun regulations in the new year. It remains unclear what effect the measures will have on New York's already stringent approach to gun control. "The changes in New York are largely cosmetic," said CNN legal analyst Paul Callan, who described existing regulations as "the toughest gun laws in the United States."
