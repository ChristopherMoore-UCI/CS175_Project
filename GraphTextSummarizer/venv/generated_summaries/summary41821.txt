The bitter cold has turned Niagara Falls into a static ice-capade and nipped at orange crops in the Sunshine state. Last week, cops in Merrimack, New Hampshire -- fed up with the snow their region has gotten this winter -- put out an arrest warrant for the prognosticating groundhog Punxsutawney Phil. Two years ago, Phil was indicted for lying when winter continued longer than he predicted. "He told several people that Winter would last 6 more weeks, however he failed to disclose that it would consist of mountains of snow!" Frozen sums up the misery in the country's eastern half from Illinois to mid-Florida.
