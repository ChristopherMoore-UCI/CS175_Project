"Brown stated that he was being chased by paparazzi, causing him to lose control of his vehicle," police said in a statement. Last year, a Los Angeles city councilman predicted such a tragedy after witnessing a high-speed chase of Bieber by paparazzi. -- Singer Chris Brown totaled his car while being "ruthlessly pursued by paparazzi," his representative said. Councilman Dennis Zine said the high-speed chase, which he estimated went for 15 miles, ended when a California Highway Patrol officer stopped Bieber and cited him for speeding. The crash follows a spate of vehicular incidents involving celebrities and paparazzi.
