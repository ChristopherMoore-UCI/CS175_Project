" Holmes is freshly returned from a three-day trip to Sri Lanka where he met with government officials and war refugees to reassess that government's efforts towards resettling the estimated 280,000 civilians that have been held in internment camps there since the final stages of Sri Lanka's civil war. -- Nearly 150,000 refugees from Sri Lanka's civil war remain detained in Sri Lankan government internment camps, according to the United Nations' chief humanitarian affairs official, John Holmes. Holmes anticipated that "those needs will continue for at least six months," adding that humanitarian organizations on the ground in Sri Lanka believe a residual caseload of 20,000 to 30,000 refugees will remain homeless in January. Since October 2008, the Sri Lankan government has used internment camps to detain nearly 300,000 civilians during its civil war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. While the Sri Lankan government justified its use of the camps as a way to protect civilians from landmines and Tamil separatists, its continued use of the camps after the end of the war in May have led some to accuse Sri Lanka of violating international humanitarian rights law.
