In areas under ISIS control, women are required to observe strict clothing rules and are not allowed to leave the house without a male relative. Is it any wonder then that women in Iraq and Syria have moved to the forefront of the war against ISIS? Inside Mosul, women organized resistance against ISIS' oppressive rule. U.N. investigators interviewed witnesses, who told of women taken captive by ISIS, sexually abused and handed to slave traders. Just when it seemed ISIS could not be more offensive and threatening, it has provided everyone, especially, women even more reasons to fight back.
