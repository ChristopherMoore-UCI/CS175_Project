Mashable.com: Facebook to help users burned by Profile-to-Page migration Tagged photos will appear in the Photos tab of a Page, rather than on that Page's Wall, and anyone can tag a Page -- even if a user hasn't "Liked" it. Page admins can also nix photos from the tab by going into Edit Page > Posting Options > and unchecking "Users can add photos." Starting Wednesday (although the feature does not appear to be live yet), users will be able to tag Pages for Brands & Products as well as People (more options coming soon) in their Facebook photos. Well, now you can, as the social network has added the ability to tag Pages in Facebook photos. For those who concerned about their privacy, Facebook assures us that privacy settings will still apply; if your photos are visible to everyone, everyone will be able to see the tagged snap, and if your photos are set to "only friends," only friends will be able to check out that pic of you standing in front of the local Rite Aid.
