Tseng clinched her second major title this season with a solid six-foot putt for par, which Hull could only match, for a winning total of 11-under-par of 277. Neither player could beat par in the last five holes, with Tseng's last birdie of the day coming on the par-five sixth. American veteran Cristie Kerr finished equal fifth after South Korean duo Amy Yang and Hee-Kyung Seo closed with birdies to join her on 282. Her ambitious long drive into the first fairway bunker at the par-five 18th gave Katherine Hull -- Tseng's fellow first-round leader -- the chance to take the tournament to a playoff. -- Taiwanese golfer Yani Tseng became the youngest woman to win three major trophies after claiming a tense one-shot victory at the British Open in England on Sunday.
