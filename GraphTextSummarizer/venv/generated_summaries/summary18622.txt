All-time chart records are handed to vacuous acts such as the Black Eyed Peas and singing awards are given to vocal lightweights such as Taylor Swift. That's what I was thinking as I was watching her performance during Sunday's American Music Awards. Gaga and Adele are worthy of the accolades, but whenever I listen to Pink's "Dear Mr. President," "Family Portrait" or "Sober," I feel the need to atone for us not making more room for her in the pop culture paradigm. But thank God for Pink. You've gotta get up and try try try Singing words like that live with the right level of emotion that Pink is known for is hard enough.
