The 27-year-old Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, was found dead less than a mile from Hernandez's expansive home in North Attleborough. The Boston Globe reported that surveillance images recorded early Monday morning -- hours before Odin's death -- appeared to show Hernandez and Lloyd together on a Boston street. "It has been widely reported in the media that the state police have searched the home of our client, Aaron Hernandez, as part of an ongoing investigation," attorney Michael Fee said earlier this week. A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation said Lloyd was shot to death. -- Authorities searched the home of New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez on Saturday for the second time since a man was found dead a half mile away.
