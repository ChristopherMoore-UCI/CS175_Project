Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS, said in a statement on Monday, "I'm so pleased that millions of viewers have returned to 'Downton Abbey' on their local PBS stations for what has become a post-holiday tradition." Rebecca Eaton, the executive producer of "Masterpiece," added, "Julian Fellowes has written every word of all four seasons of 'Downton,' and I toss him a huge bouquet on behalf of his American fans." The premiere ratings suggest "Downton" could grow to be even more popular as the season progresses. According to Nielsen data, at least 10.2 million viewers tuned in live (or within a few hours via digital video recorders) on Sunday night, up from 7.9 million at the start of season three and 8.2 million at the end of it. PBS isn't rated like a traditional network because it doesn't carry traditional commercials. Season four, of course, debuted several months ago in the United Kingdom. The "Downton Abbey" phenomenon just keeps getting bigger.
