Washington's Metropolitan Police Department has also "increased security levels and visibility, so the public should expect to see an enhanced presence" of officers in light of the Canada and New York attacks, spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump told CNN. The Ottawa gunman had "connections" to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday. New York put its officers on alert after Thursday's attack, urging them to "maintain a heightened level of awareness against random attacks," several law enforcement officials said. When asked if the unprovoked attack was tied to terrorism or to recent calls by radicals to attack military and police officers, Bratton said, "there is nothing we know as of this time that would indicate that were the case," and a senior law enforcement official told CNN on Friday that investigators do not believe that Thompson, a Muslim convert, was driven by any radical Islamic views. A man charged at four New York police officers with a metal hatchet Thursday, hitting two of them at a time of high alert for authorities concerned they might be targeted in the United States and Canada.
