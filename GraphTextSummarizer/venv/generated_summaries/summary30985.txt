Traditional games face new competition from developers who engineer video games for phones and distribute them for free online. The software maker said it will release technology that lets people play video games by moving their bodies instead of clicking hand-held controllers. The system also recognizes faces, which lets it log players into games automatically. The company announced partnerships with the social-networking sites Facebook and Twitter that will allow Xbox LIVE players to post messages about their gaming experiences and send screen shots to their friends in real-time. Hollywood director Steven Spielberg was on hand for the event and said Natal will help reach new audiences who may be daunted by complicated joysticks and controllers.
