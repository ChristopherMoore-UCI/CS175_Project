Google only re-released an iOS version of its Maps app in December, which could continue to fight back and possibly overtake Facebook in 2013. Google's app with the most engagement was Gmail, but in total 10% of users' time was spent across various Google apps. Facebook may have the No. 1 spot locked up, but Google apps account for the next five most popular apps. People aren't just opening their Facebook app the most, they're spending astonishingly large chunks of time in the app, poking around and reading up on their friends. The social network's app was the single largest, single app time suck, accounting for 23% of the time people spend using mobile apps, according to comScore.
