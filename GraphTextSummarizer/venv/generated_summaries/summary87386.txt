No one from the military or the law enforcement agencies was among those hurt; names of the victims had not been released as of late Thursday afternoon. Fifteen people were in the truck, with 10 crammed inside the cab and five under a tarp in the truck's bed, said John Gagne, spokesman for Naval Air Station Kingsville. The crash occurred late Wednesday when the extended-cab pickup sped past an officer at the main gate at the base, south of Corpus Christi, Gagne told CNN. Earlier, Gagne said that U.S. Border Patrol personnel were involved in the chase, but that was incorrect. Kingsville Police Chief Ricardo Torres referred all questions to the state Department of Public Safety, which is investigating the incident, along with ICE's Homeland Security Investigations and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.
