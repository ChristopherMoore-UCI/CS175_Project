In addition to Wahlberg and MacFarlane (who voices Ted), the film stars Amanda Seyfried and Morgan Freeman. This time around, the stuffed animal is getting married, trying to legally prove that he's human and attempting to have a baby via a sperm donation from his best friend, played by Mark Wahlberg. The trailer for "Ted 2" came out Thursday, and it's everything you probably imagined. "Ted 2" will be in theaters June 26. The trailer is deemed appropriate for "approved audiences" and is definitely not for those who are adverse to butt crack humor.
