New year, new Rooney as United stay top Former England striker Emile Heskey put Villa ahead two minutes after the break with a powerful header from Stewart Downing's cross, but Chelsea's relentless pressure finally told in the 84th minute when Didier Drogba fired home a low shot after the visitors could not clear his clever chest-down to Malouda. Carlo Ancelotti's team had fought back to lead 3-2 with two goals in the last 10 minutes, but poor defending allowed young Villa fullback Ciaran Clark to equalize with a free header in the second minute of time added on. That sparked scenes of jubilation and relief on the Chelsea bench, but Villa left Ancelotti's future in some doubt when the 21-year-old Clark stole into the penalty area unmarked to head home a teasing cross from substitute Marc Albrighton. The influential midfielder netted a penalty after James Collins was punished for a clumsy shove from behind on Florent Malouda, but Villa equalized four minutes before halftime when Ashley Young smashed home another spotkick following Michael Essien's foul on Nigel Reo-Coker. -- Chelsea's chances of retaining the English Premier League title suffered another setback on Sunday as struggling Aston Villa snatched a last-gasp 3-3 draw in London.
