In May, Democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi and 33 other newly elected members of her National League for Democracy party took their seats in parliament, a leap in the country's progress toward democracy. The government has also pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, begun negotiations with ethnic rebel groups and embarked on a series of economic reforms. First Vice President U Tin Aung Myint Oo submitted his resignation July 1. According to the law, a new vice president will be chosen by the 25% of parliament that is made up of members of the military, because the position is a quota reserved for them. Those steps have been welcomed by the United States, the European Union and other governments, who have responded by easing sanctions against Myanmar, also known as Burma.
