During torrential rain it's easy to imagine how hard life can be for villagers as dirt roads become muddy streams and people shelter in simple wooden buildings. Around 50,000 members of the Lisu tribe live in Thailand, many in isolated village communities  near the border with Laos and Myanmar. "We have a simple happy life," explains the youthful-looking head of the village of Ban Man Pa. Where once opium was grown, cash crops like rice and corn are now harvested, providing a simple way of life for members of one of Thailand's most remote tribal groups. With their distinctive, colorful headwear, Lisu women stand out from the lush green fields of northern Thailand.
