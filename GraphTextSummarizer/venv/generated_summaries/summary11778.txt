Egypt has suffered from sporadic violence since the July 3 military coup that removed President Mohamed Morsy from power on the heels of mass protests against his rule. Ashton, who has previously criticized Morsy's forced ouster, said in an earlier interview with CNN that Egyptian officials should release political prisoners and that all sides should rein in violence. " Muslim Brotherhood officials said on the group's website that they will continue protesting until Morsy is restored to office.
