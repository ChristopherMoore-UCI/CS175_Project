Thom leaves behind her nephew, her sister Susan Thom Loubet, her niece-in-law Mariko Silver, and her grand-niece Kumi Silver Loubet. "Mary was and will always be our moral compass and steady heart," said the center's co-founders Robin Morgan, Gloria Steinem and Jane Fonda in a statement. -- Journalist Mary Thom, a prominent feminist who was an editor of Ms. magazine in its early years, has died. The nephew's account was conveyed to CNN by Women's Media Center spokeswoman Cristal Chancellor. "Wherever her friends and colleagues gather, we will always ask the guiding question: What would Mary do?" Thom had picked up her 1996 Honda Magna 750 from winter storage when she veered into traffic upon entering a highway in Yonkers, north of New York City.
