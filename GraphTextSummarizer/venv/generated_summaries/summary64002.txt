Sligar, who acknowledged having detailed her activities in a journal, said she obtained a cell phone with a non-local phone number so McClain could call her without raising suspicion and admitted she gave him contraband that included photographs with explicit sexual poses, the plea agreement added. That summer, they initiated a sexual relationship that included 10 to 20 sessions of oral sex and sexual intercourse, ending in October 2007, it said. After serving her sentence, she will serve five years of supervised release and must register as a sex offender, spokesman Jeff Dorschner said in a news release. She was indicted in July by a federal grand jury in Denver and pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in October. Janine Sligar, 47, of Wray, Colorado, was sentenced Thursday for sexual abuse of a ward.
