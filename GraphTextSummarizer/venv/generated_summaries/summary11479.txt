she has been bad-mouthing me and spreading rumors and lies about me to substantiate this Guardianship proceeding," the mother said in documents filed last week in Los Angeles Superior Court. Guardianship with Gray was necessary to protect Winter from further abuse, lawyer Michael Kretzmer said in the document. A lawyer filed a petition on behalf of Gray on October 3, alleging Winter was the victim of ongoing physical abuse, insults about her weight, deprivation of food and attempts to "sexualize" the minor. Last month, a Los Angeles judge ordered the young actress to be placed in temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray. -- The mother of "Modern Family" star Ariel Winter denied allegations that she abused the 14-year-old actress and said the allegations stem from the young actress wanting to continue to date an 18-year-old man.
