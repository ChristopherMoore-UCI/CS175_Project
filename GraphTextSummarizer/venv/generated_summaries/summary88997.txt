One of the last movies, which I haven't seen in 15 or 20 years, that was about Abraham Lincoln was in the '30s, with Henry Fonda — "Young Mr. Lincoln." Rick Stengel: Abraham Lincoln is in many ways the most compelling figure in U.S. history, yet the popular culture around him in terms of movies has been pretty minimal. In [Doris Kearns Goodwin's] book "Team of Rivals," what precedes our story is two years of Mary shunning the whole family and spending time holding séances and trying to reach out and communicate across the thin veil to Willie. He had lost [his 11-year-old son] Willie two years ago to typhoid fever. Mary spent years mourning the loss of Willie.
