The FBI's website defines serial killers as "three or more killings ... having common characteristics such as to suggest the reasonable possibility that the crimes were committed by the same actor or actors." However, Paul Callan, a former deputy chief in the Brooklyn district attorney's office who helped prosecute the "Son of Sam" case in the '70s agrees with the NYPD's hesitation to label the three shopkeepers' deaths as serial killings at this stage. "The same gun was used in all three murders," said Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. "That doesn't say it's the same person who fired the gun, but that's the working premise, that it's the same shooter," Browne told CNN. "There's nothing to suggest a bias," Browne told CNN.
