-- A suspected leader of Mexico's Gulf Cartel has been arrested near the U.S. border, a Mexican official said Sunday. His arrest was the most significant blow to drug trafficking in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December. In September, they arrested Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, the then-reputed boss of the powerful Gulf Cartel. The Zetas started out as the enforcement arm of Mexico's Gulf Cartel, but later split off and formed their own drug-trafficking organization. Authorities nabbed Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, one of Mexico's most wanted drug lords, last month.
