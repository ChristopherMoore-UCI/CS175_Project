â€¢ April 11, 2006 -- Ahmadinejad declares that Iran has joined the list of countries with nuclear technology, confirming the production of low-grade enriched uranium at a level sufficient to power nuclear power plants. The United States announces concerns that Iran's nuclear energy program could lead to the development of nuclear weapons. Amid U.S. claims that Iran seeks to produce nuclear weapons, the IAEA's director general visits Iran and encourages its leaders to allow inspectors more and faster access to its nuclear sites. Iran's supreme leader issues a religious decree against manufacturing, storing or using nuclear weapons. Iran test-fires short- and long-range missiles, raising fears that the country could deliver nuclear weapons atop such missiles.
