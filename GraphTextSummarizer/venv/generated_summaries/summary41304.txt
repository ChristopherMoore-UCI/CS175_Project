The two Sallys are debating whether Sen. Elizabeth Warren should respond to the calls from the Boston Globe and others for her to enter the 2016 race, challenging likely frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Sally I. Kohn:  Ah, and that's reason two why Warren should run -- because even if she can't win, she will help shape the political debate and push Hillary Clinton to the left, especially around economic justice issues. And in a different poll, Democratic primary voters in Iowa and in New Hampshire favored Warren over Clinton, so.... Sally P. Kohn:  In fairness, that poll was run by Warren backers. Sally P. Kohn:  Yeah, but in the latest CNN Democratic primary poll, Warren trails Hillary Clinton by 52 points. Now is our nation's moment, crawling out of the economic crisis, still riddled with unprecedented economic inequality, we don't need Elizabeth Warren to be president in four years or eight years or 16.
