Check back next week for full box office coverage of "Man of Steel" and "This is the End." Many assumed that the weekend before the debut of "Man of Steel" would be a calm one at the box office, but that was not the case. While "The Internship" did exceed Fox's modest expectations, its mild $5,377 per theater average and the looming competitor "This is the End" may hurt its box office longevity. Another Universal film held strong in second place. "Before Midnight"'s robust $11,243 per theater average trailed only one other film in the Top 20: "The Purge," which had a sizzling $14,353 average at its 2,536 locations.
