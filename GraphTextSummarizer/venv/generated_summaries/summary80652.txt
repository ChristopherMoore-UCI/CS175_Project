The same unpredictability that causes people to riot at an event celebrating Gandhi or Martin Luther King Jr. -- the same mob mentality that sends fans crashing and burning all in their paths after their favorite team has triumphed in some distinguished competition -- is the same uncontrollable factor that leads to much of the racial abuse. The passion of this sport has been known to halt armed conflicts and to unite rivals, all for the good of the "Beautiful Game." It is because of all these things, and more, that the "Beautiful Game" deserves to be respected, preserved and immortalized. The hallowed sanctums of the "Beautiful Game" will survive because it is the "Beautiful Game." Perhaps it is symptomatic of modern society that despite the diversity of practitioners and the potpourri of fans, the ugliness of racism seeps through.
