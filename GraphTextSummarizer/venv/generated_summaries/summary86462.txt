The islands in the East China Sea are known as the Senkaku in Japan and as the Diaoyu in China. -- Japan's main opposition party has filed a protest with search-engine giant Google, urging it to delete from its mapping service the Chinese name for a cluster of disputed islands. Last month, China and Japan clashed over Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing captain. Japan late last month freed the fishing captain, who returned to a hero's welcome in China. Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims.
