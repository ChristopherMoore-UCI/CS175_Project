LAGOS, Nigeria -- Incident details: "Armed pirates chased, boarded and hijacked a fishing trawler underway" southeast of Mogadishu, Somalia. Pirates in Nigeria operate from the sprawling metropolis of Lagos harbor to the riverine creeks of the Niger Delta region. "One of the interesting things about piracy offshore West Africa is that it has started to mimic piracy trends off the Horn of Africa, places like Somalia," explained Rolake Akinola, West Africa analyst at Control Risks. Somalia is a barren, dusty failed state, and Somali pirates operate in the vast Gulf of Aden. Off Somalia's coast, a NATO-led task force is trying to crack down on Somali pirates.
