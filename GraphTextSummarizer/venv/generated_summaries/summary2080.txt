-- The Supreme Court made it harder Wednesday for foreign victims of torture and other crimes against humanity to press their legal claims against corporations and others in U.S. federal courts. " The U.S. law in question is the Alien Tort Statute, which gives federal courts jurisdiction over civil claims from foreigners that they were harmed by international law violations. Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the unanimous court, said acts committed on foreign soil by foreign entities against foreign citizens typically cannot be resolved in American courts. Now the issue in part was whether corporations and political entities should be treated the same as individual offenders when it comes to enforcing international human rights. It was largely ignored for decades but has become an important legal vehicle for those bringing human rights claims.
