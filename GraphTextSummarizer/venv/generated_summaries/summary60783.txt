Lawmakers worked early into New Year's Day to prevent the combustible mix of tax increases and budget cuts, which experts warned would have damaged the economy. The previous year, Congress worked on Christmas Eve to craft a short-term deal to avoid an increase in the payroll tax, a decrease in unemployment benefits, and a cut to doctor payments for Medicare patients. Sequester cuts have had a wide-ranging impact on adult job training programs, schools for low-income students, civilian defense contractors and military readiness, the report says. Congressional budget talks at critical point While the two committee leaders say they are making progress, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, one of the House Democrats on the conference committee, threw cold water on any imminent budget deal, telling CNN the talks "are going way too slowly." With less than a month before the New Year, doctors who treat Medicare patients don't yet know how much the government will reimburse them, parents aren't sure if their local Head Start program will turn away students, civilians in the military don't know how many days they could be furloughed, and families can't yet estimate the price of milk.
