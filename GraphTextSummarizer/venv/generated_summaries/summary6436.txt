Creating that outlet for local talent is an integral part of Dubai Fashion 2020, a long-term strategy that aims to make the emirate a global fashion capital by the end of the decade. Although the Dubai event only began in April 2013, its founder has grand ambitions for its future and for fashion in the Middle East. "I would like to truly have our own fashion heroes," said Fashion Forward founder and CEO, Bong Guerrero. but I believe we are also ready and have the right opportunity to also develop global brands from Dubai. Established Arab labels such as Amato are already regular attendees at Fashion Forward as are smaller up-and-coming fashion houses like Dubai's Zareena line.
