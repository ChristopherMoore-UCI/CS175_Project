At the California hearing, Sheen's lawyer, Mark Gross, had argued that Mueller was "a dollar short and a day late" in asking for the case to be sealed since she did not ask the same last month when she accused Sheen of threatening to kill her. Sheen detoured Tuesday from the East Coast leg of his "Violent Torpedo of Truth" stage tour to ask Goldberg to award him full custody of the boys after Mueller failed to appear for a drug test that was required under their child-custody agreement. While the results were sealed by the judge, Mueller was smiling broadly as she left court, in contrast to a stone-faced Sheen. -- A hearing in Charlie Sheen's custody battle with estranged wife Brooke Mueller took place Tuesday in private, despite a request from the actor's lawyer that reporters be allowed to witness the proceeding. Sheen launched his nationwide stage tour last month after Warner Bros. fired him.
