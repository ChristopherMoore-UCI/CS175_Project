Wind and warmth will "contribute to extreme fire behavior," the weather service said, which issued a red flag warning, the highest alert. It has also asked that residents not mow dry grass, pull a vehicle over onto it, toss cigarette butts on it -- and not to target shoot in undesignated areas, especially not at metal targets, which could make sparks fly. Snow The front is expected to lay down snow from parts of Kentucky through New York State, and freezing rain from Tennessee to the lower Midwest and parts of Maine. It will get at least as cold this week in Memphis, Tennessee -- which should see a low of 11 degrees Fahrenheit overnight Monday -- as in Albany, New York, where the low will hit 16 the next night. That freeze blast last week -- it got refueled with another round of arctic air.
