Qureshi, from Pakistan, says he can see it in the fans who come to watch. -- India and Pakistan have finally found something they can agree on. "That's a moment I will never forget in my life, meeting so many Indians supporting us." India and Pakistan have been bitter foes since their creation in 1947, fighting three wars over the disputed territory of Kashmir and routinely exchanging fire over the border. The pair has even proposed playing a match at the Wagah border crossing between India and Pakistan. In the audience at Wednesday's match was another unlikely pair: the United Nations ambassadors from India and Pakistan, cheering on the Indo-Pak Express -- together.
