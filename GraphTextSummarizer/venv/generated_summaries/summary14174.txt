After hearing news that miners may be trapped, former miner Randy Cox told the Register-Herald newspaper in Beckley, "I just got down on my knees and started praying that they were OK." Cox, of Arnett, West Virginia, mined coal for 18 years and now is disabled, the newspaper reported. The cause of the explosion had not been determined as rescuers worked Tuesday to bore ventilation holes into the Upper Big Branch Mine. -- One of the men killed in Monday's coal mine explosion in West Virginia knew of the danger but didn't let it bother him, his family said Tuesday. The families of the victims are not limited to bloodlines, according to Willingham's relatives and other local residents. Benny Willingham, 61, a deacon in his church and the patriarch in his family, was among those killed, relatives told CNN's John Roberts.
