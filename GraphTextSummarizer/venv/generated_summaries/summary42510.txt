Watch ecstasy's pipeline into U.S. Â» Almost 5.5 million pills of ecstasy were seized in the states bordering Canada in 2006 (the most recent year for which full statistics are available) -- an almost tenfold increase since 2003, top drug enforcement officials say. And now, Asian gangs in Canada have been smuggling the chemicals needed to make ecstasy from China and India, officials with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police tell CNN. Most alarming, they say, is not only is ecstasy back after years of decline, but most of the time it's laced with meth. Because meth is less expensive than ecstasy, mixing the two saves producers money, but it also makes it more dangerous, officials say. The Mounties have created teams across Canada focused on identifying the criminal organizations producing ecstasy and meth and say they have shut down 17 labs in the past year.
