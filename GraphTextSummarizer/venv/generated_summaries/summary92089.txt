Jeff Davis County officials ordered voluntary evacuations, but residents have not left some neighborhoods, Texas Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor said. -- Two lightning-triggered wildfires that have charred 24,000 acres in drought-stricken West Texas threaten 150 homes and 250 other buildings, officials said Wednesday. The leading edge of the Livermore fire, which has burned 13,387 acres since last week, is within a mile of the Davis Mountain Resort community, fire officials said in a statement Wednesday. "We're going to do everything we humanly, safely can do to protect those homes and residents," Incident Commander Tony Wilder said. "We've had about one-fourth of the moisture that we normally get," fire volunteer Kelly Bryan said.
