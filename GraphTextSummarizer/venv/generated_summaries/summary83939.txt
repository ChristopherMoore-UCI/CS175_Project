More on Thailand's fried bugs: A guide to Thailand's edible insects Similar markets and food carts exist throughout Asia and other parts of the world. To locals, and some expats, these foods are not out of the ordinary -- they're part of the many meals on offer. "Customers often like to eat fried insects while drinking beer, as a healthy and exotic replacement for popcorn or peanuts," one vendor says. According to a recent U.N. report, insects could be a solution to some of the world's food and health problems. These bug vendors serve up to a dozen varieties of insects, which are usually fried in vegetable oil then sprayed with soy sauce to add some zing.
