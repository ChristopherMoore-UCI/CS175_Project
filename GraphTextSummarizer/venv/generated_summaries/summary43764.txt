CNN: How would each of you describe that relationship between mother and daughter? Vanessa: I am lucky to have three daughters who are completely different. Instead they strike a stance of support -- mother and daughter side by side, arms hooked. CNN: What do you think mothers and daughters will take away from this book? Vanessa: I hope that they see that it's not all peaches and cream. CNN: As a mother now, do you hear yourself saying things that sound like your mother? Vanessa: When I heard it loud and clear was when I was on location shooting a show called "Who Do You Think You Are." Helen: For me, it was when Vanessa had performed "Kiss of the Spider Woman" on Broadway, because we knew that was one of the things that she wanted to do her entire life.
