For years, Native Americans have called on Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder to change the team's name. Although the ACLU agrees the team name is "offensive and perpetuates racism against Native Americans," it cannot support what it refers to as language policing. What the Conrad Schools of Science and the Lancaster school board decisions represent for Native Americans are hope -- for us and our kids -- that broader awareness is changing perspectives and that hurtful stereotypical nicknames should not have to be tolerated by any ethnic group. Local school districts are responding to the growing chorus of voices who oppose antiquated Native American mascots. Many have made the argument that Native Americans like me are trampling on the First Amendment when we call for the Washington football team to change its name.
