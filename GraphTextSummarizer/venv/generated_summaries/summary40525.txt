Fanconi Anemia is an inherited blood disorder that affects about 1 in every 130,000 people, says Dr. Margaret MacMillan, a pediatric hematologist oncologist at University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's Hospital. The prognosis for Fanconi Anemia patients is difficult to predict, MacMillan says. Other than stunted growth, Ethan didn't show any external signs of Fanconi Anemia, MacMillan says. A 15-year-old who hasn't yet gone into bone marrow failure gave Candi hope that Ethan could hold out a few more years. You'd never guess from looking at him that Ethan has Fanconi Anemia, a rare blood disorder that may one day kill him.
