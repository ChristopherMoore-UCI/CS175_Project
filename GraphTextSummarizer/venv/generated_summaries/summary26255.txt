Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson was not armed when a Madison, Wisconsin, police officer fatally shot him, Police Chief Mike Koval said Saturday. Koval, on Saturday, refused to comment on Robinson's past police criminal history or past interactions. Koval called for calm, while acknowledging the protests are reminiscent of those that followed the deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and Staten Island, New York, after confrontations with police. Kenny was responding Friday evening to a reported disturbance at a Madison residence when Robinson attacked him, Koval said. Koval said he visited the home of Robinson's mother late Friday and met Robinson's grandparents outside the house.
