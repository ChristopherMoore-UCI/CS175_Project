The public prosecutor trying the lone surviving suspected gunman in the Mumbai attacks told CNN the dead suspects have not been buried because no one has come to claim them and local Muslim officials are refusing to bury the men in Mumbai's Muslim graveyards. Kasab is also accused of shooting people at Mumbai's Cama hospital. Police say he was caught on a surveillance camera holding a gun as he stalked and killed people inside Mumbai's main train station, formerly known as Victoria Terminus. Security is tight for the trial of the only surviving alleged Mumbai terrorist. "In this particular case, it's very important for the Indian Muslim community to make it clear that they have nothing to do with the people who claim to be Muslims who engaged in terrorism in Mumbai," Voll said.
