" Up Helly Aa Before the 1880s, there was a great winter tradition of tar barreling in Scotland's Shetland Islands, which saw local men dragging burning barrels through the town of Lerwick on sledges, getting up to high jinx en route. "The fathers, grandfathers and great grandfathers of these lads carried barrels." Burning tar barrels are also featured here, but they're rolled, not carried. Earlier in the evening I'd witnessed the initiation of a new generation of barrel boys and girls. Here they do it by charging up and down the streets with flaming tar barrels held aloft.
