-- When Lydia Ko swung to victory at the Canadian Women's Open Sunday, she became the youngest-ever winner in LPGA Tour history. However, she could not claim the US$300,000 first-place check on Sunday. The latter competition saw her crowned as the youngest-ever winner of a professional golf tour event, although her record was broken in June. In addition to her blossoming golfing career, she intends to complete high school, and reportedly has her eye on attending Stanford for college. Currently the world's top-ranked female amateur golfer, Ko, 15, also became the tour's fifth-ever amateur champion -- its first since 1969.
