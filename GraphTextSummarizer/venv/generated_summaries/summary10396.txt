There apparently aren't enough good men to save Sodom, which leads to God destroying yet another population in Genesis. After God destroys Sodom, Lot's daughters worry that there aren't any men left, so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him. Lot is the central character in the grim story of Sodom and Gomorrah's demise in Chapter 19. Lot is visited by divine emissaries to investigate if there are indeed enough good people to save the town. It could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children.
