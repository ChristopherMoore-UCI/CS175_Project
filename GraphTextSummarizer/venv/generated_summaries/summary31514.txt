-- Seven people, including a toddler, died when fire roared through a three-story home in southwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on Friday night, fire officials said. Six of the victims -- three adults, a teen and two children -- were found in the townhome's basement, huddled together, Philadelphia Fire Commissioner Lloyd Ayers said. Wade Lee, who lived in the same building, said the landlord had helped tenants work out fire evacuation plans. Firefighters work to put out a fire at a town home Friday night in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Early clues suggest a kerosene heater may have started the blaze, but the fire marshal has not officially determined a cause, Ayers said.
