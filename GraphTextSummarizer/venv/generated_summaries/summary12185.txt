As well as posing hazards to the oceans through toxic contamination and to sealife through ingestion or being trapped in nets, unnatural transport systems could allow invasive species to be introduced to different areas and upset delicate ecosystems. The crews returned with samples of the water from various locations in the gyre and the most immediate discovery was the pervasiveness of plastic material found at regular points over 3,500 miles. The most heavily polluted areas of surface water in the gyre contained six times more plastic than plankton biomass. Some items like plastic bottles had become impromptu homes to varieties of marine mollusc. An August voyage onboard the New Horizon and Kaisei sailing ships was in partnership with Scripps Research Institute.
