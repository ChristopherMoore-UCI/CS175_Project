Mike Chinoy, a former CNN correspondent and now a senior fellow at the University of Southern California's U.S-China Institute, has seen China's leaders come and go but concedes Xi is difficult to read. The purge of party power broker, Bo Xilai, sparked China's biggest political scandal in decades. It could be seen as a mark of shame in Communist Party history," said Zhang Ming, an analyst from China's Renmin University. More than 2,200 delegates from across China will gather for the Congress, and they in turn select the 200 plus members of the party's Central Committee, who in turn appoint the Politburo and ultimately the all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee -- the country's decision makers. To some China watchers, Xi is going to need to be a traitor to his own class if he is to succeed.
