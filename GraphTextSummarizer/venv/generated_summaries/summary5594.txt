"Nobody in the world would even attempt this, but we did." Nyad was making her fourth attempt to swim across the Straits of Florida. Nyad said she was 8 years old when she first dreamed about swimming across the Straits of Florida. She had been in the water for 60 hours and was about halfway through her swim from Cuba to Florida.
