North Philadelphia has both significant African-American and Hispanic populations, but Traub -- of German-Jewish and Chinese heritage -- focused on black residents and neighborhoods. Daniel Traub knew North Philadelphia in his youth, accompanying his artist mother from their home in the more affluent central Philly as she helped residents transform vacant lots with sculptures and murals. From crumbling buildings to abandoned lots long overgrown by nature, Traub says he examined neighborhoods long troubled by destitution yet ripe with beauty and possibility. "On one hand it is ignored and in decline, but it also is a place of tremendous possibility and great human resources -- people who are marginalized but also have a tremendous amount to offer," he said. "North Philadelphia" is Traub's new 124-page portrait of the people and properties in a struggling area where more than 40% of residents in three local ZIP codes live below the poverty line.
