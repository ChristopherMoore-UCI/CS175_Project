Johnson rejected Rep. Lamar Smith's claims that Obama's immigration action would lead to a surge in illegal immigration, insisting that the order will prioritize recent illegal migrants. McCaul questioned the timing of Obama's decision to act on immigration reform, which came after the midterm elections, calling it "more of a political decision than a policy decision." Johnson would not comment on Obama's statements before he decided to use his executive authority on immigration, when Obama suggested he may not have the authority to act unilaterally to reform the immigration system. Republicans on the committee, starting with Chairman Mike McCaul, questioned the authority and timing of Obama's executive action on immigration and the impact of Obama's action on illegal immigration. Instead, Johnson stressed that administration officials "spent months" with lawyers to ensure all executive actions on immigration are legal and said the White House was repeatedly urged by members of Congress to hold off on executive action for months. Testifying before the House Homeland Security Committee on Tuesday, Johnson said he is "fully comfortable" that President Barack Obama's executive action on immigration reform is within the President's legal authority.
