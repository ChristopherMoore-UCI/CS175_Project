"While rocket launches from the Cape are considered a common occurrence, the historic significance of today's achievement by SpaceX should not be lost." Bolden said the mission reflected a new generation of commercial launch systems that would support the international space station and that could eventually carry astronauts into orbit. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, co-founder of PayPal, said in July that if all goes well after a series of test flights, SpaceX will be ready to begin flying cargo to the space station next year. Other entrepreneurs in the emerging commercial space travel business say flights will no longer be confined to astronauts. In the meantime, the United States will be renting space from the Russians aboard their Soyuz spacecraft. SpaceX currently holds a $1.6 billion contract from NASA to transport cargo, but not people, into space.
