-- Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom has declared a state of national calamity because so many citizens do not have food or proper nutrition. Speaking in a nationally televised address late Tuesday, Colom said his declaration will make it easier to get food to the thousands of Guatemalan families who are in dire need. "This is the cause of the food and nutritional crisis that this country is going through," Colom said. He also cited the Central American nation's "history of unfairness that has made Guatemala live since long ago with high and shameful poverty levels, extreme poverty and undernutrition." Colom said the nation's food problems are the result of a drought this year, global warming and the effects of the international economic crisis.
