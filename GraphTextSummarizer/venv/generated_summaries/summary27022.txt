In an interview on CNNI's "Amanpour," Morsi spokesman Jihad Haddad said parliament plans to meet this week -- potentially forcing a confrontation with military rulers and Egypt's high court. We object to the military council remaining in power beyond June," said Mohamed Gabber, a Brotherhood representative in the Shura Council, Egypt's upper house of parliament. " That move came days after Egypt's highest court dissolved the lower house of parliament and the military council announced it had full legislative authority. Egypt's highest court last week dissolved the recently elected lower house of parliament, casting doubt over the future of the Shura, which has continued to meet. -- Thousands of Egyptians gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square Tuesday night to protest what they call a coup by Egypt's military rulers and show their support for the Muslim Brotherhood presidential candidate.
