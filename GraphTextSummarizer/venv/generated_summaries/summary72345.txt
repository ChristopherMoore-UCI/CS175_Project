-- Authorities are investigating six possible cases of bacterial meningitis -- including two deaths -- in rural Oklahoma elementary school students. A medical team at Oologah Lower Elementary School screened more than 100 people including faculty, CNN affiliate KOTV reported. Authorities said the team is offering antibiotics to other students and faculty in the district, and there is enough medication for about 1,000 people, the affiliate reported. Last year, 16 cases of meningococcal disease were reported in Oklahoma and one person died, the board said. The Rogers County Health Department and Oklahoma State Department of Health said two children from Oologah-Talala public school district have died from the disease.
