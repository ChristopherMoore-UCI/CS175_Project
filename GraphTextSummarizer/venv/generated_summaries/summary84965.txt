-- Japan will lobby a dozen members of the International Whaling Commission at a meeting Monday to support its much-criticized Antarctic whaling program -- just three days before all members of the commission meet in London to discuss reaching an agreement on whale conservation rules. The country's annual hunt kills up to 1,000 whales a year -- the fisheries agency insists it wants "sustainable whaling." However, many in the international community -- particularly Australia -- believe that such hunts amount to needless slaughter. Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the nation's fisheries agency will make their case to officials from Angola, Eritrea, Congo, Guinea, Ghana, Malawi, Tanzania, Palau, Micronesia, Cambodia, Laos and Vanuatu, a government spokesperson said. Critics believe that calling it research is just a pretext for retrieving whale meat to be sold in markets and restaurants.
