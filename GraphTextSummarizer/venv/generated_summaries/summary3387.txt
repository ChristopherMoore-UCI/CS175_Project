"We eliminated four different agriculture subsidies and instead have moved to risk management so we'll support farmers and ranchers when there's a loss, where there's a weather loss, it's a price loss, through crop insurance, through other things where the farmer has some skin in the game," Stabenow said. The legislation was put together by Senate Agriculture Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat, and Sen. Pat Roberts, the top Republican on the committee. And the senators say they would save $15 billion and fundamentally change farm policy in the United States by doing away with direct payments to farmers, replacing them with taxpayer subsidized crop insurance. Watchdog groups warn the savings may not last because the crop insurance has no caps, and in bad crop years, the cost to taxpayers could explode. Roberts added that in times of drought, flood or other forces of nature that hurt farmers, Congress generally passes disaster relief bills that cost billions and are bureaucratic nightmares.
