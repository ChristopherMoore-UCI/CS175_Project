-- An increase in the number of suicides among military personnel can be traced, in part, to a "stressed and tired force" made vulnerable by multiple deployments, a military leader said Wednesday. Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones. " The suicide underscores that suicide is "a complex, very difficult problem that causes all of us to scratch our heads and wonder: how do we stop the next one?" Last year, at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, two cadets and two members of the staff and faculty killed themselves, said Brig. He noted that last year, for the first time, the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population. Long troop deployments in Iraq, above, and Afghanistan have been cited in the rise in military suicides.
