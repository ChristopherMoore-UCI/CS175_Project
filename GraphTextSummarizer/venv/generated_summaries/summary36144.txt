There are no trials in the Mac App Store, and submissions are subject to strict rules, just like the iOS store. This is clearly aimed at novice users who may never have actually downloaded and installed third-party software before, and the interface will be instantly familiar to anyone who has used the App Store in iTunes or on an iPad. Finally, here's a tip: Up in the Apple menu, on the top left of your screen, you'll see a new entry called "App Store." If you already have these installed on your Mac, the App Store detects this and shows them as "installed", just like on the iPad. This replaces the old "Mac OS X Software" which has quietly been retired.
