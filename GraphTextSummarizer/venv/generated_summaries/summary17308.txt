"That breach would have serious repercussions for United States foreign relations, law-enforcement and other cooperation with Mexico, and the ability of American citizens traveling abroad to have the benefits of consular assistance in the event of detention." "If the scheduled execution of Mr. Leal Garcia goes ahead, the United States government will have implemented a death penalty after a trial that did not comply with due process rights," said Christof Heyns, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. " The court of appeals has backed up the lower court, concluding that Leal does not have "a due process right to remain alive until the proposed Avena legislation becomes law." In 2005, then-President George W. Bush said the United States would discharge its obligations under Avena by having state courts address them. But the administration said that going ahead with Leal's execution would cause "irreparable harm" to U.S. foreign policy interests by putting the United States "in irremediable breach" of its international-law obligation.
