Its fighters were finally driven out of the Syrian border town of Kobani after more than 100 days of fighting against Kurdish militia; Iraqi government forces pushed ISIS back in Diyala province; the city of Mosul -- still under ISIS control -- is beginning to look vulnerable. Peshmerga forces have made steady progress against ISIS north and west of Mosul over the last two months. Iraqi troops and Shia militia known as Popular Mobilization Units launched an offensive last week to retake ISIS' last strongholds around Muqdadiyah -- 50 miles (80km) from the capital. The prominent role of Shia militia may yet make it difficult for Baghdad to pacify areas after ISIS retreats. Iraqi Finance Minister Hoshyar Zebari told Reuters he estimates ISIS has looted $456 million from banks in Mosul, Tikrit and Baiji since June.
