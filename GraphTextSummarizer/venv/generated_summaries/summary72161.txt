After Zahau's death was ruled a suicide and San Diego County officials refused to pursue criminal charges, Jonah Shacknai asked the California attorney general's office to investigate his son's fatal fall and his girlfriend's hanging. The San Diego County medical examiner ruled that Rebecca Zahau committed suicide, but a lawsuit filed Friday by her mother and sister contends she was the victim of a murder plot devised by her millionaire boyfriend's brother, ex-wife and the ex-wife's twin sister. This time, it was Adam Shacknai, Jonah Shacknai's brother, reporting that he found Zahau hanging, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said. Jonah Shacknai, a lawyer and the founder and CEO of Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp., was at a children's hospital or a Ronald McDonald House from the time when investigators believe the suicide happened to the time Zahau's body was reported, San Diego sheriff's Lt. The lawsuit filed by the dead woman's mother, Pari Zahau, and sister, Mary Zahau-Loehner, does not detail the alleged plot, but it contends each defendant "participated in some manner in the planning, implementation, execution and subsequent concealment of the scheme to murder Rebecca Zahau."
