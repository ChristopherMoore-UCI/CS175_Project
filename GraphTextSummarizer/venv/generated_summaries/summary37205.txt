The girls, ages 6 and 7, suffered minor arm injuries in the shooting Friday in Carlsbad, said Lt. Jay Eppel of the Carlsbad Police Department. Counselors will be at the school Monday to help students, staff and families "handle the anxiety and fear that can result from a traumatic experience," John A. Roach said in a statement Saturday. The superintendent for the school district thanked good Samaritans, police and school staff members for their actions Friday. The suspect was taken to a hospital after he complained of back and neck pain, and faces six counts of attempted murder and numerous weapons violations, according to the statement. Both were flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego.
