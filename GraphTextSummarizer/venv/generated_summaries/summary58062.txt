An Atlanta-based organization called Canstruction challenges architects, engineers and volunteers to make sculptures by using cans of food. Now stacking food cans has become part of a national campaign to fight hunger. "You can use materials for leveling purposes, such as up to a quarter-inch plywood or Plexiglas or cardboard," said Sarah Barnard, co-chair of the Syracuse, New York, event. The idea is that volunteers are able to raise supplies for food banks and simultaneously raise awareness of the problem of hunger throughout the United States. A 2012 U.S. Department of Agriculture report estimated there are around 49 million people who live in "food insecure" households (meaning anyone who is at risk of hunger or may not have consistent access to food.)
