In the 2000s, Spanish banks emulated U.S. banks in the aggressive use of securitization. Financial institutions that have bought Spanish credit-card debt (or Spanish mortgages or whatever) may discover equally shockingly late that their bonds also will not and cannot pay off in full. As we learned during the subprime mortgage crash, bad loans get sliced and diced, recombined and repackaged, into bonds whose contents are not always understood by the pension funds and insurance companies that buy them. The problem is that some European countries are bumping up against their ability to borrow in euros. Those bond buyers often only discovered that they had bought bonds based on subprime mortgages after the mortgages failed.
