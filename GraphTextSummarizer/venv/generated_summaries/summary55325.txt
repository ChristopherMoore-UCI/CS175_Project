The ruling makes SB 2305 the latest North Dakota law on abortion that a court has blocked in recent weeks. "The judge clearly stated that these attempts to contrive safety concerns continue to be wrong-headed, and that the (North Dakota) constitution does include protections for women seeking abortions," Kromenaker said. " "These privileges must include the abortion procedures the physician will be performing at abortion facilities," the law adds.
