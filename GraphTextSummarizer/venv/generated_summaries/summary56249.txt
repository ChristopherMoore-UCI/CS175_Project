The metropolis look like a "a city of ghosts," Dr. Ahmed Ammar, an emergency room doctor at Falluja General Hospital, told CNN. Most of the deaths occurred in Anbar province, the Sunni region west of Baghdad where security forces have been squaring off with anti-government fighters. In northern Iraq, one roadside bombing killed five police officers, another bombing left three civilians dead, and two people were killed in a shooting, police said. In the Anbar capital of Ramadi, two police officers told CNN that Iraqi security forces killed more than 30 anti-government fighters. Some of those fighters are militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, linked to al Qaeda.
