In a landmark case, the European Court of Human Rights ruled Tuesday that Turkish authorities failed to protect a woman from her abusive ex-husband, effectively allowing his pattern of domestic violence to lead to the killing of her mother at gunpoint. " Court documents state that in the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir, Nahide Opuz, 36, and her mother were the repeat victims of attacks by the woman's ex-husband, Huseyin Opuz, referred to as H.O. "Criminal proceedings were brought against H.O. on three occasions," the court wrote. Turkish authorities detained and then released her ex-husband after fining him the equivalent of about $580. " Turkey passed the Family Protection Act in 1998, which is supposed to offer women protection against domestic violence. Tuskan cited polls that indicate up to 40 percent of Turkish women believe they deserve to be beaten by their husbands.
