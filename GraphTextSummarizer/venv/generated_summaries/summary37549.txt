Timothy Dwayne Tutterrow, a 46-year-old from Quitman, Georgia, faces felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious bodily injury, Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison said. -- A ride operator has been charged with three felony counts of assault after several people were hurt on the Vortex at the North Carolina State Fair, a sheriff's office said Saturday. "After inspection of the ride, we determined that it had been tampered with and critical safety devices were compromised," Harrison said. More arrests in the incident are possible, said Harrison, who added that the investigation is ongoing. Witnesses said the ride had stopped Thursday night and people were getting off when it restarted, resulting in five injuries.
