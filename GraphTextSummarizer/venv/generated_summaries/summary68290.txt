-- Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg picked up where they left off in Malaysia completing another dominant day for Mercedes at Friday's practice session in Bahrain ahead of Sunday's Grand Prix. Qualifying will take place after the third and final practice session on Saturday with the Grand Prix -- the first under floodlights in Bahrain -- starting at 15.00 GMT on Sunday. The pair took the Formula One team's first one-two for 59 years at Kuala Lumpur's Sepang's International Circuit last weekend, and are on course to repeat the feat if Friday's practice is any guide. Fernando Alonso confirmed the Italian team's current overall rank completing the third fastest lap in Friday's practice, 1.035 seconds behind Hamilton. The former F1 star has been in a medically-induced coma for over three months following a skiing accident, but is now starting to have "moments of consciousness," his agent Sabine Kehm said Friday.
