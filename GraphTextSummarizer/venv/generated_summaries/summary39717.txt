Nikitin was in a heavy metal band as a young man, and got the swastika tattoo then, said festival spokesman Gunther Philipowski. "That is a problem in Bayreuth," Philipowski said. The festival is dedicated to the works of Richard Wagner, one of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler's favorite composers. Nikitin, 38, a bass-baritone, has "painted over" his Nazi tattoo, and it would not have been visible during his performance in "The Flying Dutchman," Philipowski said. He had already been in Germany rehearsing for his premiere on Wednesday, Philipowski said.
