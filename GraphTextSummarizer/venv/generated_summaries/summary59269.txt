Pressly, the morning news anchor for Little Rock, Arkansas, television station and CNN affiliate KATV, was found badly beaten and unconscious in her home and died five days later. "I think he saw her someplace, probably followed her home with the intention of robbing her," Lt. Terry Hastings, spokesman for Little Rock police, told CNN in December. " DNA evidence has also tied Vance to a rape in April 2008 in Marianna, Arkansas, about 90 miles east of Little Rock, police said in December. Vance was linked to the killing through DNA, and police told CNN last year they are "110 percent" sure he killed Pressly. Defense attorney Steve Morley told CNN affiliate WREG that such evidence presents an obstacle for them to overcome, but he said he hopes an emotional closing argument will persuade jurors to spare Vance's life.
