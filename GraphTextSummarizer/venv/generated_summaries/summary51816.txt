More than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico over the past six years as violence surged and the country's government cracked down on drug cartels, according to Mexico's Interior Ministry. A center for missing persons in Mexico will distribute photos and information about the missing young people across the country. And for the first time since the disappearance, Attorney General Rodolfo Rios confirmed there is evidence showing that the people who are missing had indeed been at the club. A mass kidnapping would be a significant development because even through the years of drug cartel violence, the capital was a relatively safe place. The young people were taken from the Heavens After nightclub on Sunday, May 26, between 10 a.m. and noon, family members say.
