-- Mark Webber climbed to the top of the Formula One championship standings with a runaway victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday as Red Bull teammate and polesitter Sebastian Vettel paid for a mistake while the safety car was out. Vettel and Alonso had pitted for the first time on lap 16, allowing Webber to establish a crucial buffer that he kept extending until he also came in for a tire change on lap 44 -- meaning he came back out of the lane still in front. It was another disappointing day for the German -- who was lapped by Webber -- and Mercedes, with teammate Nico Rosberg retiring on lap 15. The safety car was already out when the leading McLaren ground to a halt, and its introduction allowed Webber to take the lead having lost second place to Ferrari's Fernando Alonso at the start. " Alonso, who won last time out at Hockenheim, kept his hopes of a third world title alive as he held off Vettel to take second place -- 17.821 seconds behind Webber -- despite the German setting the fastest lap of any driver.
