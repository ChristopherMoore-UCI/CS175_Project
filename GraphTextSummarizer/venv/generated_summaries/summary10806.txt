He was reported to be stable and alert a few hours later, said ICE spokeswoman Virginia Kice. "I know he's pinned down," Roseville police Lt. Cal Walstad said. After that initial shooting, Samuel Duran ran and hopped fences in a Roseville neighborhood as members of various law enforcement agencies converged on the scene, police said. After determining where he was in Roseville, local police and a special agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit went there Friday afternoon. One was struck in the jaw, one was hit in the shoulder, and the third wounded by bullet fragments, according to Walstad.
