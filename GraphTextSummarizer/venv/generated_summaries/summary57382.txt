London ambulance services said 17 people suffered minor injuries, and the number could increase as several others are still being assessed. -- Air crash investigators are trying to work out why a Boeing 777 landed short of the runway at London Heathrow airport, skidding on grass and ripping apart sections of the aircraft. Some incoming flights were being diverted to other airports on a flight-by-flight basis, according to Heathrow's Web site. Airport authorities said Heathrow's southern runway had been closed, but the northern runway remained open. However, the aircraft involved in Thursday's incident appeared to have had a fortunate escape, having approached Heathrow over heavily-populated west London suburbs before its crash landing.
