-- A Rosary service and funeral were scheduled this week for Jaime Zapata, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who was killed in Mexico last week. Zapata, 32, was based in Laredo, Texas, and was in Mexico on temporary assignment. He was the life and soul of our family and a joy to his friends and colleagues," Zapata's brother, Amador, said in a statement. I firmly believe he is in heaven now, continuing to work for what is right." Outside of that statement, the Zapata family has requested privacy and has not talked with the media. He was killed and another agent was injured on a highway in Mexico's San Luis Potosi state after they were run off the road by two vehicles believed to be driven by members of the Zetas drug cartel, authorities have said.
