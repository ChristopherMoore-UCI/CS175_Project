Jessica Blackham was arrested and charged in connection with the discovery of her newborn son in the toilet of a South Carolina arena, Greenville Police Chief Terri Wilfong said. "As far as being her not knowing she was pregnant, that's a bunch of bull crap," Jones told Grace Wednesday. Blackham was charged with felony child abuse and unlawful neglect, CNN affiliate WYFF reported. Jason Jones, who said he dated Blackham, told HLN's Nancy Grace that he doubted that story. The baby was rushed to the hospital and police searched for the mother for days making public appeals and sifting through videotape taken in and around the restroom.
