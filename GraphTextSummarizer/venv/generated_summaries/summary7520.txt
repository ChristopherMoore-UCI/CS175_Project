As well as extra taxes, the Greek government is working hard to stamp out tax evasion and reform public pensions. The couple still love the people and the country they have adopted but Bob paints a picture of a nation in a mess -- one where strikes are commonplace, officialdom is mistrusted and illegal payments and tax evasion are part of everyday life. According to Bob, local hotels have pegged their room prices for three years, but he said taxi driver strikes leave tourists stranded at the airport, and extra taxes could further discourage visitors and drive away those who have already moved to Greece and spend their money there. Bob and Anna say they are facing an extra property tax of â‚¬500 ($690) next year and for the moment they say they can manage, but accountants are already sending letters to their clients warning that there may be more taxes on the way. Another British couple, Roy and Kate Cooper, who have also settled in Crete, say future tax increases may hit some ex-pats quite hard, particularly those on pensions.
