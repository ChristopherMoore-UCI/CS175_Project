As such, the U.S. decision to commence military action in Iraq based on humanitarian concerns, without the equivalent military intervention of other Middle Eastern political powers has played into ISIS rhetoric against America. In the past, most ISIS propaganda had focused on the development of the caliphate state and on securing territories within Syria and Iraq. The act is declared as revenge for U.S. air strikes against ISIS fighters in Iraq. The scene is filmed on a high quality device with seamless editing of President Obama's speech authorizing military action against ISIS positions, something which it argues led directly to this, ISIS' brutal response. Western governments face an ongoing threat that their citizens will become radicalized and go abroad to fight in Syria and Iraq.
