Said Kouachi is suspected of slipping off for terror training in Yemen in July 2011 during a trip he made with another French national to Oman in July 2011, according to multiple French officials who spoke to L'Express national security reporter, Eric Pelletier. But the surveillance of Said was terminated in June 2014 because French security services judged him no longer dangerous, Pelletier was told. So we can ask the question whether the U.S. is more able to monitor French jihadis on French territory than the French intelligence itself," said Laurent. The French responded by placing Said Kouachi under surveillance in November 2011 by issuing a "Fiche de Surveillance" notice, multiple French officials told Pelletier. On Saturday, French police were told in a briefing that sleeper cells have been activated over the past 24 hours inside France, terror expert Samuel Laurent said he had been told by a police source.
