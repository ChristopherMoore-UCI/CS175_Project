Three suspects, one of them wounded, were in custody, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation spokesman John Bankhead. The wounded officer was assisting a state trooper tracking a LoJack device in a suspected stolen motorcycle a few blocks from the Georgia Capitol in downtown Atlanta, Bankhead said. The GBI and Atlanta Police Department will determine whether all of the motorcycles were stolen, Bankhead said. The injured suspect was taken to the same hospital and underwent surgery, Bankhead said. -- A Georgia Capitol police corporal was grazed by a bullet Wednesday afternoon during an exchange of gunfire with a man suspected of being part of a chop shop ring, authorities said.
