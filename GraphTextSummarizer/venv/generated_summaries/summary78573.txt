He was later apprehended by Portland police and Army Criminal Investigation Command agents, the command said in a press release Thursday afternoon. A soldier has been detained and charged with murder in Wednesday's shooting death of a civilian employee at Fort Knox, Kentucky, according to a court document and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command. The victim was shot near Jacobs' pickup truck, and Jacobs fled the scene in the truck, according to the complaint filed by FBI Special Agent Mark A. Coleman. The civilian, who has not been publicly named, was shot several times with a .45-caliber handgun in a parking lot at Fort Knox about 5:40 p.m. Wednesday. The shooting occurred outside Fort Knox's Human Resources Command building, prompting officials to lock down the army post for an hour.
