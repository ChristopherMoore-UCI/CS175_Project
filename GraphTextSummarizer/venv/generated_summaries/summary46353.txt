Winning prizes is a new experience for me, and I'm especially hopeful that the prizes might help me find a wider audience for "Goon Squad," which struggled in the marketplace early in its publication.

"A Visit from the Goon Squad" also won the 2011 National Book Critics Circle Award and is a finalist for the Pen Faulkner Award, the LA Times Book Prize and the UK's Orange Prize. It seemed impossible that a scrappy book like "Goon Squad" could win an award like that. CNN: How did "Goon Squad" come about?
