In the 19 months since the Dreamliner fix, there have been no reports of batteries catching fire, although a 787 battery cell did overheat while on the ground earlier this year. Immediately after the Dreamliner's troubles, Boeing competitor Airbus announced it was pulling lithium-ion batteries from early production models of its new A350 aircraft and going with traditional -- and heavier -- nickel cadmium batteries. Passenger safety and billions of dollars in Boeing aircraft orders were at risk. When you pick apart the 110-page document, it reveals how any new piece of equipment can pose dangerous problems, even a noncritical piece of equipment like batteries. The FAA allows Boeing and other qualified manufacturers to use their own employees to confirm that new aircraft components meet safety regulations.
