"We think what happened to Mr. Bierfeldt is a reflection that TSA believes passenger screening is an opportunity to engage in freewheeling law enforcement investigations that have no link to flight safety," he said. There are no restrictions on carrying large sums of cash on flights within the United States, but the TSA allegedly took Bierfeldt to a windowless room and, along with other law enforcement agencies, questioned him for almost half an hour about the money. One sample: "You want to play smartass, and I'm not going to play your f**king game." Bierfeldt is director of development for the Campaign for Liberty, an outgrowth of the Ron Paul presidential campaign. Officer: So these are campaign contributions for Ron Paul? He was returning from a regional conference March 29 when TSA screeners at Lambert-St. Louis (Missouri) International Airport saw a metal cash box in his carry-on bag.
