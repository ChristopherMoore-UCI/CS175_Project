He did not give specifics, but asked by Amanpour if there is trafficking of children, Bellerive said, "The reports I received say yes." Haiti is trying to locate displaced children and register them so they can either be reunited with other family members or put up for adoption, Bellerive said. -- Trafficking of children and human organs is occurring in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated parts of Haiti, killed more than 150,000 people, and left many children orphans, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said Wednesday. " "We respect the sovereignty of Haiti and their right to control the departure of Haitian children. On the broader issue of Haitian children, Bellerive told Amanpour the government will reopen schools Monday in most of the country. They say if there are tents -- if there are facilities and we can help them -- they are willing to open very rapidly." Bellerive also highlighted the critical importance of getting enough tents and shelters to Haiti before the rainy season begins in May.
