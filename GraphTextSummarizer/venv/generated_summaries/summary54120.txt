High-altitude winds The guiding principle of the FEG is that wind speed and constancy are far greater at high altitude than they are on the ground, especially in the two major jet streams - the Sub-Tropical Jet and the Polar Front Jet - that exist in each hemisphere (at around 30 degrees and 60 degrees latitude respectively). U.S. demonstration in three years "We expect to make a demonstration in the U.S. less than three years from now at high altitude in normal high altitude winds. They might not be quite as sexy as your average Bond adventure, but flying wind turbines could end up generating a lot more heat than 007 and Pussy Galore ever did. Once in place, the blades not only keep the FEG air-born, providing lift like the surface area of a kite, but also act as turbines, turning dynamos within the platform that generate electricity, which is transmitted back to earth through a vast aluminum tethering cable. An in-built GPS (Global Positioning System) uses satellite technology to ensure that the FEG always remains in the same place, both vertically and horizontally.
