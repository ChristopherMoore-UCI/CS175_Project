Also through to the last 32 are US Open champion Samantha Stosur, 12th seed Sabine Lisicki, 17th seed Shuai Peng and 23rd seed Yanina Wickmayer, who all progressed in straight sets. But 25th seed Anabel Medina Garrigues of Spain crashed out 1-6 6-4 6-0 to South African Chanelle Scheepers, while two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, seeded 26th, lost 1-6 7-6 7-6 to Czech Iveta Benesova. Meanwhile, Russian second seed Maria Sharapova was given a scare, dropping the opening set before rallying to defeat Israel's Shahar Peer 4-6 6-3 6-3. The 2011 French Open champion Li Na also progressed, the Chinese eighth seed recorded a 7-5 6-2 win over Hungarian qualifier Melinda Czink. The Belgian struggled to defeat Slovak Jarmila Gajdosova on Wednesday, but was far more impressive in dismissing 14th seed Julia Goerges 6-2 7-5 on Thursday.
