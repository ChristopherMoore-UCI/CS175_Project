Triple world champion Sebastian Vettel began his quest for a fourth consecutive drivers' title by putting his Red Bull top of the timesheets in practice ahead of the season-opening Australian Grand Prix. The nearest challenger to the Red Bull drivers was Mercedes' Nico Rosberg, who continued to show the pace which saw him go faster than any other driver during preseason testing. The German's lap of one minute and 25.908 seconds edged out teammate Mark Webber, who was second fastest. For Rosberg's teammate, Lewis Hamilton, this weekend will be his first grand prix since ending a 15-year association with McLaren. " Friday's practice at Albert Park took place in favorable conditions, although wet weather is predicted for qualifying on Saturday.
