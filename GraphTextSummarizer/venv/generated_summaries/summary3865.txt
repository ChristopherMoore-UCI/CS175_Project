-- Someone conducted keyword searches on "chloroform" using a desktop computer located in the home Casey Anthony shared with her parents, a computer examiner testified Wednesday in Anthony's capital murder trial. Prosecutors allege Anthony used chloroform on her daughter and suffocated her by putting duct tape over the little girl's mouth and nose. Anthony told authorities Gonzalez, who had been Caylee's nanny for years, abducted her. They did find a woman named Zenaida Gonzalez, who denied ever meeting Anthony or Caylee and later sued for defamation. She also testified she found no reference to chloroform on a computer belonging to Ricardo Morales, Anthony's former boyfriend.
