"I think that the Taliban have to feel themselves under military pressure, and begin to believe that they can't win before they're willing to have a serious conversation." News of the talks has done little to stem attacks in Afghanistan. On Saturday, four NATO service members were killed in combat-related incidents in eastern and southern Afghanistan, and another four were killed in a vehicle accident in southern Afghanistan, NATO said. "The troops were targeted accurately, according to the plan, and many of the soldier have been killed as a result of the attack," Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mojahed told CNN by telephone from an unknown location. "I would say that these contacts are very preliminary at this point," Defense Secretary Robert Gates said in an interview broadcast Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." The attack came a day after Afghan President Hamid Karzai said the United States was involved in peace talks with the Taliban.
