In December, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame announced the queen of disco was part of the 2013 class of inductees, which also includes Heart, Randy Newman, Public Enemy, Rush and Albert King. Hudson and Aguilera have been tapped to perform in honor of new inductee Donna Summer, who died last year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will take place April 18 at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live in Los Angeles and will be broadcast at 9 p.m. ET/PT on May 18 on HBO (a company that, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner). Another Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, Don Henley, will induct Newman. Gary Clark Jr. Mayer's been on the mend after having another surgery to remove recurrent throat granuloma, and he just recently sang in concert for the first time in nearly two years at a benefit in Montana.
