-- The Obama administration announced new standards for commercial pilot training Tuesday, with Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx calling it a "significant advancement for aviation safety and pilot training." Tuesday's new pilot training rule addresses a congressional mandate in the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 to ensure enhanced pilot training. The new rules from DOT and the Federal Aviation Administration will reinforce ground and flight training on aerodynamic stall and "upset," enabling pilots to prevent and recover from potential disaster. The emphasis will be on pilots gaining experience on handling a stall during simulator training. The FAA mandated that pilots will need more cockpit training to become fully certified first officers for U.S. passenger and cargo airlines.
