It comes a week after the United States and the European Union increased economic sanctions on Russia for supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukraine government forces in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, along the border with Russia. Many people in eastern Ukraine are Russian-speaking and have strong ties to Russia. According to a NATO official, Russia now has about 20,000 troops stationed "in an area along the entire border with eastern Ukraine." "They are very capable Russian regular units and can move in a matter of hours and could significantly disrupt the situation" in eastern Ukraine, the official said. The NATO official said Russian forces gathering at the Ukraine border included a "spectrum" of assets: infantry, mechanized divisions, armor, a lot of artillery, conventional and air defense, and special forces and logistics.
