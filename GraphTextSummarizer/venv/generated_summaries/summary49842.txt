Childspring International, the Atlanta-based Christian charity that sponsored her stay in the United States in 2006, said it was setting up a special Baby Noor Fund so it could channel donations specifically to Noor's family. Noor's grandmother told the soldiers that Iraqi doctors could do nothing for Noor, who was born with vertebrae that did not form completely around her spinal cord. She said it would look into possibly linking Noor's family with specialists in Baghdad or shipping medical supplies to them. Some of Noor's family members wondered whether America had forgotten them. Another reader, Linda Shinn, thought Noor should not have been sent back to Iraq.
