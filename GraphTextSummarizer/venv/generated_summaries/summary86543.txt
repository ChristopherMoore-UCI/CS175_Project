Known as the "Almighty God" cult, the group latched on to the Mayan doomsday scenario to predict the sun will not shine and electricity will not work for three days beginning on December 21, an official with the Department of Public Security in the northwest province of Qinghai told CNN. The state-run Xinhua news agency reported that almost 100 people have been arrested so far, including 37 in Qinghai and 34 in Fujian province in the east of the country. According to Xinhua, the cult was established in 1990 in central China and requires its members to surrender their property to the group. Group members would spread doomsday rumors door-to-door or at public venues and claimed only they could save people's lives, according to authorities. CNN's CY Xu contributed to this report.
