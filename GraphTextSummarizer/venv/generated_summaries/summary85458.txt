Wife of captive Alan Henning begs ISIS to let him go Henning's friends plead with ISIS to let him go Barbara Henning said she'd been told that a Sharia -- or Islamic law -- court had found Alan Henning "innocent of being a spy and declared (him) to be no threat." Similar to what she'd said in a message Saturday, Barbara Henning said that Alan had gone to the region -- not to join one side or the other, or to spy for a certain group -- but to do what he could to improve the lives of people in the region. A taxi driver from near Manchester, England, Alan Henning was part of a team of volunteers that traveled to Syria in December to deliver food and water to people affected by the Middle Eastern country's devastating civil war. Barbara Henning noted the widespread sentiment voiced by Muslim leaders around the world calling for Alan's release.
