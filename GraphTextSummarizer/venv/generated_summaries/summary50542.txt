Deputy Director of Home Affairs Adeline Wong said in a statement that after a final medical check, hotel guests would be given medical certificates allowing them to travel. During that time, many guests stayed cocooned in their tiny rooms, flipping through channels on the television or staying connected with their work colleagues via Internet chats. Dragging luggage and carrying purses and backpacks, they were applauded and cheered by hotel workers and local officials, who formed what looked like a receiving line to send them off. The guests and hotel employees were kept in the Metropark Hotel for a week. None of them had the H1N1 virus, as swine flu is technically called, but health authorities imposed the lockdown May 1 after another hotel guest from Mexico was diagnosed with the disease.
