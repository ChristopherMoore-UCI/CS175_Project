District Judge John E. LeBlanc found Wright "was not competent to stand trial," Court Clerk Pam Cheriamie said. "The child had cerebral palsy and was bound to a wheelchair (and also had) additional disabilities," Thibodaux Police Chief Scott Silverii said in August. Thibodaux police were called to Wright's house on August 14 by a person who said a severed head was sitting on the side of a city street. A status hearing was scheduled for January 31 "to see if he's been rehabilitated and (is) competent enough for trial," Cheriamie said. He said Wright was sent to a state mental health facility in Jackson for further evaluation.
