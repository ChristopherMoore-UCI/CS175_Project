The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhage in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany, and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain. -- The outbreak of E. coli in Germany has killed several more people and sickened hundreds, authorities said Tuesday. News reports citing local authorities reported 16 deaths linked to E. coli in some raw vegetables. No longer contained in northern Germany, the outbreak has killed at least two people in the western part of the country. European Union spokeswoman Pia Ahrenkilde-Hansen told CNN that German authorities were examining cucumber batches from the Spanish cities of Almeria and Malaga as potential sources of infection.
