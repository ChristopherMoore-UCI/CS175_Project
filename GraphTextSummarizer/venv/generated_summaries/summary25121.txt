The moment has to happen sometime in a new administration, and the Afghanistan speech was it: the end of the Obama campaign of limitless aspiration and the acknowledgement of a presidency burdened by harsh realities and difficult choices. There was a clear subtext in the president's speech on Afghanistan: I wouldn't be in this awful situation if my predecessor hadn't sent troops to fight the wrong war in Iraq. But, knowing the threats that are out there, we have no choice: "If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan," Obama said, "I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow." Obama himself made it clear that Afghanistan is no Vietnam: After all, our enemies there weren't looking for ways to kill Americans at home. The candidate who had called the surge in the Iraq war "reckless" was proposing a surge of his own in Afghanistan.
