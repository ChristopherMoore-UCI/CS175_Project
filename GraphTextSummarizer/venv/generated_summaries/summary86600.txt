Shriver also served as chairman of the board of Special Olympics International, which Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded in 1968. -- Almost 50 years to the day that President John F. Kennedy in his inaugural address asked Americans to get involved by doing good, family and friends bade farewell Saturday to R. Sargent Shriver, who helped lead the way. "I am asking you to be apostles of Sarge," son Anthony Shriver told political and entertainment luminaries and ordinary people alike. After his brother-in-law John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Shriver was tapped by Johnson to launch the White House Office of Economic Opportunity, which was made up of a handful of anti-poverty programs. Former President Bill Clinton referred to Kennedy's famous line, "Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." Shriver, Clinton said at a funeral Mass in Potomac, Maryland, gave the perfect example of public service, both at the bright-eyed beginning of the 1960s and the cynical end of the decade and in the early 1970s.
