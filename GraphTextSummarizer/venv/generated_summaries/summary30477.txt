-- Turkish champions Fenerbahce have been withdrawn from the European Champions League group stage by the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) in relation to bribery and match fixing allegations. European football's governing body acted swiftly to end speculation over who will replace Fenerbahce by announcing that Trabzonspor, who finished second in the Turkish league last season, will take the final group stage berth. "The panel considered that the Turkish Football Federation took the right decision to protect the game, fully in line with our zero-tolerance policy against match-fixing,"  said UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino in a statement posted on UEFA's web site. "Regarding the heavy disciplinary sanctions both Fenerbahce and the Turkish Football Federation (TFF), which means Turkey might encounter, it is decided to ban Fenerbahce Sports Club from the UEFA Champions' League this season," read a statement posted on the TFF's official web site. But as the arrests mount the TFF decided to withdraw Fenerbahce before UEFA, European football's governing body, was forced to act on its behalf.
