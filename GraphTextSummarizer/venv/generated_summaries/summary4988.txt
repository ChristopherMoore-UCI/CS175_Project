The deal implements Islamic law, or sharia, in the Swat Valley region of North West Frontier Province. The central government has little control in the area, but it launched an intense military offensive in late July 2008 to flush out militants from areas of the North West Frontier Province. Last week, pro-Taliban cleric Sufi Mohammad announced he was pulling out of a peace deal for Swat Valley, saying the government was not serious about implementing Islamic law, or sharia, in the region. Mohammad brokered a cease-fire in February between the Pakistani government and his son-in-law, Maulana Fazlullah, who commands the Taliban in Swat Valley.
