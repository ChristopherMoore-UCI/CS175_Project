According to Hong Kong law, if the U.S. was to request the city to surrender Snowden, Beijing could step in only if its defence or foreign affairs would be significantly affected by Hong Kong's actions. "I see this incident as a stress test for Hong Kong society and its legal system." Claudia Mo, a member of the Hong Kong legislature who addressed the protesters, said the city of Hong Kong "owes Snowden at least some response. " "We're rallying in order not to disappoint him and to ask Hong Kong to protect his well-being, not to extradite him, and to uphold Hong Kong law," said blogger, activist and protest organizer Tom Grundy. Now he can only count on us, the power of Hong Kong civil society and our legal system," Ip Lam Chong of in-media told protesters. The three-hour protest, which kicked off in a garden in the city's business district and went on to the U.S. consulate and the Hong Kong government headquarters, failed to gain a strong sense of momentum, hampered in part by the narrow looping route allocated by the city's authorities.
