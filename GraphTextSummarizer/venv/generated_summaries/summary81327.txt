The moderates, the group of people associated with President Hassan Rouhani's presidential administration, are nudging toward an open admission that American military operations in Iraq compliment Tehran's policy goals. At the same time, contradictory statements made in Tehran make it clear that the Iranian authorities are divided about the implications of the American military's return to Iraq. In the corridors of power in Tehran, where no opportunity is missed to condemn American foreign policy at every turn, the silence was tantamount to a roaring approval of Washington's intervention. And given his stature inside the Iranian system his words must be seen as a peek into the internal policy debate in Tehran about the situation in Iraq and Iran's options. The moderates like to focus on the practical challenge at hand in Iraq and ways that Tehran and Washington can collaborate.
