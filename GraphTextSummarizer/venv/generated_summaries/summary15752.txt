We were able to go to the city of Tobruk in eastern Libya, where we saw that, despite what Colonel Gadhafi is saying, he is not in control of the eastern part of the country. One of the big concerns here is that the Libyan Air Force, which has been used against protesters in Tripoli, could be used again in this area to punish the people of eastern Libya for trying to overthrow the regime of Moammar Gadhafi. We also heard from some people that they have a plan to cut the export of oil from eastern Libya. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from eastern Libya. The target of the protests is Libya's leader, Moammar Gadhafi.
