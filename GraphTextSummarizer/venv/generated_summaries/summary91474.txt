-- Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard says he is happy to stay with the English Premier League side after reported interest from Spanish giants Real Madrid. Gerrard's future was the subject of much speculation after Liverpool finished seventh last season and failed to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League. He was linked with a move to Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid but he has underlined his commitment to Liverpool after a private meeting with manager Roy Hodgson, who took over from Rafael Benitez earlier this month. " Gerrard's declaration -- just a day after Liverpool announced the capture of England international Joe Cole -- was welcomed by Hodgson, who is also hoping to persuade Spain striker Fernando Torres to remain at the club. "Hopefully with the signing of Joe Cole -- and if we are lucky one or two others, to boost the squad -- we will be going into this season's competition, maybe stronger on paper than we were last season.
