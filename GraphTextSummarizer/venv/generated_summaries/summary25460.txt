Starting in 2006, the leader spent about $3 million a year to execute a public relations strategy that included paying think-tank analysts and former government officials to take a free trip to Libya for lectures, discussions and personal meetings with Gadhafi. -- Over four decades in power in Libya, Moammar Gadhafi portrayed himself as a revolutionary battling Western colonialism, the leader of a united Africa and the "king of kings" of his oil-rich desert nation and beyond. But Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador to Libya, said the effect of Gadhafi's rule was to leave himself as the nation's sole authority. Gadhafi said he wanted to unite the Arab world, and even proclaimed a merger of Egypt, Libya and Syria in 1972. Then-U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice met with Gadhafi in 2008 and "thought he was serious" about Libya's turnabout.
