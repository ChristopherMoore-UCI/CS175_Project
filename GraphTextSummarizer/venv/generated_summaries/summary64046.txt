Several cities in eastern China have suspended trading in live poultry in an effort to contain the problem. Hong Kong's Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced Friday that poultry imported from companies in mainland China would be subjected to "fast tests" for the H7N9 and H5N1 strains of the virus. The virus involved, H7N9, is known to affect pigeons but wasn't discovered in humans until a series of cases was reported in China last week. -- A 7-year-old girl is the latest person to be infected with bird flu in China -- and the first case in the Chinese capital, the country's official Xinhua news agency reported Saturday. While the source of the infection is unknown, poultry markets have become the focus of the investigation by China's health ministry and the World Health Organization, which are closely monitoring the cases.
