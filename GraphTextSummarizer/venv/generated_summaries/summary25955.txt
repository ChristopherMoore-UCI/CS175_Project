He told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday the two sections that resonated the most with him are the ones about introspection and encouragement: -- I'M INTROSPECTIVE, because sometimes I want to take "our" side without looking at the facts in situations like these. It makes us lash out in anger and makes us point fingers," he told CNN. Sometimes I'm just as prejudiced as people I point fingers at. While the religious nature of that final section may turn some readers off, Watson says he thinks it points to a way that people of different races can solve some of the issues they face. "It's OK to be angry and to identify your emotion as being angry, because like I said later we like to protect our own," he told CNN.
