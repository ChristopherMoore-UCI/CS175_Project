Colony predicted that Apple's long-term fate will mirror that of onetime industry leaders like Sony and Kodak when they lost enigmatic leaders, or Disney in the 20 years after Walt Disney's death. The iPhone and iPad maker will coast for two to four years on its current momentum, Colony said; but Jobs, who died in October, left a void because his successor, Apple CEO Tim Cook, doesn't possess his star power. -- The CEO of a top research firm didn't mince words about Apple in a new blog post. "Apple will decline in the post Steve Jobs era," wrote George Colony, CEO of Forrester Research. " Colony pointed to Apple executives Jon Ive and Scott Forstall as being better suited to run the company, saying they appear to possess the charisma and design sense to "legitimately" lead Apple. "Charismatic organizations are run by people with 'the gift of grace,' " he wrote, citing sociologist Max Weber.
