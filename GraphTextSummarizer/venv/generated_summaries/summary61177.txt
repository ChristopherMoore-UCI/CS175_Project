" In the section where alumni list their awards, Kaczynski's entry reads: "eight life sentences, issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, 1998. The Harvard Alumni Association said in a statement Thursday that they "regret publishing Kaczynski's references to his convictions and apologize for any distress that it may have caused others." The Boston Globe published an apparent photo of the entry, which lists Kaczynski's occupation as "prisoner" and his address as "No 04475-046, US Penitentiary-Max, P.O. Box 8500, Florence, CO 8126-8500. " Kaczynski's entry was published in a class reunion report, which was distributed in advance of the 1962 reunion. Ted Kaczynski, the so-called "Unabomber" and Harvard alumnus, listed his eight life sentences for a string of bombings that killed three people and wounded 23 others as an "award" in the class of 1962 report.
