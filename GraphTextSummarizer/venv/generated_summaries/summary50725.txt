The two statements were repeated several times by owners and members of the team's front office during a media day news conference Wednesday, the first 20 minutes of which were dominated by questions about star running back Adrian Peterson, who stands accused of felony child abuse in Texas. "This is a good decision that will allow Adrian Peterson to resolve his personal situation and the Vikings to return the focus to the football field," NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in an email to CNN. " Adrian Peterson and the false gospel of spanking Hardin said that "Adrian never intended to harm his son and deeply regrets the unintentional injury." After Wilf left the podium, a reporter asked Wilf's brother, co-owner Mark Wilf, general manager Rick Spielman and Kevin Warren, executive vice president of legal affairs, whether the team wanted to apologize to the boy that Peterson is charged with abusing or the boy's mother. The developments came as CNN affiliate KHOU reported this week that Peterson allegedly abused another one of his children -- a 4-year-old son.
