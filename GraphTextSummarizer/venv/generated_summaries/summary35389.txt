-- Two Pakistani girls who were injured in an attack that nearly took the life of their classmate, schoolgirl activist Malala Yousufzai, are to be honored with a medal of courage, Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Saturday. The attack prompted anger against the Taliban and an outpouring of support for Malala, both in Pakistan, where thousands rallied in her name, and internationally. The militants' target, Malala, was well-known for her efforts to encourage her fellow Pakistanis to stand up to the Taliban, who have been trying to push girls from classrooms. The Taliban, who claimed responsibility for the attack, issued a statement online saying that if Malala lived, they would come after her again. Malala is face of global attacks on schools "I want to tell all the girls to continue their mission to get an education," Kainat told CNN.
