People called Cook "Little Darrin," as his dad was "Big Darrin." " Cook returned home to New Orleans and talked his goals over with childhood friend Semone Jackson. Many people in our community started getting active because of Darrin. "Food and I went together like red beans and rice," Cook, 21, writes in his upcoming book, "The Weight of New Orleans." Cook is an entrepreneur -- CEO of My Mogul Media -- and splits his time between New Orleans and an office in Atlanta.
