" In summer 2014, Burse, who is president of Kentucky State University, gave up $90,000 of his almost $350,000 salary so that 24 of the university's lowest paid workers could earn $10.25 an hour. "Going through that process I learned a lot about sacrificing, waiting your turn and being thankful for what you have." Although his father attended school only through the third grade and his mother the seventh, Burse was a Rhodes Scholar, a graduate of Harvard Law School and a university president by age 30. Burse's actions spurred a pay-it-forward movement around the university, with an increase in small acts of kindness and donations to the school. In December, Burse offered high school shooting victim Javaugntay Burroughs a full scholarship. "I did that for three to four weeks and finally I went to lunch with a couple of my friends, a couple of them Kentucky State graduates," said Burse.
