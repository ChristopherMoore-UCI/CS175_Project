Suppes says he became hooked on fusion after watching a video featuring Robert W. Bussard, an American physicist who worked primarily in nuclear fusion energy research. According to Milora, the drawback to nuclear fusion now is that reactors capable of creating large enough amounts of energy cost billions of dollars and have yet to require less energy than they produce, or, "net energy. Schatzkin has been following nuclear fusion since 1973 and his site provides a forum for aspiring fusion researchers. By day, Suppes is a freelance web developer at Gucci, but at night he works in a warehouse lab in Brooklyn, New York, experimenting with nuclear fusion. " If fusion reactors could produce net energy, "it would have a profound impact, because there are thousands of years of fuel available," he says.
