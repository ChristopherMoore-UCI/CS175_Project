-- English Premier League leaders Chelsea have successfully ended their dispute with French club Lens over the signing of Gael Kakuta, ending the possibility of a worldwide transfer suspension until mid-2011. Chelsea were fined $180,000 to cover player development costs, which the club said they would still pay Lens. "It was always our intention to work together with Lens to reach this end, and both clubs have strengthened their relationship as a result of resolving this case to everyone's satisfaction," chairman Bruce Buck told the Chelsea Web site. CAS announced on Thursday that it had ratified an agreement between Chelsea and Lens which had effectively ended the arbitration procedure. "In an act of good faith and with a view to the possibility of future collaboration with Lens, and without recognizing any liability, Chelsea has agreed to pay compensation costs for the training given to the player while at Lens, as mandated by FIFA in its original ruling.
