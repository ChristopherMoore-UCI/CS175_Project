"Right now, we have about a million panels," says Scott Crider with Sempra Energy, a California-based energy resources company. The town is uniquely poised to cash in on the new energy boom precisely because it was built on old energy technology; during another time when the economy and energy collided; when thousands of jobless men came here during the Great Depression to undertake an unprecedented power-generating project. Nevada is aggressively courting more solar firms, convinced that if they can get enough into place, the whole state can benefit from being a major green energy source for neighboring super state California. But it is impressive: row after row after row of black glass panels tilted toward the sun, quietly soaking energy from the sky. "There is strong demand for cleaner sources of energy, and we're going to help fill that niche."
