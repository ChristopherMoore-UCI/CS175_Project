Average per-gallon prices in other cities: Charleston, South Carolina: $3.41 Atlanta: $3.50 Denver: $3.57 Minneapolis: $3.63 Las Vegas: $3.67 Boston: $3.69 Sacramento, California: $3.86 Lundberg expects the national per-gallon average to fall a few more cents this week as long as the price of crude doesn't jump. "More U.S. refineries are gaining access to lower-priced domestic and Canadian oils and passing these benefits on to their marketers and retailers in the form of slashed wholesale gasoline prices," Lundberg said. Lundberg attributes most of the latest drop to lower crude oil prices, but she also credits a more plentiful supply. -- A year ago at this time, U.S. gasoline prices averaged $3.97 a gallon.
