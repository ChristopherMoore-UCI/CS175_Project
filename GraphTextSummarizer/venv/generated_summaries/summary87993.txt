-- Two-time defending Fed Cup champions Italy battled back to level at 1-1 against Australia in Saturday's first-round tie in the women's tennis teams competition, while 2010 runners-up the United States went 2-0 behind against Belgium. There will be everything to play for at Hobart's Domain tennis center on Sunday, after wins for Australia's Jarmila Groth and Italy's Flavia Pennetta in the opening singles matches left the first-round tie finely poised. Should Kuznetsova and Sharapova fare better in Sunday's reverse singles matches, the result of the tie could come down to a doubles match set to feature another struggling former world number one, Dinara Safina. "It was fun to be out here playing again," said the world number two, who will seal victory for her country if she beats Mattek-Sands in Sunday's first singles match. "I made a great start," said Kvitova, who faces Hantuchova in Sunday's first reverse singles.
