A German man who called himself Clark Rockefeller and passed himself off for years as a member of the moneyed clan was sentenced Friday to four to five years in prison for kidnapping his daughter. He described Gerhartsreiter as a controlling man who was angry that his former wife, Sandra Boss, had moved with their daughter to London in December 2007. Judge Frank M. Gaziano noted that Gerhartsreiter showed little regard for the impact his actions had on his former wife and daughter. The man who said he was Clark Rockefeller actually is Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter. "Today the victims in this case have some sense of justice, I hope," said Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley
