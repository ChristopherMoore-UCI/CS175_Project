Officials at Jinnah Hospital said the dead included eight members of airport security forces, two Pakistan International Airlines employees and one ranger. Several days ago, Pakistan's government had warned provincial officials of a possible "high-profile attack on a sensitive or key installation," but the warning did not mention the airport, said Qaim Ali Shah, chief minister of Sindh province. All ten militants involved in the attack were killed, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said. Earlier Sunday, at least 22 people were killed in twin suicide bomb attacks in Taftan, Pakistan, near the country's border with Iran. The airport's cargo area is about a kilometer (0.62 miles) away from the area where commercial planes take off.
