Monfils, who brushed aside top seed Nadal in straight sets, 6-3 6-4, will now play his compatriot for the first title of the 2012 ATP Tour season. Tsonga holds a 2-1 career winning record over Monfils, but he lost their last encounter in Montpellier in 2010. Swiss maestro Federer had nursed back spasms during his wins over Greg Zemlja and Andreas Seppi and undergone treatment between matches as well as taking painkillers. -- Roger Federer pulled out of his defense of the Qatar Open Friday with a back injury before his arch-rival Rafael Nadal was beaten in the semifinals of the $1 million tournament by Gael Monfils. But with the Australian Open looming on Monday week, the 16-time grand slam champion decided against risking the injury against Tsonga.
