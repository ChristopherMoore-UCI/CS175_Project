While airlines have to get into specifics for bag fees, the rest can be listed in ranges of fees, making the information somewhat less useful. Under the new rules, anytime a fare quote is given, airlines have to let passengers know that "bag fees may apply." One actual victory for travelers here centers around which bag fees get charged when a traveler is booked on codesharing airlines for trips beginning or ending in the U.S. Today, if you buy a ticket on, say, American, but your first flight is on its codeshare partner Etihad, then the baggage rules on Etihad usually apply. If there is a change in bag fees or baggage allowances, the airlines must prominently display a link to the change on their homepages for at least three months. On some airline websites and in ads, you've probably seen fares displayed as a certain amount plus taxes and fees.
