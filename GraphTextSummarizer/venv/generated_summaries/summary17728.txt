-- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has penned a letter to President Obama, telling his American counterpart that Iran is Obama's only option for success, state-run media reported. This way is Iran," Ahmadinejad said in a nationally televised speech Tuesday, according to the Iranian Republic News Agency (IRNA). "The time when they imagine that they can do any harm on Iran is over," Ahmadinejad said, according to IRNA. " Ahmadinejad spoke just days after the conclusion of a 47-nation nuclear summit convened by Obama to raise global awareness of the threat of nuclear terrorism. In 2006, Ahmadinejad wrote a letter to then-President George W. Bush in which he proposed "new ways" to end a standoff regarding Iran's nuclear program.
