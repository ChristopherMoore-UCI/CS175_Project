Hernandez -- who was a stock clerk in Lower Manhattan in May 1979 -- admitted that he choked the boy after luring him into the basement of a Manhattan grocery store, police said. A grand jury on Wednesday indicted New Jersey resident Hernandez on charges of second-degree murder first-degree kidnapping. The attorney's statement Thursday morning came after Pedro Hernandez made a brief appearance in Manhattan criminal court. " "We believe the evidence that Mr. Hernandez killed Etan Patz to be credible and persuasive, and that his statements are not the product of any mental illness," she said Wednesday. Etan disappeared on May 25, roughly a month before Hernandez left New York to resume living at his mother's south Jersey home, according to family members and police.
