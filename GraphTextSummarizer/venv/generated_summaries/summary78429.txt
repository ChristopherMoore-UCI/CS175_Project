Erickson implicated Ferguson at trial, as did Trump, who had gone to prison himself on a parole violation the month after the murder. Though court documents say none of the DNA at the crime scene matched Ferguson or Erickson, the judge cited only the witness's wife's interview in overturning Ferguson's conviction. He said his first stop as a free man might be at a Dairy Queen, and the profile photo on the Free Ryan Ferguson Facebook site was later updated to show a grinning Ferguson in a gray V-neck sweater, sitting at a bar with a beer and a steak. Trump testified that a newspaper article his wife sent him in prison in early 2004 jogged his memory about what he saw that night, court documents say. Ryan Ferguson, vindicated in the murder of a Missouri newspaper editor, said Wednesday he holds few grudges against an old pal whose bogus testimony landed him in prison for a decade.
