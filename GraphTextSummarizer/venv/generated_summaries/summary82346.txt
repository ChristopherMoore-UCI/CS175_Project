Turkish president calls for reform Turkey's president warned about the threats this polarization posed in an address before the Turkish parliament Tuesday. Turkish authorities' use of live ammunition, tear gas, beatings and sexual assaults to crush street protests earlier this year constitute "human rights violations on a massive scale," according to a report by human rights watchdog Amnesty International. Government announces democratic reforms Amnesty International's report emerged two days after the Turkish government unveiled a long-awaited series of reforms, which  the rights group said fails "to address these violations or to take any serious steps to ensure that they will not occur in the future. Amnesty documented cases of Turkish riot police firing plastic bullets and tear gas canisters at the heads of protesters. "The levels of violence used by police in the course of Gezi Park protests clearly show what happens when poorly trained, poorly supervised police officers are instructed to use force -- and encouraged to use it unsparingly -- safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely ever to be identified or prosecuted for their abuses," said Amnesty International's Turkey expert, Andrew Gardner.
