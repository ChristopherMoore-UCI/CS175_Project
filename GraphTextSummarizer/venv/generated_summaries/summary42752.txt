" â€¢ Certain categories of confidential information will no longer be used in discharge proceedings, including information provided to lawyers, clergy and psychotherapists. The Pentagon will raise the level of the officer authorized to start a fact-finding inquiry or separation proceeding as a result of alleged homosexual conduct to a general or flag officer in the accused service member's chain of command. Information provided to a doctor as part of a service member's medical treatment or to a medical official in the course of a public health inquiry also will not be used in discharge proceedings. Among other things, Gates said the Pentagon is raising the threshold for what constitutes an appropriate level of information necessary to launch a "credible inquiry" into allegations of homosexual behavior. Only a general or flag officer in an accused service member's chain of command will be authorized to initiate expulsion proceedings.
