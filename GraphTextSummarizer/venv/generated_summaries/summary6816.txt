Roughly six months each year, Amma leaves her ashram and travels the world, holding meetings in hotel ballrooms in major cities in the United States, Europe and South America. Followers come from all over the world to Amma's ashram, or spiritual center, in Kerala, South India, to get a hug; many choose to stay. They send out Amma's newsletters, serve guests in the cafe (one for Western food, one for Indian food) and organize the thousands of visitors who come for a day, a week or several months. "I want to awaken motherhood in both men and women," Amma says, referring to selfless love. Amma has donated millions of dollars to help the victims of the tsunami in South Asia and Hurricane Katrina in the United States.
