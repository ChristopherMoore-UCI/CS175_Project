ICE agent Kelton Harrison was shot Tuesday morning near Hargill, Texas, while he and other agents were conducting surveillance relating to an anticipated narcotics deal. -- A father and son in south Texas were charged Thursday with shooting an agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, federal authorities said. The court document said Harrison finally lost control of his car and when other agents arrived on the scene they discovered he'd been shot in back. "We are encouraged by this action to bring these criminals to justice," said ICE Director John Morton. A Justice Department press release said the minor involved in the case was turned over to state authorities.
