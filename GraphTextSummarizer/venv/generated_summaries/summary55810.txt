One of the best mother-daughter-friend relationships is between Rory and Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) on "Gilmore Girls." The Frisky: 10 worst boyfriends and husbands of 2009 I secretly loved "The Lizzie McGuire Show" and Lizzie's mom, Jo McGuire (Hallie Todd), was so sweet. My personal favorite is Kitty Foreman (Debra Jo Rupp) from "That '70s Show." Marion Cunningham (Marion Ross) from "Happy Days" was similar to Kitty from "That '70s Show," but much less of a lush. Plus, she was always dancing and wearing really amazing '80s fashions.
