The last thing this country needs is more government spending, especially on such wasteful measures as stimulus packages. Government attempts to boost the economy through measures such as stimulus packages merely take money from hardworking taxpayers and throw that money into unproductive endeavors, into the sectors of the economy that already suffer from malinvestment or into make-work projects. In the case of the current economic crisis, it had its root in loose monetary policy and easy credit that skewed the allocation of resources within the economy. We have wasted trillions of dollars in the past year and a half in stimulus packages, bailouts and guarantees to unsound companies. Loose monetary policy, easy credit and too much debt created the bubble and got us into this economic crisis.
