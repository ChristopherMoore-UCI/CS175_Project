Unfortunately, a lean purse has forced Street Skills to go from monthly group meetings to more one-on-one sessions, which Felix says are not as effective as group meetings. His experiences as a "former street boy" now making money through legitimate means enabled him to get through to some of the scammers, he said. Adeolu's method is to teach the young men how to use the same skills developed from years of diligently scamming hard currency from gullible Westerners, to make legitimate money online. Felix first contacted Adeolu in 2007 after coming across his blog which provided information on various online investment schemes. The most foolish argument I've heard from the never-ending efforts to discourage young Nigerians from cybercrime is that money isn't everything.
