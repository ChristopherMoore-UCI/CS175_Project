Massa was again well off the pace at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday, despite improvements to the vehicle which helped Alonso finish second and move level on points with championship leader Sebastian Vettel. The Brazilian suffered the embarrassment of being lapped by Alonso and Williams' race winner Pastor Maldonado, coming in 15th to leave him with just two points from the opening five rounds. "This year, the winner will be whoever manages to bring the best technical updates to the track in the shortest time possible: staying still for just a handful of races could mean finishing out of the points, given that so many teams have proved capable of fighting for the top places. But the former Sauber driver has struggled to reach those heights since, partly due to a freak accident at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix which left him with a fractured skull. Meanwhile, F1 chiefs are still investigating the fire that cast a shadow over Williams' first grand prix victory since 2004 and the first race victory by a Venezuelan driver.
