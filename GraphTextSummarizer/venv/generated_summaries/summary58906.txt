The death toll from a prison fire in central Honduras rose to 382 Thursday, as new details emerged about what happened when flames tore through the overcrowded facility. The hypothesis that a mattress fire started the blaze was gaining traction, fire operations chief Jorge Turcios said Thursday. The prison facility was well over capacity, said Rodrigo Escobar Gil of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. "What I know, according to what I've been told, is that someone lit a mattress on fire and said, 'We're all going to die,'" At the request of Honduran officials, arson experts from the United States were expected to arrive in Honduras Thursday to lend a hand, Turcios said.
