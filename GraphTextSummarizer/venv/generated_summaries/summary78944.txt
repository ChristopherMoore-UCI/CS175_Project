When Head Start programs close, many parents must miss work or school to find alternative care for their children, the association said. "The Arnolds' most generous act epitomizes what it means to be an angel investor; they have selflessly stepped up for Head Start children to ensure their path toward kindergarten readiness is not interrupted by the inability of government to get the nation's fiscal house in order," the association's executive director, Yasmina Vinci, said in a written statement. " Head Start is a federal program that helps low-income children from birth to age 5 prepare for school. -- Early childhood programs for low-income families in six states, forced to close because of the government shutdown, will reopen with the help of $10 million in emergency funding from billionaire Houston couple Laura and John Arnold, the National Head Start Association said Tuesday. The Head Start Association said it will repay the Arnolds if the government, after the shutdown, provides funding to keep programs operational for a year.
