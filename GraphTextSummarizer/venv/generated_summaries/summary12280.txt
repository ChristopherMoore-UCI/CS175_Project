Saleh uses religion to give himself legitimacy and support his policies." Yemen's largest opposition bloc rejected Saleh's stance against women. Prominent activist Tawakkol Karman said Saleh was shocked to see women leading Yemen's revolt. "Saleh has finally shown the world his real face and his hatred against women," said Karman, a leading member of Islah, the largest opposition party in Yemen. The government said protesters "misused" Saleh's comments, prompted by a belief that the opposition was using women and youth to promote their own agenda, and not the greater good of Yemen. "Saleh is the first to support women's rights and has always shown interest in involving women in Yemeni politics," said Zaid Thari, a senior member of the ruling General People's Congress party.
