Combative Nixon defended legacy to grand jury For Nixonologists, Nixon's pre-dawn conversation with young students, under the stone-faced gaze of another wartime president, is part political theater and part history. On Thursday, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum released Nixon's 45-minute Dictabelt sound recordings in which the embattled president gives his firsthand account of the May 9, 1970, visit. On a Spring day in 1970, just five days after National Guard troops opened fire on anti-war demonstrators at Kent State University, a restless president awoke in the pre-dawn hours, strolled to the Lincoln sitting room, and sat down to listen to some music. In his tape-recorded dictation, Nixon said his car arrived at the memorial about 4:40 a.m., and he walked up the steps to the Lincoln statue. "I have never seen the Secret Service quite so petrified with apprehension," Nixon said a few days later.
