On phones and tablets, Verizon is the only cellular carrier that offers NFL games through an exclusive deal. For the first time ever the Super Bowl, along with some postseason NFL games, will be streamed online and through the league's mobile apps, the NFL and partner Verizon Wireless announced Tuesday. NBC's live stream will run different ads from those on TV, but Super Bowl viewers will be able to pull up the TV commercials on demand through the website shortly after they air, an NBC Sports spokesman said. The NFL does not stream most games for free during the regular season. Mobile devices with 3G service, such as the iPhone, iPad or older smartphones, require a $10-per-month Verizon Video subscription, she said.
