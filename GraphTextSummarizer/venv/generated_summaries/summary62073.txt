-- Some of Britain's most influential former military figures are under investigation after allegedly boasting about their ability to secure arms contracts for private firms in violation of British law. The Sunday Times says its three-month investigation focused on "the revolving door between the Ministry of Defence and private arms companies. Another retired military official, Lt. Gen. Richard Applegate -- a former ministry procurement chief -- was captured on video allegedly describing a secret lobbying campaign in parliament on behalf of an Israeli arms company. " Among those named in the newspaper's investigation was recently retired Lt. Gen. Sir John Kiszely, a Falklands war hero and former head of the Defence Academy. Former military officers have no influence over what (ministry) contracts are awarded," said Philip Hammond, the defense secretary.
