-- President Barack Obama wrapped up a European trip dominated by Russia's annexation of Crimea by shifting the focus of the U.S. and allied response to helping Ukraine rather than confronting Moscow. " While Obama pledged tougher sanctions on Russia if President Vladimir Putin continued his expansionist ways, he emphasized steps that don't involve the Russians -- such as Thursday's announcement that the International Monetary Fund would lend Ukraine up to $18 billion. "I've been very clear in saying that we are going to do everything we can to support Ukraine and the Ukrainian people," Obama said Thursday at his final European news conference of the trip, this time in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi. Time to hold Russia accountable for its aggression Asked by reporters about cuts to military spending by European allies as part of austerity measures, Obama said there was a limit. While Renzi and other European leaders have pledged a unified response to any further Russian expansion efforts, questions remain about whether Germany, Britain and other nations with significant economic ties to Russia would join in threatened sanctions targeting major sectors of the Russian economy.
