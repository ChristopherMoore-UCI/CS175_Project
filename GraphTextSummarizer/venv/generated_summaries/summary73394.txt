Although companies may need to soften their stricter policies, such as blocking social networks at work, employees need to get their attitude in check! Elcio Barcelos, a Vice President of Global Staffing at HP confirms this by saying that "companies need to be able to provide diverse career paths for individuals today." It's imperative that professionals start to view companies as career incubators instead of time wasters. Companies can retain employees longer by supporting their value systems, giving them meaningful work, becoming a social company and understanding generational differences. Professionals have numerous reasons for departing a company, including corporate downsizing, insufficient career opportunities, and a desire to either get an advanced degree or switch to another field completely.
