Cases deemed illegal for obscenity last year and this year were 41 and 45 respectively, while those violating national security jumped from 28 to 159, according to the commission. Social media users and civic groups decried the Thursday announcement, saying it clamps down on freedom of expression. -- South Korea plans to intensify the review of its social networking sites and smart phone applications to combat a surge in "illegal and harmful" information, government officials said. The Korea Communications Standards Commission said it will reshuffle departments to make way for a review team that will oversee new media content. "This is an authoritarian and anachronistic abuse of power that strips people of their freedom of expression and political freedom by blocking their eyes and ears," one of South Korea's largest civic organizations, People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, said in a news release.
