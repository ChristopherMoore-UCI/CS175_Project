" Straight sets for Nole With Becker courtside, Djokovic captured the Mubadala World Tennis Championship for a record third time by easing past Ferrer, 7-5 6-2, and pocketed $250,000. Andy Murray got the ball rolling by hiring eight-time grand slam winner Ivan Lendl at the end of 2011, with Djokovic turning to six-time major champion Boris Becker this month. The world No. 1 will now compete at next week's Qatar Open in Doha and was looking forward to more training time. And just this week, Roger Federer added six-time grand slam winner Stefan Edberg -- who was a playing rival of Lendl and Becker -- to his team in a bid to recapture old form. I believe all of us who made arrangements with ex players (are) looking forward to the help on court during big moments.
