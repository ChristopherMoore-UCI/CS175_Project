-- A man has been arrested in connection with the July shooting death of former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, Atlanta police said Tuesday night. Atlanta police told CNN affiliate WSB-TV in July that Forrest chased the suspect and that gunfire was exchanged. Demario Ware, 20, turned himself in to police on Tuesday and is being held in the Fulton County jail on charges of murder, armed robbery and aggravated assault, Atlanta police said. Forrest, 38, was shot in a neighborhood southwest of downtown Atlanta on the night of July 25. Forrest's longtime friend and manager, Charles Watson, said last month that Forrest was returning from the gym after a late workout when he and his godson stopped at a Southwest Atlanta gas station on the night Forrest was shot.
