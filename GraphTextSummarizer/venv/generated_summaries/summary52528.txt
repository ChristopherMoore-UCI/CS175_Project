In 1994, then House Speaker Newt Gingrich pushed a series of reforms designed to circulate more members through leadership jobs. In short, Boehner, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Harry Reid and Sen. Mitch McConnell have been the leaders, presiding over the worst stretch of job approval numbers this branch of government has had since 1974. Picture this: August 2014 and House Speaker John Boehner is on the campaign trail in Iowa stomping for then-congressional hopeful Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Worse yet, Gingrich failed to get the votes needed to impose term limits on members of Congress. Yet there's something profoundly deflating about seeing the same leaders of what was routinely referred to as "the worst Congress in history" all back to reprise their staring roles in 2015 (though McConnell has swapped jobs with Reid as Democrats lost control of the Senate to the GOP in the midterms).
