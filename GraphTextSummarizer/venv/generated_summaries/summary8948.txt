While Myanmar has been praised for reforms in recent years, rights groups say the tide appears to have turned when it comes to media freedom. "CPJ is alarmed that journalists were tried under a 100-year-old spying statute and slammed with an outrageously harsh sentence," said CPJ's Asia program coordinator Bob Dietz, Asia program coordinator in a statement calling for donor countries to Myanmar to exert pressure over the case. Aung Zaw, editor of news magazine The Irrawaddy, told CNN the case showed it was "back to square one" in terms of press freedom in Myanmar, also known as Burma. 'Back to square one' Scores of journalists, some of them wearing T-shirts that read "Stop killing press," gathered at Yangon's Shwedagon Pagoda Friday offering prayers for the sentenced journalists Friday, while some publications printed blacked-out front pages in protest. The sentencing has drawn an outcry from international media and rights watchdogs, who say it is evidence of a drastic rollback of press freedoms this year in a country that had been praised for its reforms since 2011.
