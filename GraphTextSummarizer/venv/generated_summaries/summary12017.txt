Nine states and the District of Columbia issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, including three states -- Maryland, Washington, and Maine -- where voters approved it in ballot initiatives last year. Extending the right to marry and adopt to same-sex couples in France was one of President Francois Hollande's electoral pledges in campaigning last year. The issue also has divided Australia, where lawmakers voted against a bill to legalize same-sex marriage last September. "France is a secular society, so it's very different from other countries where religion plays a large part in the question of marriage," he said. Known in France as the PACS (pacte civil de solidarite), the civil union agreement can be entered into by same-sex or straight couples and confers many but not all of the rights of marriage.
