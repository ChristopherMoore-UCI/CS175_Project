"During our exhaustive search to find Hazel Grace Lancaster, I saw some stunning auditions by today's finest young actresses," director Josh Boone tells EW in an exclusive statement. The best selling "The Fault in Our Stars" by John Green (and an EW Best Fiction of 2012 pick) tells the story of Gus and Hazel, two teenagers who meet in a cancer support group and fall in love. (From the EW review: "Their ensuing love story is as real as it is doomed, and the gut-busting laughs that come early in the novel make the luminous final pages all the more heartbreaking.") Producer Wyck Godfrey (who knows a little something about adapting popular YA novels to the big screen as he worked on all the Twilight movies) says, "When choosing the writers, director and now our first actor for Fault we've gone with the people that have had the strongest, most emotional and insightful connection to the material. " 'DWTS,' 'Dallas,' 'Real Housewives' recaps "I am absolutely thrilled that Shailene will be playing Hazel in The Fault in Our Stars," John Green says. -- Shailene Woodley has been offered the role of Hazel Grace Lancaster in the adaptation of John Green's "The Fault in Our Stars."
