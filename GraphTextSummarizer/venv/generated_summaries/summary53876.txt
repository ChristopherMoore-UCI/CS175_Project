As for the show's true stars, Kermit and Miss Piggy, it's nice to have them back, but I have to say they've never had the same spark since original voice artists Jim Henson and Frank Oz passed the baton to Steve Whitmire and Eric Jacobson. The first Muppet movie ("More entertaining than humanly possible!") boasted cameos by Bob Hope, Mel Brooks, Edgar Bergen, Milton Berle, Steve Martin and Richard Pryor -- not to mention Orson Welles -- a bill that positioned Kermit and company as the natural heirs to a half-century or more of prime-time vaudeville shtick. When Gary invites his girlfriend Mary (Amy Adams) for a romantic getaway to Los Angeles, it's only natural that he would invite Walter along too: For as long as they both can remember, it's been Walter's dream to visit the Muppet Studios. Segel hasn't given himself enough to do as Gary, whose defining characteristic is neglecting Mary -- and if you're going to go to the trouble of inventing a new Muppet (Walter), why make him a bland nonentity? Catch up with Kermit and Miss Piggy Enter Jason Segel, who fessed up to a fetish for singing puppets in "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and who has taken up the challenge of making Jim Henson's fabric-and-thread creations relevant to today's digital generation.
