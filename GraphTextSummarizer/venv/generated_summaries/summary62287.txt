On Christmas Day, McConaughey's longtime love -- and mother of his two children, Levi, 3, and Vida, who turns 2 in January -- became his fiancÃ©. "They were laughing the entire time," said an onlooker who glimpsed McConaughey and Alves at a Japanese restaurant in November 2007. And with an acting career and a family life to balance, the actor was taking his romance with Alves to new heights. The bachelor-turned-family man told PEOPLE in March 2011 that he was learning Portuguese, Alves's native language that she grew up speaking in Brazil. In early 2008, McConaughey told his fans that he was starting a family with Alves.
