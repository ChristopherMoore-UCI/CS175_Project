-- Running back Todd Gurley, one of the front-runners for college football's Heisman Trophy, was suspended indefinitely on Thursday by the University of Georgia as the school investigates a possible violation of NCAA rules. "I'm obviously very disappointed," Georgia head football coach Mark Richt said in a two-paragraph statement on the school's athletics department website. Bleacher Report predicted this week that Gurley, a junior from Tarboro, North Carolina, will be a mid-first round pick in next year's NFL draft. Georgia didn't say what kind of alleged violation officials are investigating. Gurley has rushed for 773 yards in five games and scored eight touchdowns for 10th-ranked Georgia.
