Despite the absurdity of it all, Seinfeld writer Dan O'Keefe said he, in fact, grew up with this peculiar holiday of his own father's creation, and the "airing of grievances" into a tape recorder was a real part of it. While the episode originally aired on December 18, 1997, the holiday and its eccentric customs -- like the "feats of strength" and "airing of grievances" -- live on with much fanfare. But when the show's other writers and Jerry Seinfeld caught wind of it from O'Keefe's brother, majority opinion prevailed. If I had, I would've been raised by the state of New York," O'Keefe told CNN in a 2013 interview about the "feats of strength" that appear in the episode. Much like Costanza, O'Keefe didn't want the tradition to leave the family circle.
