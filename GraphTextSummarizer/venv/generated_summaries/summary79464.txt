Vintage Chelsea it wasn't, but the result was all that mattered to Chelsea skipper Terry. -- After being humbled by Manchester City in the FA Cup and drawing against West Bromwich Albion in the English Premier League, Chelsea could hardly afford to drop points against Everton on Saturday. And it was the man who has been dubbed 'Mr. Chelsea,' the returning John Terry, who struck deep in injury time following a free kick from another Chelsea veteran, Frank Lampard. The Gunners, however, once again cut the deficit to one point by later easing past Sunderland 4-1 and Man City stayed within three points of Chelsea -- with a game in hand -- courtesy of a 1-0 win over Stoke City. Chelsea could only go one way -- up -- and keeper Tim Howard foiled Lampard, Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic before Terry's winner.
