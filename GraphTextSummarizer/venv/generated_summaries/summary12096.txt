Nuclear strategy promoted the concept of "bouncing the rubble," signifying the premise of destruction that nuclear war would unleash. By allowing us to restart inspections, verifications and the dismantling of nuclear assets, New START has established transparency, predictability and stability that serves the security of the whole world. The establishment of such a ban on nuclear testing would further strengthen American security. The United States and the Soviet Union signed the agreement in 1991, enhancing stability between the two nations and allowing for a drastic reduction in nuclear weapons. In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, our greatest threat has not been nuclear weapons fueled by uranium, but buried homemade bombs fueled by fertilizer.
