The bus, operated by interstate carrier Megabus, was headed from Atlanta to Chicago when the driver attempted to avoid a vehicle involved in a previous accident in rainy conditions in Greenwood, about 12 miles southeast of downtown Indianapolis. The crash happened at about 4:30 a.m., said Sean Hughes, corporate affairs associate director for Coach USA North America, which operates Megabus. -- A double-deck commercial bus overturned on Interstate 65 south of Indianapolis early Tuesday, injuring at least 26 people and temporarily stopping traffic on the northbound lanes, Indiana State Police said. Our first thoughts and best wishes are with everyone involved," Hughes said. Shawn O'Keefe said.
