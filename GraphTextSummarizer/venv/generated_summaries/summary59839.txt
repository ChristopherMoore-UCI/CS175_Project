-- Asia's first grand slam singles champion Li Na has called time on her 15-year tennis career due to "chronic" knee injuries. "The sport is just too competitive, too good, to not be 100%." Li, who played in three Olympics for China and retires having earned $16.7 million in prize money, has no plans to completely sever her links with tennis. " Paying tribute to Li'is successful career, WTA chairman and chief executive officer Stacey Allaster highlighted the Chinese star's help in raising tennis' profile in Asia. "These plans include opening the Li Na Tennis Academy, which will provide scholarships for the future generation of Chinese tennis stars. "We're putting together various plans on how we will continue to grow the sport of tennis in China," she said.
