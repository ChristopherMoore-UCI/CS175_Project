The American gave me a collection of speeches by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mandela's "Long Walk to Freedom." The journey to freedom in my country, Kenya, and in Mandela's own country, South Africa, is far from over. -- I had many conversations with Nelson Mandela, although I had not met him. My fear is that we become too comfortable with his legacy -- content with honoring what Mandela has stood for that we forget to carry forward his sense of urgency. Mandela survived 27 years of prison; maybe I would make it out, too.
