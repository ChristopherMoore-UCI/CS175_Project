The thigh bone was found six years ago on the banks of the Irtysh River in Siberia by Nikolai Peristov, a Russian artist who carves jewelry from ancient mammoth tusks, according to the journal Nature. Modern humans first left Africa about 60,000 years ago, according to National Geographic, and wandered toward Asia and Europe. -- DNA from a 45,000-year-old leg bone is giving scientists a better idea of when modern humans first started mating with Neanderthals. Until now, scientists hadn't pinpointed exactly when Neanderthals and modern humans began interbreeding. "This is just a random find in a Siberian river deposit," Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist at London's Natural History Museum, told Nature.
