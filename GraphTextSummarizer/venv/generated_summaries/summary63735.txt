"The powers and ability of the Commission of Inquiry appointed to investigate the deaths of 44 people near Lonmin's Marikana mine in August must be clarified to ensure justice and redress for all those affected," Amnesty International said in a statement last week. Workers at the mine ended their weekslong strike last month after accepting a pay hike of up to 22%. South African authorities at first charged 270 miners with murder before dropping the charges pending further investigation. -- A South African commission tasked with investigating the killings of dozens of striking miners by police started its proceedings Monday with a moment of silence and the reading of the victims' names. "Many potential witnesses may need financial support to engage with the commission, including for legal advice and transport," Amnesty said.
