Hail damaged more than 100 aircraft at Dallas/Forth Worth International Airport, spokesman David Magana said. Spokeswoman Anita Foster said Wednesday that their teams are still in the field assessing the damage and that she expects final tallies late Wednesday or early Thursday. Preliminary ratings of damage to one subdivision near Forney, just east of Dallas, suggests the tornado there rated up to EF-3, the National Weather Service forecast office in Fort Worth said. Between six and 13 tornadoes may have touched down in Dallas, Arlington and the surrounding area Tuesday, the National Weather Service in Dallas-Fort Worth said. -- About 200 homes were destroyed and 650 were damaged by violent tornadoes in northern Texas, an American Red Cross spokeswoman said Wednesday, a day after the storms tore through one of the nation's largest metropolitan areas.
