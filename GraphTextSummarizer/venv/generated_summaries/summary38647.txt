A mistake by goalkeeper Julio Cesar gifted Daniele De Rossi a 17th-minute opener for the hosts, then Inter defender Walter Samuel headed against the bar just before halftime and fellow Argentine Diego Milito hit the corner of the goalframe soon after the interval. We will not give up although Inter are still one point ahead of us," he told reporters Third-placed AC Milan, who lost to Parma in midweek, can join Roma on 62 points with seven matches to play by beating Lazio on Sunday. Palermo moved four points clear of fifth-placed Sampdoria with a 3-1 victory at home to Bologna in Saturday's late match thanks to a hat-trick from striker Fabrizio Miccoli. Milito was again left ruing a close miss as he hit the post deep into injury-time, sealing a frustrating defeat ahead of Wednesday's Champions League quarterfinal first leg against CSKA Moscow. Sampdoria host mid-table Cagliari on Sunday, while sixth-placed Napoli take on Catania and Juventus are at home to Atalanta.
