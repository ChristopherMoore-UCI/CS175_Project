-- William Ward Warren was 15 when his dad dropped him off at Dallas Love Field to see President John F. Kennedy arrive in the city, on the same day JFK was assassinated. The color film offers new glimpses of the president and Mrs. Kennedy, wearing a pink Chanel suit, coming down the steps from Air Force One and greeting well-wishers. According to the news release, the only color images of President Kennedy in Dallas were made by amateurs, except for a brief film by a White House photographer. The result was "the best home movie known to exist of the Kennedy arrival," according to Gary Mack, curator of the The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza. The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy from that location.
