" Honkanen says was inspired by his previous career in professional racing (snowmobiles in winter, jet skis in summer) and his own experience of turning a whimsical idea into reality -- he opened a chocolate shop after watching the Johnny Depp/Juliette Binoche film "Chocolat." Called "The Hollywood Experience," the custom-designed travel concept was created by Janne Honkanen, owner of high-end travel company Luxury Action. The custom design work, planning and script costs â‚¬20,000 ($26,800) per week to put together -- with a minimum one-week requirement. Over-the-top dreams-to-reality filmmaking is the latest luxury travel offering to come out of the Nordic nation. "My returning clients are always looking for something upgraded and more personalized," says Honkanen about how the concept came about.
