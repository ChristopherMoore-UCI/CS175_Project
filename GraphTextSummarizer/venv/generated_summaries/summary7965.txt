Developed at a research lab at the University of Cambridge in the UK and now in commercial production at a company called Owlstone with close links to the university, Dr Koehl says the sensor is already in use by oil industry giants like BP and Shell and in the food industry by Coca Cola and Nestle. "More recently we've been looking at consumer spaces so we're talking to a number of manufacturers of mobile phones and mobile phone components," he said. "Originally it was aimed at detecting things like explosives, toxic chemicals and other threats that might occur," Dr Koehl told CNN. "We want to develop a module small enough to put into mobile devices like phones." For Dr. Andrew Koehl, the inventor of the microchip spectrometer technology at the heart of this "digital nose", the technology that will allow us to do just that is already here.
