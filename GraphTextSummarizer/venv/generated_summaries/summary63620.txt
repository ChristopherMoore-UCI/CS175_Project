-- The National Transportation Safety Board has wrapped up its on-scene work as part of its investigation of the Asiana Flight 214 crash at San Francisco airport, the agency said Monday. Most of the government probe has moved to Washington where investigators will further analyze cockpit voice and data information, piece together mountains of records and run other crash material through NTSB labs. Additional interviews with first responders is the only work still being done in San Francisco, the NTSB said. The runway was littered with plane parts, bags, and a carpet of other debris that was examined in varying detail by investigators. The pilot at the controls was training on the 777 although he was experienced at flying other big Boeing and Airbus jets and had landed in San Francisco previously in those planes.
