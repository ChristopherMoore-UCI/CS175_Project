-- A former prison guard responsible for leaking videos purportedly showing the abuse of prisoners at a penitentiary in the former Soviet republic of Georgia said Friday that he witnessed such torture on a daily basis since 2005. Purported prison abuse videos prompt outrage in Georgia Bedukadze left the country three months ago and is now seeking political asylum in Belgium in the wake of the tapes' release. The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights called on the Georgia government to ensure that these allegations are "promptly, impartially and effectively investigated and that perpetrators are brought to justice," spokesman Rupert Colville said. "While working in prison, I used to witness beating of prisoners, torture of prisoners, humiliation of prisoners on an everyday basis," Vladimir Bedukadze told CNN. Torture is absolutely prohibited under human rights law, Colville said in Geneva, and Georgia has ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture.
