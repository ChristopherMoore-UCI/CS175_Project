But internships are an important (maybe essential) part of the modern rÃ©sumÃ©. The White House isn't alone in offering an unpaid internship program -- and internships are far from being responsible for America's gap between rich and poor. But the executive branch could use this opportunity to make a statement about equality of opportunity in America by offering paid internships, as many others do. With college expenses skyrocketing and internships offering young workers little or no compensation, it's no wonder it's becoming more difficult to climb out of poverty and into the middle class. Fox told me it cost her "a couple thousand dollars" to take a White House internship in 2010.
