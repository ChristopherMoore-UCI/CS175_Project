The justices in December will decide the EPA's ability to measure emissions from an upwind state that is polluting a downwind state, requiring those upwind states to pay for greenhouse gas reductions. The court rejected three other related appeals, including one from Virginia state officials: broader challenges to the EPA's power over carbon emissions. At issue is whether the federal Environmental Protection Agency can tighten emission standards for stationary greenhouse gas sources, such as power plants, in what the government says is an effort to stem the effects of global warming. The new cases are Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. EPA (12-1272); Texas v. EPA (12-1269); Southeastern Legal Foundation v. EPA (12-1268); Energy-Intensive Manufacturers Working Group on Greenhouse Gas Regulation v. EPA (12-1254); American Chemistry Council v. EPA (12-1248); and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA (12-1146). "Today's decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to deny numerous further legal challenges to EPA's science-based determination that six greenhouse gases threaten our nation's health and well-being is a historic victory for all Americans that are afflicted by the ravages of extreme weather," said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund.
