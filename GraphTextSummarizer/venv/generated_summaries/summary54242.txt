Los Angeles Dodger Clayton Kershaw was rewarded for his outstanding season, which included a league-best 2.53 ERA and just one fewer strikeout than Dickey, with two first-place votes and second place overall. That acclaim was just enough to edge 2011 AL Cy Young winner Justin Verlander, who picked up 13 first-place votes, 13 second-place votes and two third-place votes for his 17-8 won-lost record, his 2.64 ERA and his league-leading 239 strikeouts. Price's teammate, relief pitcher Fernando Rodney, garnered the final AL first-place vote and finished fifth in the overall AL voting, among nine pitchers who gained mention. Price earned 14 first-place votes, 13 second-place votes and one third-place nod from the baseball scribes. Dickey became the first knuckleball thrower to win the game's most prestigious individual pitching award, earning 27 first-place votes and five second-place votes for his historic season.
