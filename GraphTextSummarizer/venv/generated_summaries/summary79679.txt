Lindsay Lohan's lawyer said it was "nothing more than a publicity stunt." Michael Lohan's lawyer, Lisa Bloom, said in a written statement Monday he was reacting to "a problem millions of Americans have: What can a parent do when an adult child appears to have a serious alcohol or drug problem? "He intends to do everything in his power to prevent Lindsay from becoming another Marilyn Monroe, Anna Nicole Smith, Michael Jackson, Heath Ledger or Corey Haim." Bloom said she was hired "to pursue any and all appropriate legal action to save and protect his daughter." "The law affords a parent who believes his adult child is not in control of her health and welfare a number of legal options," she said. " Michael Lohan is trying to sit down with his daughter and her lawyer "to come up with an appropriate treatment plan that will allow her to get her life back on course," Bloom said. The much-publicized dispute between the actress-singer and her father boiled over last week when Michael Lohan persuaded a sheriff's deputy to help him enter her Hollywood home to check on the welfare of her 16-year-old sister. "If, however, that does not happen, Michael is prepared to pursue other legal action towards his one and only goal: to save and protect his daughter."
