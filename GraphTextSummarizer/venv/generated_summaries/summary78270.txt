-- Personal trainer Cornell McClellan was working out with President Obama one morning when he had a revelation. McClellan spoke at last month's American Council on Exercise conference in San Diego, where he thanked fellow personal trainers who donated their time to help military families get fit. And McClellan is no doubt pleased with Michelle Obama's much-coveted arms, which are so admired that they have spawned exercise DVDs with titles like "Arms of a First Lady" and "Totally Toned Arms: Get Michelle Obama Arms in 21 Days." "We're faced with similar things," McClellan said. Although it's easy to say that the presidential couple can get in shape easily because of their resources such as personal trainers and professional chefs, it's not just about that.
