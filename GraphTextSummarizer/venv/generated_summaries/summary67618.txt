Other titles announced for the system included "Wii Fit U," a new version of the exercise program that has sold more than 43 million copies; "Sing," a karaoke game that lets players user the new game pad to read lyrics; and, in a nod to hard-core gamers, "Mass Effect 3," the latest in the acclaimed role playing-game series. On its Twitter feed, game creator Bioware noted that the title represents its debut on the Wii and that the game will be available when the Wii U launches. In one of those mini-games, "Luigi's Ghost Mansion," up to four players using traditional controllers play as ghost hunters, while another with one of the new game pads is the ghost. " Having showcased the Wii U hardware at last year's Electronic Entertainment Expo, the focus at Tuesday's Nintendo event was on games: 23 of them, to be exact. But "Mass Effect" and "Arkham City" weren't enough to please some hard-core gamers, many of whom are down on Nintendo for what they see as its focus on games geared toward a more casual, family-friendly audience.
