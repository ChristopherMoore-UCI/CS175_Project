Read more about nanotechnology's promise for cancer High-profile people such as Kennedy, who are battling malignant brain tumors, have increased awareness of the condition, O'Rourke said. The theory behind proton therapy is that its high-energy particles zone in specifically on the tumor and so do not harm the surrounding healthy tissue as much as the X-ray photons in conventional therapy, said Dr. Donald O'Rourke, associate professor of neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Researchers are looking at many other treatments for brain tumors. Already the researchers can use the MRI method to see if the patient is responding to treatment, and can make treatment selection based on it. Researchers at Argonne National Laboratory are going to test this approach in brain tumors in mice, but it will be at least five years before it could become available in humans.
