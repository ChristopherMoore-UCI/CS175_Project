The U.S. Public Interest Research Group released its 27th annual Trouble in Toyland survey Tuesday, and the progress report concluded what it has noted in previous years: toy hazards come in a variety of shapes and forms. Children can be injured from small parts that pose choking risks, strangled by cords on pull toys, lacerated by sharp edges, and endangered by exposure to toxic chemicals. Toxic and dangerous toys are right now sitting on store shelves, and a public interest group is warning consumers to beware when purchasing toys for toddlers because of possible safety hazards. However, until that's the case, parents need to watch out for common hazards when shopping for toys," said Nasima Hossain, public health advocate for Public Interest Research Group, in a release detailing the report. Researchers visited national toy stores, malls and dollar stores in September, October and November this year to look for potential toxic, choking, strangulation and noise hazards.
