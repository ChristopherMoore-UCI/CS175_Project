I recently went to Vietnam and Indonesia as part of CNN's Change the List project to document the massive illegal trade in endangered pangolin species. Mother pangolins carry their babies around on their backs; pangolins hang from trees by their tails; and their tongues are longer than their bodies. The 32-year-old from Pasadena, California, recently filed a petition on Change.org asking Disney to make an animated character out of a pangolin, a little-known, scale-covered mammal that's notoriously shy and, to Kit's point, can protect itself from pretty much anything in the wild -- lions, tigers -- by rolling up into a ball. "As a Chinese-American, I also want to speak up because the demand in China is helping drive the demand for pangolins to be killed for meat and medicines," she writes in the Change.org petition. " She doesn't think she'll be able to persuade her dad to change, but younger generations may be the ones to save animals like pangolins and rhinos, she said.
