Owusu and other members of EVCO spend hours in each village, not only installing and teaching about computers, but also giving motivational speeches and teaching about other topics. Just after he graduated from a technical college, Owusu established Entire Village Computer Organization, a small nonprofit organization that donates refurbished used computers to schools. Owusu says the nonprofit group has seen an improvement in villages and a higher interest in education in schools that have received EVCO donations. Last year, EVCO also began to donate computers to villages in Nigeria. " Before each trip to Africa, Owusu picks up and refurbishes donated computers, doing most of the work himself.
