Weekend events included the prince's participation in a polo competition in Carpinteria, California, on Saturday afternoon. -- Before Prince William and his wife, Catherine, left Los Angeles to return to London on Sunday, they got their hands dirty with paint and putty at a children's art center and shook hands with military veterans looking for work. The problem of unemployment among former military families will "be raised monumentally by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge being here," said U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice President Kevin Schmiegel, one of the job fair organizers. "On behalf of us both, how grateful we are to have been welcomed so warmly in the Golden State and City of Angels," Prince William said at the last stop of the royal couple's three-day Southern California visit. A giant Union Jack flag and an equally large American flag served as the backdrop inside Sony Studios' sound stage 15 as Prince William addressed 1,500 military veterans, their spouses and recruiters from 150 companies Sunday afternoon.
