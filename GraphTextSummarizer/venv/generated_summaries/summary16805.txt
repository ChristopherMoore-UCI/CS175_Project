As for the refugees, Panos Moumtzis, Syria regional refugee coordinator for the United Nations, said many cross through unofficial border points during the night. " U.N. refugee officials, neighboring governments and non-governmental agencies have been working to help refugees, and the United Nations recently launched a drive for $193 million to help refugees. The Muslim call to prayer, he said, has been changed from "Allah Akbar" to "Assad Akbar." "I am extremely grateful Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey have maintained open borders," Guterres said. Many of the refugees to Iraq are young Syrian Kurdish men who want to avoid military service.
