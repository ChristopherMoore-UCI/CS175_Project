Editing apps like Snapseed, Afterlight (both of which I used in photo no. 6 above) and VSCO Cam allow you to tinker in a gentler manner with brightness, saturation, contrast and other aspects. When I visited Atlanta last year, a photographer I knew through Instagram pointed me in the direction of the colorful staircase you can see in photo no. 2 above. Get lost Avoid hopping from landmark to landmark. Architecture and human activity at airports and rail stations often provide rich photo opportunities. You can discover photogenic spots in the places you're going to visit through hashtags, geotags and the feeds of local Instagram users.
