"Our hearts and prayers go out to the families and friends of those precious little girls," said Black Hawk County Sheriff Tony Thompson. Last week, when the bodies were found but authorities had not yet identified them as belonging to the girls, residents gathered at Meyers Lake for a candlelight vigil, according to CNN affiliate KCRG. -- Relatives of 10-year-old Lyric Cook and 8-year-old Elizabeth Collins got news Monday that no family wants. Their bodies were found in the Seven Bridges Wildlife Area in Bremer County. Students and staff created a "remembrance chain" that they will give to the girls' families, along with a memorial made from pink ribbons.
