The Maldives will introduce strict guidelines on conducting wedding ceremonies for tourists after a foreign couple was mocked and abused by staff members at a local resort, the president's office said Friday. But the person conducting the ceremony calls them "swines" and "infidels" and says children of such a union will be "illegitimate," according to a translation provided by the local Minivan news website. In his weekly radio address Friday, the nation's president, Mohamed Nasheed, said he was disgusted by the incident and described the behavior of the staff as "absolutely disgraceful." The couple thought they were taking part in a marriage renewal ceremony conducted in the local Dhivehi language. "No stone will be left unturned to ensure that an incident like this never happens again," the government said in a statement Thursday.
