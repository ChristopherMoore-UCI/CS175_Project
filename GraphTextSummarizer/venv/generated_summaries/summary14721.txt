Trains from Sanya to other provinces were canceled until Thursday, while trains heading from other provinces to Sanya will stop at Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, the Xinhua news agency reported. Southern provinces such as Hainan, Guangdong and Fujian are gearing up for heavy rains and strong winds, state media said. Typhoon Megi marched toward southern China on Wednesday after leaving 11 people dead in the Philippines, prompting Chinese authorities to close train services in the region, state media said. It is expected to make landfall in Hainan or Guangdong province on Saturday, Xinhua said. According to civil defense officials, the fatalities were for various reasons, including falling trees, drowning and lightning.
