The president claims that more government involvement in health care will promote competition. Health care today costs too much for families and small businesses, preventing too many Americans from accessing the affordable quality care they need, when they need it. Despite what the president says, his government-run plan won't make health care more affordable. The president and his Democratic allies have looked to raise taxes on many small businesses to help pay for his government-run health care scheme, a foolish proposition even during the best of times, let alone during a recession. It is a direction that rams massive spending bills through Congress in the name of economic stimulus and job creation, it is a direction that masks a costly job-killing national energy tax in environmentalism, and it is a direction that looks to put federal bureaucracy between patients and their doctors all in the guise of reducing costs and expanding coverage.
