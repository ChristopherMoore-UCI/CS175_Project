Zuckerberg "is eager to connect with computer science and engineering students from some of the best schools in the world, and may well be tomorrow's Facebook innovators," Facebook's Andrew Noyes told the Crimson in an e-mail before the visit. Harvard students applied for the Facebook internships within seconds of their being posted online, a university official told the Crimson. The university's student newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, says he was back on campus for the first time since he left to recruit students for internships at Facebook. Facebook is "just getting started," Zuckerberg said, according to The Crimson. Mark Zuckerberg went back to Harvard on Monday on a recruiting trip, his first visit since he dropped out of the prestigious university to found social-media giant Facebook.
