House demolition of Palestinian militants' houses is a form of collective punishment and an act of revenge, concealed behind a claim of deterrence. Ironically the policy of demolishing houses as a form of deterrence was abandoned back in 2005 at the request of the Israeli army. There is no evidence that the misery inflicted on thousands of innocent Palestinians enhanced Israeli security. The two assailants, cousins from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabal Mukaber, were shot dead by the Israeli security forces. Regrettably, the Hamas praised the attack in Jerusalem and the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the situation as the "Battle for Jerusalem."
