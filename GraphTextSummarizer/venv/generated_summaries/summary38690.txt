Katy Perry reportedly to perform at Super Bowl XLIX halftime Neither Perry nor the NFL has commented on the speculation, and the singer herself seemed to downplay the idea during her appearance on "College GameDay. After attending her first college football game on October 4 (Ole Miss vs. Alabama), appearing on ESPN's "College GameDay" and sending a flirtatious message to Oklahoma Sooners quarterback Trevor Knight, pretty much the only thing left for Perry to do is take the field herself. Katy Perry's music is essentially the stuff Super Bowl halftime dreams are made of. According to reports, Perry will come close to doing just that as the star of 2015's Super Bowl halftime show. But by Friday, it seems someone's tune changed, with the New York Post's Page Six and Billboard reporting that Perry is preparing to shine at Super Bowl XLIX, set for February 1 in Glendale, Arizona.
