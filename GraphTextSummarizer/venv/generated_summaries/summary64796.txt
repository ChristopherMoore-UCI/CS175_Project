Friends and family have erected a billboard in downtown New Orleans seeking help in finding Monette. Hundreds of volunteers and police have scoured New Orleans, but are no closer to finding Monette. A night of celebration New Orleans police said she was last seen on March 2 at Parlay's, a bar in the Lakeview area of the city. But in her 2011 video, Monette said she had no qualms about starting her teaching career in New Orleans. The vehicle was discovered by Equusearch, an independent search and rescue team out of Texas that has volunteered to help police comb the lagoons and waterways of New Orleans City Park.
