-- A fatal police chase involving a teenager on a bicycle has led the Pensacola, Florida, police department to revamp its policy on stun guns, officials said. Policies regarding stun guns vary from department to department, but Fred Wilson, director of operations for the National Sheriffs' Association, said that the general policy on stun guns should focus on appropriate training and an appropriate reporting system for when they are used. The teen eventually crashed his bicycle and fell into the path of the police car, according to Pensacola Assistant Chief Chip Simmons. Before Steen's death, the department's policy required that officers act "professionally" and that stun gun use be "reasonable." Officials with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a civil rights group that advocates for a uniform federal stun gun policy, met with the Pensacola police and city officials Thursday.
