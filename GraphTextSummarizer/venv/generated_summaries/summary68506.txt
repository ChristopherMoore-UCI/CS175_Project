"Sadly, another mine disaster and more Utah miner (and mine rescuer) deaths have led Defendant here to convene another MSHA panel, this time with a goal of determining MSHA's alleged complicity in the accident," the plaintiffs' attorneys wrote. Also joining the suit is the Utah Media Coalition, representing Utah newspapers, television stations and journalism groups. " The Department of Labor, which includes MSHA, has not allowed the news media access to its investigation into the August 6 cave-in of the mine in central Utah. -- A coalition of news media organizations has filed suit in an effort to get the government investigation into the Crandall Canyon mine accident opened to the public. Rescuers drill into the Crandall Canyon mine on August 16 to try to reach six miners trapped underground.
