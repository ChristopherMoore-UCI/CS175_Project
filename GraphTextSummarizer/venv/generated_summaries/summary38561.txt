" Hagel: More U.S. troops than planned will remain in Afghanistan next year At the end of December, U.S. forces will end their combat role in Afghanistan and instead focus on counterterrorism missions and training, advising and assisting Afghan troops. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel traveled to Afghanistan this weekend, his fourth and last trip to the country as he makes way for his likely  replacement, Defense Secretary nominee Ashton Carter. CNN traveled with Hagel to tactical base Gamberi in Eastern Afghanistan, where the outgoing defense secretary met with troops. Hagel does not see Afghanistan's security force buckling like in Iraq, citing Afghanistan's willingness to sign an agreement allowing a residual American troop presence in the country. Hagel said he has confidence in the Afghan security forces ability to protect Afghanistan from terror by the hands of al Qaeda and the Taliban.
