As Le Web founder Loic le Meur identifies in his slideshow of Silicon Valley trends, we're entering an era where human mindfulness and the sharing economy develop alongside wearable technology, driverless cars and artificial intelligence. Augmented reality will become the norm, and predictive software will deliver the answer to scientific, medical or personal queries for which we seek answers. Speakers at the conference include venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who invested in Twitter and Tumblr, Hugo Barra, the former Google executive who now heads Xiaomi's product portfolio, and Nick D'Aloisio, founder of artificial intelligence company Summly which was bought by Yahoo. Online letting market AirBnB, car-sharing service Lyft and online education outlet Coursera are tapping into a desire to share intelligence, space and journeys in the real world. And that real world may become more attractive that it has been before: Digital detox (there are apps for that) will help you kick that grab-the-smartphone twitch.
