Eight crew members are missing after a cargo vessel overturned off the coast of Scotland, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution said late Saturday. The coast guard in Shetland was notified at 2:30 p.m. that the hull of the Cemfjord was found 11 miles east of Pentland Skerries, the RNLI said. Meanwhile, 25 crew members were airlifted from a boat that ran aground off the coast of southern England, below Southampton, the Maritime & Coastguard Agency reported. The ship ran aground on Bramble Bank near the Isle of Wight. A search operation that included a helicopter, coast guard rescue teams and a fixed-wing aircraft was unsuccessful, the agency said.
