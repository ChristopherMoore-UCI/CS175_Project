The suspect, 43-year-old Harold Martin Smith, pulled a handgun and shot himself last December as Beverly Hills detectives approached him at Hollywood's Harvey Apartments. Detectives scanned 150,000 e-mails and texts belonging to Chasen, investigated thousands of tips and reviewed thousands of financial documents tied to the victim, Beverly Hills police said Friday. " "All facts and evidence conclusively indicate that Mr. Smith acted alone and was in possession of the murder weapon when confronted in Hollywood for questioning" the night he committed suicide, the Beverly Hills police department said. Beverly Hills police Lt. Chasen, 64, was driving last fall through a posh Beverly Hills neighborhood on her way home from a Hollywood movie premiere party when she was shot several times, police said.
