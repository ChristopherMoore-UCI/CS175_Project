The issuing banks are raising interest rates by 20 percent or more -- even if the individual has good credit, has never been late on a payment or hasn't even had any change in their credit standing. The reality is that the banks are fearful of the high rate of credit card default, and they know they've got you if you're among the 70 percent of Americans who carry a month-to-month balance. You didn't get into credit card debt overnight, and you won't get out of it overnight; the recovery is going to be a slow step-by-step process. That gives the banks plenty of time to lobby members of Congress and get this pending legislation overturned. It's even affecting successful business owners and moderate to wealthy individuals.
