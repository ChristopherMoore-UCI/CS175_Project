"I've had a lot of our members, especially sexual assault survivors, emailing me, asking if this is going to distract from the broader, bigger problem of sexual assault on campus," said Monika Johnson-Hostler, president of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. Even after the Rolling Stone article published, there was more fallout from UVA regarding campus sexual assaults. Rolling Stone has been accused of victim blaming when it said that its trust in Jackie was "misplaced. It removed the reference to trust being misplaced and added this: "These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie." Some advocates feel that keeping those stories in the dark only makes survivors feel more alone and it takes away from the public's education about preventing and reporting sexual assault.
