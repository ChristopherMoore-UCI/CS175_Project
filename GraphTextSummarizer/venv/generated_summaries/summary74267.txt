According to its Web site, "Covenant House New York is the nation's largest adolescent care agency serving homeless, runaway and at-risk youth." They are from Washington state and are on their way to New York, New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne said on Saturday. -- Authorities have identified a teenager believed to be suffering from amnesia who was found on the streets of New York two weeks ago. The girl was found in Midtown Manhattan around 12:30 a.m. October 9 outside the Covenant House youth shelter, although the organization said that she was not a resident at the time and did not appear as if she intended to seek refuge at the facility. The police said she was wearing military green camouflage pants, a black shirt and a pair of black sneakers when she was discovered.
