But while Fox-Pitt wants to be safe, he does not want to entirely eradicate the inherent dangers of horse and man riding over gargantuan fences, often at breakneck speeds. There are the contradicting aspects of him -- that he is part of the bloodline of William Pitt, British Prime Minister in the 18th Century, which contrast to the black eye he sported after sumo wrestling at his bachelor party, prior to his second marriage to the television presenter Alice Plunkett. Improvements in safety have steadily come into force in the proceeding 15 years, with collapsible fences and inflatable jackets for riders. It is a career beset by tragedies too -- of riders and horses -- that made him think twice about climbing back into the saddle. For all the bravado required for such a dangerous sport, Fox-Pitt talks of that moment as though the emotional wounds are still raw.
