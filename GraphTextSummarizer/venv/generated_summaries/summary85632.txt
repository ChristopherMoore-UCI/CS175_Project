" There were few memorable speeches at Sunday's awards, but newcomer Nyong'o -- who won best supporting actress for "12 Years a Slave" -- gave a standout. The resulting picture included DeGeneres, Jennifer Lawrence, Channing Tatum, Julia Roberts, Kevin Spacey, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong'o and her brother Junior, Meryl Streep, Bradley Cooper and Jared Leto's eye. For the most part, the Oscar prognosticators were right: With the possible exception of Nyong'o, who beat Jennifer Lawrence for best supporting actress, all the winners were expected. But the searing film was rewarded with three Oscars Sunday night -- including the big prize, best picture. " "Gravity," Alfonso Cuaron's film about a space mission gone wrong, didn't win best picture, but it did the best by far of any nominated film, winning seven Oscars altogether.
