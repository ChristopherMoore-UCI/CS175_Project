-- President Barack Obama announced Monday that he has signed an executive order allowing new sanctions against companies that enable Syria and Iran to use technology such as cell phone monitoring to carry out human rights abuses. He was accompanied by Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor, who urged Obama and world leaders to prevent atrocities such as attacks on citizens occurring in Syria. Obama also announced that he is extending the work of American advisers in Uganda helping pursue the Lord's Resistance Army and its leader, Joseph Kony, who are accused of widespread atrocities. Other steps include what Obama called the first-ever intelligence assessment on the risk of mass atrocities and genocide, saying the goal is to "institutionalize the focus on this issue." "Our Treasury Department will work more quickly to deploy its financial tools to block the flow of money to abusive regimes," the president said. The order is part of a broader strategy intended to strengthen the administration's ability to prevent atrocities, including creation of an Atrocities Prevention Board, Obama said in somber remarks at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day.
