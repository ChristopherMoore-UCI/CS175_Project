-- Turkish warplanes bombed suspected Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq's rugged mountains for a second consecutive night Thursday after an ambush on a southeastern Turkey highway killed eight soldiers and a government-employed guard, the semi-official Anatolian News Agency reported. The officials were expected to discuss policy challenges, including the conflict with the PKK and official Turkish frustration with another neighbor, Syria, where the regime has violently cracked down on anti-government protesters. Kurdish lawmakers are protesting a decision by Turkey's electoral board, which disqualified a prominent Kurdish candidate from participating in the June election. Turkish war planes were once again spotted flying over the Qandil mountains of northern Iraq on Thursday, Firat reported. "Similar activities of the Turkish Armed Forces, both domestic and abroad, will continue with determination until the separatist terrorist organization that uses northern Iraq as a safe haven and an attack base against Turkey is eliminated," the military said.
