-- After hours of debate and forceful arguments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli cabinet this week approved a deal to exchange more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, many linked to some of the deadliest terror attacks on Israeli civilians in recent years, for the release of an Israeli solider captured by militants more than five years ago. According to Israeli association of terror victims Almagor, 180 Israelis have lost their lives to terrorists freed in previous deals since 2000. We must have the strength to tell the families of the captive soldiers -- there is a line that the nation cannot cross." And pushing this latest deal is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has built a reputation as a strong opponent to deals with terrorists. Arad has become a symbol of the failure of Israeli governments over the years to strike a deal that would bring him back alive to his family. On board the plane was Israeli air force Navigator Ron Arad, who was captured alive by local Shiite group Amal and later handed over to Hezbollah.
