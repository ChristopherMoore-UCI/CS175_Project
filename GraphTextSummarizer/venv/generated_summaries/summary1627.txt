Pjanic netted the opener in first-half injury time on a free kick and got the second from the penalty spot in the 71st after Napoli defender Paolo Cannavaro fouled Marco Borriello -- who came on for injured Roma legend Francesco Totti. " Hoffenheim manager Markus Gisdol wants the game to be replayed, citing a similar incident between Bayern Munich and Nuremberg in 1994 when Bayern's Thomas Helmer scored a 'phantom' goal. Lorenzo Insigne's pass put Goran Pandev in the clear but his shot was partially stopped by ex Napoli keeper Morgan de Sanctis and then cleared off the line by Daniele De Rossi.

Rafael Benitez's men, watched by former Napoli great Diego Maradona, made the better start in Rome and some would feel deserved better.
