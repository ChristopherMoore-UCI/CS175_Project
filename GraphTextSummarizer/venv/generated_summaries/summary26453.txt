The closet shielded his body from rapid decomposition, animals and insects, resulting in the mummy-like condition the boy found it in. "Because of the location where he was found, it was relatively protected, sunlight-protected, temperature-protected and low humidity," coroner Kent Harshbarger told CNN affiliate WDTN. Until the boy made his way inside the ramshackle house in Dayton, Ohio, on Sunday, neighbors didn't think anyone lived there, said Ken Betz, director of the Montgomery County Coroner's Office. Betz puts Brunton in his late 40s at the time of his suicide. Inside, however, was the body of Edward Brunton, who hanged himself with a belt in a closet in 2009, according to Betz. Brunton had little time to forge friendships with neighbors; he had purchased the home just months prior to his death.
