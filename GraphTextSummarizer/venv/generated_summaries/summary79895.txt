as the defendant, Conrad Murray, arrived at the Clara Foltz Justice Center for the start of his involuntary manslaughter trial in the death of pop superstar Michael Jackson. "Even in death, Michael Jackson can draw a crowd," said Najee Ali, a Los Angeles civil rights activist who grew up in Jackson's hometown, Gary, Indiana. Defense: Michael Jackson caused his own death Murder also is a major theme for the group "Justice4MJ," which was out in force on Tuesday, leading the crowd in chants of "Justice for Michael" as Jackson's family walked into the courthouse. That sentiment is shared by many of Jackson's fans, although Murray is charged with the less serious offense of involuntary manslaughter. They started with "Heal the World," but the voices soon waned, and Jackson impersonator Goward Horton stepped in with his version of "Man in the Mirror," complete with Jackson's distinctive yips and squeaks.
