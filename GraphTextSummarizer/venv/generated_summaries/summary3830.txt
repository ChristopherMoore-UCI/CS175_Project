Narey had also faced charges of civil rights violation resulting in bodily injury and disturbing a school assembly; Mulveyhill, who had dated Prince, had faced similar charges, plus statutory rape. She was taunted again as school let out, and as she walked home crying, one of the students called Prince names and tossed an empty can at her from a car, according to the 38-page court filing. On the day she died, Prince had endured a torrent of verbal abuse that began at the school library that continued as she walked home from school in tears, prosecutors said. Court documents show that, the day before she died, she told a friend, "School has been close to intolerable lately." Prosecutors said Prince, who had moved to Massachusetts from Ireland earlier in the school year, had gone out with boys who also dated two of her alleged tormentors, who in retaliation called her names, including "whore" and "Irish slut." Ashley Longe and Flannery Mullins, 18, and Sharon Velazquez, 17, admitted to sufficient facts on charges related to the harassment of Prince, who hanged herself in the stairwell of her parents' apartment in South Hadley on January 14, 2010, after weeks of ridicule and teasing at the hands of classmates, prosecutors said.
