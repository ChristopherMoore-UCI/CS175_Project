I wondered if my experience was unique or similar to other stepmothers so I started a website (stepsforstepmothers.com) which featured an online chat room and a questionnaire for stepmothers to fill out. This works for a lot of other stepmothers who choose to spend the holiday with their mothers or with women for whom they deeply care. Being ignored is minor compared to the hostility and emotional abuse many other stepmothers experience, but my sense of failure grew each time I tried to grow closer to my stepdaughter and was rebuffed. Almost instantaneously, a vibrant community of stepmothers formed that gave each other encouragement and advice during difficult times. I just wish other stepmothers wouldn't have to go through similar or far worse emotional distress.
