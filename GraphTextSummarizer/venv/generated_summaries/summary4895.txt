It's not known at this stage how much of the cost of Jackson's canceled concerts will be shouldered by promoters AEG Live. For almost four months, fans of Michael Jackson were holding what were deemed by concert promoters AEG Live as the "Hottest Tickets on the Planet. Mary Craig Calkins, partner at Howrey law firm in Los Angeles told CNN it was likely Jackson was covered by essential element insurance, a common form of cover in the entertainment industry to guard against losses associated with the main act. Now some 750,000 would-be concert-goers have been left with slips of paper that, while steeped in sentimentality, won't entitle them to see the hyped spectacular that was promised to be Jackson's farewell concerts. According to estimates by "Billboard," unconfirmed by the promoters, Jackson's concerts would have netted the singer $50 million in ticket and merchandise sales.
