A month later, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report that showed Iran had experimented with virtually every element of nuclear weapons production and studied how to put nuclear weapons on its missiles. The clock is ticking on preventive Israel or U.S. military options as Iran gets closer to full nuclear capability. In December, the United States passed new sanctions designed to halt Iranian oil exports that nearly crippled Iran's ability to conduct international banking; the European Union passed similar sanctions this January. While it is making clear it prefer negotiations, the United States is also developing new weapons for its B-2 bombers that can strike at Iran's underground nuclear facilities. Last week Iran's Supreme Leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, issued new threats to Israel.
