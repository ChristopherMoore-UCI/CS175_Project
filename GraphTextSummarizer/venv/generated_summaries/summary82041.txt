-- Days after Anthony Weiner admitted to lewd chats with women online, his campaign manager quit, Weiner and his campaign said Sunday. "I think it's become very clear that former Congress member Weiner has a pattern of reckless behavior, an inability to tell the truth and a real lack of maturity and responsibility," Quinn said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "Danny has left the campaign," Weiner told CNN affiliate NY1. Weiner first acknowledged Tuesday that he did not stop sending raunchy online chats to women when he left Congress in 2011. Danny Kedem's departure is the latest sign Weiner's New York City mayoral bid is struggling amid allegations of online sexual impropriety.
