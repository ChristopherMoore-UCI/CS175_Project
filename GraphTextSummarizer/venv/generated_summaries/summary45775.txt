The purists are likely to argue that everyone knows that a Tuesday in early November is set aside for Election Day. Officially, Election Day is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November (depending on the year, it could be November 2 through November 8). Because of the excitement generated by this year's campaign, you can bet there will be long lines at the polls, and if there are not enough ballots, we can expect all kinds of delays. Instead of putting up barriers for people who want to vote, we should be the most open society when it comes to giving our citizens as many options as possible to vote, and moving Election Day from a weekday to a weekend makes a lot of sense. Congress wanted a set date to elect a president and members of Congress, and because we were an agricultural society, this was the best day for farmers in rural America to get to the polls.
