When Heath Ledger died midway through filming "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus," director Terry Gilliam seized on the film's magical-real aesthetic and finished off the movie with Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp fake-Shemping Ledger. Paul Walker died in November with filming only half-finished, although given the age we live in fans had already seen Walker on set and in character. Cutting Walker out of the film entirely would have been a costly endeavor. River Phoenix and Marilyn Monroe died too early to salvage "Dark Blood" or "Something's Got to Give;" a tragedy for many reasons, not least because they both looked much better than "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus."
