U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has said she will soon introduce legislation updating the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act to strengthen U.S. sanctions, including authorizing U.S. assistance to support a transition to democracy in Syria. Officials acknowledge that the United States has little leverage on Syria, which has proved immune to U.S. pressure during the protests. " Officials said the U.S. would be urging its European allies, who have also become increasingly concerned about the violence in Syria, to follow suit with measures of their own that could be more effective, given that Syrian officials have more assets in Europe and travel there more frequently. However, as  the crackdown in Syria has intensified, several U.S. officials and Western diplomats have described the regime as increasingly brittle and predicted that it would be hard for Assad to survive. The State Department is expected to call in the Syrian ambassador to the U.S. to protest the violence, and Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, was protesting the crackdown to foreign ministry officials in Damascus, officials said.
