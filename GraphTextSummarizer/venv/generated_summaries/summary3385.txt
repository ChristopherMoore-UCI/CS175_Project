Less than two days into a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, deadly violence erupted once again between the military and pro-Russian separatists, casting further doubt about whether the peace plan will hold. Despite the reports of violence Monday, the truce did appear to hold up in many parts of eastern Ukraine. Dmytro Chalov, a spokesman for a sector of the Ukrainian army, said mortar fire pummeled the Mariupol area of eastern Ukraine. But pro-Russian separatists have also blamed Ukraine for violations. The ceasefire aims to end 10 months of fighting in eastern Ukraine.
