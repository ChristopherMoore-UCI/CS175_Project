Brown told CNN while sitting in his tour bus strumming his guitar before a recent show at Chicago's Wrigley Field. For over an hour band members stand behind tables spooning large helpings of Rusty's food on to fans plates and Zac Brown stands at the end of the line talking to each and every person as the pass by. When the lights dimmed and the band walked through the ivy covered walls of the 100-year-old Wrigley Field it was time put down the plates and pick up instruments and play. Brown also throws a giant music and food festival "What we love about the Eat & Greet is that it completely turns the table around on the fans" So, he teamed up with his friend and chef, Rusty Hamlin, to create the "Eat & Greet."
