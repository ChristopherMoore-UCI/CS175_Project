Read more: Real Madrid unveil Gareth Bale at Bernabeu Shortly after scampering down the right wing, ball at feet, Bale's debut was over as Carlo Ancelotti hauled off his most expensive asset. The Spanish giants were second best for much of the first half and were trailing after Cani's 19th minute strike gave the hosts a deserved lead. Dani Alves put the home side ahead with a 36th minute header and when Lionel Messi scored to make it 2-0 with 15 minutes to go all was going according to plan. His 38th minute goal against Villarreal -- stabbing in Daniel Carvajal's low cross -- came at just the right time for his new team. Barca's fourth win of the season keeps them top of the table, level on points and goal difference with Atletico Madrid who completed a more comfortable 4-2 win over Almeria.
