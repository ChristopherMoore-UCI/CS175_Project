Utah professor Mark Nielsen told CNN that the application is aimed at medical and anatomy students who might not have the opportunity to dissect a real human body, but it's also proving a hit with medical practitioners. "Anatomy Lab" lets the user move between 40 separate body layers, zoom in to view different structures and rotate them to get different view points. "A lot of medical professionals, especially in physical therapy and rehabilitative medicine, are using it to educate patients and show them the body parts they're discussing," Nielsen told CNN. It started out as a computer program showing the dissection of a cadaver, beginning with the skin and moving on to subcutaneous tissue, nerves, veins, and muscles. The iPhone app, "Anatomy Lab," allows the user to move between 40 body layers to enable dissection.
