I spent my first months off drugs in the San Francisco County Jail. The reality for me was and is that stopping use of the substance is relatively easy compared with staying off drugs. I agreed to be featured in the film because I thought it would live on after I died from an overdose as a testimonial to the dangers of drug addiction. After experimenting with many drugs, I found opiates provided me with the ability to forget my problems. In the years I have been off heroin, I have struggled with depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.
