While there currently is no proven treatment for Ebola beyond supportive care, government agencies and small biotech firms have been scrambling to speed up development of several potential therapies and vaccines. It will be the first test of this type of Ebola vaccine in humans. Funding from an international consortium formed to fight Ebola will enable GlaxoSmithKline to begin manufacturing up to 10,000 additional doses of the vaccine while clinical trials are ongoing, the pharmaceutical company said in a statement. While vaccines might be given to prevent infection among health workers or other people thought to be at high risk,  development has also been sped up on drugs that might potentially be given to patients who already have the disease. The virus delivers genetic material derived from two species of Ebola virus, including the Zaire strain that's responsible for the current outbreak.
