He made no mention of Mitt Romney, his all-but-certain opponent in November, but took aim at House Republicans who passed a measure last week that would pay for extending the lower student loan rate by cutting from a health care fund that promotes preventive care. -- President Barack Obama on Friday urged high school students to e-mail, tweet, and teach their parents to tweet a message to Congress to prevent student loan interest rates from doubling on July 1. In his continuing push to extend the current 3.4% interest rate charged on federal student loans, Obama told students at a Virginia high school that the goal is to provide all Americans with the best possible education. The White House warned last week that Obama would veto the student loan measure passed by House Republicans. In remarks almost identical to previous speeches to college students on the issue, Obama said America is not about a few people doing well while everyone else struggles.
