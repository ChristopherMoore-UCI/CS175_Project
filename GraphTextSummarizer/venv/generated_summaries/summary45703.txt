Yarnell's statement notes that frequencies between 380 megahertz and 399.9 megahertz have been reserved for government and military uses since World War II, though manufacturers of garage door remotes may choose to use these frequencies if they think there is low risk of interference. The newspaper also noted the new system was installed for updating emergency communications, and that the complaints of nonresponsive garage doors come from up to 15 miles away from Fort Gordon. The frequency update caused garage doors to be unresponsive to owner remote controls. For now, residents experiencing interference can wait for Fort Gordon to fix the issue, or shell out $150 to $500 for new systems that can withstand the interference, according to the paper. " The interference is not a cause for safety or privacy concerns; it will not open garage doors but temporarily keeps the remotes from working.
