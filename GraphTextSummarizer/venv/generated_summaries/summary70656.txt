Kia Scherr, who didn't go on the trip, said at a news conference in Faber, Virginia, she is experiencing the "deepest grief and pain I have ever known." Synchronicity's founder, Charles Cannon, told reporters Alan Scherr was in Cannon's room at the Oberoi shortly before the attacks began on the night of November 26. So that's my choice." Alan Scherr, 58, and Naomi Scherr, 13, were among 25 people who had traveled to India for a meditation retreat with Virginia-based spiritual group Synchronicity Foundation, to which the Scherrs belonged. Scherr and his daughter were in the restaurant with other Synchronicity travelers when gunmen burst into the hotel and started shooting, Cannon said. Three of the wounded Synchronicity travelers still were in an Indian hospital this week, Cannon said on "Larry King Live. [Alan and Naomi Scherr]," Cannon said.
