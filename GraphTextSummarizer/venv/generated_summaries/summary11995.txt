" Fording noted Alabama's passage in 2011 of one of the strictest laws in the country designed to crack down on undocumented immigration. " "A nation that pretends to have a lawful system of immigration has to be willing to execute that," Sessions said, noting that bitter opposition of the ICE agents' union to the "Gang of Eight" bill. "I grew up in rural Alabama, in a poor area of the state," the three-term Republican noted during a recent interview in his Washington office. And so, if we end the illegality with a good, principled immigration bill, (if) we allow a generous but responsible flow of immigrants in the future, and if we improve the lives of working Americans, then that's the way you win elections." Jeff Sessions has a lot of answers to that question, but he starts by pointing to a picture of a modest white house built in the early 1930s in Hybart, Alabama.
