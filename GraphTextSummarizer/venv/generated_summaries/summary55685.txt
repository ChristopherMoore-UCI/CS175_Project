-- Texas Presbyterian Hospital "fell short" several times in treating Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, starting by not asking the right questions in the emergency room, the hospital's chief clinical officer, Dr. Daniel Varga, said in an interview with CNN. After Duncan died and two nurses who cared for him contracted Ebola, the CDC issued new guidelines Monday on how health care workers should handle Ebola cases. The CDC director stressed that hospitals train workers more thoroughly and make sure no skin is exposed when dealing with Ebola patients. Varga told CNN the hospital didn't conduct enough training in how to handle Ebola patients -- something that contributed to the initial misdiagnosis. He said the policy has been changed so that hospital workers who might contract Ebola are told not to take public transportation.
