" "Crime 2" seeks to apprehend 41 people in Italy, Germany, Canada and Australia on charges ranging from homicide and illegal weapons possession to drug smuggling and money laundering. The 'Ndrangheta is prevalent in the Calabria region of southern Italy and is seen as similar to the Sicilian Mafia. In 2004, authorities said they linked the 'Ndrangheta to an international drug trafficking network involving gangs in South America and Australia. Reggio Calabria is located in Calabria. Of the 41 people sought, 34 are in custody, said Chief Prosecutor of Reggio Calabria Giuseppe Pignatone.
