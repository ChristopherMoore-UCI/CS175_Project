In what was apparently an automated e-mail, I was told that: 'Your Twitter account has been suspended for posting an individual's private information such as private e-mail address.' Others, though, noted that the posting of Zenkel's e-mail makes it a somewhat murkier question. "If criticizing NBC over how it's handled the Olympic coverage were cause for suspension Twitter would pretty much be empty right about now," wrote tech industry analyst Michael Gartenberg. Some people critical of the move say that should have saved Adams, because a Web search for Zenkel's e-mail address will turn it up. Twitter spokeswoman Rachael Horowitz said the company doesn't "comment on individual users for privacy reasons."
