The United Nations, the European Union and other Western countries have called for peaceful polling and stressed the importance of these elections for Libya's transition to democracy. In Libya's first vote in 2012, a more liberal political coalition won more seats than the Islamist parties. More than 1,500 candidates are competing in these elections, but they are running as individuals, not as political parties. More than 1.5 million Libyans have registered to vote for a new 200 member parliament that will be called the Council of Representatives (COR) and will replace the General National Congress (GNC). -- Polls opened in Libya on Wednesday in the country's second parliamentary elections since the fall of the Gadhafi regime in 2011.
