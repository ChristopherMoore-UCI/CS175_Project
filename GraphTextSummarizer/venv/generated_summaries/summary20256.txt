The rocket launch in April was timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, the founder and longtime leader of North Korea. Two previous rocket launches in 2006 and 2009 were followed weeks or months later by nuclear tests.

Many analysts assume an atomic test by North Korea is just a matter of time following the failure of a controversial rocket launch last month.
