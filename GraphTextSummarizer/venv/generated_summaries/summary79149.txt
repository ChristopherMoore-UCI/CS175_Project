Yet there was no mention of the feline on the Disneyland Paris Twitter page, and park spokeswoman Cathy Pianon said the park's security team -- while it was working closely with local authorities -- was never asked to reinforce their security. Montévrain Mayor Christian Robache told CNN affiliate BFM that authorities believe the tiger was domesticated, though an investigation is ongoing. While authorities haven't managed to corner the animal, all witnesses identified it as a tiger, according to Cédric Tartaud-Gineste, mayoral cabinet director in Montévrain. Both Chessy and Montévrain are adjacent to the Disney amusement park, which is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Paris. That's what French citizens say they saw Thursday in woods and other areas not far from Disneyland Paris, according to a local official.
