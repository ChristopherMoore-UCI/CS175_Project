In recent years, Manzarek and Krieger toured under the moniker Manzarek-Krieger, or Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of The Doors. Guitarist Robby Krieger says he and drummer John Densmore have been in contact since Manzarek's sudden death last month, following a battle with bile duct cancer. In 2002, Manzarek and Krieger formed a new version of The Doors called "The Doors of the 21st Century," featuring Ian Astbury from The Cult on vocals. The Doors were formed in 1965, after keyboardist Manzarek met a UCLA film student and poet named Jim Morrison on Southern California's Venice Beach. Even with new projects in the works, Krieger's thoughts haven't strayed too far from his friend, Ray Manzarek.
