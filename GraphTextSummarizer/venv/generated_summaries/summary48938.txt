Walter Renard Jones, 31 -- a grandson of the home's owner -- has been charged with injury to the elderly by act and injury to the elderly by omission, according to Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva. William Merle Greenawalt, 79, was pronounced dead six days later, Houston police said in a statement, which did not detail a cause of his death. -- One of three malnourished men found earlier this month in the garage of a Houston home has died, police said Tuesday. "All three men claimed the suspect used force and coercion to keep them there for the purpose of monetary gain." Investigators were looking into whether the men had been forced to hand over their government aid, including disability, Social Security and veterans checks. The charges came after officers responded to a call at a modest single-story Houston home and found three men "living without any level of care," police said.
