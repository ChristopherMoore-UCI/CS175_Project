The so-called "Literary Misery Index," devised by statisticians at Bristol University, shows how often words associated with sadness appeared in print, year by joyless year. In other words, about a decade after you have an economic crisis -- you tend to get more expressions of sadness in literature. It means biographies, histories -- maybe even cook books -- which were written in the aftermath of economic decline will statistically speaking contain more "sad" words... like "sorrow", "weeping" or "melancholy", Professor R. Alexander Bentley, Head of the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, at Bristol University, said: "To me the study confirms that we do have a collective memory that conditions the way we write, and that economics is a very important driver of that." Maybe that's why they call it the "dismal science." The researchers contend that it's not only novels which are influenced by economic despondency. U.S. unemployment hit 10% in October 2009 -- and it's only now beginning to fall to more "acceptable" levels.
