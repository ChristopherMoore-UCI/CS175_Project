Why it took Obama so long to address his no ISIS strategy comments Clarifying his position Speaking Wednesday, Obama addressed his much criticized statement last week that he has no strategy on ISIS in Syria. The extremist group ISIS "probably" won't be defeated under the current Obama administration, Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday. Last week, the Senate's top Republican told CNN that he would support congressional authorization for a new, broadened strategy to go after ISIS. Nudges from Congress Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson announced on Tuesday that he plans to introduce legislation making it clear the President has the authority for airstrikes against ISIS in Syria. After the beheading of journalist Steven Sotloff by ISIS militants, Obama faced a chorus of bipartisan calls from Congress to act more aggressively and come up with a concrete strategy to combat ISIS, beyond the ongoing targeted airstrikes in Iraq.
