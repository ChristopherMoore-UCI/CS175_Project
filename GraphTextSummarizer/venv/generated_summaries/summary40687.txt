"While eight of the top 20 clubs experienced a drop in revenue in 2011/12, in most cases this was due to less successful on-pitch performances in European club competitions, rather than wider recessionary impacts. Deloitte's Football Money League list is based on a club's revenue from match-day revenue, television broadcasting rights and commercial revenue. There is also good news for German club Borussia Dortmund, up to 11th from 16th, while Italy's Napoli climbed five places to 15th following its Champions League exploits last season. "This combined with new Premier League broadcast deals from 2013/14, which will deliver incremental distributions of between £20 million ($31.7 million) and £30 million ($47.5 million) per club, will help Manchester United push the two Spanish clubs above them, for a top two ranking," added Houlihan. The need for clubs to maximize these three areas will become ever important with the introduction of financial fair play regulations by European governing body UEFA.
