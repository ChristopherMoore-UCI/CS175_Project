Thompson and his unnamed co-conspirators allegedly disbursed "approximately $668,800 in excessive and unreported corporate contributions to pay for campaign services and campaign materials in coordination with and in support of" Gray's campaign, the papers said. Mayor Gray has always said he did not break any laws," he added. The allegations were made during a hearing at which a local businessman, Jeffrey Thompson, pleaded guilty to conspiracy for masterminding a nearly $670,000 illegal "shadow campaign" for Gray in 2010, federal prosecutors said. "In the Thompson charging documents, boilerplate language is used to describe all the campaigns that Thompson sought to illegally influence: (Hillary) Clinton's, Gray's and many others," said Thies. -- Prosecutors on Monday for the first time sought to link Washington Mayor Vincent Gray to campaign finance irregularities stemming from his successful 2010 bid as well as an effort to cover them up.
