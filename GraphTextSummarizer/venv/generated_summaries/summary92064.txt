The world No. 3 earned his first tournament success in 11 months as he routed fellow Spaniard Fernando Verdasco 6-0 6-1 to complete a triumphant return to his favored clay surface. Nadal will be top seed at the Barcelona Open starting next week, with the draw also including Sweden's Soderling, Verdasco, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France and Monte Carlo semifinalist David Ferrer. -- Rafael Nadal fired an ominous warning that he is ready to reclaim his French Open crown from Roger Federer after picking up a record-equaling sixth consecutive Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday. He has now won 54 successive matches on clay in the month of April, with six titles in Monte Carlo and five in Barcelona in that time. "For me, it is very emotional," Nadal, who equaled the 106-year-old record of six Monte Carlo titles held by Englishman Reggie Doherty, told the ATP Tour Web site.
