-- Attorney General Eric Holder Thursday ran into unexpected bipartisan opposition on Capitol Hill over the Justice Department's failure to release its report on the alleged misconduct of the prosecutors who mishandled the prosecution of the late Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens. Sens. Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, and Diane Feinstein, D-California, joined Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchinson, R-Texas, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, in urging Holder to release the internal Justice report promptly. Two Democrats and two Republicans jumped on Holder for not releasing the report by the Justice watchdog unit, the Office of Professional Responsibility. Stevens was convicted of failing to disclose a gift from a contractor friend on required campaign financial forms while seeking re-election in 2008. That report by independent attorney Henry Schuelke is expected to be released by trial judge Emmet Sullivan as early as March 15, although one of the prosecutors in the case is still fighting making that report public.
