-- Margaret Thatcher, one of the seminal political figures of the 20th century, will be remembered for her unswerving belief in the virtues of free market capitalism and the vices of socialism, and for her role in the downfall of communism. Opinion: Why Thatcher made so many enemies She guided Britain's economic base away from domestic monopolies and toward global capitalism. She had moved the political discussion from one of statism versus capitalism to a basic acceptance of free market economics as a standard of British political consensus. She believed the root causes were found not in the shifts of economic cycles, but in the failure of Britain's flawed economic model. Thatcher believed that pervasive unemployment and growing inflation were not just temporary threats, they were burying Britain's future.
