The magazine's newest issue features an article by Ayaan Hirsi Ali, who purports to lecture the West on how to best handle Muslim rage. There were headlines and stories that made it seem as though millions of Muslims across the world had taken to the streets, with Muslim countries in riots and businesses closed. Thousands of tweets bearing the hashtag #MuslimRage filled Twitter, showcasing satire at its best -- the type, by definition, which uses "wit, irony, or sarcasm used to expose and discredit vice or folly. How is this different from a radical Muslim cleric telling his followers that every American hates them -- from street vendors to the president -- because of their faith? The U.S. media -- and we're not just talking about Newsweek or Joe Scarborough -- need to act in a more responsible way.
