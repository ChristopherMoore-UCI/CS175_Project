The international race among sailors, kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind-powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all-time highs. According to a spokesman from the WSSRC, interest in speed sailing is steadily building, and the close competition has been giving it a boost. He said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work. The spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008. Even the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race has had a speed record of its own with current leader Ericsson 4 claiming the world record for the most distance sailed in a 24-hour period during the event's first leg.
