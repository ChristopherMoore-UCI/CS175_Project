-- Protests continued Friday in several California cities, including San Francisco, Palm Springs and Long Beach, over the passage of Proposition 8, which outlaws same-sex marriage. The three organizations filed the legal challenges on behalf of Equality California and six same-sex couples who did not marry before Tuesday's election, but would like to be able to wed now. According to the three groups, "such radical changes" as outlawing gay marriage cannot be made by ballot initiative, but must, "at a minimum, go through the state legislature first." The Mormon church strongly supported Proposition 8, which amends California's constitution to define marriage as legal only between one man and one woman. " Voters in Arizona and Florida also banned same-sex marriages in ballot initiatives Tuesday.
