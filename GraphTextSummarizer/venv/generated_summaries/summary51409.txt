In 2012, then-101-year-old Florence Detlor got a tour of Facebook's headquarters and a meeting with Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. When Facebook didn't have her birth year as an option, Ramireza helped Stoehr write a letter to CEO Mark Zuckerberg -- on a typewriter. According to CNN affiliate KARE-TV in Minneapolis-St. Paul, when she found the earliest birth year Facebook's sign-up page provides is 1905, she claimed to be a spry 99 years old. According to her Facebook page, Stoehr now has 31 friends on the site and has activated Facebook Mobile. Facebook did not respond immediately to a message seeking comment on Tuesday.
