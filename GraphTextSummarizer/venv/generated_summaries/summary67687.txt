Owned by the English Football Association, Wembley is hosting the final of the prestigious European club competition for the second time in two years, but on match day it is UEFA which assumes responsibility for the stadium in north London. Security in London has come under renewed focus after a British soldier was brutally killed close to barracks in Woolwich, south London on Wednesday. -- European football's governing body UEFA says it will continue to monitor security ahead of Saturday's Champions League final in London. "We would like to reassure travelling fans and visitors to London that there is nothing at this stage to suggest any threat to this event and an appropriate policing response will be in place to ensure the safety and security of those who attend the event. " Firearms officers are used as a response service by the Metropolitan Police Service and would not routinely be on patrol at events such as Champions League finals.
