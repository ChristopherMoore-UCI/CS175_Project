Mohit Kamboj, President of the Bombay Bullion Association says he does not think this hike in gold import duty will affect a consumers appetite for gold, even if it means a gold bracelet may cost a little bit more. It gives good returns -- domestic gold prices rose around 13% last year. "No one has got much return on investment besides gold." Investing in gold has been good for the retailer but according to Shubhada Rao, Chief Economist of Yes Bank, it's been a drag on the Indian economy. In India, gold is gifted at weddings, when a baby is born, during festivals, to mark a promotion -- at any celebratory occasion. There's one big problem with India's greed for gold.
