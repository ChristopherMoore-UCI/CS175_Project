'Giving away integrity' The NAACP and Sterling weren't strangers, and the group had honored Donald Sterling before, an analyst said. "The revelation that Mr. Sterling may have made comments in a phone conversation that were reminiscent of an ugly time period in American history that contained elements of segregation and racial discrimination demands that the Los Angles NAACP intention to honor Mr. Sterling for his lifetime body of work must be withdrawn, and his donation to the Los Angeles NAACP returned," the group said Monday when it withdrew its invitation. "There is a personal, economic and social price that Mr. Sterling must pay for his attempt to turn the clock back on race relations. Sterling is accused of making racist comments against African-Americans in an audio recording that surfaced last weekend that purportedly depict an argument between Sterling and V. Stiviano. Platonic." When asked why gave Sterling her such lavish gifts as expensive cars, the attorney said: "Because he cares about her." Nehoray also stated that Stiviano didn't distribute the recorded conservation.
