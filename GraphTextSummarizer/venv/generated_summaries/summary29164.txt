An official at Turkey's prime ministry, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told CNN, "If there are recordings similarly threatening to national security, there can be similar precautions taken on other social media." Until Wednesday, all of the wiretaps seemed to be recordings of phone conversations between Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his inner circle, government officials and some top corporate executives. "Monitoring such a meeting of a highly confidential nature which was held at a location such as the office of the Foreign Minister, where the most sensitive security issues of the State are discussed and releasing these conversations to the public are a despicable attack, an act of espionage and a very serious crime against the national security of Turkey," announced Turkey's Foreign Ministry in a statement on Thursday. "It is seen as appropriate that a temporary broadcast ban be implemented on the voice recordings on social media and alleged to be between the foreign minister, the head of the National Intelligence Agency and military officials,"  the Radio and Television Supreme Council -- Turkey's chief media regulating agency -- announced on its website. Turkey's government has accused social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook, of being used to spread false information and lies since the leaked, high-level conversations from inside the current government have spread online.
