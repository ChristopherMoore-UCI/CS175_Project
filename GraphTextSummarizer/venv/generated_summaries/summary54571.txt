The footage from a camera attached to the rearview mirror -- a common practice in South Korea -- shows that the car also drove through two red lights before it crashed into the stationary car at a speed believed to be 80 mph (129 kph). He twisted the car wheel to the left as he was trying to avoid the cars in front of him, and that is when the vehicle accelerated at a crazy speed. The Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs says it is investigating the claim of sudden unintended acceleration. Sohn Young-sam, an official at the ministry, told CNN that 80 claims of such acceleration have been investigated since 2003. Kwon says his mother, 63, had an operation for internal bleeding and is awaiting a second operation on her back.
