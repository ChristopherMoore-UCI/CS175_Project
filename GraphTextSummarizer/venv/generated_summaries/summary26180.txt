The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) last week introduced a new set of denominations, including a $100 million note, but that has not helped to clear long lines for cash at banks. Zimbabwe's new $500 million note Finance Minister Samuel Mumbengegwi made the announcement about the new note in a government gazette set for release Friday. Some people sleep outside banks after failing to get cash. The situation has been exacerbated by the closure of government hospitals for more than a month as health personnel demand the government review their salaries and equip the hospitals with medicines and modern machinery. Zimbabwe has had higher denominations than the $500 million note in the past.
