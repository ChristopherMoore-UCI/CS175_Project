The slaying of prominent Kremlin critic Boris Nemtsov in the heart of Moscow has shocked Russia and the wider world. In a hard-hitting interview conducted only hours before his death with Newsweek magazine, Nemtsov said Russia was "drowning" under Putin's leadership and was swiftly becoming a fascist state. Sir Andrew Wood, a former UK ambassador to Russia, told CNN that Nemtsov, whom he knew personally in the 1990s, was a "genuine Russian patriot" who opposed what the Kremlin had come to stand for. Nemtsov acknowledged in an interview with Russian newspaper Sobesednik this month that he was "a little bit" afraid that his mother's fear -- that Putin would have him killed -- would come true. " Nemtsov's lawyer Vadim Prokhorov told Russian media that Nemtsov's life had been threatened on social media in recent weeks.
