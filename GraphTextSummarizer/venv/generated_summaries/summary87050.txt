But Lampard doubled the advantage just past the hour mark when he converted from the penalty spot after substitute Salomon Kalou was tripped in the area by defender Ian Evatt. Chelsea have closed the gap on leaders Manchester United at the top of the English Premier League after a John Terry header and a Frank Lampard double gave them a comfortable 3-1 win at Blackpool on Monday. However, Blackpool remain in relegation trouble and they lie in 15th place, just two points and three positions above the relegation zone. Blackpool were unlucky not to level before half-time when midfielder Jason Puncheon's fierce low drive was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Petr Cech. Deportivo's victory means they are up to 13th position, five points clear of the bottom three, while Sociedad are ninth and look clear of relegation danger.
