-- The swollen Red River that forms the border between Minnesota and North Dakota crested near 40 feet in Fargo, North Dakota, a spokesman for the City of Fargo Fire Department said Sunday. The region usually has seasonal flooding after warm weather and rain melts snow in early spring. The river is expected to remain swollen for the next few days, said spokesman Jesse Schmidt. Rain forecast for Sunday had raised flooding fears along the Red River, where recreational boating was barred in several counties. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, talked Saturday about improved levees and preparations.
