-- Al Shabaab, which has connections to al Qaeda, is a militant Islamist group that controls much of southern Somalia and is active around the capital, Somalia. Links with al Qaeda Most Al Shabaab watchers believe that the organizational ties between the group and al Qaeda "central" are weak or non-existent. Mysterious al Qaeda 'envoy' dispenses aid in Somalia Al Shabaab formally declared its allegiance to al Qaeda in February 2010, claiming it would "connect jihad in the Horn of Africa to the jihad led by al Qaeda." At the same time, Al Shabaab commanders split from the political leadership of the ICU over talks with the government, which Al Shabaab rejected. Al Shabaab was able to regroup in southern Somalia, aided by the squabbling within the Western-backed transitional federal government.
