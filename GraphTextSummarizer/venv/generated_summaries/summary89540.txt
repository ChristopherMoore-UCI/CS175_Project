The main reason for the limited use of the program is that Amber Alert cases must meet very specific criteria. In California, where Sandra was murdered, 141 children have been safely recovered as a result of Amber Alerts since 2002, according to the California Highway Patrol. They used the full extent of their resources to try to safely recover Sandra, including dispensing an electronic alert to West Coast law enforcement agencies, heading a massive search effort and speaking to the media. The murder of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu in Tracy, California, has brought America's Amber Alert program under the microscope. That's why you'll often hear law enforcement in some states say they can't issue an Amber Alert without a vehicle description, while others don't follow that rule.
