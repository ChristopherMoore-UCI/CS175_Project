The Anthony Kiedis-led crew delivered a set comprised largely of the classics, aside from opening with the otherworldly percussion of new tune "Monarchy of Roses" (off 2011 album I'm With You), and their trademark fusion of rock, punk and funk riffs was on full display. After kicking off with his monster hit "Levels," which liberally samples Etta James' "Something's Got a Hold on Me," superstar DJ Avicii shifted through a familiar formula: searing, emotional vocal samples with giant synthesizer riffs. Several performances -- including those by Alabama Shakes, B.o.B., Temper Trap and Neon Indian -- were cancelled, and others were pushed back a few hours or shortened. Each track sent more young fans scrambling towards the Bud Light stage, many caked with mud. Shrouded by a smoke machine, lead singer George Lewis Jr. and his band made the most of their time with minimal stage patter that was as heart-on-sleeve as their music: "Turned out to be such a beautiful night."
