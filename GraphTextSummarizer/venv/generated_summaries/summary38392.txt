"The NOCs of Europe voted the proposal by secret ballot with an overwhelming majority," the EOC website reported after day two of the body's 41st general assembly in Rome. The Azerbaijan capital of Baku will host the first European Games, with around 15 sports to be on the program for the event -- which will be held "in spring or early summer" according to the European Olympic Committees website. "There are plenty of technical details to decide, but the Assembly has above all shown its will to go ahead and make this sports event, which is in no way intended to be a copy of the Olympic Games, a tool with which to enhance the attractiveness of sport. "The Baku delegation illustrated their project, presenting a modern and dynamic city that is practically ready to host this new sports event," the EOC said. The decision may put it in conflict with other sporting bodies.
