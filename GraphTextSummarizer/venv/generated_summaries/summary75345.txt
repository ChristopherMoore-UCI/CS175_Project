Business ethics and family responsibilities challenge George and his father, Charles (Brooks regular Jack Nicholson, broadly over-spluttering), a hard-charging financial tycoon who also happens to be George's boss. Should this compact, upbeat go-getter give her heart to Matty (Owen Wilson), a rich and famous major league baseball player whose vanity is offset by his sunny guilelessness and who offers great sex and good times? All this to-ing and fro-ing, this trying and failing on the way to (excuse the shrink talk) self-actualization is rich material for an expansive romantic comedy of psychological substance -- the kind, indeed, that Brooks has made his feature-film specialty, from "Terms of Endearment" and the great "Broadcast News to the sour Spanglish. The title question posed by the fumbled romantic comedy "How Do You Know" is open to more readings than writer-director James L. Brooks probably had in mind.
