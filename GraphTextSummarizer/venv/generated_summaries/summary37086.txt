This is the first time we have seen something like this," police officer Abdel Rahman Shama told CNN. According to Sharjah police, the couple arrived in the UAE last Friday but were not allowed to enter the country because they didn't have a visa for the infant. On Saturday, the impatient father persuaded his wife to put the baby in their hand luggage in the hope airport security wouldn't notice, police said. "Even if you are in a desperate situation, how can you put your child in a bag?" The parents remain in the UAE under police questioning. The infant is in good condition, police said.
