Rescuers have helped 131 other people out of the rubble and still are looking for more survivors from Friday's collapse of the two-story guesthouse at The Synagogue, Church Of All Nations, Nigerian Emergency Management Agency spokesman Ibrahim Farinloye told reporters at the collapse site. The building, at the church run by televangelist T.B. Joshua in the Ikotun area of Lagos, came down Friday afternoon amid work to build additional floors, NEMA said. On Tuesday, South African President Jacob Zuma said 67 South Africans were among the dead. But on its Facebook page Friday, NEMA said that two stories were being added without fortifying the foundation of the initial structure, and that there was a "high probability" this is what led to the collapse. "People travel from around the world to witness and receive from the mighty work that God is doing in the life of Prophet TB Joshua," the church's website says.
