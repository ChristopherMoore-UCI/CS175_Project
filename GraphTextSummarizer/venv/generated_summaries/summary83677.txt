A gutsy Sharapova saved match points in two different games with punishing forehands, both players took turns uttering shouts of "come on" -- Williams was penalized in the second set for yelling out in celebration when a point wasn't over -- and despite not being fully fit, Williams covered the court with aplomb. The world No. 1 beat second-ranked Maria Sharapova 6-3 7-6 (5) in the Australian Open final to move into sole possession of second place in grand slams won in the Open Era behind Steffi Graf's 22. A 12-minute rain delay in the first set -- during which Williams vomited off court -- forced organizers to close the roof on Rod Laver Arena and with conditions subsequently perfect for serving, it boosted Williams' already potent delivery. Besides suffering another defeat to Williams, Sharapova failed in her bid for a sixth major and first outside Roland Garros in seven years. With Williams finally holding match point on her own serve, she thought she hit an ace out wide.
