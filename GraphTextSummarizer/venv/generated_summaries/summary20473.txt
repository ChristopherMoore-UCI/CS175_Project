L.T. Wright and Dan Coppins were craftsmen by trade when they decided to turn their hobby making custom knives into a sharp business idea. Since it began, Blind Horse Knives has grossed more than $1 million and put 23 local craftsmen to work making 250 knives a week that have been delivered around the world, say Coppins and Wright. They branded themselves through social media, gun and knife shows, and word of mouth. The duo was so intrigued that they bought knife blades and products from the grocery store to craft their own knives -- all for $20 or less -- as a hobby. With several knives and nowhere to sell them, the pair attended a gun show where they met arrowhead maker R.W. Wilson, who began to mentor the men, teaching them about handcrafting and inviting them to shows to sell their products at his station.
