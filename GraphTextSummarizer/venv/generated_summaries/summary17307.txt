"Humanitarian workers are said not to go there." On August 10, the United Nations posted an online bulletin saying that 25 women had been raped in the villages, contradicting statements made by U.N. military spokesman Madnoje Mounoubai and special representative Roger Meece. Asked to explain the discrepancy, deputy U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters this week: "We are aware of the existence of a number of e-mails and we are trying to trace exactly how those e-mails were responded to." A July 30 internal U.N. e-mail that was relayed to relief agencies working in the area warned that the rebels had taken over the villages, and had already committed one instance of rape. "The question is -- how much area could they cover, and were they able to get into the areas where they needed to be, where the relevant information was?" U.N. officials have said they will toughen efforts to stop rapes in the region. Since the rapes were first publicly reported on August 22, more victims have come forward, the force said.
