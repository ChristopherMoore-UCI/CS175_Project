The Facebook picture features Diesel wearing an "Inhumans" T-shirt, standing in front of a graphic reading, "Are you Inhuman?" It's no sure thing, of course. Either way, his Facebook page features a photo post that hints about involvement in Marvel's forthcoming "Inhumans" movie -- and has the Web buzzing. Diesel as Black Bolt, the leader of the Inhumans, would please a chunk of fanboys. He already has a part in the Marvel universe, that of Groot, the laconic tree-like entity from "Guardians of the Galaxy," and Marvel doesn't like actors to play more than one role. The "Inhumans" movie isn't due out until November 2018, according to the Marvel calendar.
