Fuad Ibrahim eyes Africa Cup of Nations chance Tunisia triumph In Tuesday's other match in Group D, Tunisia scored a 90th-minute winner to see off Algeria 1-0 at Rustenberg's Royal Bafokeng stadium. Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure put Ivory Coast ahead in front of a small crowd in Rustenberg to ensure he has now scored in four successive Africa Cup of Nations tournaments. -- Ivory Coast, the perennial underachiever of the Africa Cup of Nations, began the 2013 tournament with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Togo on Tuesday. After suffering a shock defeat in last year's final by Zambia, "Les Elephants" are hoping to finally end a 21-year wait for the title in this month's competition in South Africa. Meanwhile, tournament organizers confirmed that Ethiopia has been fined $10,000 after its fans threw missiles onto the field of play during Monday's 1-1 draw with defending champion Zambia.
