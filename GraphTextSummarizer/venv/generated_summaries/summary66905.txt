-- Unable either to win the war in Ukraine by proxy or to retreat from the conflict because of the enormous blow a defeat would deliver to his regime's legitimacy, Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be sending in regular troops to attack Ukraine. A video appeal by Russian mothers asking Putin to bring their sons back from the battlefield in Ukraine went viral just this week. One hopes, of course, that Russian soldiers will not have to die en masse for their commander in chief to adjust his policy. Take the previous round of sanctions, which targeted only select Russian banks. This is only true, however, as long as Russian troops do not begin to sustain significant casualties.
