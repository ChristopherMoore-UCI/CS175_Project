Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Welsh and Air Force Secretary Michael Donley were "appalled" by the allegations against Krusinski, they told members of Congress at a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing. Obama's remarks at the White House were in response to new Pentagon statistics showing an increase in reports of sex assaults, as well as allegations of sexual battery against an Air Force officer who led a sex assault prevention unit. -- With a top Air Force officer facing allegations of sexual battery and the Pentagon releasing a troubling report on the number of sex crimes in the military Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski, 41, was arrested early Sunday in Arlington, Virginia, just outside Washington, accused of grabbing a woman's breasts and buttocks, Arlington County police said. She said she told the Air Force that the county has routinely prosecuted service members and will hold onto the case.
