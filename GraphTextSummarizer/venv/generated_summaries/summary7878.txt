The Nobel committee noted Steinman's "discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity. The decision was made Monday, just before the announcement, Nobel officials said. Ralph Steinman, a biologist with Rockefeller University, was named a winner Monday of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. "The events that have occurred are unique and, to the best of our knowledge, are unprecedented in the history of the Nobel Prize," the Nobel Assembly said in a statement, announcing that Steinman will remain a Nobel laureate. Speaking to CNN, Goran Hansson, secretary-general of the Nobel assembly overseeing the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, said the fact that Steinman didn't know he would win "adds to the sadness." Hansson said that after the committee chose the winners Monday, he tried to call Steinman to inform him of the good news.
