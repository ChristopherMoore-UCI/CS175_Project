Weatherwax was related to other showbiz figures, including actress Ruby Keeler and Lassie trainer Rudd Weatherwax. Pugsley was the older of the two Addams children on the cheekily macabre comedy, based on Charles Addams' darkly humored New Yorker cartoons. After the show left the air, Weatherwax -- who struggled to find other acting roles -- entered the Army. He later provided the voice of Pugsley on an animated "Addams Family" and worked as a grip and set builder in Hollywood, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Sister Wednesday (Lisa Loring), Uncle Fester (Jackie Coogan), butler Lurch (Ted Cassidy), Grandmama (Blossom Rock) and the disembodied hand Thing rounded out the cast.
