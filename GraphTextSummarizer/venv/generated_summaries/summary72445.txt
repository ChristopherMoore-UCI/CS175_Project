"We know that we are going to have an influx of fresh flowers, but we have a special operation to focus on more inspection" during the holiday madness, Maizuss said. Maizuss is a federal inspector lording over the arrival of millions of roses and other flowers from Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, intended for delivery to couples in the United States. "The ones that are reportable are the ones we already have here in the States, and the ones that are actionable are the ones that we actually don't want in the States at all, because they are invasive, because they are a big problem for the U.S. "Cut flowers is a huge industry, and it's very important we protect it all the time," said Maizuss, who's chief agriculture specialist. "What we do is we take a random sample out of each variety of flowers, and we do our inspection in either in an edit bay inside, or out on the dock," Maizuss explained at the border crossing, where motorist traffic is routinely backed up for an hour or more. Otay Mesa ranked No. 3 among the nation's busiest ports in processing Valentine flowers last year and No. 6 for finding plant pests in shipments.
