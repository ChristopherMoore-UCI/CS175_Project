The Florida jury on Saturday convicted Dunn, 47, on three charges of attempted second-degree murder for shooting into an SUV holding four black teenagers, after arguing with Jordan Davis, 17, about the volume of their music. Dunn testified that Davis threatened him, and he decided to take matters into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the Durango. " Misgivings about Florida law Miles spoke the same day Davis' parents told CNN's "New Day" that Florida's laws about self-defense need to be changed. Miles, 21, said she believes Dunn is guilty of murder, but not as charged. Dunn is white; Davis was black.
