"So very proud of you, my hero," tweeted daughter Kendall Jenner. "I accept that Bruce Jenner is a Republican and wish him happiness, even if I can't understand it," said Johnny McNulty. " The Jenner interview was a key moment for advocacy groups like GLAAD and  the National Center for Transgender Equality, thrusting LGBT issues into the spotlight. Of course, Jenner's family owned the moment, being the reality TV mavens they are -- the Jenners and the Kardashians. His other daughter Kylie Jenner expressed mixed emotions.
