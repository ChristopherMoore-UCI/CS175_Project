The Indian navy declined to provide an exact number of how many incidents had taken place on vessels in recent months, saying only that there had been "a couple of serious accidents involving submarines. Analysts say the current number of submarines is far fewer than India needs to patrol is lengthy coastline, but plans to update the fleet have been held up because of technical problems, bureaucracy and higher-than-expected costs. The Indian navy has been struggling to modernize its aging submarine fleet, which, like much of the Indian military, relies heavily on Russian hardware. Adm. D.K. Joshi, the navy's chief of staff, stepped down Wednesday after news of the problems on the submarine emerged, the government said. Two Indian sailors were found dead Thursday a day after the submarine they were on filled with toxic smoke, authorities said.
