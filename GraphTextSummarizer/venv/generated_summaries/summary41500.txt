In his farewell, Stewart said he was going to spend time eating meals with his family -- "who," he said, "I have heard from multiple sources, are lovely people." I hope that Stewart's departure from "The Daily Show" may usher in a new era -- in which the viewpoints of a younger generation are represented not just by old-ish white men but by actual younger people. Hopefully, too, the post-Stewart era will include more women, more racial minorities and more LGBT people. But the thought of nightly cable TV without him is a bit stunning -- for me, age 32, and for people of all ages, really, who get frustrated with the stilted earnestness of old-timey news programs, and who, likewise, are turned off by televised shouting matches and hype. Found ways to make uninterested people care about politics.
