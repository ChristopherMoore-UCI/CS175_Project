Connecticut-based Quark Expeditions said the M/V Ocean Nova became stranded Tuesday in the bay not far from an Argentine research base. We anticipate a positive outcome," Quark Expeditions president Patrick Shaw said. The Ocean Nova, seen on a previous voyage, has a total of 106 people on board. --   The owners of a cruise ship that ran aground in Marguerite Bay, Antarctica, are hoping high tide will dislodge the ship Wednesday, a company statement said. The captain is also waiting for divers from the Spanish naval ship the Hesp√©rides to inspect the hull of the Nova to make sure it's not damaged, the statement said.
