McCance, then vice president of the school district in Pleasant Plains, wrote on his personal Facebook page that he wanted gay people to commit suicide, according to The Advocate, a newspaper focusing on gay news. McCance used the terms "queer" and "fag" repeatedly, promised to disown his own children if they are gay and stated that he enjoys "the fact that [gay people] give each other AIDS and die. "The statements attributed to Mr. McCance constitute a significant departure from statements we expect from our school leaders. Because McCance's Facebook page is not accessible publicly, the Advocate said it learned about the posts after being provided with a screen shot. "I'm sorry I've hurt people with my comments," McCance said.
