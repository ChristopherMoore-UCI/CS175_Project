More than nine months on from Mubarak's overthrow, many of the things the country's revolutionaries fought against remain: The country is, in effect, a dictatorship, elections have yet to take place, and protesters fear the military will not give up its hold on power easily. " However, presidential elections are still months away -- Tantawi says they will be held by June 2012 -- and protesters are concerned that the military will remain de facto rulers until a new president is named. "The situation has become increasingly tense," said Dr Maha Azzam, Egypt expert and associate fellow at London-based international affairs think-tank Chatham House. In its place, a council of generals -- the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF) -- led by former defense minister Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, took charge. But high on the list of protesters' concerns is the fact that many members of the Supreme Council were close allies of the former president: The head of the SCAF, Hussein Tantawi, served as Mubarak's defense minister.
