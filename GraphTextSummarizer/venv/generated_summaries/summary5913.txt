Oconee County Sheriff Scott Berry has designated northern Georgia a "NO VALENTINES DAY ZONE" in a post on the department's Facebook page Wednesday night. Men are "exempt from having to run out and buy lottery scratchers and Hershey bars from the corner stores until February 18, 2014, due to ice, snow, freezing rain," the tongue-in-cheek post said. But for those who didn't manage a gift due to the ice and snow, commenter Bo Edwards has a suggestion for what they can tell their loved ones: "It's the thaw(t) that counts...." Border inspector picks flowers aimed for your Valentine "I think he was just trying to cut the monotony," dispatcher John Ogle told CNN. By pronouncement of the sheriff, there will be no Valentine's Day this Friday.
