Football's governing body FIFA will allow the use of two additional assistant referees in the UEFA Champions League for the next two seasons and the Asian Football Confederation's President's Cup in September, as well as competitions in Brazil, France and Mexico. The experiment, which involves an assistant behind the goal at either end of the pitch, was first tried at youth level and then last season in UEFA's second-tier Europa League. FIFA has been under increasing pressure to change its current system of match officiating following controversial incidents at the 2010 World Cup that saw England wrongly denied a goal against Germany and Argentina incorrectly awarded a score against Mexico. -- The experiment of extra match officials will be extended to Europe's top club competition and several other tournaments around the world.
