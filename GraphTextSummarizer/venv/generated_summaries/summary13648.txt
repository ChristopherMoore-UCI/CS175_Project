"Poaching is essentially not an issue anymore in Namibia because conservation efforts put local communities at the center," says Jeff Muntifering, a scientific advisor at SRT. By accommodating tourists willing to pay money to track rhinos on foot, they provided employment for locals and income for monitoring and research. How to keep it going While examples like STR in Namibia and tourism ventures such as the Rhino Desert Camp are the success stories of conservation, their effectiveness is being threatened again by a recent surge in poaching. Desert tracking Damaraland is now home to the largest concentration of black rhino on Earth. In response to these alarming figures, 46 countries agreed in London earlier this year on a declaration to tackle wildlife crimes.
