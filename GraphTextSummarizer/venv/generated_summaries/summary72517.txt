Philips says the bio-light would be more suited to providing mood lighting than "functional illumination." It forms part of a wider Philips Design's Microbial Home project which imagines an "integrated cyclical ecosystem" in the home where traditional waste is recycled to address sustainability issues. The new "bio-light" concept designed by Dutch electronics company Philips creates light in the same way that bioluminescent living organisms like fireflies and glow worms do. "Designers have an obligation to explore solutions which are by nature less energy-consuming and non-polluting," says Clive van Heerden, senior director of design-led innovation at Philips Design. "We need to push ourselves to rethink domestic appliances entirely, how homes consume energy and how entire communities can pool their resources," van Heerden said in a statement. It part of a wider swing to sustainable technologies, Haseloff says, but he doesn't see bioluminescent lights competing with LED and other low-energy lights in the future.
