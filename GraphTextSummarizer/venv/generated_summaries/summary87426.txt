AS: It's something that the people who are most famous as Internet experts of the last generation didn't really anticipate: that most people don't want to stay in their little cubicles and play Internet games all night. Most people want to get dates, buy presents more easily or meet up with their friends and family -- "Where can I go to get the business of life done more efficiently and be more like the person I want to be?" CNN: When did people first use the Internet as a campaigning tool? We're going to see the Internet facilitate continuous partial attention more and more for local issues, for political issues, for community events, for things happening in your social network. I think we're going to start to see a new model of civic advocacy where people get together once in a while to protest, but it's more about an ongoing, sustained engagement in issues, networks and communities about which people care. It leaves us more connected to a larger group of people and more at one with a lot more people in our community.
