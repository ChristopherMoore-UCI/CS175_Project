Federal agents on Tuesday raided a South Florida office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor whose past issues with authorities had already entangled Sen. Robert Menendez. Yet in an interview last spring with Bloomberg, Melgen insisted that he "did not ask Sen. Menendez or any public official to intervene. "While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government," Menchel said. Melgen, his wife Flor and his daughter Melissa have been generous donors to Menendez, his fellow Democrats and related causes in recent years. Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over.
