A neighbor said she was in her apartment in the building on West 165th Street -- half a mile from Yankee Stadium -- when she heard the boys' mother, Tashika Turner, screaming "Fire!" Hospital spokeswoman Nydia Negron said two children -- sisters ages 4 and 4 months -- were in stable condition in the intensive care unit; the mother was treated and released. "She saw me and said, 'Fire!' There was so much smoke and fire. The whole front, the kitchen, everything was on fire."
