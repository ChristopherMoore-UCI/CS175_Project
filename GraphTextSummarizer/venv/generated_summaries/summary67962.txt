Human rights conditions in Zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007, the report said, "with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association, assembly and expression." Members of the main opposition party, the MDC, along with other human rights defenders, were arrested, and many were tortured while in custody, Amnesty said. -- Human rights and freedom of the press in China, the detention of terrorist suspects by the United States and Russia's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in Amnesty International's annual report, released Wednesday, which looks at the state of human rights around the world. There were fewer reported disappearances in the Chechen Republic in 2007 than in previous years, Amnesty said, but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses. Amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in China and said censorship of the Internet and other media intensified last year. Amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the United States, where 42 people were executed last year.
