"With 1,819 pediatric patients on organ transplant waitlists and only 852 pediatric organ transplant donors each year, it is especially clear that we can and should, if possible, do more to encourage the public to become registered organ donors," Sibelius wrote. But doctors say modified adult lungs could help save her -- and adult lungs become available much more often. But because the review process involves research and public comment and because there's not enough organ donations for children, the nation's transplant system won't likely be able to save the life of Sarah Murnaghan, who could die within weeks without a transplant of lungs. So Sarah could only get available adult lungs if everyone else waiting for lungs in her region -- no matter how sick they are -- turns them down. "I ask that you pay particular attention to the age categories currently used in lung allocation, and review the policy with the intent of identifying any potential improvements to this policy that would make more transplants available to children," Sebelius said in a letter to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network.
