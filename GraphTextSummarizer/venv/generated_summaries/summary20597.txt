she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems," Col. Keith Schultz said in the Air Force report after piloting the eight-engine jet on the 1,000-mile flight. Stephen Sorge, a fuels specialist from the 307th Maintenance Squadron, said in an Air Force report on the project. "We were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed," Schulz said in the Air Force release. On February 13, Ghost Rider flew again, a three-hour flight from Davis-Monthan to its new home, Barksdale Air Force Base in Shreveport, Louisiana. Besides Barksdale, B-52s are based at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota.
