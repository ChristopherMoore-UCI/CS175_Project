And I had watched "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute" in the past, and it's a very popular show because it captures human emotion and spirit and it shows people doing extraordinary things for others. You hear fantastic stories about Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and a lot of other people who give money towards these amazing charities, but there are really thousands of ways where everyday people can donate -- even if it is a very small amount of money -- and help someone else who is in need. Apolo Anton Ohno: SeeYourImpact.org was first brought to me by a close friend who has been involved with philanthropic work for many years, and he said, "Apolo, I know you are involved with a lot of different charitable organizations, but this is one that can help change billions of lives around the world. At the end of the day, it's things like SeeYourImpact.org and CNN Heroes that really are what life is really all about. It made me happy to know that there are people out there who have really dedicated their lives toward helping others.
