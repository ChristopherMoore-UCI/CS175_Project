Indonesia said it is sending two warships to assist Australian rescue efforts. The Australian territory is closer to Indonesia and in the latter's designated search-and-rescue area, said Susan Usher of the Western Australian Police. "We never know the exact number of people onboard as they get onboard illegally," said Gagah Prakoso, a spokesman for Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency. A merchant ship was diverted to the scene and is taking on survivors, said Jo Meehan of the Australian Marine Safety Authority. An Australian naval vessel has also arrived on the scene and is preparing to take on survivors.
