British police want to question Robert Murat, a British man living in Portugal, in connection with the disappearance of Madeleine McCann at a Portuguese resort in 2007, a source close to the investigation told CNN. Murat's lawyer told CNN his client has not been informed of any British police request; Murat himself told ITV News he had been told of the development by Portuguese media. British police had been expected to travel to Portugal next week, but that trip was delayed for reasons unknown, the source said. Murat received an apology and damages from several UK newspapers after reaching an out-of-court settlement with them over libel claims. Police also want to question Murat's wife and several others, according to the source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
