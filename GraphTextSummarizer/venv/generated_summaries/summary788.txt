Labor Day is a holiday many American workers eagerly anticipate -- a three-day weekend, and a respite from work to relax and celebrate with friends and family. As you're calculating how many bags of buns you need to go with that jumbo pack of hot dogs at your barbecue (they never seem to match up), here are some other Labor Day numbers to contemplate. 685,000: Number of workers who were placed into new jobs through the Workforce Investment Act Adult and Dislocated Worker programs. 30: Percentage reduction of overall family summer travel from May through September. 33 million: Americans who plan to travel at least 50 miles over Labor Day weekend this year, according to AAA.
