English Premier League champions Manchester United have rejected a bid for striker Wayne Rooney from rivals Chelsea. "Chelsea Football Club can confirm that yesterday it made a written offer to Manchester United for the transfer of Wayne Rooney," the Chelsea statement read. At the end of last season, outgoing manager Alex Ferguson confirmed that Rooney had submitted a transfer request. The club eventually won by 11 points from rivals Manchester City, but Rooney was playing second fiddle to striker Robin van Persie who signed from Arsenal at the beginning of the 2012/13 season. "Although the terms of the offer are confidential, for avoidance of doubt and contrary to what is currently being briefed to the press in Sydney (where Manchester United are currently on tour), the proposed purchase price does not include the transfer or loan of any players from Chelsea to Manchester United," the Chelsea statement read.
