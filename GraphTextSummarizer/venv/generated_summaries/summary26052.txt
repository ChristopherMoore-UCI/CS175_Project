-- Nearly eight months after Superstorm Sandy devastated low-lying areas, Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Tuesday for a $20 billion system of flood walls, levees and other measures to protect vulnerable regions from storms and the effects of climate change. The plan outlines working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to strengthen dune systems and beaches across Staten Island, South Brooklyn and Queens, including Coney Island and along the Rockaways. Proposed protections include surge barriers and flood walls in Manhattan's Lower East Side, Chinatown, the Financial District, parts of East Harlem and the Bronx, and Brooklyn's Redhook. The plan includes changes to the city's construction codes that will raise standards for new construction and infrastructure. Bloomberg said money already allocated for Sandy relief provides $10 billion.
