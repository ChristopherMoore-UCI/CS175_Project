Authorities have identified the man who opened fire at Fort Hood in Texas on Wednesday, killing three people before committing suicide, as Specialist Ivan Lopez. While aboard Air Force One, Obama received an update from top defense and FBI leaders about Wednesday's shooting at Fort Hood, the White House said in a statement. Sixteen more people were injured Wednesday when he opened fire at Fort Hood, the sprawling Army post in Texas still on edge after a mass shooting there left 13 dead in 2009, officials said. The suspect, a soldier who had served in Iraq, "had behavioral health and mental health" issues, Milley told reporters late Wednesday. Wednesday's shooting reminded many in the central Texas community of that incident.
