The drills, which are to run through Friday, are "designed to send a clear message of deterrence to North Korea," U.S. Forces Korea have said. The six are China, Russia, North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and the United States. North Korea warned Tuesday that the continuing military drills by the United States and South Korea could lead to "all-out war any time." North Korea denies sinking the ship and says South Korea and the United States are using it as a pretext to conduct the war games. The war of words got louder when South Korea and the United States launched joint anti-submarine military exercises in the Yellow Sea on Monday, a move that drew North Korean ire.
