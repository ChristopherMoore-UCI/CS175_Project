Frustrated with Republican votes against the $7.4 billion measure because Democrats suspended the rules to prevent them from offering unrelated amendments -- and at the same time requiring a two-thirds majority to pass -- Democratic Rep. Anthony Weiner excoriated the minority party. She told CNN Friday that passing the bill under suspension rules was "a very high bar." "My goal is to have it on the floor again under regular rule, majority rule, which would require only 218 votes. King told CNN Friday that if the bill went to simple majority vote he "would sit with the Democrats all day and defend the bill against the Republicans." "It takes great courage to wait until all Members have already spoken and then stand up and wrap your arms around procedure," Weiner began. Democratic New York Rep. Carolyn Maloney -- the sponsor of the bill who has been working on the legislation since just after terrorist attacks -- is working to convince  her party's leadership to hold a simple majority vote before the ninth anniversary of the attacks.
