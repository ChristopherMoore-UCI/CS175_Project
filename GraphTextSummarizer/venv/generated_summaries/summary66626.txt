" While it has been widely reported that flocks of sheep in the project could transmit WiFi and improve internet coverage in rural areas, Professor Blair said this is not the aim of the research. "I would worry about sheep flocking behavior -- I don't think sheep are the right animals to do this. He doubts whether sheep could ever become roving wireless internet transmitters. "The sensors might be too big for ear tags and sheep do lose ear tags. " While the study is limited to sheep flocks for the time being, Blair said there's no reason why it may not be extended to other livestock animals.
