The swapped-out flags were spotted by construction workers at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, NYPD Deputy Commissioner for Intelligence John Miller said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. Miller said that the NYPD has video that shows a number of people crossing the bridge just after 3 a.m. Tuesday and within the hour, the light that normally illuminates the flag on the Brooklyn side of the bridge flickered and appeared to go out and a few minutes later the same thing occurred on the Manhattan tower. "This may be somebody's art project, or it may be an attempt at making some kind of statement, but at this point it's not clear what that statement is. He said members of the Emergency Service Unit found two flags, one on each tower of the bridge, that appeared to be American flags that had been bleached white. "If flying a white flag atop the Brooklyn Bridge is someone's idea of a joke, I'm not laughing," Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams said in a statement.
