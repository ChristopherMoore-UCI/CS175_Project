That's the case in parts of upstate New York, where powerful bursts of rain falling in already saturated areas swelled rivers, caused waters to cascade from hills and contributed to sudden floods that "just destroyed and demolished (homes) in a matter of minutes, just out of the blue," Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday. The reasons are that, by Saturday evening, rivers around the area had already crested, meaning the flooding threat from them should not get any worse immediately. One woman is unaccounted for in Fort Plain, a village along the Mohawk River and the New York State Thruway about 55 miles west of Albany, that village's police Chief Robert A. Thomas III told CNN. States of emergency were in effect Saturday for 15 counties -- affecting cities from Binghamton near the Pennsylvania border north to Plattsburgh, which is close to Canada. Still, the last few days are a not-so-subtle reminder that things can change quick: The National Weather Service forecasts a chance of heavy rain from Sunday night through Tuesday.
