Many expected Donovan to be named to the 2014 team and make an appearance in his fourth World Cup, but he was cut by U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann, who praised the player Thursday. "Landon Donovan is one of the most significant figures in the history of soccer in the United States," L.A. Galaxy coach and former U.S. coach Bruce Arena said Thursday. "As one of the best players in U.S. soccer history, Landon should be proud of everything he has accomplished." The 5-foot-8 forward has been the highest profile American player for many years. The exceptionally fast Donovan scored one of the most famous goals in U.S. history, knocking home a stoppage-time shot in the 2010 World Cup to beat Algeria and get the United States out of group play.
