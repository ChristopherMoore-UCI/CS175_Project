The suspect in Sunday night's attack was killed in a shootout with police after the explosion, Cali Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina said Monday, hours after convening a special security meeting in the middle of the night. The explosion caused damage in a two-block area, the Cali news Web site Semana.com said. It was the fourth bombing in Cali in less than 42 months, Semana.com said. "Although the explosive device only had moderate impact," Ospina said on the Cali government Web site, "we should not forget we are at war and the FARC has been committing terrorist acts in Bogota, Neiva, Cali and other cities in the country.
