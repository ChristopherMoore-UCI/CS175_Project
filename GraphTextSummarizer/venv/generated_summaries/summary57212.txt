In a separate development on Wednesday, PGA Championship organizers announced that the 2016 edition of the competition will be held in July. -- Tiger Woods has not only declared himself fit to play at this week's PGA Championship, after playing nine holes of practice at Valhalla on Wednesday, but he's also eying a fifth title. While keeping a close eye on Woods' practice round, the veteran Watson also named Steve Stricker as one his Ryder Cup vice-captains on Wednesday -- with the 47-year-old joining Andy North and Raymond Floyd as an assistant. The event is traditionally held in August but with golf featuring at that year's Olympics for the first time since 1904, with the Rio Games running between August 5-21, the PGA has been forced into a change. "(To) try to go out there and win this event, that's all I'm focused on," said Woods, who won the PGA Championship the last time it was held at Valhalla Golf Club in 2000.
