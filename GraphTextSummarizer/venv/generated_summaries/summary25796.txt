In past cases involving pregnant or nursing women, the Sudanese government waited until the mother weaned her child before executing any sentence, said Christian Solidarity Worldwide spokeswoman Kiri Kankhwende. However, because her father was Muslim, the courts considered her one too, which would mean her marriage to a non-Muslim man is void. The filing asks the appeals court to reverse the verdict by the lower court and free Meriam Yehya Ibrahim, 27. Attempts to contact Sudan's justice minister and foreign affairs minister for comment were unsuccessful. "The fact that a woman could be sentenced to death for her religious choice, and to flogging for being married to a man of an allegedly different religion, is abhorrent and should never be even considered," said Manar Idriss, Amnesty International's Sudan researcher.
