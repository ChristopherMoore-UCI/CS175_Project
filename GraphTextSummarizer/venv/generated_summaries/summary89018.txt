Liquid natural gas imports alone climbed 28.2% year on year, according to the ministry's preliminary report. -- Japan -- battered by a strong yen, slowing global demand and increased oil and gas imports due to last year's Fukushima nuclear disaster -- posted a record trade deficit of $18.7 billion in January, according to official figures released Monday. Exports fell 9.3% year-on-year, according to figures released by the country's Ministry of Finance Monday.
