" Uganda declared the outbreak of the second Marburg epidemic following laboratory tests confirming that one health worker, a 30-year-old male radiographer, had died of the hemorrhagic fever at a Kampala hospital on September 28. Marburg virus causes symptoms similar to Ebola, beginning with fever and weakness and often leading to internal or external bleeding, organ failure and death. Marburg virus was first identified in 1967, when 31 people became sick in Germany and Yugoslavia in an outbreak that was eventually traced back to laboratory monkeys imported from Uganda.
