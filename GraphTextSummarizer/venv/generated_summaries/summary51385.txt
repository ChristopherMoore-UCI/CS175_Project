Margarito says sorry for Roach video Mayweather is represented by Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions, but has been linked with legendary entrepreneur Don King. "Todd will ask Floyd, 'Who is your chosen representative, who should we sit down with to put this fight together?' "We don't care who Floyd says, who he picks, be it Don King, Golden Boy or anyone else." The Filipino became the first fighter to win world titles in eight divisions on Saturday night after claiming the vacant WBC super-welterweight belt from Antonio Margarito in a brutal bout that left his opponent needing facial surgery. Mayweather last fought in May, beating Shane Mosley, but has since been embroiled in domestic violence claims by his former girlfriend and faces criminal charges in court in January. Todd will ask one question and one question only, and that is whether Floyd wants to fight Manny," Arum said in quotes carried by sports website FanHouse.
