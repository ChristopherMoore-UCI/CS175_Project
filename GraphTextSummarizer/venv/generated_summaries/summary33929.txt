Father Alberto Cutie will deliver a sermon Sunday at a Florida Episcopal Church. Cutie (pronounced koo-tee-AY) was received into the Episcopal Church earlier Thursday at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Miami, Florida. After the photographs surfaced, Cutie was removed from his duties at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace Networks. " He had been president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications, home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace. "Father Cutie is still bound by his promise to live a celibate life, which he freely embraced at ordination," Favalora said.
