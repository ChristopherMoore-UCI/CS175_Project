But the guide also says it's important to know the location of ethnic groups that might be vulnerable to hate crimes in order for law enforcement to protect such communities. The organization's press release says the FBI's operations guide gives agents authority to gather information and make maps of "so-called 'ethnic-oriented' businesses, behaviors, lifestyle characteristics and cultural traditions in communities with concentrated ethnic populations." The FBI Domestic Intelligence and Operations Guide says agents can identify areas with concentrated ethnic populations "if these locations will reasonably aid the analysis of potential threats and vulnerabilities. The ACLU press release says, "the FBI's attempt to collect and map demographic data using race-based criteria for targeting purposes invites unconstitutional racial profiling by law enforcement."

The spokesman said this needs to be done in a manner consistent with protecting civil rights and civil liberties.
