French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet said the declaration of independence in northern Mali was meaningless if it was not recognized by African states. -- Mali state television announced late Friday that the leader of Mali's coup, Captain Amadou Sanogo, and the Economic Community of West African States have agreed to a plan under which the coup leaders will hand over power to the civilian government in exchange for the end of trade and diplomatic sanctions. The announcement of a promised return to civilian rule came shortly after separatist rebels, who had captured large areas of Mali's vast Sahara region in the north of the country, declared independence for a region they call Azawad. The Tuareg rebels' seizure of northern Mali followed a military coup last month that toppled the government and threw the country into turmoil. ECOWAS representatives met Thursday in the Ivorian capital, Abidjan, to discuss possible military intervention in Mali to restore democratically elected Amadou Toumani Toure to the presidency.
