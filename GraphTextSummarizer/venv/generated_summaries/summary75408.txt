Mozala camp houses 573 people from ethnic Rakhine communities in temporary bamboo shelters. The Red Cross is bringing in drinking water as part of its emergency relief program that distributes 8,000 liters of safe water to camps each day. While the longterm solutions to this crisis remain unclear, the need for drinking water, food, shelter and medical care are very evident. Soon a new rotation will arrive, and these teammates will return home, back to their communities, jobs and normal day-to-day lives -- an impossible reality now for the thousands of displaced families in Rakhine. Several hundred "long houses" -- temporary shelters which house eight to 10 families -- have already been built.
