Qadri confessed to assassinating Taseer because "he did blasphemy of the Prophet Mohammed," Naeem Iqbal, spokesman for Islamabad police, said Tuesday. Pervez said Qadri came from an area of Rawalpindi called Sadiq Abad, adjacent to the capital, Islamabad. Qadri told police Taseer had described the blasphemy laws as "the black laws." Officials say Judge Malik Mohammad Akram Awan was asked to come to Islamabad to preside over the hearing. The warning signs about Qadri go back even further, said Rana Shahid Pervez, senior police official in Rawalpindi.
