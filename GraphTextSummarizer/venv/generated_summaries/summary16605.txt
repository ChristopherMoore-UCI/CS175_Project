German striker Miroslav Klose scored his team's second goal, giving him 16 in World Cup matches, one more than Ronaldo. Germany now also lays claim to most goals by one nation in its World Cup history -- 223. We got disorganized and panicked after the first goal and then it all went wrong for us," Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said. Not only was the Selecao beaten badly, but famed goal scorer Ronaldo was bumped off the top of the all-time World Cup goal scoring list. Klose's first shot was saved by a sprawling Brazil keeper.
