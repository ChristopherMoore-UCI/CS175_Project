"Esther Vergeer is a tremendous ambassador not only for tennis but also for disability sports," Ricci Bitti said. Her 470 consecutive wins is not a world record; Pakistani squash star Jahangir Khan won 555 successive matches between 1981-86. As well as her own charity, she has worked closely with the foundation set up by her compatriot Johan Cruyff, one of the most iconic figures in Dutch soccer. The 31-year-old has dominated wheelchair tennis for more than a decade, winning seven Paralympic gold medals, 13 world titles and all 21 of the grand slam singles events she entered, plus 23 in doubles. She was hailed as an inspirational figure by the head of the International Tennis Federation, Francesco Ricci Bitti.
