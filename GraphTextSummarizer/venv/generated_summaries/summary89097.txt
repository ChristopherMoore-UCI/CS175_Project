In a bold move away from the works of Michelangelo, Rafael and Giotto for which it is renowned, the Holy See picked Italian new media art collective Studio Azzurro, Czech-French photographer Josef Koudelka, and Australian-born U.S. painter Lawrence Carroll to interpret its chosen theme. Its art collection is the envy of galleries the world over, but until now the Vatican has been better known for Renaissance masterpieces rather than hip modernist artworks. He said Carroll had used salvaged materials to form a meditation on "Re-Creation" and the "continuous and cyclical action of recovery and erosion... forcing fragility and monumentality to coexist." Antonio Paolucci, director of the Vatican Museums, said Studio Azzurro's installation explored the theme of "Creation" using "the immaterial image, light, sound, and sensory stimuli." Paolucci said Koudelka had selected a "specific and extremely evocative sequence" of his photographs to examine the idea of destruction, or "Un-Creation," "[exposing] an abandoned, wounded world." Ravasi said the book -- and the artists' works it had given rise to -- examined "the mystery of man's origins, the introduction of evil into history, and our hope and future projects after the devastation symbolically represented by the Flood."
