In the future, LaBrot hopes to set up permanent clinics that would be run by local health care workers in the three countries they've visited. In addition to providing medical care, Floating Doctors enlists locals to help with smaller-scale projects that address specific community needs. Today, LaBrot's "backpack" can carry 20,000 pounds of medical supplies. LaBrot first steered "The Southern Wind" to Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, delivering 20,000 pounds of medical supplies, 80 sheets of plywood and 2,500 pounds of tin roofing. The group has installed water filtration systems, built ramps for the disabled, improved care for the elderly and raised awareness about local health issues.
