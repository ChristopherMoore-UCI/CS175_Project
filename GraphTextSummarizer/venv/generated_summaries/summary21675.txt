But the plane can also be temperamental, especially for pilots without much DC-3 experience, says Catalina Air Boats pilot Robby Bolling, who flies a daily DC-3 cargo route from Long Beach, California, to Catalina Island, about 30 miles offshore.

"One of the most common comments I hear when some passengers come on board is, 'Wow, there's really an angle here,' " says Ric Hallquist, a longtime pilot for Missionary Flights International. That's kind of unbelievable in an age when dozens of younger types of airliners have already retired to aviation boneyards.
