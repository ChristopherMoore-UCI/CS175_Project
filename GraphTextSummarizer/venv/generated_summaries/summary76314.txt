Racing, watched by new Indian owner Ahsan Ali Syed, took the lead in the 33rd minute through Argentine striker Ariel Nahuelpan. Valencia were reduced to 10 men when defender David Navarro was booked in the 54th minute, but still drew level through Argentine midfielder Tino Costa with 12 minutes to play. Syed became only the second foreign owner in La Liga earlier this month, following the pre-season acquisition of Malaga by Qatar's Sheikh Abdallah Ben Nasser Al-Thani. -- Fourth-placed Valencia snatched a 1-1 draw at lowly Racing Santander despite having two players sent off on Monday in a result that did little to help either side's Spanish league hopes. Portuguese defender Ricardo Costa joined Navarro on the sidelines after his second yellow card with a minute to go in regulation play, while Santander's Algeria midfielder Medhi Lacen suffered the same fate in time added on.
