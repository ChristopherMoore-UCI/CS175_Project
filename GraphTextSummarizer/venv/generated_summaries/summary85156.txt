The judge also ordered Edson, also known as Kayvon Edson, to be seen at a state hospital that evaluates defendants' sanity after a mental health professional told the judge that Edson has a history of psychiatric disturbances. Edson was arrested after carrying the backpack with a rice cooker near the finish line on Boylston Street in Boston while survivors of the 2013 bombing were commemorating its anniversary on April 15. Wark said prosecutors decided to drop the charge after reviewing statements Edson made at the scene as well as video shot by onlookers. Investigators dropped the charge because they say the suspect, Kevin Edson, 25, did not communicate an "overt threat that an incendiary device would be detonated," Jake Wark, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney, told CNN. A judge in April set bail at $100,000 for Edson.
