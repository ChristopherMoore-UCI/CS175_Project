After the documentary screening, a panel consisting of bully prevention experts, the president of Cartoon Network and some victims of bullying discussed bully prevention. Before part of the documentary was screened, students watched a taped message from President Barack Obama in which he said bully prevention is important to him both as the president and as a father. Sebelius told students gathered at Stuart-Hobson Middle School that bullying is simply unacceptable, "You shouldn't ever have to go to class with an empty feeling in your stomach, trying to figure out what was going to happen in that class. The documentary, set to air Sunday on Cartoon Network, consists of interviews with children who say they were bullied in school and includes strategies on how to bring an end to bullying. While Sebelius acknowledged there's only so much the federal government can do to prevent bullying, she did say its prevention is a basic human right.
