The five officers have been fired, Mayor Larry Langford said at a news conference Wednesday. Police had chased the van almost 50 miles, winding from downtown Birmingham to suburban Hoover. "The culture of the past was that police brutality was acceptable," Langford said. Warren was charged with attempted murder, but no trial took place because he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault. It showed the end of a 100-mile-an-hour police chase of a van driven by Anthony Warren, suspected of illegal drug activity.
