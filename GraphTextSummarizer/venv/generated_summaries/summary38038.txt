Hezbollah's use of drones marked a milestone for terrorist groups worldwide: It would be the first time a terrorist group used armed drones successfully to carry out an attack. That said, it will likely be many years before other countries or terrorist groups are able to build up the capacity that the United States has to carry out lethal drone strikes. Described as a 2-foot-long quadcopter -- a drone with four propellers -- the event raises some troubling questions about the possibility that terrorists using armed drones could one day attack the White House or other tightly guarded U.S. government locations. Today, there are at least 7,000 drones in theÂ U.S. arsenal, more than 200 of which are armed drones that have killed thousands of people. Armed drones will likely prove as important to the future of warfare as tanks were during World War II.
