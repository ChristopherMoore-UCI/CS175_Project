Arriving in Vienna for the talks, Zarif said a deal hinged on the political will of the West, making clear Iran would "be resisting excessive demands" in the final negotiating sessions. As world powers are gathering in Vienna this week for a final round of nuclear talks with Iran, Western diplomats put their chances of a comprehensive deal at 50 percent at best and a breakthrough before the Nov. 24 deadline appears highly unlikely. Diplomats say Iran has indicated a willingness to ship much of its estimated 28,000 pounds of enriched uranium to Russia, where it would be converted into nuclear fuel for civilian usage. A key component of extending Iran's breakout time centers around limiting the amount of enriched uranium Iran is able to produce and keep on hand. But a recent IAEA report, obtained by CNN, said that Iran has failed to address the suspicions by explaining its activity on high explosives testing and other nuclear activity.
