The arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. Chinese authorities have blamed Uyghurs for a vehicle attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October that killed five people -- including the three in the vehicle -- and wounded 40 others. Xinjiang's worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting in the capital, Urumqi, between Uyghurs and Han Chinese killed some 200 people and injured 1,700. The violence took place around 6:30 a.m. in Yarkant County in western Xinjiang and is under investigation, authorities said. Chinese authorities have cracked down heavily on violence involving Uyghurs, deepening resentment.
