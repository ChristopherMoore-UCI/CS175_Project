The death of Dr. Martin Salia, who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone, marks the second time Ebola has claimed a victim in the United States. The team caring for Salia in Sierra Leone characterized him as critical ill, possibly sicker than patients treated successfully in the United States, according to Nebraska health officials. Complete coverage of Ebola When Salia arrived Saturday at Nebraska Medical Center, he was in "extremely critical" condition, doctors said. Spending time with Salia's wife, Isatu Salia, shed light on how anguishing it is to have a loved one suffer from Ebola, Morris said. "It was an absolute honor to care for Dr. Salia," said Rosanna Morris, Nebraska Medical Center's chief nursing officer, at a news conference in Omaha.
