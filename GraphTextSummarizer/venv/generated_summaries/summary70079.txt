For several days before and after each solstice the sun appears to stand still in the sky, i.e., its noontime elevation does not seem to change from day to day. A solstice is different from an equinox, the two times each year when the sun is directly above the Earth's equator and day and night are of equal length. Solstice loosely translated in Latin is "sun stands still". The site was closed for 16 years after rioting broke out between police and revelers for several years at solstice gatherings. Summer solstice will take place on June 21, 2013.
