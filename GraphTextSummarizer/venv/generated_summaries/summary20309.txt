A 71-year-old man died Wednesday night in Derry Township, Pennsylvania, as he was bailing water out of the basement of his home and the walls of the structure caved in, said Chief Patrick O'Rourke of Derry Township Police. High water blocked dozens of roads in Baltimore County, according to CNN affiliate WMAR-TV. In Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, CNN iReporter Nick Bohacz said flooded roads prevented him from getting to work. -- The swollen Susquehanna River began receding in northern Pennsylvania on Friday as authorities there and in other eastern U.S. states hit by the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee surveyed the damage. Plymouth Township resident Francis Federici was forced to leave his home, which sat in five feet of floodwaters.
