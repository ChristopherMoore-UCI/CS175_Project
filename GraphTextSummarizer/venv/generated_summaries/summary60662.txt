Last month the radius from JFK and LaGuardia airports where Canada geese would be removed and euthanized was increased from five to seven miles and Bannerman said the new radius included Brooklyn's Prospect Park. "When geese are killed, more birds simply move in to use available resources, and the temporary spike in the food supply results in accelerated breeding. Bannerman said that 1,200 Canada geese were euthanized in 2009 in 17 New York locations. Bannerman said Canada geese were responsible for over 600 damaging airstrikes to U.S. planes between 1990 and 2008, and that their population was rapidly increasing. "JFK and LaGuardia are between six and seven miles from Prospect Park border-to-border," she said adding that she understood that attachment that people in the area have to the geese.
