" Police said Monday that Jerad Miller shot Officer Igor Soldo in the back of the head, then shot fellow Officer Alyn Beck in the neck before Miller's wife, Amanda, pulled a gun from her purse and also fired on Beck. Upon completing that action, he did not realize that Amanda Miller was with Jerad Miller," McMahill told reporters. Amanda Miller shot her husband repeatedly as officers closed in on them inside the Walmart, McMahill said. He continued: "As soon as he began to confront Jerad Miller with his firearm, Amanda Miller removed her firearm and shot him one time in the ribs area where he immediately collapsed." Wilcox, 31, "died attempting to protect others," Gillespie said. The pair ran to Walmart where Jerad Miller fired off one round and told people to get out, McMahill said.
