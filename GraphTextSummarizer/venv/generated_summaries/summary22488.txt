In his writings, author Avijit Roy yearned for reason and humanism guided by science. " Mukto Mona contains sections titled "Science" and "Rationalism," but most of the articles hold science up to religion as a litmus test, which it invariably fails. "A well-known extremist ... openly issued death threats to me through his numerous Facebook statuses," Roy wrote. Roy and the blog's other critics took off the gloves when it came to religion, particularly Islam. But at night, secularist sympathizers marched through a street holding torches; by day, others held a sit-in to protest Roy's killing.
