-- A Michigan man and woman were convicted Thursday of trying to extort $680,000 from "Full House" actor John Stamos by threatening to sell compromising photos that prosecutors say were never found. Scott Edward Sippola, 31, and Allison Lenore Coss, 24, could face up to nine years in prison for convictions of conspiracy and interstate communications to extort money, said assistant U.S. Attorney Maarten Vermaat. FBI agents got involved and started monitoring Stamos' e-mail account and "eventually communicated by cellular telephone with the defendants pretending to be Mr. Stamos' business manager." According to WLUC, Coss testified there were several photos depicting Stamos using cocaine. Vermaat said the defendants sent about 40 e-mails to Stamos threatening to sell the photos.
