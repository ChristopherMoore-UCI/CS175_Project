It was Hispanics being racist toward other Hispanics. I always thought undocumented immigrants were working the farms and not speaking English. Throughout high school, I was always careful about what I said in my circle of friends. They were second- or third-generation Mexicans who spoke English at school and hung out with the white kids. I spoke perfect English.
