Without an attitude of service to bishops and churches worldwide, he said, "the structure of the Curia turns into a ponderous, bureaucratic customs house, constantly inspecting and questioning, hindering the working of the Holy Spirit and the growth of God's people. " Holiness encompasses an openness to God, prayer, deep humility and fraternal charity in relationships with fellow workers, Francis said. The Roman Curia, which includes Vatican staff, priests and cardinals, gathered in the ornate Clementine Hall. The church needs "people who work with competence, precision and self sacrifice in the fulfillment of their daily duties," he said. He also urged the Curia to avoid indulging in gossip, saying: "Gossip is harmful to people, our work and our surroundings."
