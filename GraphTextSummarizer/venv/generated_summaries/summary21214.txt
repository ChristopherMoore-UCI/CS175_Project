The claim: "Yeah, I'm not in favor of new pieces of legislation on -- on guns and taking guns away or making certain guns illegal. Responding to a question at Tuesday's presidential debate that referred to reintroducing the Clinton-era assault weapons ban that expired in 2004, Republican candidate Mitt Romney said that it was already illegal to own those kinds of guns in the United States. Semi-automatic weapons account for about 15 percent of the more than 250 million privately owned firearms in the United States, according to the National Rifle Association (NRA). The counterclaim: President Barack Obama did not challenge Romney on the issue, having mainly steered clear of gun rights during the campaign. We, of course, don't want to have automatic weapons, and that's already illegal in this country to have automatic weapons," Romney said.
