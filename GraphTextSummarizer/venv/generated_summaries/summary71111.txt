The affected products, known as Uncle Ben's Infused Rice, are sold in 5 pound and 25 pound bags through wholesale distributors, said Mars Foodservices, the company that produces them. Mars Foodservices said it found out last week that some people at three Houston schools had "experienced allergic-like symptoms of mild flushing and rash" after eating Uncle Ben's Mexican Flavor Infused Rice. -- The company that makes some Uncle Ben's products says it is recalling bags of flavored rice after people developed flushing and rashes after eating one of the rice varieties. "Our network of distributors, brokers, and sales associates immediately started notifying their customers and collecting the product," Mars Foodservices said. Besides the Mexican flavor, Uncle Ben's infused rice comes in roasted chicken, pilaf, saffron, cheese, Spanish and garlic and butter varieties.
