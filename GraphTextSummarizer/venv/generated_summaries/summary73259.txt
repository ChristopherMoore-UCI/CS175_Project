Failure is not an option for Switzerland coach Kobi Kuhn, either. "Unfortunately, Emre is not going to play tomorrow," said Turkey coach Fatih Terim ahead of the game at Basel's St Jakob-Park Stadium. BASEL, Switzerland -- Turkey suffered a blow when Emre Belozoglu was ruled out of Wednesday's critical Group A clash against Euro 2008 co-hosts Switzerland after tearing a hamstring in training. " Kuhn, whose side lost 1-0 to the Czech Republic in their first encounter, knows his men will face tough opposition, though. "We will make a decision on whether they will play tomorrow." Terim, whose side lost 2-0 against Portugal in their opening game, remains confident that his team can still qualify from the group stage.
