Authorities haven't explained the charges and they have not said if Williams' arrest over the weekend is related to the investigation into the deaths of District Attorney Mike McLelland, McLelland's wife, Cynthia, and Mark Hasse -- the prosecutor who last year accused Williams of "using Kaufman County as his own piggy bank." In a recent interview with North Texas TV station KXAS, Williams said he bore no ill will toward Hasse or McLelland, saying he felt the officials were just "doing their jobs." In March 2012 -- almost a year before McLelland's death -- Hasse and McLelland played prominent roles in prosecuting Williams on one count of burglary and one count of theft by a public official. But Bell, a reporter for The Forney Post, said McLelland told her before his death that he thought Williams was responsible for Hasse's death. Now, amid an even larger investigation into the deaths of two Kaufman County prosecutors this year, that former official, Eric Williams, is jailed on $3 million bond -- charged with two counts of insufficient bond and one count of making a "terroristic threat."
