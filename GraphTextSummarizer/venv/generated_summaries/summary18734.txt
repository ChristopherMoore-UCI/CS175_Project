Davis' sisters, Martina Correia and Kimberly Davis, attended the funeral Saturday, as did Correia's son De'Jaun Davis-Correia. " Jealous and other friends and advocates for Davis, including his lawyer, Jason Ewart, voiced Davis' last words before he was put to death by lethal injection. Davis was tried and convicted for MacPhail's murder and sent to death row in 1991. He spoke of how Davis, from death row, used to help his nephew with homework, even put his tests and exams on his calendar. A mass of flowers covered Davis' closed casket.
