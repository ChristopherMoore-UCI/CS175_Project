"I didn't say I needed to be Hazel," Woodley said at the movie's New York premiere on June 2. The 22-year-old actress, who is developing a reputation for pushing back against Hollywood's rules, recently explained to New York Magazine the impact she thinks "Fault In Our Stars" could have. "On this beautiful day, there's kids at home in bed hooked up to chemo machines," Woodley reflected at the movie's June 2 premiere. "In 'Fault,' I am trying to rewrite what a female lead can look like," Woodley said. Although Woodley said she wasn't gunning for the role of Hazel when she wrote Green, the author remembers that exchange a bit differently.
