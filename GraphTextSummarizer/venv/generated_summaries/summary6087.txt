Foley, who coaches 2013 U.S. Open winner Justin Rose and world No. 19 Hunter Mahan -- champion at The Barclays on Sunday -- didn't appear to hold a grudge. -- Tiger Woods has split with his longtime coach Sean Foley after not winning a major during their four-year tenure. Woods, currently nursing a back problem that will keep him out of next month's Ryder Cup, isn't due to compete again until an event in Florida in December and said he wasn't in a rush to appoint a new coach. In a statement on his website, the slumping Woods called Foley an "outstanding" coach but felt the time was right to part company. The world's most famous golfer has been hindered by injuries recently and cutting ties with Foley adds to his rocky 2014 season.
