New York City's ID program would be similar programs in 11 other cities, including San Francisco and Los Angeles; Trenton, New Jersey; Washington; and New Haven, Connecticut. Immigrant advocates hope that the municipal IDs will bridge the gap between police and undocumented immigrants, as was the case in New Haven, Connecticut. As for Cesar Vargas, he believes there's a chance undocumented immigrants could be singled out when using New York City IDs, but he believes the benefits outweigh the costs. For the cards to be effective, they need to be broadly accessible, linked up with private and public services, and be widely used by people who are not undocumented immigrants, Brittny Saunders, supervising attorney at the New York-based Center for Popular Democracy, told CNN. "To all of my fellow New Yorkers who are undocumented, I say: New York City is your home, too, and we will not force any of our residents to live their lives in the shadows," de Blasio said during his first State of the City speech February 10.
