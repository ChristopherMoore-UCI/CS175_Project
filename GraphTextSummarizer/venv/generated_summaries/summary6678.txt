The U2 frontman/hitchhiker said that Edmonton Oilers player Gilbert Brule and his girlfriend were driving in a truck when they spotted the forlorn traveler. During his Edmonton show Wednesday, Bono said that he had decided "that I now want to be Gilbert Brule," a five-year NHL veteran center who scored seven goals in 41 games last season with the Oilers. "I like ice hockey, because people who play ice hockey are the kind of people who pick up hitchhikers," Bono told a concert crowd Wednesday in Edmonton, Alberta, as seen in a video posted on YouTube. Brule, who flew from Vancouver to Edmonton so he could go backstage at Wednesday's concert, told CTV that he was "star struck" upon meeting the rock star and taking him to Horseshoe Bay. Kelsey Nichols told CNN affiliate CTV, that she didn't believe her boyfriend, Brule, that the hitchhiker was Bono.
