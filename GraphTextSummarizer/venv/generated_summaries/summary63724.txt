As for the replacement of the HHS official, Siga said in its e-mail to CNN: "The findings, the negotiations and the decision to award were handled solely by career procurement officials at HHS who negotiated a fair and reasonable price. Internal HHS documents obtained by CNN also show that as part of the early negotiation process, two key Siga executives granted themselves salary increases of $200,000 in the case of CEO Eric A. Rose and $225,000 for Siga Chief Financial Officer Daniel Luckshire. "I can tell you not Ronald Perelman, not Andy Stern, no member of the (Siga) board was involved in these contract negotiations and never contacted anybody in the government about this contract," said Townsend, who works full time for McAndrews and Forbes, a company owned by Perelman, and who also is CNN national security contributor. A few weeks later, the CEO of Siga, Dr. Eric A. Rose, wrote to HHS, saying "it was clear that we were at an impasse in negotiations" and urging government officials to remove the existing contracting officer and replace him "with a more senior official." But internal e-mails obtained exclusively by CNN show a contracting officer assigned to manage price negotiations between HHS and Siga was alarmed at the cost.
