During the NBA lockdown last year, caused by dispute between NBA players and owners, several stars, including JR Smith and Wilson Chandler, played for Chinese teams in the CBA. Just a few minutes into the game, James made five straight points, punctuated by a big dunk, to the delight of the thousands of Chinese fans who packed the arena in Beijing chanting "MVP, MVP!" Basketball-mad Chinese fans watch him regularly in NBA games televised by local sports channels here. He then credited Chinese former NBA star Yao Ming as a role model. China has also emerged as alternative destination for former NBA stars in the twilight of their career.
