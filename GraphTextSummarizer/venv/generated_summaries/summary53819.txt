All existing URLs, including those linked on social media sites, will still work or will redirect to the new NBCNews.com URL, Vivian Schiller, NBC News chief digital officer, said in a conference call with reporters Monday. "You are going to lose traffic," a SearchEngineLand blogger warned would-be name changers in 2009. If that's true, it spells bad news for MSNBC.com, which on Monday changed its name and URL to NBCNews.com following a split from Microsoft, the technology giant that had partnered with the U.S. news network to produce the website. NBC, for its part, said it doesn't expect the move to affect traffic. (The MSNBC cable channel will launch a new website in 2013 as an extension of its on-air brand, NBC News said.)
