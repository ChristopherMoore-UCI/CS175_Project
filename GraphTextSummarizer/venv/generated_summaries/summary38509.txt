This time it's Oscar Pistorius whose life has moved from sports headlines to the news pages to cause headaches at Nike headquarters. Pistorius, known as the 'blade runner,' is the man Nike called a bullet and who is now charged with shooting his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. In this marketing world, Vorhaus said, with many athletes sponsored by and representing Nike, it is also easier to shake off the bad publicity when a star falls. Nike issued a statement soon after Steenkamp's death expressing "sympathy and condolences to the families concerned following this tragic incident." Now Nike is being reminded again that pinning your company reputation on star names is a risky business.
