"It is my opinion that Virginia law enforcement officers, including conservation officers, may, like Arizona police officers, inquire into the immigration status of persons stopped or arrested," Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli writes in the opinion. Cuccinelli said Wednesday the difference between the Arizona provision and his opinion -- which does not carry the weight of law -- is that while Virginia officers have the authority to inquire about immigration status, they are not required to do so. "And our opinion addressed the fact that they can ask about illegal immigration, immigration status, along with anything else." "Although immigration is politically controversial, the legal principles discussed in the opinion are a matter of settled law and do not break any new legal ground. Arizona officials have said the law was enacted because the federal government has failed to adequately enforce immigration law.
