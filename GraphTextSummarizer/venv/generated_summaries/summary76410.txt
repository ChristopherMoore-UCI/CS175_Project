This past weekend, the 25-year-old was trying to do just that -- delivering books to a school in southern Afghanistan -- when a suicide bomber smashed into her convoy Saturday, killing Smedinghoff and four others. Kerry was emotional Sunday as he spoke of Smedinghoff's death and described his experience meeting her during the recent Afghanistan trip. In Smedinghoff's memory, CNN affiliate WBBM reported, American flags lined the road near her family's home on Sunday. As parents you always want to make sure no harm comes to your children, but I knew that she wanted to embrace this opportunity," her mother, Mary Beth Smedinghoff, said Monday, "so she had our full-hearted support and blessing to apply for that position." Before she joined the State Department, Smedinghoff served on the board of directors for the Ulman Cancer Fund for Young Adults' 4K for Cancer program, spending a summer cycling across the United States to raise money and awareness.
