-- Two 15-year-olds broke into a Denver middle school armed with what appeared to be BB guns and ransacked several rooms before being taken into custody, police Chief Robert White said Tuesday. White said the same pair attempted to break into Greenwood Elementary school earlier in the evening, but weren't successful. While authorities have not moved the weapons the boys were spotted carrying, investigators who looked at them think they are BB guns, White said. No students were in the building at the time of the late-night burglary at Rachel B. Noel Middle School, and classes were expected to go on as usual Tuesday, he said. The teenagers, whose identities have not been made public because they are juveniles, were being interviewed by investigators early Tuesday, White said.
