-- Bolivian President Evo Morales handily won re-election Sunday, unofficial preliminary results showed. The victory "shows that it is possible to change Bolivia based on the vote of the Bolivian people," Morales said in a victory speech Sunday night. "I urge all the patriots to go vote at the electoral tables so that Bolivia beats not just the national, but the international participation record, near 90 percent," Morales told reporters Sunday. The conservative Progress Plan for Bolivia party came in second with 23 percent, according to preliminary numbers. The resounding victory was not unexpected, as Morales, the country's first president of indigenous descent, was leading in pre-election polls and was widely expected to win.
