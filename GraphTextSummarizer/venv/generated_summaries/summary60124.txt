Paul Collier (Oxford University), Makhtar Diop (World Bank's Vice President for Africa), and Donald Kaberuka (chairman of the African Development Bank) also sent some very strong messages to African CEOs by reminding them to promote Africa's private sector. Diop said: "This CEO Forum reminds us that Africa needs its business leaders as never before -- to help it generate more electricity, grow more food, and create more jobs to keep growing strongly, while also improving people's well-being through less poverty, better health and education, and more hope." The continent is needed more than ever, they said, but I think African CEOs must start working together, trusting each other, thinking of implementing a regional integration package and finding a route for transferring solutions between African countries. Sitting at the first Africa CEO Forum this week, in the heart of Geneva, I asked myself if this was the right time to open the debate on Africa's private sector future. Over two intensive days, top African chief executive officers shared with attendees from all over the Africa, Europe and Asia, some latest trends and best practices, discussed the future of the continent's private sector, and received awards and accolades.
