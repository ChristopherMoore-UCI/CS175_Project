One engine ran on a 50-50 mix of that combination with conventional jet fuel, while the other ran entirely on conventional fuel. The Boeing 737 burned less fuel in the biofuel-powered engine than a conventionally powered engine, and the two performed identically during the one-hour, 40-minute flight, Boeing spokesman Terrance Scott said. And last month, Air New Zealand tested a 747 with one of its engines powered by a blend of conventional jet fuel and jatropha oil. "What we're starting to see here is even when you combine two of them that haven't been flown before, the performance is equal to or better than traditional jet fuel with no degradation," Scott said. "If you had to grade it on a scale of one to 10, it would be an 11." Wednesday's test, conducted from Continental's hub in Houston, Texas, was the first by a U.S. carrier and the first to use a blend of oils from algae and the jatropha, Scott said.
