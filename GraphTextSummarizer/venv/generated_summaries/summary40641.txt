After the race, NBC reporter Christin Cooper asked him about his emotions and stuck with the questions after Miller teared up talking about his brother, Chelone, a snowboarder with his own Olympic aspirations who died last year at age 29. The gold was the first in ice dance for the United States, which has seven first-place finishes in past men's and women's competitions at the Olympics. "I believe the temperatures are dropping in the last day or so," said IOC spokesman Mark Adams. CNN Senior Weather Producer Brandon Miller says Tuesday could be the first day of significant precipitation at the Winter Olympics, with the mountain venues looking at the possibility of rain mixed with sleet. Miller -- who ended up unable to speak, doubled over and crying -- said Monday he doesn't blame her for asking the questions.
