Every time the economy and stock market turn down, financial historians get predictable calls from reporters. Between 1930 and 1933, not just the U.S. but also Europe and Latin America experienced rolling banking crises.

The U.K., which has just announced a $50 billion plan for bank recapitalization, has shown how this can be done in a matter of days.
