Other family members, including Bobbi Kristina's father, singer Bobby Brown, have been in Atlanta for days. The daughter of musical superstar Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina was found facedown in a bathtub full of water in her Atlanta area home on January 31. They called 911 and performed CPR until emergency crews arrived and took over, police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said. Sources close to the family say she opened her eyes briefly on Monday and also suffered seizures that same day. Her grandmother, Cissy Houston, mother of the late Whitney Houston, arrived at Emory University Hospital on Friday, a source close the family told CNN.
