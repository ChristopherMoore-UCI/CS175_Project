" Second Life has its own economy and social scene, and Bracken and Savill hope it could become a haven for those seeking help for autism. Savill said Second Life excels at minimizing geographical separations between people and bringing people from all over the world to meet together quickly and easily. David Savill, 22, lives in Gloucester, England, in real life and created this spot within the virtual world of Second Life. "For people with autism, we've found it's a very nice way of setting up situations they might come across in their everyday lives," Bignell said. "It's not just to help people with autism, it's to help people whose lives have been affected by autism, be they family or friends or employees of people who have autism," Savill said.
