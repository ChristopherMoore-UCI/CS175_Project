One of the three killed had accompanied the two female suicide bombers from Dagestan to Moscow and guided one of them to the subway, Alexander Bortnikov told President Dmitry Medvedev. -- Three men involved in the Moscow subway bombings in March were killed when they fought back during an attempt to arrest them, the director of the Federal Security Service told the Russian president Thursday. "There are grounds to believe that jointly (with the Federal Security Service) we will be able to find out who specifically organized those terrorist acts in the Moscow subway," Bastrykin told Medvedev at the meeting. The blasts ripped through the Lubyanka and Park Kultury stations in central Moscow while an estimated 500,000 people were using the subway system. The twin bombings struck the Moscow metro during morning rush hour March 29, killing 40 people and wounding more than 80.
