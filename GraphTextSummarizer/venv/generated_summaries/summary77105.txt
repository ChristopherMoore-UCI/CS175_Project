In appearances on morning talk shows, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and Rick Perry all contrasted their conservative credentials with Romney's more moderate record in hopes that South Carolina voters will agree with their contention that Romney can't defeat Obama in November. After previously describing Romney's former company, Bain Capital, as corporate "vultures" who looted North Carolina companies, Perry used less combative language Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union" but reiterated his accusation that it "came in and basically shut down" a Georgetown steel mill, taking away "a lot of money in management fees. On the same program, Scott said: "If Romney wins South Carolina, I think the game is over." Perry, the Texas governor who lags behind after poor performances in earlier debates, kept up his criticism of Romney's experience as a venture capitalist -- an attack line shared by Gingrich but criticized by Santorum and other conservatives. "Our nominee had better be capable of standing up there, telling the truth, enduring the negative ads and winning the vote," Gingrich said, insisting he is the more accomplished debater and stronger candidate than Romney. Two South Carolina Republican politicians, Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. Tim Scott, said Sunday that another Romney victory this week would likely sew up the nomination for him.
