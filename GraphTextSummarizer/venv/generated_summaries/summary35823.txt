-- It was a moment of triumph amid a personal tragedy for Malaysian leader Najib Razak.

Strategy of 'quiet diplomacy' From day one, according to the source, Najib had set his own diplomatic course; a strategy of quiet diplomacy. However, Najib's claims to have brokered the deal with the pro-Russian rebel leader have been met with skepticism by some who say his role in the negotiations may be over-stated. "It's really important that he did not start blaming anyone before getting what he needed," said Wan Saiful Wan Jan, a political commentator and CEO of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur.
