-- Fifteen Africans died while trying to reach Spain's southern coast in a small, overcrowded boat, Spanish officials told CNN on Thursday. The Ministry of Interior said illegal crossings by boat from Africa declined 54 percent in 2007, from a year earlier. The decline is due to increased sea patrols off West Africa, along with increased repatriations, officials said. The total number of immigrants to Spain from sub-Saharan African countries is far less, but their plight on the boats has sparked a great deal of media attention. They told authorities that 14 others, including nine young children, had died en route and were dropped overboard, officials told CNN.
