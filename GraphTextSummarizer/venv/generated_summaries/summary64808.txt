New York doctor's condition improving Dr. Craig Spencer, the doctor who returned to the United States from Guinea and tested positive for Ebola, "continues to show improvement and is stable," New York City health officials said Wednesday. "This person's daily movements in New York City will no longer be restricted, and the individual will be assessed twice each day by Health Department staff," officials said. The contacts of nurse Amber Vinson, one of the Dallas nurses infected with Ebola, are clear of the deadly virus, health officials said. Global Ebola case numbers grow The World Health Organization's latest report on the worldwide Ebola response says there have been 13,042 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of Ebola and 4,818 reported deaths. "These activities are critical to combat the spread of Ebola and reduce the potential for future outbreaks of infectious diseases that could follow a similarly devastating, costly, and destabilizing trajectory," the official said.
