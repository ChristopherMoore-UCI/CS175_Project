-- A new national poll suggests that as President Barack Obama prepares to try to convince a skeptical American public why the U.S. should take military action against Syria, he may be partly to blame for the box he's put himself into. "The public's split right down the middle on whether Obama is a strong leader, whether he is honest and trustworthy, and whether he inspires confidence." Obama tells CNN a 'breakthrough' is possible on Syria And the poll also found that only one in five say they completely understand Obama's Syria policy. The CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday indicates that Americans are divided evenly on whether Obama is a strong leader as well as whether he's honest and trustworthy. "Syria may be the topic 24/7 on Capitol Hill and at the White House, but nearly three times as many Americans say the economy's the country's top issue than say the same about Syria," Holland added. The president is also up against the fact that Syria is nowhere near the top issue for most Americans.
