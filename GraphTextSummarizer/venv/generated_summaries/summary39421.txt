In this domain, with no doubt, everything exists, we will have to motivate - sensibly, because the human factor exists - in order to create an elite of players, to allow young talents to use soccer to get out of the misery, with the goal of obtaining a major professional contract and bringing money back to the country, or attending school abroad. Football is part of the everyday life of Haiti, even with the scary living conditions in Port-au-Prince, even with the fields being occupied, they still play soccer. About two weeks ago, with a lot of difficulties, FIFA Vice-President Jack Warner made it to Port-au-Prince in a private plane and brought us meds, foods and water. FIFA experts will come to Haiti soon to evaluate our needs, build projects that FIFA will finance from this newly created fund. Soccer federations of the whole world - Qatar, Switzerland, Honduras, Nicaragua and Mexico -- offered their help and we are deeply touched by this move.
