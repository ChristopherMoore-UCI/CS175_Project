Listen to Anne Vos talking to the media Vos was not rescued until early Wednesday afternoon. I thought 'this is it - I'm not coming out of here,'" said earthquake survivor Anne Vos. Vos says she now needs to assess the damage to her possessions, and after experiencing two major earthquakes and many aftershocks, she may decide to move away from the area. Vos had spoken to the media on her mobile phone while trapped under her desk in the Pyne Gould Corporation building, drawing international attention to her plight. In the 24 hours she spent under the rubble, Vos, 57, said she gave up hope, and accepted she would die.
