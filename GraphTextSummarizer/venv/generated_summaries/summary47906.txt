-- He is hoping to be one of the stars of the 2014 World Cup, but an injury blow for Luis Suarez has drawn extreme reaction from Uruguay football fans. Oscar Tabarez's side begins its World Cup campaign on June 15 against Costa Rica before facing England four days later in Sao Paulo, with a final group-stage match against Italy on June 24. Suarez is facing a race against time to be fit for the showpiece tournament in Brazil starting next month, and the player whose challenge required the Liverpool star to have knee surgery has been bombarded with death threats. Paul Dummett, who plays for Newcastle United, was sent off for his challenge on Uruguay's all-time leading scorer on the final day of the English Premier League season earlier this month. " Suarez, one the world's most potent strikers, enjoyed a successful season with Liverpool, becoming the first player to score 30 league goals for the club since Ian Rush in 1987.
