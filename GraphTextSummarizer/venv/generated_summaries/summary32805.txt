Chavez was elected and re-elected in large part thanks to support from the country's poor, who felt marginalized by previous governments. Maduro said after airing videos during a national broadcast that he said showed opposition attacks on government buildings. Opposition leaders and government officials blame each other for the unrest, and both sides show no sign of backing down. The anti-government demonstrations are the biggest threat President Nicolas Maduro has faced since his election last year. "They perceive that there are parts of the opposition that want to go back to pre-Chavez Venezuela, which basically ignored the concerns of the poor," Shifter said.
