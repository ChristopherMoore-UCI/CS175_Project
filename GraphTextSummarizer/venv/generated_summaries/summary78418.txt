"Many of the victims, their families, air race teams and fans have told us they're coming to Reno this September no matter what," said Mike Houghton, president and CEO of the Reno Air Racing Association, at a Reno press conference. -- Nearly four months after a P-51 Mustang veered out of control and slammed into spectators at the Reno, Nevada, air races -- killing 11 people, injuring scores of others and jeopardizing the future of the event -- race organizers Wednesday said the show will go on. In a lawsuit filed by the family of deceased spectator Craig Salerno of Friendswood, Texas, lawyers argued the crash was not a "freak accident," but was "the predictable result of a reckless drive for speed by a risk-taking pilot and crew, coupled with an insatiable drive for profit" by race organizers. The head of the Reno Air Racing Association said the association will seek permits for the full schedule of races to take place September 12-16 and is confident that it will get them. He expressed optimism that all three entities would permit the races, but said his biggest concern is any unknown obstacle that could interfere with race plans.
