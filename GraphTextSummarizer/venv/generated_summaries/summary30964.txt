PSG made a flying start with star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic putting them ahead in the fifth minute. Charlison Benschop pulled a late goal back for already relegated Brest, but it could not spoil the celebrations -- which went on long after the final whistle as the entire PSG squad, Beckham included, were paraded ahead of the trophy celebration. -- With tears streaming down his face, David Beckham said farewell in his final home game as a professional footballer Saturday. Beckham was going out on a high and although PSG have an away match at Lorient to complete a triumphant season his appearance in that match is considered highly unlikely.. Ancelotti, who has led PSG to their first title in 19 years, said he wanted to make Beckham's farewell special.
