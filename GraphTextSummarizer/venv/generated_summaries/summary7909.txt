Gooch: Her name was Mary Flannery O'Connor, and her mother and everyone in Milledgeville (Georgia), where she lived most of her life, continued to call her Mary Flannery. The latest is "Flannery: A Life of Flannery O'Connor" (Little, Brown) by Brad Gooch, an exhaustively researched exploration of O'Connor's unlikely journey from shy, sarcastic and "contrary" Georgia girl to acerbic literary treasure. Everything we think of as a Flannery O'Connor story came after she had been diagnosed as having lupus and settled in to life in the South. She later said, "Who would want to buy these stories of an Irish washerwoman named Mary O'Connor?" Partly, I think she wanted to lose the Southern-ness of "Mary Flannery." ... Her initial rejection letters were actually addressed to "Mr. Flannery O'Connor," and I think she kind of liked that neutrality.
