Before leaving Poland, Obama stopped at the Field Cathedral of the Polish Army, where he visited a memorial to the victims of a plane crash that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski, his wife and several military leaders in April 2010. -- President Barack Obama on Saturday held up Poland's transition to democracy in the 1980s as a model for nations today pushing back against their governments -- from countries in North Africa and the Middle East to some in Eastern Europe. And it has many relevant lessons, so we want to encourage all states undergoing similar experiences to learn from Poland." Obama thanked Poland for its contributions to Tunisia, which saw the ouster of its leader this year, and for sending its foreign minister to the Libyan opposition stronghold of Benghazi as rebels fight the forces of strongman Moammar Gadhafi. Prior to meeting with Tusk, during the last day of a six-day trip, Obama praised Polish leaders and acknowledged the sacrifices Poles have made in wars. Obama spoke after meeting with Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski.
