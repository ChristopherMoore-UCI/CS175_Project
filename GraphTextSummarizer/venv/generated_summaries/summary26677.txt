And we had the privilege to spend time with a special group of people who, although they are not from Afghanistan, have a unique appreciation for what Afghan women are fighting for. An important bellwether for the success or failure of America's efforts in Afghanistan will be the preservation of the gains made by Afghan women. At a roundtable, we discussed the opportunities that have been made available to Afghan women and girls over the past decade; the important role they must play in the country's society, security and economy in order to see future success; and the critical need to protect these gains from backsliding. We spoke with female public officials, women journalists, and heads of organizations focused on advancing the role of women. More than a decade after American and allied forces toppled the Taliban regime, the improvement in the quality of life for Afghan women is unmistakable.
