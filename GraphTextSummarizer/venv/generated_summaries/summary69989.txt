The 17-year-old mother and her son had been removed from their home and placed in protective custody after the video surfaced last week, but officials said their removal had little to do with the video, CNN affiliate KETV in Omaha reported. An Omaha juvenile court judge ruled Monday that the toddler and his mother would be placed with the same foster family. They say posting the video needlessly antagonized minority communities, which make up about a quarter of Omaha's 409,000 residents. Last week, the mother defended her son in an interview with KETV. In the video, the diapered boy is taunted and cursed at by adults, who coax him into using crude words.
