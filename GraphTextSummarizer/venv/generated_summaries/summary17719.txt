-- A new barter market in Mexico City is helping residents trade their trash for food in an effort to reduce the mountain of waste produced by the mega city. If he does, it would bring the city's plan full circle, essentially turning trash into food. Mexico City's huge, infamous Bordo Poniente landfill site was receiving 12,600 tons of waste a day -- one and a quarter times the weight of the Eiffel Tower -- before it was shut down in December last year. But although the landfill is is no longer in operation, the city keeps churning out trash. Along with his housemates, Aranda brings along glass, plastic and cardboard waste, which is separated and weighed.
