Last year, when cotton prices hit an all-time high due to a global supply crunch, manufacturers first raised prices, then used less cotton and more blended fabrics such as poly-cotton. U.S. cotton futures surged last week after India announced the ban, igniting fears of another jump in prices for cotton goods. -- India will end a six-day ban on cotton exports that impacted global commerce, the country's trade minister said Sunday. Cotton prices cooled off toward the end of last year, Flynn said. "This India development really caught the entire cotton industry and traders off guard because it came with no warning," Phil Flynn, senior market and commodities analyst with PFG Best, told CNN last week.
