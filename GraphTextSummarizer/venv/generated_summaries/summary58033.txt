President Barack Obama pardoned the national Thanksgiving turkey with a smile on Wednesday, but he admitted before saving the bird from it's likely demise that he found the decades-old tradition somewhat "puzzling." The two 20-week-old turkeys will enjoy a much more tranquil Thanksgiving than many of their fellow fowl, as they're headed to "Turkey Hill" the historic turkey farm at Morven Park, the Leesburg, Va., home of former Virginia Gov. Westmoreland Davis, according to the White House. Other elected officials got in the spirit of the holiday on Wednesday, tweeting out their favorite Thanksgiving recipes. House Speaker John Boehner revealed the details of his special "Boehner Brine," while Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted her family's chocolate mousse recipe. Obama will also volunteer with his family on Wednesday, another longstanding presidential Thanksgiving tradition.
