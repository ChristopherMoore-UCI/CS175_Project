"As there is still a potential threat, even though reduced, a voluntary evacuation remains in place until the Army Corps of Engineers deems the lock stable and safe," the president and sheriff of St. Tammany Parish announced late Sunday morning.

Earlier Sunday, St. Tammany Parish President Pat Brister told CNN the water level at the lock has been reduced "tremendously" since Saturday night, and "We feel a lot better."
