-- Six Americans who were salvaging goods from the bottom of the sea off the coast of Honduras have sat in a jail there for over three weeks as officials have charged them with illegal weapons possession. Crew's business Aqua Quest International salvages precious cargo from sunken vessels underwater beds, according to its website. Mayne and Aqua Quest are adamant that their weapons were for personal use and not for resale on the black market. Legal allegations Aqua Quest alleges in its statement that authorities boarding and searching the ship circumvented proper legal procedures. The ship's captain said from jail that the weapons on board were for personal protection against pirates.
