The Dinner Garden gets its seeds through donations from seed companies as well as some of the people it sent seeds to in the past. In 2008, she started The Dinner Garden, an organization that provides free packs of seeds to people so they can grow enough food to feed a family of four. After realizing how much nutritious food she was able to grow, Hirshberg began collecting seeds from her garden and sharing them with others. People can also fill out a seed request form online, and Hirshberg and her volunteers will send seeds directly to them. "We find between 10 and 11 varieties of seeds that will grow in their area," Hirshberg said.
