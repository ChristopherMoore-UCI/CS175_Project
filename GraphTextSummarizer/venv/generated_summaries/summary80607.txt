Rain, real name Jung Ji-hoon,  broke into the notoriously tough world of South Korean show business with JYP Entertainment when he was just 18-years-old. The 27-year-old South Korean has even faced down U.S. comedian Steven Colbert in a spoof  dance-off. He made his first mark in Hollywood last year with a role in "Speed Racer" appearing alongside Christina Ricci and Matthew Fox. As well as a sense of humor and dance moves that shook Colbert out of his satirical posture to praise, Rain is also known as one of the hardest working men in the entertainment business.
