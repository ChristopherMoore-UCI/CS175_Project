" Former Vice President Dick Cheney â€” the architect of many Bush war on terror policies -- told the New York Times that claims that the CIA acted unlawfully were "a bunch of hooey." The report found CIA tactics were more brutal than previously known and accused the agency of keeping the Bush White House and Congress in the dark about them. The Justice Department has twice investigated the issue of enhanced interrogations and decided against bringing charges against CIA operatives who were under intense pressure to avoid additional attacks after September 11. But he said the Obama administration, which has sought to try terror suspects in civilian courts, had gone far too far in repudiating Bush-era methods. But three-quarters of the way through his own two-term presidency, he is still wrestling with the long shadow cast by the war on terror and the methods Bush chose to fight it.
