The proposed deal blocks several parts of the law, including a requirement for public schools to collect information on the immigration status of students; a provision that criminalized the solicitation of work by undocumented immigrants; and a section that prohibited giving a ride to undocumented immigrants. -- Some of the most controversial parts of Alabama's immigration law could soon be off the table for good, according to a settlement deal filed in federal court Tuesday. "The filings made today inform the trial court of which claims must be dismissed and which provisions our of law cannot be enforced because of the Supreme Court's and Eleventh Circuit's rulings. The agreement, which must be approved by the court, also says the law does not authorize police to detain someone for the sole purpose of checking immigration status. The agreement comes nearly six months after the Supreme Court refused to review Alabama's law and just days after U.S. President Barack Obama renewed a push to drum up support for an overhaul of the nation's immigration laws.
