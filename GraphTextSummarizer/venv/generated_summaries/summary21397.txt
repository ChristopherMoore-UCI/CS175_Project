-- Controversy continues to swirl around New Jersey Sen. Robert Menendez -- including his relationship with a generous Democratic donor whose plane he took to the Dominican Republic and who has business ties in that Caribbean nation. Questions revolve around his relationship with Salomon Melgen, the Florida man who owned a plane Menendez admits having flown three times -- once on official Senate business, and twice for personal reasons -- to the Dominican Republic in 2010. During a Senate subcommittee hearing last July, Menendez didn't mention ICSSI by name, but he did press Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Matthew Rooney about an unnamed company who had a contract to X-ray cargo that went through all Dominican ports -- a contract that, he said, Dominican authorities "don't want to live by. This does not include the $600,000 that Melgen's then company, Vitreo Retinal Consultants, donated to the left-leaning Majority PAC last election cycle, reports the OpenSecrets.org website run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. " "Stemming the growth of narco-trafficking is a key challenge in the region, and it is a fight from which Sen. Menendez will never back down," O'Brien said.
