-- A federal judge ruled Tuesday that there is enough evidence that former reality TV producer Bruce Beresford-Redman murdered his wife at a Cancun resort to justify his return to Mexico to face trial. While investigators have not talked to the children, a therapist who has helped them deal with the loss of their mother did question the daughter about her memories of the Mexico trip, Hirsch said. "How absurd it is to think that our client, or anyone, would book a trip to Mexico with his two minor children, have a room in which all of them, the whole family, is staying together, and have this with some motive to commit a homicide," Hirsch said. The case is "replete with inconsistencies and unsupported innuendos," attorney Richard Hirsch said. An affidavit signed by the therapist said the girl told her she never heard her parents argue in Mexico and that she was never left alone at the resort.
