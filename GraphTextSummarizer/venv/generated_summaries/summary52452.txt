Watson, who had won earlier this year at the Farmers Insurance tournament at Torrey Pines, slipped three-strokes behind Simpson, 25, with only eight holes remaining of regulation play. The U.S. duo finished two shots clear of compatriots Jason Dufner and Tommy Gainey and South Korea's K.J. Choi, who all ended the tournament on 13-under. -- Bubba Watson held his nerve to secure a third win on the PGA Tour Sunday after the 32-year-old beat Webb Simpson in a playoff to clinch the Zurich Classic in New Orleans. The left-hander and fellow American Simpson both finished on 15-under par after final rounds of 69 and a second additional hole was needed to separate the pair. "This week, I won [by] not getting down on bad shots, just staying focused on what I'm supposed to be doing," Watson told the PGA Tour's official web site.
