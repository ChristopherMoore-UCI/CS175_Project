A day after a total of 15 players were disciplined for breaching 'internal team protocol', the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) issued guidelines about how its own athletes should behave at future Games after the consumption of alcohol. While drinking may be permitted outside the Olympic Village, team members have been left in no doubt as to the expectations now placed upon them. Several Australian rugby players have been involved in drinking incidents in recent times, including James O'Connor -- who lost his contract with the national team as a result -- and Kurtley Beale, who has sought counseling for his problems. "These restrictions have been implemented to ensure that Australia's Olympic athletes are given the opportunity to compete to the best of their ability and with distinction," said a statement bearing the name of AOC President John Coates. There is to be no 'swaying, staggering or falling down' while rambling or boisterous conversations, annoying team members and difficulty in paying attention to others are also outlawed.
