Authorities said Geele tried to break into the home of cartoonist Kurt Westergaard on January 1, 2010. Geele was convicted Thursday of attempted terrorism, attempted manslaughter and attacking a police officer with a knife and an ax, according to prosecutors. Although Geele had been under surveillance because of his alleged terrorist associations, Danish authorities said they had no idea Geele was planning an attack on Westergaard. Prosecutors had sought 12 years in prison for Geele. Danish intelligence officials linked Geele to an East African Islamist militia allied with al Qaeda.
