District police and Thai special investigators raided a karaoke bar and a spa Friday night, said Lt. Col. Noppadon Petsut, deputy police chief of Sadao district. The raid took place after the Department of Special Investigation received a call from the Laotian embassy in Bangkok saying there were Laotians being forced into prostitution, Petsut said. Thai police arrested five suspects -- three Thais, one Malaysian and one Singaporean, Petsut said. Forty-one of the females released had been forced into prostitution, Petsut said. Of those forced into prostitution, about 20 trafficking victims are under age 18, Petsut said.
