Agents and detectives from the FBI and Cleveland Police are looking into hundreds of leads in the cases and whether they may be linked, according to FBI Special Agent Scott Wilson in the agency's Cleveland bureau. Citing FBI policy, Wilson declined to say whether there are persons of interest in any of the three cases. The girls did not know each other and the FBI would not say whether any of them had mutual friends or acquaintances. She has a light birthmark on her right leg and pierced ears, the FBI says. "We kind of put all three of these cases together to work them to see if there's any connection," Wilson said.
