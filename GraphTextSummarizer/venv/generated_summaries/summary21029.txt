It's easy to be a baseball fan if you root for teams with rich history like the New York Yankees, Boston Red Sox and both Chicago teams, the Cubs and White Sox. The Cardinals, Yankees, Red Sox and Cubs fans look on with envy at a franchise that spent decades as a laughingstock. Most days I've spent watching Rangers baseball haven't compared to that day. The "stadium" was a converted minor-league field that looked like an open-air county arena better suited for rodeos than baseball games. The losing kept the bleacher seats cheap, which was fine for most fans.
