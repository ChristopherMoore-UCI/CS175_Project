Last year, Harding was reprimanded by Russian authorities for unauthorized travel to areas closed to journalists. The British journalist expelled from Russia was denied entry when he came back to the country because "he violated a number of rules concerning the work of foreign correspondents," the Russian Foreign Ministry said on its website Tuesday. "We understand that Mr. Harding had previously been warned by the Russian authorities about several alleged violations of his status as a journalist -- including visits without permission to border zones and classified areas," he said. Russia's treatment of journalists -- both domestic and foreign -- is a cause of great concern," Rusbridger said. Alan Rusbridger, the Guardian's editor, said in a statement that Russia's move was "a very troubling development with serious implications for press freedom."
