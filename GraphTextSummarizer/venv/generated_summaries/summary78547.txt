-- Israeli military experts Sunday worked around the clock to examine the remains of a mysterious drone that was shot down after penetrating Israeli airspace from the Mediterranean Sea. Opinion: U.S. drone monopoly gone While Israel has yet to officially announce who it sees as responsible for the penetration into its airspace, Lebanon's national news agency on Sunday reported that Israeli fighter jets have flown into Lebanese airspace, causing sonic booms in the area. The decision to closely follow the drone for almost 30 minutes within Israeli airspace was a wise choice, Ben Yishai said. "We know it originated in Lebanon," said Ron Ben Yishai, an Israeli national security and defense commentator for Israeli news portal Ynet. Ben Yishai said small drones are difficult to spot on radar, and missiles aren't designed to hit such slow-moving targets.
