"We condemn South Sudan's military involvement in the attack on and seizure of Heglig, an act which goes beyond self-defense and has increased tensions between Sudan and South Sudan to dangerous levels," State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. The Sudanese president has vowed to "never give up" a disputed oil-rich region that has escalated tensions with South Sudan and sparked fears of the two neighbors' return to war. " The international community has urged Sudan and South Sudan to return to the table amid intensified tensions. Sudan also claims ownership and has lodged complaints with the United Nations and the African Union, urging them to pressure South Sudan to withdraw troops from its territory. South Sudan split from its neighbor in July under the terms of a 2005 peace agreement that ended decades of a civil war.
