"We are very happy to let you know that Marina is expecting a baby in the fall," parents Marina and Kevin Krim said Thursday on the "Lulu & Leo Fund" memorial page, established for their late daughter Lucia "Lulu" Krim, 6, and her brother Leo, 2. Krim left two of her children with the nanny, Yoselyn Ortega, 50, to take her 3-year-old child, Nessie, to a swim lesson at a nearby YMCA, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. Police say on that October 25, 2012, the children's mother returned to the family's Upper West Side apartment, found Lucia and Leo dead in the bathroom and saw the nanny stab herself with a kitchen knife. Friends introduced the family to Ortega, and she had worked for them since Leo's birth, police said. The parents of two children allegedly slain by their nanny in New York City last year are expecting a child this fall, roughly a year after the nightmare deaths, according to a Facebook post.
