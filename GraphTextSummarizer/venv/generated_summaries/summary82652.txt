"Everybody thinks it's about the horses," says Gary Maynard, Secretary of Public Safety for Maryland prisons. "You look at these grounds, the meadows, the horses grazing in the field," says Felicia Hinton, assistant commissioner, Maryland Department of Corrections. Each year thousands of racehorses in the United States like Greek are sent to slaughterhouses and their meat sold overseas, according to the nonprofit Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation. In the rolling hills of Carroll County, Maryland, is Second Chance Farm. But Pickett maintains this will be his last time in prison and he thinks working with Greek as part of this program is what has changed him.
