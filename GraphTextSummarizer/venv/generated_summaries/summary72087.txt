It's worth noting that this part of suburban Tokyo can hardly be compared to the dense underground of New York City, which is a maze of subway tunnels, sewage systems and power lines. The engineers here are the first to point out that their system, while remarkable, is meant to deal with heavy rains -- and that it would struggle to cope with a Sandy-type storm surge coming from the Atlantic Ocean into New York's Upper Bay. In this area of Saitama prefecture, heavy rains would often flood the Naka River Basin. It's an example of how Japan's capital, which lies in a region at high risk from flooding and tropical cyclones, is trying to figure out how to contain the elements to protect its 13 million inhabitants. The turbines are then able to rapidly funnel floodwaters to the nearby Edo River.
