-- Myanmar's former Prime Minister Thein Sein has been sworn in as the country's new president, marking the end of the military body that has governed the Asian nation for decades, state-run Myanmar Radio reported Wednesday. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. Tin Myint Oo and Sai Muak Kham will serve as vice presidents. In February, Myanmar convened its first parliament in more than two decades in the capital, Naypyidaw. The regime refused to allow international monitors to oversee the race and would not allow international journalists to cover the voting from inside the country.
