"I believe if my name had been John Ernst attached to my resume, Sen. Harkin would not have said those things." Ernst also slammed Democrats for their "phony war on women. " His apology came after Ernst fired back Monday on Fox News and in an interview with CNN affiliate KCCI and said Harkin would have never made those comments if she were a man. After Sen. Tom Harkin likened her to Taylor Swift, Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst is taking the pop star's advice. " That's how Ernst responded Monday to Harkin's remarks last week that Ernst wasn't fit to be Iowa's senator just because she's "really attractive and she sounds nice. I am a combat veteran, this is not a war on women and anytime Democrats use the word war, they need to do it to honor our servicemen and women," Ernst said Monday.
