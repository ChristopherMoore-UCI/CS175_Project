" Talks will resume Saturday and Monday to attempt to salvage the second round of matches, but a prolonged strike would likely have serious implications in a crowded Spanish league season with Barcelona defending their Champions League crown as well as La Liga. It means Barcelona's opening match at Malaga in their defense of their La Liga title will be postponed. The two were involved in an explosive second leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday, won 3-2 by Barcelona and 5-4 on overall aggregate, but must now wait to begin their league campaigns. Barcelona refused comment on the strike when contacted by CNN Friday. Talks between the Professional Football League (LFP)) and the Association of Spanish Footballers (AFE) broke down Friday, both sides announced.
