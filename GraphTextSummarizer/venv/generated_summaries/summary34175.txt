"I'm very honored by the offers I had from other Premier League clubs but I didn't want to play there unless it was for Manchester United." Beckham is one of the world's most recognisable names, both for his sporting prowess and numerous off-pitch endorsement deals, and his pulling power could provide a valuable income stream for PSG -- which must conform to European football's financial fair play rules that restrict over-spending by club owners. Carlo Ancelotti's team tops the Ligue 1 table on goal difference after 22 of 38 rounds in the 2012-13 campaign, and will play in the knockout phase of Europe's top club competition in a two-legged tie against Spanish club Valencia on February 12 and March 6. He had been linked with a host of clubs around the world but, in the twilight of his career, has decided to join a team on the rise thanks to the injection of hundreds of millions of dollars by its Qatari owners. However, Beckham might be struggling to be fit for those matches, according to the manager of English club Arsenal -- who allowed the veteran to train with his squad this month.
