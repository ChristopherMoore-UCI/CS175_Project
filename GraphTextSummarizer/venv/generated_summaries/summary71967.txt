Iran should be able to enjoy its right to peaceful nuclear energy while avoiding further hostilities and instability. Particularly illogical is their joining in the decades-old rhetoric, comparing who they see as their foe -- Iran -- to Adolf Hitler. They say that since Hitler's claim that he desired peace was a lie, Iran's claims to want peace cannot be believed. Thus, comparing Iran to Nazi Germany is illogical and should be condemned for the sake of peace and global security. The recent op-ed by Rick Santorum and Joel C. Rosenberg is yet another attempt to stymie and shackle Iran and international negotiators in ongoing talks about Iran's peaceful nuclear program.
