We traveled along narrow roads winding among snow-capped mountains, eventually arriving at Birkhall -- the Scottish home to Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. I had pitched for interviews with the couple several times over the years and finally Prince Charles accepted. Prince Charles opens up about love and life When Prince Charles arrived, he also insisted on meeting the crew, which was great but was also eating into our interview time. The Duchess of Cornwall joined us on the way and was worried I would be cold without a coat, but the coat was inaccessible and I didn't want to hold things up.
