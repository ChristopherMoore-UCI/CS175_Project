Women often say one primary reason for seeking an abortion is to avoid exposing their children to domestic violence. According to this long-term study, when these women are able to access abortion services, their odds of being abused decrease by 7% each month after -- while women who can't get an abortion see their rates of domestic violence remain the same or even increase. The Republican Party has do more than just talk about domestic violence and women's opportunity and actually support the real policies that support women's freedom and choices -- or otherwise, women will keep choosing to vote for Democrats. So instead, several Republican candidates are coming out against domestic violence in an attempt to seem sensitive to us girls and our issues. A report actually commissioned by Republican groups and reported in Politico found that women view the party as "intolerant" and "stuck in the past."
