Another Red Cross spokesman, Vinicio Sarazua Santillan, told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that a number of people were remaining in their houses, unwilling to evacuate out of fear that their belongings could be stolen. The "Volcan de Fuego," or Fire Volcano, began spewing ash at 10 a.m. and was continuing to belch forth late in the afternoon near the country's former capital, Antigua, said Carmen Maria Caballero of the Guatemalan Red Cross. Several people were treated at mobile health centers for respiratory problems; one person was hospitalized in critical condition, according to Caballero. CNN iReporter Harby David Marroquin had been working at a nearby golf course when he saw nature's pyrotechnics and shot video on his iPhone. A volcano erupted Thursday in Guatemala, prompting officials to evacuate 35,000 residents, a spokeswoman for the Red Cross told CNN.
