Schwimmer -- best known for his starring role as Ross Geller on the 10-year hit NBC show -- invited cops into his New York City townhouse Monday to view his surveillance video of a bloody brawl that took place in the adjacent apartment building, according to Sgt. The lyrics to the "Friends" theme song "I'll Be There For You" proved to be more than just words this week when actor David Schwimmer helped cops solve an alleged stabbing near his building. "I am sure it contributed in some form or fashion to the investigation," Antonetti told CNN. The alleged stabber was arrested by police, but the third individual fled the scene, Antonetti said. Police said that prior to viewing Schwimmer's footage, they only had the stories of those involved to rely on for evidence.
