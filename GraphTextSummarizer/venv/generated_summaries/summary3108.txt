"We're launching Web profiles to give you a simple way to share your photos with more people and to make it easier to discover new users on the Web," Instagram said in a blog post. Instagram announced Monday it will be adapting user photos and data into Web-based profiles for people to enjoy from laptops or desktops. The new interface creates a challenge for the ecosystem of independent sites that had sought to fill Instagram's Web void by offering browser-based platforms for viewing, liking and commenting on photos from the app. Instagram also says that if your photos are set to private, they will be visible on the Web only to Instagram users you've allowed to follow you. Everyone understands pictures," wrote tech columnist and prolific Instagram user MG Siegler on his blog.
