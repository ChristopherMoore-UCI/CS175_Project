-- Two white Atlanta police officers who pulled over and questioned entertainment mogul Tyler Perry have been exonerated of racial profiling by an internal investigation, according to documents released Tuesday. After a four-month investigation, an internal affairs officer reported, "I would submit the evidence shows the actions of both officers with the regard to the traffic stop of Mr. Perry were justified, lawful and proper." The report said the officers were working for the auto theft task force and one thought Perry's $110,000 sports car was similar to one on a list of stolen cars. Perry, whose name appears on his license as Emmitt Perry Jr., said on his Facebook post that he explained to the officers that he was trying to make sure he wasn't being followed. Fire at Tyler Perry's studios limited to backlot facade The car likely wasn't stolen because "the guy was a billionaire," the officer told his colleagues, explaining that Perry made movies.
