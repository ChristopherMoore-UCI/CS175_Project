-- France will start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan, following a timetable similar to the one U.S. President Barack Obama announced, the French president's office said Thursday. All French troops could be out of Afghanistan by 2013, French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet told France Info radio Thursday. He said the British will keep "force levels in Afghanistan under constant review," adding: "I have already said there will be no UK troops in combat roles in Afghanistan by 2015 and, where conditions on the ground allow, it is right that we bring troops home sooner. British Prime Minister David Cameron, whose country has the second largest number of foreign troops in Afghanistan, welcomed Obama's announcement. Obama said Wednesday that the U.S. would withdraw 33,000 U.S. troops by September 2012.
