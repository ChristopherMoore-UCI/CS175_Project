Working with Hollywood studio execs in China, producer Dan Mintz describes the censorship process as a moving target. Movie-making in China is a quick and dirty business, a process director Eva Jin affectionately calls "China Speed." But not for the local film crew I was working with in China's Hengdian Studios. It's also where grips like to take short cuts with cables, and makeup artists do touch-ups with dirty brushes. But ultimately, the sci-fi thriller was filmed partly in China and became a major box office success in the country last year.
