-- News that the United States is considering a military strike on Syria in response to the Bashar al-Assad regime's suspected use of chemical weapons suggests we could soon see an American bombing campaign on the war-torn country. The conflicts in Syria, Egypt and Libya are small threats compared with the disaster that could ensue and the lives that would be endangered if Iran succeeds in its drive for nuclear weapons. Syria is not the greatest threat in the Middle East to U.S. or world security. Before bombing Syria over the regime's latest crimes, however, we should stand back and ask, "And then what?"
