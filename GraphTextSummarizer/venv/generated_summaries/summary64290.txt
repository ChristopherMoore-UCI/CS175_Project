"CITIZENS," the description begins, "The Capitol requires your viewing of President Snow's official Panem Address, 'Together As One,' brought to you by Capitol TV in stunning 4K. "Your districts are the body," Sutherland's Snow says. Each poster contains a representative from each of the districts dressed to represent their region, along with slogans such as "Panem Today, Panem Tomorrow, Panem Forever." The studio also released a video of "President Snow's Panem Address," which sees Donald Sutherland as the villainous President Snow delivering a not-so-veiled threat to his nation. Lionsgate has released "propaganda" posters from the forthcoming film, which salute the hero citizens of Panem. Even the YouTube description for the teaser indicates the kind of place Panem is.
