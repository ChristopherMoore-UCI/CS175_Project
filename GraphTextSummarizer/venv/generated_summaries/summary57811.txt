"The legacy of Dr. King is oneness in the community, everyone treating each other as they would want to be treated," said Monique Barashango, founder of Atlanta's ViZion Dance company. Princess Starr encounters talented teens like Wright as co-founder of the Young Voices United Performing Arts School in suburban Atlanta. "We are helping to carry on the dream that Dr. King articulated to let our kids know that they can do anything, they can be anything." Young leaders from across Atlanta gathered this month during a celebration of the holiday to talk about how they are seeking change in their schools, homes and communities. They sit beside the image of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and are meant to inspire others to devote themselves to their "beloved communities" on the upcoming holiday.
