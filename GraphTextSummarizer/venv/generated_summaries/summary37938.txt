The virus was first discovered earlier this month in domesticated birds at a turkey farm in Germany with subsequent outbreaks on poultry farms in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The H5N8 strain in Europe "appears to be highly pathogenic," meaning that it is highly likely to cause disease and death in poultry. He ordered all poultry farmers in his state to keep their animals inside enclosures and away from wild birds. Authorities say that the first wild bird case strengthens the suspicion that the source of the European outbreak lies in the wild bird population. Once the virus is discovered in select birds, the entire flock must be destroyed, according to health officials.
