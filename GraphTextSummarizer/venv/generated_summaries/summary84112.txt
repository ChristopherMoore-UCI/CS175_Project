-- British challenger Dereck Chisora has risked the wrath of WBC heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko by slapping his opponent at the weigh-in ahead of their title fight on Saturday. Underdog Chisora struck Ukrainian Klitschko as the two went face-to-face after they had taken to the scales 24 hours prior to their bout in Munich. Wladimir is due to fight former cruiserweight world champion, Jean-Marc Mormeck, from France, on March 3. " Chisora pulled a similarly controversial stunt when he planted a kiss on Derek Baker before their fight in 2010. A stunned Klitschko took a step back after Chisora's slap before both fighters' entourages became involved in a brief scuffle.
