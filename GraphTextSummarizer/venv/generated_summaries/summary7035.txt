-- Daniel Ricciardo drove the race of his young life to secure an unlikely victory for Red Bull Sunday in an incident-packed Hungarian Grand Prix which saw Lewis Hamilton ignore Mercedes team orders to let title leader Nico Rosberg through. Rosberg, who still leads the championship from Hamilton by 11 points, was making up about three seconds per lap on the top three after his stop for new tires, but his charge came too late. Lewis Hamilton claimed the final podium spot after starting from the pit lane and spinning off the track on the first lap with Rosberg in fourth place. But the intense rivalry between the pair reached a head when Hamilton refused to allow Rosberg through at a crucial stage of the race. Hamilton countered by saying Rosberg had not been close enough.
