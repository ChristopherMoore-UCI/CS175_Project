Pedrosa crash overshadows Stoner's French MotoGP success Simoncelli headed off Le Mans winner Casey Stoner and Yamaha's world champion and series leader Jorge Lorenzo as he set a late lap of one minute 42.413 seconds. "This is the best way to forget what happened in Le Mans and what everyone has been saying in the last two weeks, and before this race," he said after qualifying first for Sunday's Catalunya Grand Prix near Barcelona. -- Marco Simoncelli hopes he has put his Le Mans nightmare behind him after earning the first pole position of his top-level motorcycling career in Spain on Saturday. American Ben Spies will lead the second row on the grid from Honda's Andrea Dovizioso and fellow Yamaha rider Cal Crutchlow, while seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi was seventh ahead of Ducati teammate Nicky Hayden of the U.S. Simoncelli reportedly received death threats following that collision, which resulted in the 24-year-old finishing fifth after being hit with a ride-through penalty, having been denied his first podium placing.
