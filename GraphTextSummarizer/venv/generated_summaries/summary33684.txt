You might remember Meeks, the California man who -- despite a rap sheet littered with charges related to gang membership, firearm possession and grand theft -- became a viral sensation in June because of his attractive mugshot. Kory's mugshot sparked numerous reactions on Twitter, many from women praising his looks or comparing him to Meeks. Police in Santa Cruz, California, said the 29-year-old dreadlocked man attacked a person dressed as a Fox News reporter during the city's downtown festivities on October 31. Among the other notable mischief makers in the coastal California city was a resident dressed as Edward Scissorhands who got a little too into character and was cited "for mutilation of city trees. Now, Sean Kory has stolen the social media spotlight after his alleged Halloween escapades and subsequent police photograph.
