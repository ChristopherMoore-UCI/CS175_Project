Lee's Hollywood star, to be dedicated Tuesday morning, will be the 2,428th on the Walk of Fame. The movies based on Lee's comic books "have done so much for the characters" by giving them glamour and prestige, he said. "I'm pretty proud of the fact that some of the stories I wrote so many years ago are still being read and hopefully enjoyed by the public and people are making motion pictures based on them, and television series and even a Broadway show," Lee said.
