"Price tag" attacks are actions taken by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and Palestinian properties as retaliatory measures. " Hebron Governor Kamel Al-Hameed told CNN the incidents were not isolated, represent escalating attacks by Israeli settlers and said the Israeli government is not doing enough to put an end to them. In the second incident, a 32-year-old Palestinian farmer was stabbed in the upper body by masked Israeli settlers in the southern Hebron hills, according to Palestinian medical officials. -- Three Palestinians were wounded Monday in two separate incidents, including one that Israeli officials described as a "price tag" attack against Palestinians. "The Palestinian government media center holds the Israeli government responsible for tolerating settler violence against Palestinians," the statement read.
