To increase high school graduation rates, the report recommends a focus on the middle schools that feed "dropout factory" high schools so that students begin their high school years with the reading skills needed to complete high school. The Obama administration has targeted such schools with School Improvement Grants, which provide money to school districts that agree to follow certain criteria, such as closing down underperforming schools or changing a certain percentage of staff at those schools. It is estimated that around one-quarter of students in the United States do not complete high school. "But the data also indicate that if we are to meet our national goals by 2020, we will have to accelerate our rate of progress, particularly in the states that have shown little progress." Over the past decade, the report says, the number of high schools considered "dropout factories" has declined by 457, with the largest decrease coming since 2008. The grants have been criticized by those who say they don't take into account the realities of rural school districts where it is hard to replace those staff members let go.
