The firestorm of controversy has already begun For more than 50 years, presidents have pushed for government rockets to send astronauts to space, the moon and possibly Mars. Without a space shuttle, the U.S. will rely temporarily on Russian rockets to send our astronauts into space. â€¢ NASA has to fund risky, out-of-the-box propulsion systems -- besides the expensive chemical rockets that are used now -- to help drive down the cost of space travel. Ground-based laser and microwave beams, for example, can vaporize water contained in a rocket, which is then shot out the other end, so only the payload goes into space, not the fuel. Conceivably, any political crisis with the Russians in far-away places, such as the Balkans, might affect our access to outer space.
