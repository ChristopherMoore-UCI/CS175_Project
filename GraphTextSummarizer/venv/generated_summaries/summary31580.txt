Attorney Mark O'Mara drops George Zimmerman When asked Monday night by CNN for clarification about the gun, a spokesman for O'Mara's law firm, Shawn Vincent, said there was no update yet. No charges were filed against George Zimmerman after an alleged altercation with his estranged wife and her father, Lake Mary, Florida, Police Chief Steve Bracknell said Monday. George Zimmerman came to the house with a friend of his and got into a heated discussion with Dean, O'Mara said. Police answered a 911 call from Shellie Zimmerman on Monday afternoon during which she said George Zimmerman had threatened her and her father with a weapon. Shellie Zimmerman called police as George Zimmerman sat in his truck with his friend.
