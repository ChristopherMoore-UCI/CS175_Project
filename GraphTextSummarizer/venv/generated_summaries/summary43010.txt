The Commonwealth Fund recently released a study of health systems in 10 developed countries around the world which included a survey of satisfaction. Yes indeed, a glitchy website and people moving from junk insurance to real insurance prove once and for all that government should have as little to do with health care as possible, and the entire liberal project lies in tatters. The conservatives who profess to love markets so dearly seem unable to grasp that the market for health care isn't like the market for shoes or cars. But in health care -- to paraphrase Ronald Reagan -- the free market isn't the answer to our problems. For decades, liberals have been working to devise policy solutions and create the political conditions for health care reform that would achieve secure, universal coverage.
