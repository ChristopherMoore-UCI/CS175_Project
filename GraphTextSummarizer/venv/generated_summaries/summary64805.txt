Many observers are using this incident as hard evidence that British soccer remains an unreconstructed backwater, a sport stuck in a past, malign time, followed by prejudiced people. As late as the 1980s, bananas were thrown at black players: In one infamous photo from 1987, black Liverpool player John Barnes could be seen kicking off the field a banana that had been hurled at him. A columnist for the Daily Mail described the Chelsea men as a "mob of filthy fans" whose behavior was a "throwback to the Eighties terrace culture" -- that era when hooliganism was a genuine problem at English soccer games and racist attitudes were fairly widespread. So should we assume that soccer fans are more likely than others to harbor hateful thoughts for the Other? Today, more than 30% of soccer players in Britain are black.
