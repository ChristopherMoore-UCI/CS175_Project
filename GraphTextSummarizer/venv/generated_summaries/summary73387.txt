And until the striker, painted as a maverick and a trouble maker in the press, proves he can '"carry" a club, his enormous potential may go unfulfilled, according to Milan director Umberto Gandini. "Probably Mario has not made the transition yet from being just a fantastic athlete to a great player," Gandini told CNN of one of the most talked about players in world football. The Uruguayan achieved cult status at the club, scoring 82 goals in 133 appearances, and 31 times last season as the Reds came agonizingly close to a first Premier League title since 1990. "He is much, much better than he is portrayed and his lifestyle was much better than portrayed in England," Gandini added. Not helping him is the shadow of the man he replaced on Merseyside -- Luis Suarez, now at Spanish club Barcelona.
