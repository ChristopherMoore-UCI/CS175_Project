They contended that existing federal hate-crimes laws were sufficient to protect the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Opponents of the expanded hate crimes bill challenged the need to specify one particular community in federal legislation. Had hate crimes been a federal offense in 2007, the FBI would have been able to investigate the attack, and Sean Kennedy's killer might still be in prison, his mother said. "My son was murdered as he was leaving a bar in Greenville, South Carolina," the 48-year-old woman told CNN about her son, Sean, who was 20 when he came face-to-face with what she calls a hate crime. Last week, the Senate did what she was seeking when it passed legislation by 68-29 that would make it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity.
