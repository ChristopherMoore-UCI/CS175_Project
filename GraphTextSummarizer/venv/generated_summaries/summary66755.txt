"It is very important because rugby is not as popular as other sports such as table tennis and Olympic sports," Zheng said on the IRB's Web site. Sevens is competing against baseball, softball, golf, karate, squash and roller-sports for one of two new spots at the 2016 games, and IRB chairman Bernard Lapasset believes it has an edge. The women's final featured a showdown between traditional rugby nations New Zealand and Australia. Last week's IRB Rugby Sevens World Cup in Dubai lived up to the sport's unpredictable reputation, with surprises and upsets at every turn. "Having the likes of Thailand, Brazil, China and Uganda competing with New Zealand, England, Spain and France in a Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament is a very exciting development for the game," Lapasset said, according to a report to the international rugby board (IRB).
