One of the men in the group took out his own handgun and fired, said Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos. -- A man, who tried to rob a group of people waiting in line to buy the new $180 LeBron James sneakers, was shot and killed when one of the customers pulled out a gun, Atlanta police said. Another customer in line, Taylor White, told CNN affiliate WSB-TV that the would-be robber should have thought twice. The incident took place before dawn Saturday outside a shoe store in Atlanta's Little Five Points area. Campos said the customer was not charged.
