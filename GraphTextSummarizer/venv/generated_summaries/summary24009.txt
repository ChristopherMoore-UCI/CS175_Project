The ship's captain, Robert Mayne, told CNN by cell phone from his prison cell that the weapons were for protection against piracy while at sea. A family member of one of the former captives and a U.S. congressman, who had traveled to the Central American nation to inquire about the Americans, said Thursday that the men were out of prison and headed home. -- Six Americans imprisoned in Honduras for more than a month on charges they attempted to smuggle weapons into the country are now free. The Americans were in Honduras to work with local officials in the impoverished, rural municipality of Ahuas to remove valuable mahogany logs from a nearby riverbed, remnants of decades of logging. "It is with great pleasure I am able to announce the safe release of the six Americans wrongfully imprisoned in Honduras," Rep. Mike Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican, said in a statement.
