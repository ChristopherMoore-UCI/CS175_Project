Without any intervention, officials believe the 5,000-pound secret spy satellite would fall to Earth on its own in early March. -- A Navy team including some 200 industry experts and scientists has been working furiously since January to modify the Aegis air-defense missile system so it can shoot down a failed satellite officials say could fall to Earth, a Pentagon official told CNN. Selected for the mission is the Aegis-equipped cruiser USS Lake Erie, which is fully equipped with sea-based missile defense systems, and has long been the Navy's primary ship for the sea-based missile defense program, officials said. Officials have told CNN the shootdown carries a $40 million to $60 million price tag. Most of the debris would re-enter the atmosphere within hours of impact, NASA Administrator Michael Griffin has said.
