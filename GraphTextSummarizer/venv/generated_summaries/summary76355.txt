-- Democratic offices in at least three states have reported instances of vandalism that party members say possibly were tied to Sunday's historic vote on health care reform. Stauble mentioned that a recent post on a blog encouraged people to throw bricks at local Democratic offices nationwide. He said he didn't call for the damages to congressional offices because, "I didn't want to be responsible for anybody breaking a federal law." Blogger Michael B. Vanderboegh of Pinson, Alabama, told CNN Monday that in a Friday blog -- which he says was posted after the incident at Slaughter's office -- he called for people to break windows at Democratic headquarters at the city and county level. WHEC reported that a note attached to the brick in the Monroe County office read "extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice" -- a quote delivered in an acceptance speech by Republican president candidate Barry Goldwater at the 1964 GOP convention.
