-- The Bush administration made a "fatal mistake" by talking up facts and figures without painting a broader picture of the obstacles in its widely criticized Hurricane Katrina response effort, ex-FEMA chief Michael Brown said Thursday. " Brown headed FEMA under the Bush administration and resigned in September 2005, two weeks after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast and 10 days after President Bush famously complimented him. Chertoff was criticized by a House committee in 2006 for choosing Brown to lead the government response, despite inadequate training. Brown told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the talking points he and other federal officials used at the time didn't tell the whole story. "If I knew then what I know now about Mr. Brown's agenda, I would have done something different," Chertoff said.
