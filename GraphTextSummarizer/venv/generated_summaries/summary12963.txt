She was given a cameo role in the 1994 "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake, but her later career focused on stage productions in Texas. Burns' acting career began with a small role in Robert Altman's "Brewster McCloud," which was filmed in her hometown of Houston in 1970, according to her biography published in 2009 when she was inducted into the International Horror & Sci-Fi Film Festival Hall of Fame. "She was found unresponsive by a family member" in her Houston-area home, manager Chris Roe said. -- Actress Marilyn Burns, a "scream queen" in the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," died Tuesday, her manager said. She was a University of Texas student when she landed the role of Sally Hardesty, the sole survivor in the first "Chainsaw" film in 1974.
