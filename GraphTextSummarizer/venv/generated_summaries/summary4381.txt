This week, the Russian ambassador to the United States accused the United States and Europe of trying to turn a Security Council resolution on Syria into an "anti-al-Assad" resolution, a step that, he argued, could "be a recipe for disaster." The resolution also supports "full implementation" of the Arab League report on Syria that called on Syria to form a unity government within two months but stopped short of supporting military intervention. The Arab League report was released about a month after it sent observers into Syria. The draft gives Syria 15 days to comply or risk the adoption of further measures. The U.N. Security Council discussed Friday a resolution introduced by Morocco that calls on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down and transfer power to his vice president.
