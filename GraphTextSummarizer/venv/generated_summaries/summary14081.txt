But last week, Shanghai Daily reported that local officials had called off a popular New Year's Eve light show there, citing police concerns over crowd control. Many of the dead were young students, CCTV America reported, citing Shanghai rescue authorities. Photos showed large crowds packing a street near the river and emergency medical workers treating people on the ground. A witness told the government-run news agency that people started scrambling after coupons that looked like dollar bills were thrown from the third floor of a building. Even with the light show and official countdown called off, many revelers remained at the location and had their own countdown there.
