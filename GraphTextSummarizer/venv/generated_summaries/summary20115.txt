-- Teresa Scanlan of Nebraska will spend the next year as Miss America after besting 52 other pageant hopefuls at Saturday's event in Las Vegas. The pageant, which is distinct from the Miss USA crown, aims "to provide personal and professional opportunities for young women to promote their voices in culture, politics and the community," according to the Miss America website. Margaret Gorman became known as the first Miss America after winning a pair of contests in 1921 -- one consisting of women deemed most popular based on photos shown in various East Coast newspapers and the other for the so-called Golden Mermaid trophy. This year's contest was the 90th anniversary of the Miss America pageant. She hopes to attend law school, become a judge and eventually a politician, according to the Miss America website.
