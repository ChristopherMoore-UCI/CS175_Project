The pope's visit is to mark the "bicentenary of the independence of the peoples of Latin America; the Mexicans' enthusiastic desire to welcome the Pope; the 20th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Mexico and the Holy See; and the 400th anniversary of the discovery of the image of 'Nuestra Senora de la Caridad del Cobre' in Cuba, with its concomitant Holy Year," a Vatican spokesman said. The pope's visit to Mexico will be "a journey of hope," Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said in a statement. The pontiff answered reporters' questions about the Caribbean communist island on the papal plane Friday as he began a six-day trip to Mexico and Cuba, according to the Vatican. The government did not re-establish formal ties with the Vatican until a visit by Pope John Paul II in 1998. Benedict is committed to a "continental mission" in Latin America, launched at the Aparecida Conference, where the church seeks to continue making her "inspirational contribution to the progress of the continent, so that human and Christian values may guarantee integral human development, despite the difficulties and dangers of our time," Lombardi said.
