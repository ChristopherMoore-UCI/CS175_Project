Wal-Mart "will consider how aspects of this plan could apply to stores outside of New York," he said in a statement. -- Wal-Mart has agreed to pay nearly $2 million and take extra safety precautions after a stampede killed a store employee in Long Island, New York, last year. Wal-Mart agreed to pay $1.5 million for community programs in Nassau County and another $400,000 to compensate people who were injured in the incident and repay them for out-of-pocket expenditures, District Attorney Kathleen Rice of Nassau County said in a statement. At the time, Detective Lt. Michael Fleming of the Nassau County police described "utter chaos" when Wal-Mart workers tried to open the store doors that day. The district attorney and Wal-Mart said they agreed on a crowd-management plan that the retailer will implement at each of its 92 stores in New York for after-Thanksgiving shopping.
