Mental Floss: 5,000 years of boardgames (Part I) Willard Fiske, author of the misnamed Chess in Iceland (which includes histories of many table games beyond chess), argues for Nard as the connection between tables/backgammon and the table games of antiquity, while David Parlett identifies its entry into Europe as Table, later Tabula, by way of the Byzantine Empire and then Greece.
