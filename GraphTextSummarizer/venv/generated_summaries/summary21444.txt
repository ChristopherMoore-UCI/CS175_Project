"Their circumstances are pretty dire, because an amputee in Haiti is highly disadvantaged in terms of being able to be mobile, have a job and look after family," said Eric Doubt, executive director of Healing Hands for Haiti International, which provides treatment and rehabilitation to people with disabilities. With so many earthquake victims having had or facing the prospect of amputations, Haiti's government should prioritize the issue of disability and support for disabled people, Stuart said. Stuart explained that many people with injuries requiring amputation may not have made it yet to hospitals. She has since been active in charities to clear land mines and provide artificial limbs to tens of thousands of people. Before the earthquake, Haiti had only one facility that produced prosthetic limbs.
