So, if being unattached made me an asset to those I've worked for, should that same status keep me, and millions of others without children, from enjoying flexible work arrangements that few seem to question if you've got children at home? Or do we have to have kids at home in order to have a valid "excuse" to benefit from the 21st century reality of virtual work? It's not just supporting family balance, but you balance," says Cindy Auten, general manager of Mobile Work Exchange. I'd never want to keep my colleagues with children from making work arrangements that best add balance to their hectic lives. A "2012 National Study of Employers" conducted by the Society for Human Resources Management and the Families & Work Institute found that 63% of employers allow workers to work at home at least occasionally, up from 34% in 2005.
