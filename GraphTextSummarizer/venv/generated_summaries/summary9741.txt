-- Merle and Pat Butler, lifetime residents of Red Bud, Illinois, hold the third winning ticket worth $218 million in last month's Mega Millions lottery, officials announced Wednesday. Michigan winner charged with welfare fraud Red Bud locals commenting on a message board thread threw out several names of suspected winners but never the Butlers. The mayor said the "windfall of money" could be a boost for his farming community's economy, but a person "can only buy so many groceries." The Butlers said they would remain in Red Bud, which Merle Butler called "a nice comfortable, family-oriented community. " Mayor Tim Lowry suspected the decision by the winner to have the announcement in his southern Illinois town was evidence it was a Red Bud resident. Moto Mart, which saw a two-fold rise in lottery ticket sales, also was gossip central for lottery rumors.
