Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is heading to North Carolina next week to campaign with Republican Senate nominee Thom Tillis, CNN has learned. Romney, who won North Carolina in the 2012 general election, is scheduled to attend a rally with Tillis in Raleigh next Wednesday, which "will be a big shot of momentum" for the campaign in the closing days, campaign manager Jordan Shaw told CNN. That revelation, prompted by questioning from CNN producer Ted Barrett, prompted Hagan then to attack her opponent on missing legislative work in favor of fundraising. This comes as GOP officials believe Tillis, the North Carolina House Speaker, has closed the gap in his race against endangered incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan. The race for the North Carolina seat is expected to be the most expensive Senate contest this election year and is key for the Democrats if they hope to hold onto control of the Senate.
