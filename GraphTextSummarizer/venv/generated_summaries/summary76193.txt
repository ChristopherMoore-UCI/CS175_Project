The Australian Open has banned selfie sticks, outside of designated selfie zones. In any case, selfies are a cliche that have always reminded me of Rowan Atkinson as that sad old buffoon, Mr. Bean, taking self-portraits with his teddy bear in front of Buckingham Palace. Some of the world's most important museums are confirming what we've suspected all along but didn't dare say: selfie sticks are stupid. The MoMA is one of the world's busiest museums -- add selfie sticks among the crowds and you've got a recipe for disaster. Travel writer Paul Theroux once told his readers: "I never bring a camera -- because taking pictures, I've found, makes me less observant and interferes with my memory."
