" States have previously challenged federal laws and regulations in areas aside from health care. The law declares that any guns that are manufactured and kept in-state are not subject to federal gun laws passed by Congress under interstate commerce authority, because the guns never crossed state lines. "I think most of the states that are passing these laws understand that they can't trump federal law with state law," said Professor Jonathan Siegel at George Washington University Law School. A number of states have also passed laws trying to wrest more control from Washington over issues such as how public lands are used or how a state's National Guard forces are deployed overseas, according to the 10th Amendment Center, which advocates for states' rights. Such state laws might not be the only legal challenge to Democratic health care legislation.
