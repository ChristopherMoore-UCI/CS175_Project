Denver Police Sergeant Steve Warneke interviewed Sergeant Brett Hinkle and Detective Aaron Kafer from the DPD Marijuana Unit, who reiterated Johnson's advice to parents to seek candy in its original package. Kafer advised parents taking a keen eye to their child's candy haul as they would on any previous Halloween, but with a special focus on labels that may seek to imitate classic candies. Edible foods and candies infused with THC, the active ingredient in pot, have proved to be immensely popular with consumers, but they also pose a potential problem for parents trying to keep weed out of trick-or-treaters' hands. "Once that candy dries, there's really no way to tell the difference between candy that's infused and candy that's not infused," Johnson warned. "You do need to talk to your kids about it prior to this because you know how kids are -- they reach into a bag and they want to eat that piece of candy right away," he said.
