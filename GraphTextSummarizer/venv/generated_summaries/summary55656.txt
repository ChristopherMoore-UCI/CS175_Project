-- Norwegian marathon runner Grete Waitz, winner of a record nine New York City marathons, has died at the age of 57 following a six-year fight with cancer. Waitz, who had been undergoing treatment for cancer since 2005, died overnight on Tuesday in hospital in Norway's capital Oslo, according to Helle Aanesen, co-founder of Waitz's Active Against Cancer Foundation. "The dedication, perseverance and fortitude with which Grete carved out her athletics career on the track, across the country and on the road is an example to us all, as is the positive way she tackled the illness that beset her life in recent years," he said, AFP reported. International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) president Lamine Diack described Waitz as "one of the brightest flames of the modern athletics era," AFP reported. Waitz's talents extended to other distances as well.
