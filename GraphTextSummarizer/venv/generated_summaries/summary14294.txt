The number of people killed in a car bombing in Afghanistan's capital rose to 26, including six Italian soldiers, Afghan authorities said Saturday. Before the remains left for Rome, the Italian military, international troops and dignitaries held a service in the Afghan capital. The coffins of six Italian soldiers killed in a suicide attack in Kabul return to Rome. After the attack, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said it would be "best" for the country's troops to leave Afghanistan as soon as possible. The 500 troops Italy sent to Afghanistan this summer will be home by Christmas, Ignazio La Russa, Italy's defense minister said.
