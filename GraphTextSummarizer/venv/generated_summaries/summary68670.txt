Due to a lack of early education and a poor academic foundation, many students are far behind the curriculum. This semester my classroom was equipped with a "smart' whiteboard and a computer but students still have to share dilapidated wooden desks due to lack of funds. Families don't attach much importance to education and many students quit even though education is compulsory until the age of 16. I visited the homes of my students more than 70 times in my first year of teaching and got to know more about the community. I fell in love with teaching.
