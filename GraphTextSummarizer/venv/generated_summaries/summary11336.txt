Protesters are upset with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker's call to curb collective bargaining rights. But that's not what Governor Walker is doing. Walker repeatedly cited his experience as a local official in explaining his call to curtail bargaining rights for government.

Wisconsin is "broke," and unions use their power to block necessary cost-saving measures, Walker argued. This is our moment in Wisconsin's history," Walker told NBC.
