The FIFA World Player of the Year walked away from the smash and was given a lift to training that morning by then Manchester United teammate Edwin van der Sar who had been driving along the same stretch of road behind him. The Manchester United star, who is set to move to Real Madrid for a world record fee, demolished the front of his high-performance sports car after he hit a roadside barrier in a tunnel on a freeway in the north-west of England city. Real Madrid and Manchester United confirmed last week that they had reached a deal to send Ronaldo to the Bernabeu, but it has still to be officially sealed. Ronaldo's Ferrari was a complete write-off after his accident on the way to training. The impact of the crash saw one of the Ferrari's wheels come off and end up 200 meters away, with skid marks on the road clearly prominent.
