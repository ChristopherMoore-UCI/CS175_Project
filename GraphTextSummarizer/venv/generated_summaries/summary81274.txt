"Everything is melted inside," said Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino. At least seven people died Tuesday when a packed Metro North commuter train plowed into a Jeep Cherokee on the tracks north of New York City. Six of the people killed in the fiery crash were train passengers, and the seventh fatality was the female driver of the Jeep, the official said. "There were about 650 (people) total on the ride home," said  Astorino said. The collision happened about 7 p.m. when the gates at the two-track Commerce Street crossing near Valhalla came down on top of a Jeep Cherokee stopped on the tracks.
