If you can only see one set of family, decide to see the other set (or sets, if you're children of divorced families) for Christmas or New Year's or Thanksgiving next year. Whether you have invites to more than one Thanksgiving get-together, you live close enough to see both sets of families, or you have to choose which family or set of friends to spend time with this year, the key to avoiding a fight and hurt feelings is to compromise. Unfortunately, all that togetherness can be a little stressful for couples -- especially if it includes a hectic travel schedule and/or time with one or both sets of families. If everyone lives close enough that you can see more than one set of family (or friends) this holiday, have lunch at one place and dinner at another, or the entre√© at one home and dessert at the other. Thanksgiving is a time for a lot of new couples to meet each other's extended families for the first time.
