In a cell phone video obtained by CNN, men topple portable toilets as others jump and cheer, and still others look on and record video. Then came a riot, with scores of people rampaging down palm tree-lined streets, damaging city vehicles and street signs, throwing more punches and overturning portable toilets as many more looked on. First, police say, came a fight in a crowd at the end of a multiday surfing and skateboarding competition in Southern California's Huntington Beach on Sunday evening. Huntington Beach police said the crowd was dispersed by 9 p.m. Rioters damaged city vehicles, windows, newspaper racks and street signs, police said.
