The twist is these two agents, Elizabeth (Russell) and Philip Jennings (Matthew Rhys), would be married. -- On a recent January night near the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn, Keri Russell was shooting FX's new Russian spy thriller show, "The Americans." In the pilot episode, Russell kicks a guy's head through a wall, while co-star Rhys stabs a guy in the crotch with a large fork. That's where the journey is over the season -- this roller coaster of them trying to figure out what their path is, what the present is and what the future is." Russell's last series was the short-lived Fox comedy "Running Wilde" in 2010. I think my interest in that came from working at the CIA and seeing those people." Both Russell and Rhys echoed those sentiments.
