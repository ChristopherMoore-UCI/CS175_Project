Rogen, who says he wouldn't be in comedy if he never saw Sandler's movies while he was growing up, says "Funny People" paints an accurate picture of the ups and downs of comedians who are just starting out. -- Given a cast of Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill, and the guiding hand of director and writer Judd Apatow ("Knocked Up" and "The 40-Year-Old Virgin"), perhaps there is no more appropriate title than simply "Funny People. Ira is forced to adapt to his boss' constant mood swings, erratic behavior as he deals with the fear of dying and deep regret at losing Laura (Leslie Mann), the only woman he ever loved. Along the way, he hires struggling comedian Ira Wright, played by Rogen, to pen jokes for him and act as his personal assistant. Which is saying something, since "Funny People" frequently treads into the darker realms of comedy.
