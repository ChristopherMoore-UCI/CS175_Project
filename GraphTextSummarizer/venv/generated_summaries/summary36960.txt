Although he made his breakthrough with French team Monaco, and spent time with Juventus, Barcelona and latterly New York Red Bulls, Henry is best remembered for a glittering eight-year spell with Arsenal in the English Premier League. Although his immediate focus will be punditry work with British broadcaster Sky TV, Henry has not ruled out a coaching career. The 37-year-old brought the curtain down on his player career with a four-year stint in the "Big Apple," helping New York Red Bulls win Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference in 2010 and 2013. "It has been an incredible journey and I would like to thank all the fans, team mates and individuals involved with AS Monaco, Juventus, Arsenal FC, FC Barcelona, the New York Red Bulls and of course the French National Team that have made my time in the game so special," he said on his official Facebook page. See you on the other side..." Henry's move to Arsenal in 1999, after a troubled year in Turin with Juventus, saw him reunited with former Monaco coach Arsene Wenger.
