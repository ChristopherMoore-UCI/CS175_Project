Valdez officials came close to going in that direction after schools and businesses were closed because of excessive snow loads on roofs. One thing is clear: It takes a lot of snow for the city to shut schools and businesses. It brought in workers from other parts of the state to help cut blocks of snow off the roofs of schools and businesses. For my city, Valdez, Alaska, 18 inches of snow is just another day; schools operate, companies stay open and people go about their daily routines. That was good enough to shut down schools, cancel flights in the region and declare snow emergencies.
