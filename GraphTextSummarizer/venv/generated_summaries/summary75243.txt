But Italy's top court ruled that 18 months is too long, and that judges, not politicians, should be the ones to determine if a defendant is free to appear in court. The Berlusconi-backed law said top government officials could not be prosecuted because their official duties made it impossible for them to attend court hearings. The law was designed to halt criminal proceedings against top government officials for 18 months on the grounds that they are too busy to appear in court. The law was approved in March 2010, but prosecutors in Milan challenged the constitutionality of the measure, saying it should be judges, not politicians, who determined whether someone had time to attend court. The court heard arguments Tuesday about the legality of the "legitimate impediment" law, which would have granted top Italian government officials what amounted to immunity while they were in office.
