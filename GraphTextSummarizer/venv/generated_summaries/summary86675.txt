Rolling Stone Assistant Editor Andy Greene thinks the song and the album deserve higher praise, considering it was the last album the Beatles collectively worked on together. The first side of the lyrics -- which are believed to have been composed on the morning and afternoon of January 17, 1967 -- features a rough draft written in script with a black felt marker and blue ballpoint pen, with a few annotations in red ink. The album is considered a turning point in the career of the Beatles, transforming them from pop icons to among the 20th century's leading artists. The other side of the page, whose ink is also bright and vibrant, is written in block letters, according to Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy. The double-sided single sheet of paper written in Lennon's hand includes cross-outs and corrections, and chronicles the evolution of one of the most famous musical masterpieces by the Beatles.
