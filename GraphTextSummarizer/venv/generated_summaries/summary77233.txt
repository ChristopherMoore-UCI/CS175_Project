But for some people in Argentina's Jewish community, this and other recent acts, like the appearance of swastikas painted in a cemetery, have raised concerns. The attack occurred outside the Israeli embassy as members of Argentina's Jewish community, celebrating the 61st anniversary of the state of Israel's founding, were confronted by a gang of youths. " Fernandez described the act as anti-Semitic, but denied Argentina was experiencing a surge in such sentiment. -- A day after police arrested five people in what authorities described as an anti-Semitic demonstration that turned violent, Jews expressed concern Monday over the attack. "They came equipped for that," said Daniel Gazit, Israel's ambassador to Argentina, who witnessed the incident in which three Jews and a policeman were injured -- none seriously.
