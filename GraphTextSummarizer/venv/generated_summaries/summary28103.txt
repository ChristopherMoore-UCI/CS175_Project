-- A New Jersey police officer plead not guilty on Friday, a day after he was arrested and charged with setting fire to the house of an Edison police captain and his family. Michael A. Dotro was arrested on Thursday at his home in Manalapan, New Jersey, after an investigation by the Middlesex County prosecutor's office and the Monroe Township Police Department. Dotro's lawyer, Lawrence Bitterman, said that his client is "in shock" and had told Bitterman that "he can't believe he's being arrested. " Superior Court Judge Bradley Ferencz on Friday upheld previously set bail conditions on Friday, which included a $5 million bail. Bitterman said that Dotro also told him, "The thought of anyone doing this to his brother officer makes me (Dotro) sick."
