"Once again, thank you guys for inducting Public Enemy into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame," said Hank Shocklee, a member of the group's production team, the Bomb Squad who along with group frontman rapper Chuck D. helped create the Public Enemy sound. "Our mission was basically to inspire, to teach, to do something that we haven't done in music, or even in the rap game, was to bring about a unity, a collective effort, so that we can fight the power." Singer Harry Belafonte Jr., praised Public Enemy for changing "everything about the emerging urban musical force called rap." Randy Newman, Heart, Albert King, Donna Summer and Public Enemy also joined the exclusive club on Thursday. Rush joined the likes of Aerosmith, The Doors and James Taylor on Thursday when the trio was -- finally -- inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Though the ceremony took place in Los Angeles, Boston was on everyone's mind, including Neil Diamond's, in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing.
