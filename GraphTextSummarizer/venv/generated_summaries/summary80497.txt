In the United States, a typical patient dies of chronic kidney disease their 70s or 80s, said Daniel Brooks of Boston University School of Public Health. Stage 3 is considered chronic kidney disease, Brooks said. La Isla Foundation would like to work with sugarcane companies on improving working conditions, provided they acknowledge that working conditions could be contributing to the illness, "and need improvement independent of that," Glaser said. The illness is not related to diabetes or hypertension -- drivers of kidney disease in the United States -- and affects primarily young men. It is not yet clear to scientists and industry leaders what is causing this increased incidence of kidney disease.
