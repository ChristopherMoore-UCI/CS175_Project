Both teams were successful with their first seven penalties of the shootout, including Drogba, until Manchester City defender Kolo Toure saw his effort saved by Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene. His Zambian counterpart Christopher Katongo hit the woodwork in extra time before the drama of penalties and victory for the underdogs. Ivory Coast captain Didier Drogba missed a penalty in the second half of regulation play as the match ended scoreless after extra time. Drogba set up Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure for his side's best chance of the first half, but the African player of the year fired wide. Clear-cut chances were few and far between in wet conditions, but Ivorian goalkeeper Boubacar Barry had to make a brilliant early save to foil Nathan Sinkala.
