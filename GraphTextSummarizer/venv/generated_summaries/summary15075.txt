An Israeli was stabbed Sunday near central Jerusalem, police said, the latest in a string of similar attacks. Israel has also recently been facing what some call an "auto intifada" -- a spate of attacks on Jewish civilians in Jerusalem by Palestinians driving vehicles. Authorities are searching for the attacker, described as an Arab youth who fled in the direction of Damascus Gate, an entrance to Jerusalem's Old City. Palestinians are facing a fresh internal rift between the two major political factions: Fatah, which controls the West Bank, and Hamas, which controls Gaza. The victim was taken to a hospital in moderate condition, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
