-- Employers in Denmark have started paying compensation to women who have developed breast cancer after working night shifts. Studies have shown that nurses working night shifts have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. " Those most likely to do night shifts are those working in the health-care industry, hospitality, industrial manufacturing, news media and security workers. Ulla Mahnkopf developed breast cancer after 30 years working as a flight attendant for SAS, a job where night shifts were the norm. Dr Vincent Cogliano, Head of the IARC Monographs Program, told CNN that the evidence in humans is limited to breast cancer because researchers have historically studied nurses and flight attendants.
