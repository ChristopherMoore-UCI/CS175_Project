Elsewhere in Australia, top seed Marion Bartoli crashed out at the quarterfinal stage of the rain-hit Hobart International after defeat by the Czech Klara Zakopalova. Weather delays meant Zakopalova was forced to play two matches on the same day, but she still had enough to beat world number 17 Bartoli 6-4 6-2. Klijsters will now face China's Li Na in Friday's final and a win at Sydney's Olympic Park will see her rise to number two in the world rankings. Germany's Mayer secured his place in the last four of the competition with a straight-sets 6-4 6-1 win over Italian Potito Starace. "She (Zakopalova) played unbelievable to be honest," Bartoli told the tournament's website.
