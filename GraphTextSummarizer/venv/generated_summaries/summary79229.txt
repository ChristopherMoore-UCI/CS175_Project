Contract towers had an average of six controllers, while FAA towers had 16. The Wednesday conference call "wasn't just some coffee break conversation at the water cooler," he said, saying it included FAA officials and representatives of all three contractors who operate FAA control towers in the United States. About 250 of the nation's 374 towers are staffed by contactors, though they must meet FAA standards and are overseen by FAA managers. A 2011 report by the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General said contract towers cost on average $537,000 a year to operate, compared to $2 million for comparably busy FAA-staffed towers. Tower closures would not necessarily result in airport closures, because some aircraft can land without ATC help, and those that need controller help can communicate with more distant FAA facilities.
