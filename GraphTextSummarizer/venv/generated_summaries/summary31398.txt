Battles between Yemeni government forces and the Shiite Houthi rebel movement have raged intermittently for five years in northern Yemen, where government troops launched a new offensive in late summer. -- Iran's foreign minister Tuesday called on Yemen's neighbors to stay out of the conflict between Yemeni forces and Shiite Muslim rebels, while Yemen said it had seized an Iranian ship near its territorial waters. Saudi Arabia, Yemen's northern neighbor, turned its air force against suspected Houthi rebels last week. The Houthi claimed the airstrikes occurred within Yemeni territory, a claim both the Saudi and Yemeni governments denied. A Yemeni government official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, told CNN that Yemen's navy was "on the highest state of alert" and watching for any possible smuggling of weapons to the Houthi.
