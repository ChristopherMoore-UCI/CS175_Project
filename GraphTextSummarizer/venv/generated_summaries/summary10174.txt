In India, the angry demonstrations after the gang-rape and subsequent death of a 23-year-old woman have prompted initial changes -- such as increasing the number of women working in New Delhi police stations and official pledges to strengthen laws regarding rape and assault. "The media attention to protests in Delhi has raised awareness on issues of violence against women in Nepal," said Manju Gurung, of Pourakhi, an organization that advocates for female migrant workers. For almost two weeks, demonstrators across Nepal have chanted slogans and massed outside official buildings, including the prime minister's residence, demanding better protection of women and criticizing what they describe as the government's delayed response to issues such as rape and abuse. -- Echoing outrage seen in the streets of Indian cities after a deadly gang-rape in New Delhi, protesters in India's northern neighbor Nepal are also demanding their government take action over violence against women. Their outrage focused on several cases of alleged rape and abuse against women, including that of the migrant worker, whom they refer to as Sita Rai.
