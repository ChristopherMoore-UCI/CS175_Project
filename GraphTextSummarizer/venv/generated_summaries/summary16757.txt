New Zealand Post has become a successful, innovative global company focusing on parcel delivery, logistics and other businesses. It provides managers with more focused incentives and helps to raise the additional capital necessary to pursue new services and lines of business. Unlike horse transportation, however, it's possible for mail delivery services to remain viable, innovative, self-sustaining businesses even in the electronic age, as posts around the world have shown. Repeal of the monopolies is necessary because the service will never get the freedom to pursue new lines of business aggressively, and thus to generate new revenue, unless it is subject to the discipline of competition. Mail delivery is now like offering transportation by horse in the dawning automobile era.
