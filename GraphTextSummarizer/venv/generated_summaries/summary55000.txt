-- Making good on a threat of election day violence, the Taliban sliced off the index fingers of at least two people in Kandahar province, according to a vote monitoring group. Their claims came as election officials said the results of the vote, seen as a judgment on the Karzai government's efforts in tackling Taliban insurgents, poverty and corruption, would be rolled out starting August 25. A spokeswoman for the American Embassy in Kabul said the United States has "every confidence that they (the commission members) will be able to finish this part of the electoral process in a transparent fashion" Meanwhile, the top two presidential candidates -- President Hamid Karzai and his chief rival Abdullah Abdullah -- positioned themselves as the likely winners in the race. On Friday, the European Union echoed those sentiments and congratulated Afghanistan for holding elections under what it called challenging circumstances. Sporadic attacks on election day killed 26 people and injured scores more.
