Rescue efforts have been hampered by severe weather, including heavy rains and strong winds, according to local officials. The Teratai Prima ferry left Pare Pare on Sulawesi island in central Indonesia on Saturday evening for Samarinda, East Kalimantan. The nine survivors were rescued by a navy ship Monday afternoon, bringing the total number of survivors from Sunday's accident to 30, said Col. Jaka Santosa, chief of search and rescue operations for the Indonesian navy. The ferry overturned about 4 a.m. Sunday off the coast of Majena in west Sulawesi after being pummeled with waves as high as 19 feet, survivors said. The search and rescue operations continued Tuesday, with five navy ships joining the effort.
