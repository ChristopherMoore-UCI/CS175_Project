The air traffic control system for London airspace has been restored after a technical failure, the UK air traffic management company NATS said Friday, but travelers can expect disruptions and flight cancellations. "Flights from Tunisia will be landing at Charles de Gaulle instead of London. He said they include "the parking of the aircraft, refueling, servicing of the aircraft, the security guarding and checking of the aircraft, the handling of the passengers at different airports where they're not really planning on that kind of capacity for the coming night -- perhaps this is happening overseas as well -- flights that were en route to the United Kingdom now diverting to other places. "The earlier problem will cause delays and cancellations to flights for the rest of the day and is likely to have a knock-on effect on some services tomorrow because aircraft and crew will now be out of position," Heathrow said in a statement. "All flights that are supposed to fly London from Charles de Gaulle are delayed," a representative for Paris Charles de Gaulle airport told CNN.
