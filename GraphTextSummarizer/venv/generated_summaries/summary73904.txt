The taping as well as an interruption by a spectator who witnesses said began talking loudly about campaign finance reform, apparently occurred near the end of arguments in a patent case. The video confirms what witnesses told CNN-- that the well-dressed man spoke about the need to keep campaign finance reform laws in place to regulate election spending and contributions. The biggest concerns raised by the justices are that cameras would upset the personal dynamic between them that make oral arguments so unique and useful to their later deliberations and opinion-writing. The group 99Rise.org, which supports campaign finance reform, posted the video of Wednesday's proceedings on YouTube as part of a protest over the issue. Sketch artists are allowed to portray the oral arguments and other public sessions of the court.
