One thing we do know is that these laws disproportionately affect women, young people, the elderly, African-American and Latino voters -- voters who traditionally vote for Democrats. Just last week, Republican House Judiciary Chair Bob Goodlatte said that it's not "necessary" to fix the mangled Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court's decision left the door open to burdensome and unfair voting restrictions. Across the country, people are lining up in theaters and watching a raw image of the sacrifice 600 voting rights marchers made: as they pursued the right to vote, they were brutally attacked by police using billy clubs and tear gas. For Dr. King who gave his life, along with many others including Jimmie Lee Jackson, Viola Liuzzo and the Rev. James Reeb, for the 600 individuals who made unbelievable sacrifices that day in Selma, for our children who should not have to face the same hardship the men and women before us had to face. Those negatively affected by these unnecessary, indeed oppressive, voting restrictions constitute over half of the voting population.
