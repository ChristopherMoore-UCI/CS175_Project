Airports experienced hours of flight delays Tuesday afternoon after a communications breakdown at a Federal Aviation Administration facility, the administration said. Mark Biello, a CNN photographer sitting on a delayed flight at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta on Tuesday afternoon, said flights there were being cleared for takeoff one at a time. The problem appeared similar to a June 8, 2007, computer issue that caused severe flight delays and some cancellations along the East Coast. The Web site, which normally lists the length of expected flight delays, was no longer listing that information Tuesday afternoon. Newark International was still reporting delays of up to 1 hour and 45 minutes and LaGuardia Airport in New York reported 45-minute delays -- although weather problems were cited as the main problem.
