The Buffalo Police Department said 25-year old Keith Johnson is in custody and has been charged with four counts of second degree murder. At a news conference Saturday, Police Commissioner Daniel Derenda said that the dead -- two men and two women -- included a Texas man who was celebrating his wedding anniversary. About 100 people were at the City Grill when the shootings occurred, and patrons were asked to leave the restaurant's bar after some sort of argument, police said. , New York said Saturday evening that they have arrested and charged a suspect in connection with a shooting spree that left four dead outside a downtown restaurant earlier in the day. Authorities would not comment on whether Johnson knew his alleged victims.
