Here's a sampling of some online deals being advertised for Cyber Monday (and in many cases, the rest of the week): -- Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet with 16GB of storage: $399, down from $499 (Amazon) -- Canon Powershot A3500 Not to be outdone, Amazon is promising new deals as often as every 10 minutes through Saturday, along with free shipping on "eligible orders" of $35 and over (it's not clear how they define "eligible.") While retailers are still trumpeting deals for this Monday after Thanksgiving, many such as Amazon, Target and Walmart are now promoting some version of "Cyber Week" and extending Web-only deals through next weekend. Clothing chains such as H&M, Gap and Banana Republic also are offering storewide Cyber Monday discounts of 40%. It's not always clear whether Cyber Monday discounts are much greater than what retailers offer online during other sale events.
