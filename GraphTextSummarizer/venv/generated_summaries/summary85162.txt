" Husband testifies his wife died after abortion was denied in Ireland Opinion: If Ireland had abortion rights CNN's Peter Taggart in Ireland contributed to this report. -- Irish lawmakers overwhelmingly passed new legislation early Friday that allows abortions if the mother's life is at risk. "The new law does add clarity, but requiring women to seek multiple approvals from health professionals may delay or defeat access to legal abortions," said Gauri van Gulik, women's rights advocate for Human Rights Watch. The European Court of Human Rights found that Ireland's failure to regulate access to abortion had led to a violation of its human rights obligations. Religious lawmakers and church leaders are upset over a provision allowing abortion if a pregnant woman is acutely at risk of committing suicide.
