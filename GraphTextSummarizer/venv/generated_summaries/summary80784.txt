The Quaids were ordered to appear for a hearing on burglary charges filed last month after police were called to a Montecito, California, residence to investigate a report of squatters. A contractor who worked on the residence told police he believes the couple caused more than $5,000 in damages in the guest house, and the Quaids were charged with residential burglary. -- A judge issued bench warrants for the arrest of actor Randy Quaid and his wife, Evi, after the couple failed to appear for a court hearing in Santa Barbara, California, Monday morning The Quaids weren't around at the time, but upon their return later that evening the couple told police that they have "owned the property since the 1990s." According to a press release from the Santa Barbara Sheriff's department, a representative for the owner of the property came by the house to check the security alarm because it had gone off earlier that day, and then discovered that someone had been resting their head in the property's guest house.
