Cats are denigrated, treated as less than, relegated to old women and semi-ironic decorations on sweatshirts. Let's hope Tara inspires a generation of cat heroes around the globe -- as well as the rest of us, including those in children's literature and Hollywood -- so we no longer see cats just as lazy, fat Garfield-style layabouts, but ferocious, fierce daredevils. Tara is a hero to cats and cat lovers everywhere, tired of being upstaged by the bigger, brawnier, droolier pets who can't even manage to use a litter box. -- Apparently, cats do rule and dogs drool.
