The alleged letter comes despite a consistent message from the White House and America's top nuclear negotiators that nuclear talks would not be linked to larger regional issues on which Iran may possess greater leverage. Although Iran has given the world plenty of reason to believe that it will simply go about its business as usual after a possible nuclear deal, it seems more likely that the combination of a deal, Rouhani's presidency, and public demand in Iran for real change would offer Washington an opportunity to exact real changes from the regime. According to the Wall Street Journal, Obama pointed out some common American and Iranian interests in defeating the extremist ISIS -- which calls itself the Islamic State -- and reportedly also suggested that a nuclear accord between Iran and the P5+1 (United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China and Germany) could result in cooperation on regional issues between Washington and Tehran. All this suggests that the United States has a real opportunity not only to put the brakes on Iran's nuclear pursuits, but also to bolster larger American goals. And while it is not surprising the letter has upset domestic critics of the negotiations, the alleged correspondence has also unsettled Israel and Saudi Arabia, which fear a "bad" deal with Iran and even secret collusion between Washington and Tehran.
