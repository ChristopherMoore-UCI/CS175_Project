Additional information about the incident was not disclosed, but authorities have bolstered security at the theater and other public areas across New York after two deadly mass shootings in Colorado and Wisconsin. Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN Tuesday, "We take the threat seriously, especially in light of recent attacks in Wisconsin and Colorado." -- Authorities have identified the Twitter user accused of posting violent threats against the Longacre Theater, New York Police Comissioner Ray Kelly said Wednesday. Authorities said the Twitter user posted a threat about an attack at the Longacre Theater in midtown Manhattan, where former boxing champion Mike Tyson, 46, is performing his one-man show, "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth," a Broadway production that centers on his well-publicized life. Authorities' quest this week for personal user information highlights a growing conundrum for companies in the Internet age, when privacy concerns are pitted against those of public safety.
