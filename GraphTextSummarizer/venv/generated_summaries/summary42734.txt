HitFix's Drew McWeeny goes as far as to call "Dawn" one of the best movies of 2014, thanks to its combination of digital expertise and talented direction from Matt Reeves. The follow-up to 2011's surprise hit "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" won't open until July 11, but early reviews and strong box office predictions are setting it up for a splashy debut. In addition to Serkis, who received plenty of praise for his work in "Rise of the Planet of the Apes," "Dawn" also stars Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman and Keri Russell. While McWeeny entered his screening just wanting "a solid and respectful follow-up," what he got instead was "a film that digs deep, that challenges not only the notion of what a studio blockbuster looks like but also how sequels are supposed to work in a commercial world, a movie about real ideas with a spectacular sense of character and mood. ' In this future existence, the apes, led by Andy Serkis' Caesar, have built a functioning society in the woods of California's Bay Area, while humans have suffered a severe blow from a global virus.
