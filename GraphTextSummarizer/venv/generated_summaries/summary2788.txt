The district's marriage bureau says same-sex couples can begin applying for marriage licenses Wednesday. A group of Washington residents had objected to the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Equality Amendment Act, which expands the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples. A $35 application fee is waived for couples who are registered domestic partners, although a $10 fee for the license is not, the bureau said. -- The District of Columbia's same-sex marriage law will go into effect as scheduled this week, after the Supreme Court refused to stop its enforcement. However, by law, "three full days must pass between the day of application to the day that the license can be issued," the bureau, part of the district's superior court system, says on its Web site, so no marriages would be held this week.
