Villa joins an attack which already features world player of the year Lionel Messi, Swedish star Zlatan Ibrahimovic, France captain Thierry Henry and Spanish youngsters Pedro and Bojan Krkic. Meanwhile, club president Joan Laporta has commented on rumors that Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas is to make a return to the club he played for as a youth team player. Another successful season, in which Villa scored 29 goals in all competitions to help Valencia finish third to secure a place in the Champions League, persuaded Barcelona to move once again for the Spanish international striker. Villa scored 107 goals in five seasons for Valencia and lines up alongside Liverpool marksman Fernando Torres in the Spanish national team. Barcelona have signed Spain striker David Villa from league rivals Valencia for $49 million, further boosting an already potent forward line.
