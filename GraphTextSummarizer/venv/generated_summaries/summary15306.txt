" The group, which focuses on reducing government spending, keeps a scorecard of votes it deems important and uses it against members in re-election campaigns. The bill, which would fund the government until mid-December, includes an amendment to arm Syrian rebels to attack ISIS. With the Club removing its pressure on the spending portion of the bill, conservatives who went to Congress to reduce the size of government are free to vote their conscience on the ISIS provisions. Also part of Wednesday's House vote is a measure to extend the authority of the Export-Import Bank, a small government agency that has sparked the ire of tea party conservatives for subsidizing U.S. businesses to conduct international trade. While conservatives are complaining that no one is focused on the bank anymore, the ISIS component of the bill could help House Speaker John Boehner, who supports the bank's extension, to pass it.
