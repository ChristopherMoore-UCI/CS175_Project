"The evidence that we have now developed shows the Pakistani Taliban directed this plot," Attorney General Eric Holder said, describing the investigation into suspect Faisal Shahzad during an appearance on NBC's "Meet the Press." "We know that they helped facilitate it, we know they helped direct it, and I suspect we're going to come up with evidence that shows they helped to finance it," Holder said. Critics have accused the Obama administration of losing interrogation opportunities by giving Miranda warnings to terrorism suspects, including the alleged Christmas Day airplane bomber and Shahzad. Brennan said U.S. counterterrorism efforts had degraded the ability of groups such as al Qaeda and the Taliban to launch successful attacks. Brennan said Shahzad was interrogated for four hours under an exclusion to the Miranda warning involving public safety. "They're trying to find vulnerabilities in our defenses," Brennan said, noting the attempts have been "unsophisticated." Shahzad, a Pakistani-American, had traveled to Pakistan several times in recent years, Brennan said.
