As she began the narrative of their whirlwind romance and 12-year marriage, Boss described how she was charmed by a handsome stranger she knew as Clark Rockefeller, who was host of a party based on the mystery game Clue. Shortly after that revelation, Gerhartsreiter agreed to give Boss full custody of Reigh. In September 2004, Boss transferred to her company's Boston office to cut her commute time so she could spend more time with Reigh. Boss and Reigh moved to London in late December 2007. Boss had always been the sole income earner and said she began to doubt that her husband was really a Rockefeller.
