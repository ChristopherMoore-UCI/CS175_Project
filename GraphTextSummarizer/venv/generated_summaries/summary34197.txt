In an earlier clash Sunday, Sunderland salvaged a 1-1 home draw against second flight north-east neighbors Middlesbrough. Arsenal looked headed out of this year's competition after goals from Richard Dunne and England striker Darren Bent left them trailing. Barry Robson gave Middlesbrough a deserved first half lead, but it was his mistake that allowed Frazier Campbell to score the equalizer on his return after a long-term injury. The winners of their replay will take on Arsenal in the last 16, while Liverpool's reward for knocking bitter rivals Manchester United out of the FA Cup Saturday was a home tie against second-tier Brighton. Tottenham, third in the Premier League, must travel to Stevenage, who play in the third flight, while favorites Chelsea are at home to Birmingham, who won last season's League Cup but were also relegated.
