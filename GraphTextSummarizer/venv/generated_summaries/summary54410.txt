The singer, whose full name is Michael "D'Angelo" Archer, opened up about substance abuse, weight gain and a car crash that kept him out of the public eye and his fans craving new music for years. Fans were hooked, and the song netted D'Angelo a Grammy for best male R&B vocal performance. It's the subtitle of D'Angelo's biggest hit song and a question many are sure to ask the R&B singer after the release of his first album in 14 years. But with club appearances over the last few years, a performance at the BET Awards and a cover set at the Bonnaroo music festival in 2012, D'Angelo has eased back into the spotlight. " "Black Messiah" is D'Angelo's third album in a career that has spanned more than 20 years.
