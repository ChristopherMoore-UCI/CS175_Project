Sony will release 65-inch and a 55-inch versions that can be in homes starting this month, coupled with a video player set for release in June that can show movies produced in 4K. "What 4K allows is for bigger screens to look just as good as they're supposed to and allow consumers to get closer to the TV for a more immersive, home theater experience -- something more similar to what it's like to go to the movies," Manfredo said. " Manfredo said that with fewer consumers purchasing televisions under 40 inches, bigger is becoming standard and the resolution had to improve. Because movies and the movie theater experience has gone in that direction and consumers want that same experience in their homes, it was a logical step for us. The 4K picture starts with the camera, which can capture details better than standard HD cameras. The end product with a 4K camera and television is going to visually be clearer, crisper and more detailed than something shot at 48 frames per second, he says.
