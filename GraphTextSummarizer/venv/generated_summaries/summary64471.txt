The woman has denied the allegation, but several others have come forward to claim that they had sexual relationships with Woods, who has two children with his wife, former model Elin Nordegren. The accident occurred days after the tabloid National Enquirer named Woods as having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess. The controversy prompted several major sponsors to suspend or drop their relationships with Woods, who also apologized to his business partners for his behavior. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions. In a carefully-managed March statement, delivered to a small, hand-picked crowd, Woods said he was in inpatient therapy for 45 days from the end of December to early February for "issues," which he did not explain.
