Unfortunately, the sorority of successful and powerful women who have reportedly been victims of domestic violence includes Halle Berry, Madonna, Whitney Houston, Pamela Anderson,  Mariah Carey, Tina Turner, Meredith Baxter and Rihanna. Domestic violence knows no boundaries, affecting women â€” and some men â€” who meet every descriptor of race, age, socioeconomic or educational status, sexual orientation, demography, geography, ideology, disability or theology. The World Health Organization reports that 15% to 71% of women ages 15 to 49 in a multicountry study had experienced intimate partner violence. Why does the myth that intimate partner violence exists only in lower socioeconomic communities persist? In light of tabloid photographs that show Saatchi holding a tearful Lawson by the neck, it should be clear that intimate partner violence is a universal scourge.
