Worse yet, city pension debt is dwarfed by that of state pension debt. Detroit's bankruptcy is a warning to other cities -- and even states -- that public pension systems are a ticking time bomb with potentially catastrophic consequences. Opinion: Detroit, the 'used to be' city New York City, for instance, is much worse off than Detroit, with some $69.9 billion in pension debts. Next door, New York faces pension debts of $133 billion, while Illinois' clocks in at $167 billion. Unfunded pension debt, which in Detroit stands at $3.5 billion and is roughly one-sixth of the city's total debt, is a national problem that has already put other city and state governments on the same road to insolvency.
