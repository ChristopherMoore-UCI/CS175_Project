By international consensus Israel is not a regime that is guilty of abusing human rights and so is an excellent market for arms exports: the UK agreed licenses worth over Â£10 million just last year, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade. Although it is Ukraine and Gaza that are the current flash-points the main export markets for British arms are the wealthy oil states of the Middle East including Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and UAE where citizens put their lives at risk for merely asserting their basic human rights, and their safety is threatened with arms made in the civilized countries of Western Europe. Export licenses for UK arms exports to Russia increased in the last 12 months at the very time that our prime minister and Foreign Secretary were mouthing meaningless platitudes about getting tough on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Campaign Against Arms Trade recently called for an end to what it labeled "arms control by embarrassment," with governments waiting for catastrophes to occur rather than issuing ethically motivated bans on regimes with a history of abusing human rights. During another debate in Strasbourg last week, where our agenda was dominated by foreign policy I had to watch while the Green motions calling for "a comprehensive UN arms embargo to all parties in the region in order to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and human rights" was expunged by the Grand Coalition demonstrating its commitment to business before morality.
