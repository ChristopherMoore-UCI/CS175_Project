"The OCE has forced members of Congress to take ethics more seriously," said Sloan. We're so glad the OCE brought it.'" In the past, numerous federal lawmakers from both political parties have voted to cut the OCE's budget or limit its powers, including Reps. Mel Watt, D-North Carolina; Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas; John Campbell, R-California; Yvette Clarke, D-New York; Eliot Engel, D-New York; Sam Graves, R-Missouri; Tom Price, R-Georgia; Laura Richardson, D-California; Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi; and Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina. That's because the OCE is the only quasi-independent government body whose sole mandate is to formally investigate members of Congress. It is hard to know whether the stalled fiscal cliff negotiations have sidetracked any effort to reinstate the office, or if members of Congress might be quietly leading an effort to kill the OCE. Whether members of Congress decide to keep the OCE or allow it to dissolve "is a critical test," according to Lee Hamilton, a widely respected former Congressman who chaired the famous 9/11 Commission.
