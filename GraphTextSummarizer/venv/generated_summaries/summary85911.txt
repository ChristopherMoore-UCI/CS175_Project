-- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, who was shot in the head in January, reads aloud a portion of her upcoming audio book, her office said Thursday. Kelly reads aloud the whole book except for the final chapter, which is read by Giffords, spokesman Mark Kimble said. The couple wrote the book together with Wall Street Journal columnist Jeffrey Zaslow. Her book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope," chronicles the relationship between Giffords and her astronaut husband, Mark Kelly. The man charged in the shooting, Jared Loughner, is in mental health treatment and will be re-evaluated early next year to determine his competency to stand trial.
