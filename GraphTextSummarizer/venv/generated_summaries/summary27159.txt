-- A former south Texas prosecutor has been indicted on a felony charge of misusing money from seized property to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses to himself and his staff, state prosecutors announced Wednesday. State law forbids officials from converting money from forfeiture cases to personal use or to supplement salaries without the approval of county commissioners, prosecutors said. Garza served as the chief prosecutor for Jim Wells and Brooks counties in south Texas from 2003 to 2008, when he lost his bid for re-election. Attempts to reach Garza for comment were unsuccessful Wednesday evening. Property seizures are a common tactic in drug cases, but critics have argued the practice can lead to abuse by law enforcement agencies.
