A group of Urban Escapes NYC hikers stops for a snack during an expedition in New York's Harriman State Park. The company offers an array of activities -- from short hiking, sky diving or canoeing trips to international journeys that combine various activities. But one New York City company, offering trips aimed at the young and thrifty, is capitalizing on the urbanite's desire to get away -- and finding success despite the downturn. It also quickly developed a reputation as a great way to meet people and make new friends. There were trips ranging from one-day hiking or fruit-picking excursions priced at around $60 to $800 weeklong international expeditions.
