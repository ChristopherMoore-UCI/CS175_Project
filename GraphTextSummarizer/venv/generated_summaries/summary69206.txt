Claire Williams -- deputy team principal of her father's eponymous race team and another strong female role model in the sport -- explained the team did not need to judge Wolff's driving abilities during her practice debut. The late Maria de Villota, who died in October last year, also began her F1 career along with Wolff when she was signed as a development driver by the Marussia team in 2012. Williams' deputy team principal has also had to deny employing Wolff as the team's development driver was just a publicity stunt. Susie Wolff became the first female since 1992 to take part in an F1 weekend, but after just four laps at Friday's British Grand Prix practice session the 31-year-old Scot had to retire because of an oil pressure problem. " There was also support for Wolff from her British peers at Silverstone -- former world champions Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button.
