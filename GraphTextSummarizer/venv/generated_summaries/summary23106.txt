" "Chase Culpepper is entitled to be himself and to express his gender nonconformity without interference from the South Carolina DMV," said Michael Silverman, the executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund. The suit alleges the employees have interpreted it "to prohibit a male applicant from wearing regular everyday makeup that they allow female applicants to wear under the same policy. Chase should be able to get a driver's license without being subjected to sex discrimination," Silverman said Tuesday at a joint press conference with Culpepper and his mother. The employee told Chase he couldn't wear "a disguise" and didn't look "like a boy should," the teen told CNN affiliate WYFF. Calls and emails to the state DMV communications office were not immediately returned late Tuesday.
