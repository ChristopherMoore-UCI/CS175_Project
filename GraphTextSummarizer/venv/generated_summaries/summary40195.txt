The focus of the NRA campaign is Colorado State Senate President John Morse. The NRA would not comment publicly, deferring to local Colorado gun activists involved in the petition drive. With gun control efforts stalled in Washington following the failure of a proposal in the Senate to expand background checks, the move in Colorado suggests that the fight is now turning to the states. In a mailer obtained by CNN, the NRA Political Victory fund wrote to a "Second Amendment Supporter" in Colorado that "your NRA is coordinating a recall effort with the Basic Freedom Defense Fund to put Senator Morse on the ballot for a special election and vote him out of office." Some political observers suggest that these local battles over gun laws could end up gaining the type of attention, fundraising and ferocity that marked the failed 2012 recall election of GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.
