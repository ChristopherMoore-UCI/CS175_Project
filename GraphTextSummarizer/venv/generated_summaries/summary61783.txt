The four artists were on the cusp of the radical Cubist movement in the early 1900s, a period underrepresented in the Met's current exhibition encompassing more than 5,000 years of art history, according to museum officials. In a news release, the museum said Lauder's collection, "unsurpassed in the number of masterpieces and iconic works critical to the development of Cubism," will fill the spaces where representations of modern art had been lacking. The collection will be presented for the first time in an exhibit due to open in the fall of 2014, according to museum officials. He said he chose the Met because "it's essential that Cubism -- and the art that follows it for that matter -- be seen and studied within the collections of one of the greatest encyclopedic museums in the world." Lauder has long been entwined with New York City's art institutions, serving as president and chairman of the Whitney Museum of American Art, as well as various committees at the Met since the 1980s.
