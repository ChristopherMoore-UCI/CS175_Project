But in sports, someone giving up some time for free and winning some games --  while being entirely unqualified to be around young people --  is vaunted. A recent UK study (PDF) suggests that 75% of young people experience psychologically harmful treatment in sport. We believe that coaches always have the best interests of our young people at heart and that everything they do on the side of that court, field, pool or track is for the long-term, holistic benefit of young people. As coaches and educators, we participate in the creation of indelible memories for young people. Coaches need to stop bullying and start mentoring,  educating and inspiring young people.
