Li, who became Asia's first grand slam singles champion when she triumphed at the 2011 French Open, remains on course for a semifinal meeting with Sharapova, provided she can progress from her round four match with 18th seed Julia Goerges. Spain's Ferrer recorded a 6-4 6-2 6-3 win over 2006 finalist Marcos Baghdatis, while Berdych of the Czech Republic eased to a 6-3 6-2 6-2 success against Austrian Jurgen Melzer. Second seed Maria Sharapova dropped just four games on Friday as she swept aside six-time grand slam winner Venus Williams 6-1 6-3 in the third round of the Australian Open. Next up for the defending champion is Switzerland Stanislas Wawrinka after the No. 15 got the better of American Sam Querrey. In the men's draw, top seed Novak Djokovic was made to work on his way to a 6-4 6-3 7-5 win against Czech Radek Stepanek.
