At long last, "Breaking Bad" fans got to see the first episode of "Better Call Saul" on Sunday night. Then we flashed back to 2002 to see Jimmy McGill -- as Saul used to be known -- struggling to keep clients and pay the bills between issues with his brother, Chuck, and some skateboarding twins who reminded him of his con-artist days. When Jimmy teamed up with the twins to basically bribe a potential client into signing with him, things went horribly awry, with a hit-and-run and Jimmy ultimately taken at gunpoint, a cliffhanger to be resolved on Monday night's episode. " Much of it rests on the performance of Odenkirk as Jimmy, and he delivered an Emmy-worthy performance here. The spinoff's much-hyped premiere started off slowly, with a downright depressing look at a defeated Saul (Bob Odenkirk), working at a Cinnabon, reminiscing about the good old days of his law firm.
