"Our projections for what we are seeing is that, with climate change, many of these types of droughts will likely last for 20, 30, even 40 years," said NASA climate scientist Ben Cook. It examined past wet and dry periods using tree rings going back 1,000 years and compared them with soil moisture from 17 climate models, NASA said in the study published in Science Advances. That's worse and  longer than the historic Dust Bowl of the 1930s, when "black blizzards" -- towering, blustery dust walls -- buried Southern Plains homes, buggies and barns in dirt dunes. If NASA's worst case scenario plays out, what's to come could be worse. Those regions have suffered severe drought in recent years.
