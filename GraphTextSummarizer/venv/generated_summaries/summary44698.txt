The operation was a success and a majority of those in the park cooperated with police, park police spokesman David Schlosser said. The move comes after a federal judge Tuesday rejected an Occupy DC demonstrator's request to keep park police from enforcing a ban on camping in McPherson park and nearby Freedom Plaza. On Saturday, police began removing the tents from the park that had camping gear inside. -- Dressed in yellow full-body sanitation suits, members of the U.S. Park Police combed through tents in the Occupy DC camp Saturday, taking down ones violating park policies. Authorities told protesters Monday that they had to remove camping gear such as sleeping bags and housekeeping materials, but could keep their tents as long as one flap remains open at all times.
