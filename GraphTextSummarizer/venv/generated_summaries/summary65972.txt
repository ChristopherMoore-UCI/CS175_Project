"We just ran and hid in the closet," Tina Clark told CNN after one of a swarm of tornadoes descended Wednesday night into their neighborhood in Hood County, 30 miles southwest of Fort Worth, Texas. Some of the patients underwent amputations, said Dr. Kerri Sistrunk, head of the trauma unit at Lake Granbury Medical Center. -- Tina and Billy Clark saw the funnel cloud approaching and did what many of their neighbors did. "I was holding the door shut," Billy Clark told CNN. "Once we turned the corner and got up the street a little bit, I mean, just everything was destroyed," said Billy Clark.
