At a Romney event Wednesday night, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley chided fellow Republicans for making an issue of Romney's business past. -- Mitt Romney arrived Wednesday in South Carolina as the clear front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, while his rivals campaigned across the state to try to halt the former Massachusetts governor's momentum after his victory the day before in New Hampshire. " "Yesterday's primary couldn't have happened soon enough for him because his support in the state was rapidly eroding," Wasserman Schultz said "As I watched it erode, it seemed to me the more people got to know Mitt Romney the less they liked him." Romney seemed unconcerned in an interview Wednesday on CNN. Next on the primary calendar is the January 21 primary in South Carolina, where Romney's five opponents are counting on the state's social conservatism and reputation for brass-knuckle political brawls to help their cause. Romney is hoping a combination of momentum, campaign cash, growing establishment support and a fractured opposition will lead to a victory not only in South Carolina but also in Florida at the end of the month.
