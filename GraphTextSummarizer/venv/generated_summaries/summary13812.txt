-- A suicide bomber has attacked and killed Bilal Shaikh, the security chief of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, Police Superintendent Raja Umer Khitab said. "It's not known if Mr. Shaikh had received any threats, but he was definitely the target of this attack," Khitab told CNN. Khitab told CNN that his early assessment is that the bomber was on foot and approached the passenger window where Shaikh was sitting and set off the bomb. The attack happened as Shaikh's car pulled up to buy fruit from a roadside stall in Karachi, Khitab said. Shaikh's vehicle was bullet proof, so Khitab believes the shock wave of the blast killed the security chief.
