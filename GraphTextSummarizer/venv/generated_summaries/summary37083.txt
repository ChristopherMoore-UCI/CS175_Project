Princess Cristina will be the first direct member of Spain's royal family to testify in court while facing preliminary charges for a crime, Spain's royal household confirmed. The youngest daughter of Spain's King Juan Carlos won't appeal preliminary charges against her for alleged financial crimes, and will give unprecedented testimony before a judge on February 8, a court and her lawyers said Monday. In April, the magistrate brought preliminary charges against the princess in this case, but they were dropped in May after prosecutors appealed to a provincial court, citing insufficient evidence. Her husband, Inaki Urdangarin, the King's son-in-law, already faces preliminary charges in the same case. But Castro continued his investigation and on Tuesday, in a 227-page order, again leveled preliminary charges against her.
