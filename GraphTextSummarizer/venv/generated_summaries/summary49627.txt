The 32-year-old Li has never gone beyond the last 32 in eight appearances at the All England Club and also went out in the first round of the French Open last month. Defending champion Andy Murray wasted little time on Centre Court later as he polished off Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain in their third round clash. Australian Open champion Li Na bowed meekly out of Wimbledon Friday to extend her miserable record at the grass court grand slam, blaming her lack of preparation for a shock defeat. But given a second chance of redemption on a replayed match point, Li served her seventh double fault to exit in lame fashion. After her defeat, Li told reporters that she had made an error of judgment in skipping the warmup event at Eastbourne.
