I hope we can together create a good future and career for this young woman," Westin Dhaka Hotel General Manager Azeem Shah said of 19-year-old Reshma. Reshma surprised searchers and workers clearing rubble at the collapsed Rana Plaza building when she cried out for help in a faint voice more than two weeks after the nine-story structure fell, killing 1,130 people and injuring more than 2,400. Reshma had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since her rescue on May 10, and she accepted the new job in the housekeeping department of the Starwood Hotels and Resorts facility when she was released Thursday. "I am really happy to join here," Reshma told reporters at the hotel, where she met with media.
