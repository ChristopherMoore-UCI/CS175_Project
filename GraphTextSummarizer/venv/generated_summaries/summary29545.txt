Instead of Columbus Day, cities celebrate Indigenous People's Day Columbus was stubborn. Columbus didn't know that his voyage would spread diseases across the continents, of course, but disease wasn't the only problem. So if your child comes home in the leadup to Columbus Day, like mine did, full of praise for the explorer's bravery and vision, that's a fine place to start, even if he didn't really "discover" the Americas or figure out that the Earth was round. The story goes that Columbus had to persevere against the odds to get support for his venture, because everyone but him believed the Earth was flat. I asked that question of William Phillips, professor of history at the University of Minnesota and co-author of "The Worlds of Christopher Columbus," and of LeAnne Howe, the Eidson Professor in American Literature at the University of Georgia and an enrolled member of the Choctaw Nation.
