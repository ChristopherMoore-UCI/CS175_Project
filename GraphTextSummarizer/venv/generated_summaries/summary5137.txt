I've written about my experiences interviewing Jobs for Time magazine here, but the first time I ever spoke to him was a prime example of his mainstream approach. Thousands of people use PCs at home, but they're mostly hobbyists and amateur programmers. This was shortly after his return to Apple, in an interview for a now-defunct supplement called Time Digital. -- Just imagine, for a moment, a world in which Steve Jobs had never lived. Many words have been written attempting to distill the magic of Steve Jobs.
