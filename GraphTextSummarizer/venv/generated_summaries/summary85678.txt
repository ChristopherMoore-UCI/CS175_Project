Cuban officials have said they wish to discuss the case of the Cuban agents and that of jailed U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross, who was sentenced in 2011 to 15 years in prison after being convicted of importing banned communications equipment to Cuba. The five were part of a network of agents in South Florida that the Cuban government said was gathering intelligence to prevent terrorist attacks against Cuba. In 1996, four members of Brothers to the Rescue were killed after they were shot down by Cuban fighter jets as the group's planes headed toward the island to drop anti-government leaflets. Last year, "Cuban Five" member Rene Gonzalez returned to Cuba after completing his prison sentence. He has been treated as a hero by Cuba's state media and has led the media campaign to free the other intelligence agents.
