Atlanta also is under a flash flood warning until Thursday evening, and flooding is possible across much of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. -- A Missouri woman was killed in the state's flash flooding Thursday as inclement weather hammers several states in what forecasters predict will be a particularly nasty storm season. As rescue teams were performing 18 "swift water rescues" in McDonald County, Missouri, Thursday morning, the woman -- thought to be in her 60s -- was driving over a bridge when she was caught up in "rapidly rising waters," said Gregg Sweeten, the county's emergency management director. Forecasters warn that areas along the Gasconade River could see record water levels, and widespread flooding is expected to continue in Missouri and Kansas into the weekend. Southern Missouri has witnessed widespread flash flooding as parts of 12 Midwestern and Eastern states experienced some sort of flood watch or warning Thursday.
