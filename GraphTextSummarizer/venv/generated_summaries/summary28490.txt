As part of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, Medicare extended health coverage to seniors who inevitably needed care. It's unconscionable that in the richest nation on Earth, health disparities linger because ordinary people can't obtain good care. We can fund the plan by preserving how we pay for health care and asking our very well-off to contribute a little more. As Sanders said, "The United States is the only major nation in the industrialized world that does not guarantee health care as a right to its people." What America is doing on health care isn't working for either men or women.
