Prospects looked somewhat grim for "Hope" when it earned a quiet $4.5 million over Wednesday and Thursday, but the film's overwhelmingly older female audience (66 percent were women, 69 percent were 40 or older), who aren't all relaxing on their summer breaks, turned out in higher volumes for weekend engagements. Due to heavy competition, Warner Bros.' other big release, "The Dark Knight Rises," slipped into third place with $19.5 million, a 45 percent drop from last weekend. After four frames, Christopher Nolan's $250 million Batman finale has soared to $390.1 million, and it will pass "The Hunger Games' " $407.3 million cume to become 2012â€²s second-highest-grossing domestic performer next weekend. The action film debuted higher than franchise launchpad "The Bourne Identity," which grossed $27.1 million in its 2002 opening weekend, but it will need solid word of mouth (which may not be merited by its lukewarm "B" CinemaScore grade) to match that film's $121.7 million finish. American audiences have never been particularly receptive to political comedies.
