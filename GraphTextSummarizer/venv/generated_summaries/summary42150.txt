-- Famed Indian spiritual guru Sri Sathya Sai Baba was laid to rest Wednesday as hundreds of thousands of followers bid a tearful farewell to the ascetic they revered as a living god. On Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Italian-born head of his Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, paid their tribute as they filed past the guru's saffron-robed body placed in a glass casket and sat beside it as a mark of respect. Recognizable with his trademark puff of dark hair, Sri Sathya Sai Baba claimed to be a reincarnation of Sai Baba of Shirdi, one of India's greatest spiritual leaders, who died in 1918. In his condolence message on the day Sri Sathya Sai Baba died, Singh remembered the spiritual leader for inspiring millions to lead a meaningful life regardless of their religions. Sri Sathya Sai Baba died Sunday at age 85 of respiratory failure.
