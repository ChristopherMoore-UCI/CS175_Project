The bus crashed about 5:30 a.m. near the town of Espinar, Peru, Lt. Edilberto Tunquipa of the Espinar fire department said. The bus holds 52 people, Tunquipa said, but it was overcrowded, with people standing in the aisle. The exact number of people on the bus remained unknown. -- At least 40 people died and 20 were injured early Thursday morning when a bus plunged into a ravine in a mountainous region near Cuzco, Peru, authorities said. No international tourists were believed to be on the bus, though authorities could not confirm that, Tunquipa said.
