-- American Airlines, already grappling with union issues and bankruptcy fallout, is now confronting a third problem: growing reports of loose seats. The Federal Aviation Administration is looking into the incidents of loose seats, which are the latest in a string of woes for American Airlines. Meanwhile, Robert Gless, deputy director of the Air Transport Division of the Transport Workers Union of America, dismissed the notion that the problems with loose seats were linked to labor issues as "without any basis in fact. On Tuesday, the company said another flight had experienced loose seats, bringing the total to three flights on two planes in a week. So far, American Airlines has inspected at least 36 planes and found that six -- including the two involved in the recent diversions -- had seats that were not properly secured.
