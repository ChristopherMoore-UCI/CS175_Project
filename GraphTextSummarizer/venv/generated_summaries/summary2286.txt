Chinese officials provided the Olympic committee with passports, showing that team members were of legal age, but numerous challenges have been made. -- The International Olympic Committee has asked gymnastics officials to look into whether China's women's gymnastics team used underaged competitors In women's gymnastics, younger teenage girls can have an advantage over older competitors due to their often smaller, more agile bodies and lighter frames. "According to online sports registration lists in China, half the team - He Kexin, Yang Yilin, Jiang Yuyuan - would be under age," the Times reported in July. The committee asked the International Gymnastics Federation to clarify the situation, said spokeswoman Giselle Davis.
