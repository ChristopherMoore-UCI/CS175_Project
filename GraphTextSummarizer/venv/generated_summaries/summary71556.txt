Despite the long history of DES research, the "vast majority" of health professionals working today know very little about the drug, says Candy Tedeschi, a nurse practitioner in Great Neck, N.Y., who worked for 20 years in a state screening center for DES daughters operated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Later that decade, however, doctors connected the drug to a rare form of vaginal cancer that was turning up in young women exposed to DES in the womb. Compared with a control group of unexposed women, DES daughters were found to have higher rates of infertility (33% versus 16%), miscarriage (50% versus 39%), preterm delivery (53% versus 18%), and ectopic pregnancy (15% versus 3%). (Fifty-three DES daughters who developed breast cancer have brought a lawsuit against several DES manufacturers; the lawsuit is currently under way in Boston.)
