Park will also miss Saturday's FA Cup fifth-round match with non-league minnows Crawley Town as well as Premier League trips to Wigan, Chelsea and Liverpool, but may be back in time for the second leg against the French champions on March 15. "It was very unfortunate because it was his last kick of the ball in training," team manager Alex Ferguson told the club's website on Tuesday. In better news for United, Ecuador winger Antonio Valencia is back in training after breaking his ankle in a Champions League match against Scottish side Rangers in September. Park was part of the South Korea squad which reached the semifinals of January's Asian Cup before losing to eventual champions Japan. Park injured a hamstring injury on Friday ahead of the Manchester derby, and will now miss United's European Champions League last-16 clash with Marseille in France on February 23.
