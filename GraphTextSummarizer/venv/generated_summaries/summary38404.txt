"He doesn't watch TV or anything else," El Deeb said in his first interview since the Mubarak family hired him in April. El Deeb denied that Mubarak, his family and friends amassed fortunes at the expense of the Egyptian people. Transferring Mubarak to Tora is not an option because the prison hospital does not have a proper intensive care unit, he said. The former leader is in "very bad health," suffering from a serious heart problem and a resurgence of colon cancer, attorney Farid El Deeb said. -- Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is "very sad and sorry" that he is accused of ordering that live ammunition be fired on protesters, but he has no regrets, his lawyer told CNN Sunday.
