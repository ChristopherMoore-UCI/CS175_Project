-- Cairo's main square Saturday overflowed with people angry that six former government aides were acquitted of charges of killing hundreds of pro-democracy protesters last year, while former strongman Hosni Mubarak was ordered to prison. Mohamed Morsi is facing secularist Ahmed Shafik, a former official in Mubarak's regime. Human Rights Watch said the verdict sends a message to Egypt's future leaders that they are not above the law, though it said the acquittals give "a green light to future police abuse." Amnesty International described the verdict as "a significant step towards combating long-standing impunity in Egypt," but it, too, said the ruling leaves many waiting for full justice. Protesters in the square, the center of last year's protests, waved Egyptian flags as they demanded justice for those killed and injured during last year's demonstrations. Timeline of Mubarak's ascent and fall from power The White House had no comment on Mubarak's sentencing, while a U.S. State Department official, not authorized to speak on the record, described it as "a decision made by the Egyptian judiciary according to the Egyptian legal process" and referred further questions to the Egyptian government.
