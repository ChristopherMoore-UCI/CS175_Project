"The engineering team and the rappelling team, a combination of people from Denali National Park in Alaska as well as from an engineering firm, will come out of the windows at the 500-foot level," said Bill Line, spokesman for the National Park Service. They will install climbing ropes and safety lines on all four sides, then clip onto those lines, Vogel said. Officials need to "get up close" and search for possible damage, Line said. "The heaviest damage appears to be concentrated at the very top of the monument, in what is called the pyramidion, where large cracks of up to 1-1/4 inch wide developed through stone and mortar joints," said Bob Vogel, superintendent of the National Mall and Memorial Parks. Daylight is visible through some of the cracks, and rain water has gotten into the monument, which could cause further damage.
