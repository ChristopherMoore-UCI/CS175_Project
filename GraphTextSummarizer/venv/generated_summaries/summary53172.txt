Heiress' death a mystery City authorities say they are investigating what could be new evidence in the killing of Fox, although they remained cautious, saying the find could pose any number of possibilities and is potentially unrelated to her death. Dana Balicki, a spokesman for Occupy Wall Street, said authorities had not contacted organizers of the movement about the new find, and that the group was unaware of the investigation. DNA found on a chain used by protesters believed to be aligned with the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York appears to be a "similar profile" to DNA recovered in the unsolved murder of a Julliard student in 2004, according to a source with knowledge of the case. There currently is no definitive forensic match between DNA recently found on the chain and DNA on a compact disc player believed to have belonged to Sarah Fox, which was recovered in 2004, the source said. Her roommate told authorities she was last seen leaving their apartment with her keys and a pink portable CD player.
