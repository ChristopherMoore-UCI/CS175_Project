A landmark report on Arab societies by the U.N. Development Program in 2002 concluded: "This freedom deficit undermines human development and is one of the most painful manifestations of lagging political development." And in a majority of Arab countries, the power of the state remains formidable if not overwhelming. The overthrow of three men does not change the basic dilemmas faced by the Arab world: illiteracy, unemployment, a youth bulge (the United Nations estimates that Arab countries will need 50 million new jobs by 2020), chronic water shortages, a lack of women's rights, the legacy of the "freedom deficit" -- to which perhaps add now a burgeoning crisis of expectations. " Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri (no friend of the Syria regime) said: "Any Arab citizen, watching the course of events in Libya, cannot but think of the popular revolutionary movement that is taking place in Syria." But one of the few characteristics Arab states have long shared is the "freedom deficit," the product of decades of authoritarian rule.
