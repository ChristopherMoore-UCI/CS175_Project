This was the department where he first started his career as a lawyer in the public corruption unit in 1976, and where he has served 26 years, including as deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration, and for a few days as acting attorney general under President George W. Bush. -- Attorney General Eric Holder strode in to a raucously triumphant welcome at Justice Department headquarters on cold, sunny February morning in 2009, less than a month after the inauguration of President Barack Obama. That makes his record on civil liberties more complicated than his record on civil rights issues, critics argue. President Obama hailed Holder's role in the administration's decision to stop defending the federal ban on recognizing same-sex marriages, which has opened the way to some of the most sweeping changes in gay rights. One of Holder's heroes is Robert F. Kennedy, who used the Justice Department to push the agenda of civil rights.
