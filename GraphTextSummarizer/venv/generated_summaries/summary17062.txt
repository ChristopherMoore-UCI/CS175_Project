On Friday, the federal attorney general said the grave -- a shallow grave covered by concrete at an eco park in a state neighboring Mexico City -- contained 13 bodies. -- At least five of the bodies found this week in a shallow grave near Mexico City are those of teens who were kidnapped from a bar three months ago, Mexico's attorney general said Friday. The site is in the town of Tlalmanalco, in the state of Mexico, about 30 miles east of Mexico City, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Five of them were those of youths who'd been taken from the Mexico City club, the attorney general said. The May 26 incident at the after-hours bar shocked residents of Mexico City, who for the most part have been spared from the violence seen in other areas.
