A general in charge of the "Morale Affairs Directorate" of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said on television that "Nabil had used 'inappropriate language' and defamed the military, and that his calls for an end to military conscription would have a negative effect on the youth of Egypt," according to Human Rights Watch. Ramadan told Human Rights Watch that when lawyers went to the court complex Monday "they saw on the court roll that the court had already sentenced Nabil the day before." Human Rights Watch, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information and Ramadan said the military told defense attorneys that there would be no court session on the day he was sentenced. Human Rights Watch and the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information said the Egyptian news media has not been bold on covering reports of torture by the military over the past two months. Human Rights Watch said the judge had announced last Wednesday that he would rule Sunday after defense lawyers finished their pleadings.
