Robert Meyers told HLN's Nancy Grace on Thursday that the man threatened to kill his wife and daughter. On Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. The father defended the family against criticism that they should have gone into the house when mother and daughter arrived after the road rage incident. The captain said authorities were unaware until Thursday that the Meyers family knew Nowsch. Robert Meyers, who was out of town when his wife was shot, said the other car followed the Meyers and at some point away from the house there were gunshots.
