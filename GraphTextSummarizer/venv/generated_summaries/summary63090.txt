"In all settings and for diverse types of epidemics, it is clear that programs to prevent new infections among these key populations must constitute an important part of national AIDS responses." While the decline in new infections is welcome, "if we do a better job of getting resources and programs to where they will make most impact, quicker progress can be made and more lives saved," said Michael Sidibe, executive director of UNAIDS in Geneva, Switzerland. In addition, the number of people living with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, has increased, and over the last five years, AIDS deaths have declined by 10 percent, thanks to antiretroviral drug therapy and access to lifesaving treatments, said the report by the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization. In Eastern Europe, a region that had seen a dramatic increase in new infections among intravenous drug users, "the epidemic has leveled off considerably," the report said. -- New HIV infections have fallen worldwide by 17 percent over the past eight years, a testament to prevention efforts, according to a U.N. report released Tuesday.
