Avery Lynn Canahuati, who was born in November with spinal muscular atrophy type 1, died of pulmonary complications related to the genetic disorder, Mike Canahuati said on the blog Tuesday. Writing in the first person as if his daughter were the author, Canahuati created new bucket list entries during the week on the family's averycan.blogspot.com website or their "Avery's Bucket List" Facebook page. Canahuati wrote Monday that there were two items he could now scratch off Avery's "bucket list": 1. The infant's parents had written the blog as though Avery would make it past age 2 and experience life's milestones as a healthy girl. "Avery's passing this quickly came as a complete shock to all of us, as she had just been given a thumbs up at her last doctors appointment only three days ago," her father wrote Tuesday.
