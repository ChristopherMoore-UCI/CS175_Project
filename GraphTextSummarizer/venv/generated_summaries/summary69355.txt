-- Veteran British broadcaster David Frost, best known for his series of interviews with disgraced U.S. President Richard Nixon, has died. Frost's interviews with Nixon, and the story behind them, were portrayed in the play and film "Frost/Nixon," written by Peter Morgan. More than 30 years later, Frost remembered Nixon as a surprisingly awkward figure who, while once discussing what they'd done the previous evening, asked the host, "Did you do any fornicating?" "It was amazing to discover how ... hopeless he was at small talk," Frost told CNN. Charlie Courtauld worked with Frost in his later years at Al Jazeera English. In a 2011 interview with CNN, Frost praised former U.S. President George H.W. Bush.
