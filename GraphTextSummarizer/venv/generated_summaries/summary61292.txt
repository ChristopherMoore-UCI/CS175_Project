It's one of the series of the popular Rocky films starring Sylvester Stallone, who played boxer Rocky Balboa. -- Tommy Morrison, a former heavyweight boxing champion who starred in the "Rocky V" film, died, his former promoter told CNN. Morrison died at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital Sunday night with his wife at his side, Tony Holden said. Morrison was interviewed by Larry King from Holden's living room on February 1996 -- the night he announced he had tested positive for HIV. Holden, who said he spoke with Morrison or his wife several times a week for the past year, would not comment on the cause of his death or the state of his health in recent months.
