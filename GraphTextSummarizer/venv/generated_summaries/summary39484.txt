"Several other incidents with chapters or members have been brought to the attention of the headquarters ... and each of those instances will be investigated," the national office said in a statement. SAE's university chapter denied the allegations, saying an investigation determined the culprits were not members of the fraternity. University of Washington students are accusing fraternity members of offensive comments during a protest to raise awareness about racism last month. Jones told a news conference that he had been retained by the board of trustees -- the alumni advisers for the chapter -- "to assist them in evaluating certain legal issues and other matters that may impact local chapter of SAE." "People were called monkeys and apes by members of SAE," said Maggie Negussie, president of the  university's Black Student Union.
