A virtual parking lot of vehicles filled with woman and young children, the two-lane road was choked with dust and engine exhaust as Iraqi civilians fled the rapid advance of the militant Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, an al Qaeda splinter group also known by its acronym ISIS. That unraveling began in earnest on Tuesday as Iraqi security forces fled and militants overran Iraq's second-largest city in a stunning collapse that heightened questions about  al-Maliki's ability to control not only Mosul, but the entire country. A spokesman for the U.N.'s High Commissioner for Human Rights reported summary executions of Iraqi security forces and of 17 civilians thought to be working for the police in Mosul. One such airstrike came against a former Iraqi military base south of Mosul where ISIS militants were believed to the staying. Additionally, Shia religious leaders and others have called for volunteers to join Iraqi security forces in the fight.
