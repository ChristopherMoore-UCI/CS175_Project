The attack on Timbuktu's cultural heritage is an attack against this history and the values it carries -- values of tolerance, exchange and living together, which lie at the heart of Islam. Militants from the Ansar Dine group, which controls much of northern Mali, have started to destroy Timbuktu's ancient tombs. We know also the power of World Heritage to bring together divided communities and promote international cooperation in difficult contexts. Attacks against cultural heritage are attacks against the very identity of communities. Culture has today a central role in peace building and conflict prevention.
