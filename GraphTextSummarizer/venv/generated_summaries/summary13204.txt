" Dawson is survived by his two sons with Dors, Mark and Gary, along with his wife Gretchen, their daughter Shannon and four grandchildren, Gary Dawson said. At one point, when Johnny Carson was considering retiring as host of "The Tonight Show," Dawson was considered as a replacement, and hosted the show for a week, Gary Dawson said. -- Richard Dawson, the longtime host of "Family Feud" known for planting kisses on female contestants, has died, his son said in a statement Sunday. In the Archive of American Television interview, Dawson discussed meeting his second wife, Gretchen Johnson, when she was a contestant on "Family Feud." "I knew there was just something about this young lady and myself," he said. I kissed black women daily and nightly (on "Family Feud") for 11 years and the world didn't come to an end, did it?" Dawson and his first wife, British actress Diana Dors, had divorced in the late 1960s, according to his son.
