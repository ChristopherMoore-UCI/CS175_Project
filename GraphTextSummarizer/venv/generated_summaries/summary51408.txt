Toronto resident Lee Moir, 34, was arrested after police posed as a young girl and arranged to meet him. Charges against Moir in Canada include luring, manufacturing child pornography and extortion, according to Toronto police. Working with information from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office, Toronto Police Services became involved and engaged in sexual conversations with Moir while posing as a 14-year-old girl, according to the prosecutor's office. Authorities said they believe Moir has been in contact with numerous girls in the United States, Canada, France, Australia and the Philippines using accounts on Facebook and the video chat site ooVoo, the prosecutor's office said. The 12-year-old girl and her family live in New Jersey, where Essex County Assistant Prosecutor John Laurino said the girl believed Moir was Bieber and started a relationship with him, e-mailing back and forth.
