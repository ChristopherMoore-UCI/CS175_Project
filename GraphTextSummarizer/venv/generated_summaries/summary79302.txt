The scientific team at Tanzania's Ifakara Health Institute has developed a potent serum -- similar to that of human foot odor -- to lure and kill mosquitoes, which can carry malaria and other diseases. Okumu, who is currently completing a PhD from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in England, plans to develop the mosquito landing boxes over the next two years, thanks to a $775,000 joint grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the not-for profit organization Grand Challenges Canada. Four times more powerful in attracting mosquitoes than natural human odor, the synthetic smell is now being used in a pioneering research program aimed at killing mosquitoes outdoors using a "mosquito landing box." "We know mosquitoes don't see people, they smell them." "For example, instead of going into houses to bite people, mosquitoes are now starting to wait to bite people outside," he said.
