"Our motto is 'aroma tells a thousand pictures'", says Dr. David Edwards, biomedical engineer at Harvard and founder of Le Laboratoire, known for producing radical sensory devices such as calorie-free chocolate spray. Edwards plans to feature 'smell emoticons' and viral stunts, and may offer a mixing deck that allows overlap with music production software. Every human has thousands of distinct smell sensors, Edwards explains, a resource he taps with his newest invention the oPhone. MIT electrical engineer Eyal Shahar designed containers for them that release when heated by the touch of a button, but cool quickly to keep smells distinct and localized, a historic difficulty with the much-mocked smell-o-vision experiments in cinema. The faith is grounded on the acknowledged influence of smell on the subconscious, and the potential to learn its secrets.
