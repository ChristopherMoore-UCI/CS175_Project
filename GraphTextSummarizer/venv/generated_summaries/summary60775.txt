But FSU Athletics Director Stan Wilcox increased the sophomore's punishment late Friday after hearing eyewitness accounts that differed from Winston's initial version, a source close to the situation told CNN's Rachel Nichols. As part of a civil citation for alleged shoplifting -- an alternative to criminal prosecution for first-time, nonviolent offenses in Leon County -- Winston was not arrested but was ordered to serve at least 20 hours of community service, authorities said. Redshirt sophomore Sean Maguire replaced Winston for the defending national champions (2-0) against Clemson (1-1). The witnesses told FSU officials that Winston was standing on a table while shouting the phrase -- something Winston initially denied, the source said. Winston made headlines again in April when he was accused of shoplifting crab legs and crawfish from a Publix supermarket in Tallahassee.
