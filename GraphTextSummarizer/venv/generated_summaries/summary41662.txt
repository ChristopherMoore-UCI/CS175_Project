Earlier, Pelosi repeatedly said she wants to see a "grand bargain" -- the catch-all term for a major deficit reduction package that includes some combination of tax reform, spending cuts and entitlement reforms. It pointed out that bipartisan commissions have already drawn up plans that reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts and new revenue, but the group didn't endorse any one formula. -- President Barack Obama and congressional leaders wrapped up their first "fiscal cliff" meeting since the election Friday with a confident tone that had both sides suggesting an agreement could be reached before January 1, when hefty federal spending cuts and tax raises are scheduled to take effect. Ahead of the meeting, members of the New Democrat Coalition, a group of centrists, sent a letter to Obama, Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. But when asked what kind of entitlement changes she could accept, she said those programs should be dealt with separately from discussions about tax cuts.
