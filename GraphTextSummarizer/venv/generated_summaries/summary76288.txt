Adhamiya, in Baghdad's northeastern area, used to be controlled by al Qaeda in Iraq fighters. Turkey has been going after PKK bases just over its border with northern Iraq, where the group has been staging cross-border attacks. In another development, Turkish warplanes late Wednesday bombed three villages in northern Iraq where Kurdish rebels were thought to be based, a border security officer said Thursday. The strikes -- the latest by the Turkish military against Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) militants -- occurred in the Zab region of Duhuk province in Iraq's Kurdish region. The brigades are a former nationalist insurgent group turned into an Awakening group, fighting al Qaeda in Iraq.
