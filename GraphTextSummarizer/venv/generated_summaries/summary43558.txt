"This is a disgusting tide of litter which is threatening the safety of beach visitors both human and animal.

Of those tackled by MCS volunteers, the cleanest was identified as Langland Bay, near the Welsh city of Swansea, which yielded just a quarter of a sack of trash. From craggy cliffs to broad sandy beaches, Britain is rightly proud of its thousands of miles of shoreline.
