"He is one the most notorious drug lords and was on a list of the Top 24 drug traffickers in all of Mexico" said another DEA official, who asked not to be identified because officials were still gathering preliminary information. Mexican federal police, assisted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, made the arrest in the city of La Paz, Mexico, the capital of the state of Baja California Sur, DEA spokesman Michael Sanders said. Garcia Simental is accused of more than 300 murders, most of them since he split from the Tijuana-based Arellano-Felix organization in April 2008, Federal Police Section Chief Ramon Eduardo Pequeno said. Once he split from the Arellano-Felix cartel, Garcia Simental continued to operate a drug trafficking organization in Tijuana with the help of rival cartels. Garcia Simental is accused of disposing of 300 body parts by dipping them in acid, Pequeno said.
