-- U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and her youngest daughter, Sasha, 9, arrived Wednesday on Spain's southern Mediterranean coast for a vacation with friends at a luxury hotel here. Before then, many people in old town Marbella -- with its winding narrow streets and white-washed walls, and in nearby chic Puerto Banus, where large yachts are moored -- were hoping Obama would come for a visit. "We are really amazed about her choosing our hotel and coming down to the south of Spain, paying us such a wonderful visit at the best time of the year," said Alicia Villapadierna, co-owner of the Hotel Villa Padierna, where Obama and her entourage are staying. Her husband, hotel co-owner Ricardo Arranz, said Obama apparently chose the hotel on the recommendation of friends who had visited before. The Obama group is expected to occupy 60 to 70 rooms, more than a third of the lodging at the 160-room resort, which consists of hotel rooms, suites and separate villas.
