-- Another actor was injured Thursday night while playing the role of Spider-man in "Spider-Man Turn Off the Dark" on Broadway, according to a statement released by the show's spokesman Rick Miramontez. Despite the injury, Miramontez claims that the technical aspects of the Broadway show are in working order and that equipment malfunction played no role in the injury. The producers said the delay would give the show's creators time to work on various revisions, including improving the musical arrangements and sound quality. Curry's injury on Thursday occurred almost two-and-a-half years after a series of other maladies and safety concerns caused the show's opening to be postponed several months. He suffered four broken ribs, a hairline skull fracture, a broken scapula, a bruised lung, three cracked vertebrae and broken bones below his elbow as a result of his fall, his father said.
