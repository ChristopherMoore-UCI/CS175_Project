The world must act now to prevent a new digital caste system from emerging, Google's executive chairman Eric Schmidt told the world's largest mobile phone gathering in Barcelona, Spain. Schmidt predicted that in the next decade there would be many improvements to connectivity; but there is a limit to the amount of new infrastructure that would be laid by 2020, he said. In his 2010 keynote at the MWC, Schmidt proclaimed Google's new strategy of "putting mobile first." The following year he gave an update on the rise of Android and emphasized the importance of cloud computing to the future of new mobile services. Some governments would try to control access to the web and new technology, but he said he believed they were going to fail.
