And, noting that Stanley had highlighted a rant from "Scandal's" Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) as illustrative of Rhimes' own perceived anger, she wondered why other rants by white characters don't get the same attention. The story later observed, "Ms. Rhimes has embraced the trite but persistent caricature of the Angry Black Woman, recast it in her own image and made it enviable." Immediately, the Internet reacted, led by a bemused Rhimes, who observed that she didn't create "How to Get Away with Murder." "Confused why @nytimes critic doesn't know identity of CREATOR of show she's reviewing," she tweeted in response to a tweet from Pete Nowalk, who did create the series.
