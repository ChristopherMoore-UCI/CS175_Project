-- South Africa has named Caster Semenya, the women's world 800 meter champion, in their squad for the 2010 Commonwealth Games which will take place in New Delhi, India. "The fact that she's unbeaten in her three races thus far and has improved her time on each occasion is good news for our medal effort in New Delhi," SASCOC president Gideon Sam told the website. Semenya clocked a time of 1:59.90 at the ISTAF meeting in Berlin at the weekend which, though four seconds short of her 1:55.45 personal best, was enough to draw criticism from fellow runners. Cummins -- who finished eighth in race Semenya won on Sunday's race -- told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph the sport's governing body needed to think again. Prior to this, the 19-year-old had been forced into an 11-month hiatus from competition after the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) banned her following a urine sample test which revealed high levels of testosterone.
