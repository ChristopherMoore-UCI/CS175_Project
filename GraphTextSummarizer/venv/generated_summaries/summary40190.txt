It comes after two people were able to get married in wedding dresses in St. Petersburg last year because one of them, according to passport information, is a man. As a lawmaker with the ruling United Russia party, he ensured the legislation was first passed in his home city of St. Petersburg before it was adopted across the country. I will perhaps continue this joke by closing their gay club in St. Petersburg, or ban them from having meetings in public places, that's also a funny step. Vitaly Milonov was on an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to St. Petersburg when he was photographed by two women who took a selfie of themselves kissing in front of him. Milonov was the driving force behind a law that bans "propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors."
