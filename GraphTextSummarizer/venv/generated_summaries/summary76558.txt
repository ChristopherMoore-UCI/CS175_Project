Real Mallorca continued their fine form at home with a 4-1 thrashing of Atletico Madrid to stay in the fourth and final Champions League slot. "Messi did well, I'll leave it for others to find the adjectives to describe him," Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola told AFP.. "We showed that we are a strong and ambitious side who are candidates for a place in Europe," a delighted Mallorca coach Gregorio Manzano told AFP. Atletico had Raul Garcia sent off in the second half to seal their fate as a Luis Perea own goal and Felipe Mattioni strike made the game safe for Mallorca. But within two minutes Aritz Aduriz headed Mallorca in front again.
