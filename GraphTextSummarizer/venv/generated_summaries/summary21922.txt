-- President Barack Obama said Wednesday that China's currency is undervalued, resulting in a trade advantage for Chinese goods over American goods that contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. Last week, Obama urged Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao to speed up the revaluation of the yuan currency, telling him in a two-hour meeting at the United Nations that the slow pace of reforms was affecting both the global and U.S. economies, a top U.S. aide said. However, demands by U.S. lawmakers that China revalue its currency by more than 20 percent would bankrupt Chinese companies and lead to "major unrest" in his country, Wen said in the speech. Obama told Wen that the Chinese inaction "had consequences for the global economy and the U.S. economy," according to Bader. Bader declined to characterize Wen's response to Obama, saying only that Wen "did reiterate Chinese intention to continue with reform to their exchange system.
