Though not a member of the Note family, the Round does sport the Note 3's internal hardware, complete with a 2.3GHz Snapdragon 800 processor, 3GB of RAM, and a 13MP camera. Dubbed "Roll Effect," one technique makes use of the curve as a way to provide glanceable information by simply rolling one edge down when the Round is lying on its back. Announced in Korea today, Samsung's Galaxy Round sports a 5.7" 1080p flexible display that's mounted on a gentle curve along its short side. Samsung is no stranger to motion control in its interfaces, but it's been met with varying success. No word on a US release, though it will be available to our South Korean readers through SK Telecom tomorrow for around 1.09 million won ( about $1014).
