The dispersant used on the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill appears to be breaking up within weeks and is less toxic than similar products, according to preliminary testing by the Environmental Protection Agency. But he said there is no sign that dispersants are remaining in the water or settling to the bottom, and that the Corexit 9500 being used by oil company BP is among the least toxic to small fish and mysid shrimp of the eight products tested, Anastas said. Anastas said all the dispersants tested are "not without toxicity," and the studies have not examined the effects of the biodegraded products or of the combination of dispersants and the crude oil that has been gushing into the Gulf since late April. That includes more than a million gallons in surface dispersant and more than 500,000 gallons in subsea dispersant. The group is calling for an immediate end to BP's use of dispersants in the Gulf.
