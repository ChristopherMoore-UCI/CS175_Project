-- A hacker's invasion of dozens of celebrity iCloud accounts, leading to the embarrassing leaking of nude photos, has lessons for us all. "Certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet," Apple said. Many of them only found out they were victims because of media reports naming them, but others -- such as Lawrence -- found out when social networks exploded with buzz about nude photos being distributed online. Actress-singer Keke Palmer, 21, was on the list, but has never taken or kept nude photos on her phone or elsewhere, her mother said. Other celebs, however, have enjoyed career boosts when supposedly inadvertent leaks of nude photos or videos have gone viral.
