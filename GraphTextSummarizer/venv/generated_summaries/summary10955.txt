"As of right now, we have not heard from Miss Huskins and we are no longer in contact with any of the family members," Park said late Wednesday. Huskins was found safe on Wednesday, more than 400 miles away in Huntington Beach. Officers from the Huntington Beach Police Department talked with Huskins, 29, at her father's apartment complex, department spokeswoman Jennifer Marlatt told reporters. Vallejo police Lt. Kenny Park went as far as to call it a "wild goose chase" that wasted department resources. Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn, who reported the kidnapping Monday, are no longer cooperating with police, Park said.
