-- "Excited" after a meeting Thursday with Mitt Romney, tea party favorite Sen. Jim DeMint urged fellow Republicans to be realistic and rally around the party's eventual nominee, making his plea the same day the ex-governor's chief rival suggested voters would be as well off with President Barack Obama as they would Romney. " Romney quickly blasted Santorum's remarks, saying in a statement he was "disappointed to hear that Rick Santorum would rather have Barack Obama as president than a Republican." "Any of the Republicans running would be better than President Obama and his record of failure," he added. " A website unveiled Thursday by the Gingrich campaign features the Fehrnstrom quote above an Etch A Sketch that highlights Romney's policy shifts when viewers hit a prompt labeled "shake." In this swift retort, Romney was able to turn the tables on an opponent who, along with Gingrich, had sought to play up Fehnrstom's Etch A Sketch remarks for a second day. He was referring to earlier comments from a top Romney adviser, Eric Fehrnstrom, who said his campaign will "hit a reset button" to take on Obama in the fall if Romney wins the GOP nomination.
