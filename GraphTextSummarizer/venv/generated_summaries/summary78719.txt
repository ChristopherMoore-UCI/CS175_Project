-- Before Jared Lee Loughner allegedly opened fire on an Arizona congresswoman, police at an area college he had previously attended were put on alert to keep him off campus, according to e-mails obtained Monday by CNN. The e-mails, dated December 23 and December 28, show that campus police at Pima Community College were distributing photos of Loughner to staffers and night watchmen, adding patrols in an area of the campus they believed Loughner had visited and searching for videos he'd posted online. However, the e-mails obtained by CNN through the Arizona Open Records Act show that, before the shootings, Pima officials considered Loughner enough of a threat to bolster security in case he tried to revisit the campus. "In regards to Jared Loughner," wrote college Police Commander Manny A. Amado on December 28, "I will have a photo of Jared copied and given to the swing shift crew and have them conduct more frequent checks of the Northwest Campus, to include the night roving CSO. Loughner's suspension occurred after he was reported five times to campus authorities for classroom outbursts.
