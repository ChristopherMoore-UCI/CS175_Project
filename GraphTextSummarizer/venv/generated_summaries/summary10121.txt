Sharapova has taken advantage of a series of shocks in the $2 million tournament which saw world number one Dinara Safina and Venus Williams exit in the first round. -- Maria Sharapova landed the Toray Pan Pacific Open title in Tokyo on Saturday as her final opponent Jelena Jankovic was forced to retire injured in the first set. Sunday will see top seed Safina and second-ranked Serena Williams in action in the women's tournament with Sharapova granted a first round bye after her Tokyo heroics. Venus Williams was back in action in her opening round match at the China Open in Beijing on Saturday, but was made to fight hard by Russia's Vera Dushevina before coming through 6-2 7-6.
