City were forced to play the closing moments a man short after second half substitute Mario Balotelli was shown red for a second bookable offence. In Germany's Bundesliga, there was a shock 3-2 defeat for Bayern Munich at Mainz Sunday, a result which leaves the Bavarian giants third in the table with reigning champions Borussia Dortmund on top. It preserved his side's unbeaten start to the EPL season and they have 35 points from 13 games, leaving city rivals and defending champions Manchester United trailing in second spot. Bayern defender Daniel van Buyten equalized on 56 minutes, but Mainz took a two-goal lead as Marco Caligiuri and defender Niko Bungert scored. It nearly proved costly as Liverpool's late substitute Andy Carroll saw his header brilliantly saved by City goalkeeper Joe Hart.
