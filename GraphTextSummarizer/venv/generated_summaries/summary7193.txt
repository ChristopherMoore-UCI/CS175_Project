Henry, a tuatara who, as far as curators at Southland Museum in New Zealand know, had never mated before, hooked up with Mildred, a younger woman of about 80, in March. Henry, the oldest tuatara to mate at Southland Museum, enjoys a cold shower in his home in New Zealand. Friday morning, Hazley was working to install a camera so Henry's international fan base can watch him and other tuataras on the Internet. -- It took about 110 years and some delicate surgery on his most private parts, but Henry -- a lizard-like creature from New Zealand -- is now a dad. They're endangered, only living on a handful of islands in New Zealand, which makes Henry's happy news all the more important to supporters of the species.
