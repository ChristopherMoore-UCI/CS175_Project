-- South African police are investigating abuse allegations at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy, the talk-show host's $40 million school for disadvantaged girls near Johannesburg. Winfrey's representatives said she flew to South Africa twice in October to meet with parents of girls at the academy, although they would not specify what the meetings were about. " In the statement, Samuel said South African child protection services were notified and that the dorm parent was removed from the campus. In an emergency meeting with pupils and parents at the school, Winfrey apologized in connection with the incident. I'm so sorry," she said tearfully, according to numerous South African media reports.
