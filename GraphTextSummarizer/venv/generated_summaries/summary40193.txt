A second suspect, Ronnie Wayne Case, 34, who had been arrested in connection with the case, was released, the Santa Monica police department told CNN. In an earlier media statement, the Santa Monica police said both Case and Park had been "charged with murder with special circumstances and conspiracy." "Park allegedly entered Redding's Santa Monica apartment on March 15, 2008, and physically assaulted her, causing her death," the prosecutor's office alleged in a statement Monday. Jay Trisler of the Santa Monica police told CNN the case is not closed. Kelly Soo Park, 44, was charged with murder and her bail was set at $1 million, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said in a statement.
