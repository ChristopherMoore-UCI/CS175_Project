London based Arabia Monitor, commenting after attacks in Sinai, said the new government "faces the difficult challenge of striking the right balance between propping up the economy, achieving fiscal consolidation, and improving the socio-economic conditions that helped overturn the old order." The Sinai may be vast, but scenes of attacks in the north have real potential to spook tourists who were just getting comfortable with coming back to Red Sea resorts in the south. Morsy is taking a bold stand, ordering counter attacks against militant hideouts over the weekend near al-Arish in Northern Sinai, after 16 border guards were killed in a surprise attacks when they were breaking fast at sundown during Ramadan. At the same time, Morsy nullified the constitutional declaration made by the military council before he took office June 30th. The new President of Egypt is taking the concept of getting work done in the first 100 days in office very seriously.
