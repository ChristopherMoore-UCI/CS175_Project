The spacecraft could be spun in-transit to generate an artificial gravity that slowly decayed, simulating a transition from Earth to Mars gravity (and vice versa) over the six-month journey. With Martian gravity around a third of that on Earth, it would take astronauts a couple of days to acclimatize, and perhaps a few months to fully adapt. As the majority of this is received in transit between planets, with proper radiological protection on the ship, it would actually be (radiologically speaking) healthier for an astronaut to live on Mars with a radiation dose of 0.10 sieverts per year than to smoke on Earth at 0.16 sieverts per year. While the solar energy reaching the surface of Mars is about half that on Earth, this isn't a show-stopper. Psychology: Depending on relative orbits, sending a message between Earth and Mars can take between three and 22 minutes.
