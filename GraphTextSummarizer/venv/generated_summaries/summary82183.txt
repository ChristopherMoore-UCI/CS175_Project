-- Nevada won't defend its ban against same-sex marriage, saying its legal position has been "undermined" in a series of rulings that began last June with a historic U.S. Supreme Court ruling recognizing gay marriages. The state's withdrawal leaves only the Coalition for the Protection of Marriage, which a lower court allowed to intervene, defending the marriage ban in federal appeals court, Lambda Legal said. A subsequent 9th Circuit Court ruling in an unrelated case persuaded Nevada to abandon its defense of the gay marriage ban, Nevada officials said. "After thoughtful review and analysis, the state has determined that its arguments grounded upon equal protection and due process are no longer sustainable," Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said in a statement Monday. The state's decision comes in a case filed by eight same-sex couples represented by the gay rights group Lambda Legal.
