-- A speaker claiming to be terrorism mastermind Osama bin Laden warned in an audiotape aired Friday that the release of two French journalists abducted by militants hinges on France's military role in Afghanistan. France has 3,750 troops in Afghanistan, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force. On the tape, the speaker, believed to be al Qaeda chief bin Laden, warns the French government that its alliance with the United States will prove costly. " One U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN that the tape "sends a chill up your spine," as it refers to "a couple of human beings whose lives are at stake." However, the official said it is unclear how much influence bin Laden might have over the fate of the hostages. The official said there has been no change in the U.S. belief that bin Laden is hiding in Pakistan somewhere along the border with Afghanistan.
