New rule doesn't go far enough, former chief says Sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft, former TSA chief Kip Hawley told CNN, and the search for knives interferes with the search for objects that can threaten aircraft. Focusing on the wrong threat Security expert Rafi Ron says the TSA should focus on risky people rather than risky objects. The TSA's move this week to allow small pocket knives on airplanes has generated a storm of criticism and concern among aviation professionals and passengers alike. Former flight attendant Tiffany Hawk is "stupefied" by the TSA's decision to allow knives "especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes, liquids and computers -- remains unchanged," she wrote in an opinion column for CNN. The agency says it believes knives cannot be used to hijack planes because of strengthened cockpit doors and more passenger awareness.
