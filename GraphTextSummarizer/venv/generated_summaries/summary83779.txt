-- This week's Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California, reaches a notable milestone as the tournament celebrates its 40th year -- the oldest WTA Tour event on the circuit. Four former champions, each representing a different decade, will be paraded; inuaugural champion King (1970s), two-time champion Andrea Jaeger (1980s), Davenport (1990s) and defending champion Marion Bartoli (2000s). Reigning U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters has four wins, with American legends Chris Evert and Lindsay Davenport and Billie Jean King with three  victories each. And, the 1971 tournament at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium, in which King beat Rosie Casals in the final of an event then known as the British Motor Cars Invitational, was to become the first of 24 events that year that formed the first-ever WTA Tour calendar. The tournament has been hosted in the grounds of Stanford University for the past 14 years, after various different venues in the North California area, and its roll-call of former winners reads like a who's-who of women's tennis.
