Darlington Arena, home of English club side Darlington F.C., where a stand will be closed to cut costs. -- An English football club is being forced to close a stand at its 25,000-seat stadium to cut costs, in what could be the first of many similar moves at other clubs, a sports business expert predicts. Darlington F.C. has also increased the cover price of match day programs and has cut the number of complimentary tickets given away for home matches. However, the issue of crowds not filling stadiums was a wider concern for many clubs. Professor Simon Chadwick, director of the Center for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) at Coventry University, UK, told CNN that many football clubs may soon find themselves in the position of having to make a similar move.
