-- Sport's battle with racism and discrimination has suffered a further setback after a senior Australian administrator compared an athlete to "King Kong." Eddie McGuire, president of the Collingwood Australian Rules Football team, has apologized unreservedly after describing Adam Goodes, an indigenous Australian playing for the Sydney Swans, as an ideal person to promote the musical of the 1930s classic film. " "I understand the questions surrounding my leadership but with the support of my fellow directors I remain committed to the Collingwood Football Club and all that it stands for," McGuire said in a Collingwood statement. "I apologize to Adam Goodes, to the Indigenous people of Australia and every Indigenous sportsperson," McGuire told a press conference. When asked if he would invite world No. 1 Tiger Woods to dinner during next month's U.S. Open, Spain's Sergio Garcia replied: ""We'll be having him round every night... and serving him fried chicken. "Morning Australia this is what I have woken up to t #racismitstopswithme #bigweekinfooty," said the 33-year-old from his verified Twitter account.
