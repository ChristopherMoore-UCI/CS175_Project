Residents of 14 states, from North Dakota to Virginia, faced wind chill warnings or advisories due to frigid temperatures combined with strong winds heading into Tuesday. But the possibility of light snow around President Barack Obama's inaugural festivities in Washington did not materialize despite colder temperatures. Overnight temperatures in Pittsburgh should be just above freezing with wind chills at 14 below. Around the same time and about 30 miles east in Warren County, heavy snow and low visibility contributed to a crash on Interstate 75 that involved 52 cars, said Ohio State Highway Patrol Sgt. All four of these crash sites are among the hundreds of communities under wind chill advisories.
