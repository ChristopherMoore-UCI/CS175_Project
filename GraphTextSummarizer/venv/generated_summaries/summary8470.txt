Instead of going all-in on one product, Betaworks gives multiple ideas room to grow, and even die, in order to single out the most promising sites, apps and tools. "Every place I've worked before has always been trying to make a specific product or company work, so you had no alternatives," said Paul Murphy, Betaworks' senior vice president of product, who formerly worked at Microsoft and Aviary. The business model and minimalist approach to apps is working out swimmingly for Betaworks. "We try to fail fast and small," explained founder and CEO John Borthwick. To come up with a product, the team starts with a running list of about 80 things they feel should just be better, from weather apps to business cards.
