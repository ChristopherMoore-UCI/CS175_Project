That gritty reality has been key to a photograph of jockey Katie Walsh winning a prestigious portrait competition featuring esteemed subjects like former United Nations secretary general Kofi Annan. British photographer Spencer Murphy took the award-winning picture of Walsh -- sister of famed Irish jockey Ruby Walsh and the daughter of trainer Ted Walsh -- during a promotional shoot at Kempton racehorse. A black-and-white shot of Annan captured by Iranian photographer Anoush Abrar was in third place this time around. The award ceremony took place at London's National Portrait Gallery, where a selection of the 5,410 entries will be on display until February. -- The life of a jockey is far from glamorous -- a world away from the confines of the rarefied, hushed atmosphere of London's National Portrait Gallery.
