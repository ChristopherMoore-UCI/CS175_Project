From 2004 to 2008, amusement parks hit a slump with dozens of theme parks shutting their doors nationwide. Attendance at U.S. theme parks increased by 59 million visitors from 2000 to 2013, said David Mandt, a spokesman for the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions. Those deep feelings of nostalgia associated with places like local, homegrown theme parks are quite common, according to Jim Futrell, a historian with the National Amusement Park Historical Association. This includes several smaller theme parks that closed in the mid-2000s, including some that had survived a century, Futrell said. "In this Internet era, people are looking for something different to do, and a lot of amusement parks are able to capitalize on that," he said.
