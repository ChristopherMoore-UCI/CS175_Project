At least 54 people were taken to various medical centers, including four who were in critical condition, said Deputy Rod Carroll of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department. -- At least 50 vehicles were involved in a wreck that hurt dozens of people and closed part of a highway in southeastern Texas on Thursday "We are very fortunate not to have any fatalities," Carroll added. " Poor visibility stemming from a mixture of fog and smoke probably caused the wreck, authorities said. Two vehicles caught fire, and several had heavy damage, he said.
