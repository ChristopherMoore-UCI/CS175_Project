" Mapping the ocean floor Some 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) off the coast of Western Australia, a pair of survey ships continue their efforts to give search teams a better understanding of what lies thousands of meters below the surface in one of the most uncharted, remote places on the planet. For the most extreme terrain, Gallo said, search teams may need a remotely operated vehicle (ROV), steered from a surface ship with a tether. There is far less confidence about whether search teams are looking in the right spot. Despite a potentially vast search zone, Dolan said late last week that he's cautiously optimistic that search teams will find the missing plane. And with a greater area to search, and multiple search assets involved, the operation becomes far more complex.
