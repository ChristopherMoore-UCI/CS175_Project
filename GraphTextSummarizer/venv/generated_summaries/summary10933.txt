Grimes, the Democratic secretary of state who is challenging Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in one of the nation's marquee races, cited the "matter of principle" of privacy at the ballot box, noting that she is the state's chief election officer. But he wouldn't address the future of Kynect, saying that "it's a state decision" and that "it's fine to have a website." Grimes said McConnell is living in a "fictional fantasyland" on the issue and that more than 500,000 Kentucky residents now have health insurance because of the law. "There's a great likelihood," McConnell said, "that I will be the leader of the majority in the Senate next year." Alison Lundergan Grimes again refused to reveal whether she voted for President Barack Obama, dodging the question for the second time in a week Monday during the only debate of Kentucky's Senate race. It came after McConnell had already blasted Grimes for trying to hide her political allegiances in a state where Obama is deeply unpopular.
