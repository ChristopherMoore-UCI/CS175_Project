"The government would like to give time to people in affected areas to prepare for floods during high tide periods between (October) 28 to 30. More high tides are expected in the coming week, which could cause rivers to back up, further raising water levels, according to Thailand's Flood Relief Operations Command. Flood waters could reach almost five feet (1.5 meters) in the village. The center's director said parts of a dike at Tambon Lak Hok, MuangÂ District,Â PathumÂ Thani province have broken and a mass of water is expected to flow into the village. Residents have resorted to moving out of flooded homes by boat or anything that could float -- or wading through water with plastic bags of belongings balanced on their heads or pets tucked into clothes.
