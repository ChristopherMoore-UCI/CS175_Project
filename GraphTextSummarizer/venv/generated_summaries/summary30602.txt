Even the structure of "Louie" has always felt like a dream, mixing real-life clips of C.K.'s stand-up with semi-fictionalized moments from his life, cameos from people he knows (Sarah Silverman and Jerry Seinfeld pop up this season), and references to movies he's seen â€” from French New Wave films to Buster Keaton classics. So there must be a wink behind the strange and wonderful new season of "Louie," which often uses dream logic in place of jokes. The second episode, "Model," finds Louie (Louis C.K.) hooking up with a rich young beauty (Yvonne Strahovski) whose astronaut father walked on the moon. Like the gnarliest stuff that your subconscious coughs up at night, its main purpose is to confront the taboo, and whether that means exploring just how far Louie will go into the "experimental" side of masturbation in the season premiere or simply digging into his ugliest prejudices about overweight women, the show can be revelatory. The third episode, "So Did the Fat Lady," might be the most poignant one here, as Louie fends off the advances of a self-proclaimed "fat girl" (Sarah Baker).
