The complex system fully"Afghanized" such operations, putting Afghan commandos in the lead and giving American special forces a "training and support role," a senior Afghan official said. Under the deal, U.S. special forces would be on the ground but would not enter the home of an Afghan unless specifically asked to do so by the Afghan commandos leading the operation, or by other Afghan officials, according to a senior NATO official. And special operations forces will operate under Afghan law, said a statement from Karzai's office. The agreement prevents ISAF from conducting such operations without the explicit permission of Afghan officials, said a senior NATO official. " Last April, the United States and Afghanistan signed a deal giving Afghan authorities an effective veto over controversial special forces missions.
