-- President Obama is expected to approve a proposal to withdraw most combat troops from Iraq within 19 months, Pentagon officials told CNN Wednesday. It is expected that the final plan will call for the majority of combat forces to be withdrawn, and keep as many as 50,000 in Iraq to serve mainly as military trainers or advisers. A White House spokesman said the president has made no final decisions about Iraq policy. U.S. military officials said even those residual forces could find themselves in combat. But shortly after taking office, he asked Pentagon and military commanders for an analysis of other time frames.
