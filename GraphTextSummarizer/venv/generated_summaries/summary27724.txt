Therefore, even in Jordan you still have to compete and I think it's only making Jordan stronger to try to present themselves to the labor market to represent themselves with more communication skills and more experiences. CNN's John Defterios sat down with Jordan's labor minister, Nidal Katamine, to discuss the scale of these issues and what measures need to be put in place to tackle them. Unfortunately, those who are living in Jordan as refugees, they are looking for any work that could cover their expenses. As a minister of labor I made this clear last year to the ILO, the International Labour Organization, and I plead for assistance. Youth unemployment is not a new subject to make the headlines (see Spain and Greece) but it is has become a particularly acute problem for Jordan.
