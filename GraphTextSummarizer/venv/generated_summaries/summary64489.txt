" At the center of the lawsuit is a February 5 memorandum from the school to students that said prom dates must be of the opposite sex. When school officials told McMillen she could neither take her girlfriend to the prom nor wear a tuxedo to the event, the senior went to the American Civil Liberties Union, which demanded the school change its policy. "The record shows Constance has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same-sex date," Davidson wrote. Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence, according to the documents. "She got what she wanted, and now it's just a question of what the damages might be in her case." "I never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together," McMillen said last week in an ACLU news release.
