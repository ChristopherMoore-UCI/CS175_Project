"We don't know, ultimately, who was responsible for his death," said Lt. Mark Farrall spokesman for the Newark, Delaware, Police Department. He worked in the administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Wheeler's body was discovered New Year's Eve at Wilmington's Cherry Island landfill as a sanitation truck was unloading garbage it had picked up from metal trash bins in Newark. A Wilmington parking lot attendant, Iman Goldsborough, noted Wheeler's strange appearance on December 29 when he stumbled into her garage. He appeared confused on video surveillance tape that showed him near the Nemours Building in Wilmington.
