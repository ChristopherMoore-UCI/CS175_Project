Yevloyev was the owner of Ingushetiya.ru, a Web site that frequently took to task local leaders in Ingushetia, a small Russian republic bordering Chechnya in the North Caucasus, just north of Georgia. According to The Associated Press, the site's deputy editor Ruslan Khautiyev said that Yevloyev arrived in Ingushetia from Moscow on Sunday on the same plane as regional President Murat Zyazikov. Yevloyev was a critic of regional President Murat Zyazikov (left), seen here with Vladimir Putin. President Zyazikov's administration is battling a low-level Islamist insurgency, who launch frequent attacks on Russian servicemen and law enforcement officials. He said the police blocked the jet on the runway after it landed in Ingushetia's provincial capital, Magas, boarded the plane and took Yevloyev off.
