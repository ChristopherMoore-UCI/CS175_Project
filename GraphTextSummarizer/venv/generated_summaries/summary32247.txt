However, if ISIS takes Kobani, that would mean it would control land between Raqqa and Turkey -- about 100 kilometers (60 miles). Tal Abyad is on the Turkish border and about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from Raqqa. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria took control of Raqqa last year. The strategy against ISIS is working, said U.S. Central Command Gen. Lloyd Austin on Friday. U.S. warplanes struck only twice Friday and Saturday in the city, Central Command said, both times targeting ISIS fighting positions.
