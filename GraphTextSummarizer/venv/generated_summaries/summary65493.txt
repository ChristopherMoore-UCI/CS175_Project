Barcelona lead Real by three points with seven matches to play ahead of Wednesday's home clash with Deportivo La Coruna, while their title rivals travel to Almeria on Thursday. Meanwhile, Sevilla's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League suffered another blow with a 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Valladolid on Tuesday night. The 25-year-old Spain international could be out for up to a month, Barcelona's Web site reported on Tuesday, meaning he may not be fit to return until the club's final domestic league match against Real Valladolid on May 16. Tenerife stayed in the third relegation place, one point above Valladolid, despite registering a first away win this season, 2-0 at mid-table Sporting Gijon. Getafe claimed seventh place from fellow Europa League Villarreal with a 3-0 victory in Tuesday's late match.
