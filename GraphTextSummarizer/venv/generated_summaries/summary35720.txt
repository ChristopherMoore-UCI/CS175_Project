-- A lawyer for presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr. made an impassioned plea to a federal judge Thursday to allow Hinckley longer visits to his elderly mother's home in Virginia. The lawyer said Hinckley needs to spend more time with his 86-year-old mother, Jo Ann, while she's still able to help him integrate into her community in Williamsburg, Virginia. Testimony during the proceedings revealed the Secret Service watches Hinckley from time to time while he is in Williamsburg. "Not once during any one of these releases has Mr. Hinckley done anything dangerous or violent. "Mr. Hinckley is entitled as a matter of constitutional law to be placed in the least restrictive environment consistent with public safety."
