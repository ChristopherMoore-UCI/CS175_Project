Rono clocked 2:09.32 with Hall another eight seconds adrift and the only non-African competitor in a top 10 that included five Kenyans headed by Rono and with Robert Cheruiyot finishing fifth. -- Ethiopia's Deriba Merga forgot his Olympic disappointment when he won Monday's 113th Boston Marathon ahead of Kenyan Daniel Rono and Ryan Hall of America. Tune won last year in a similar sprint finish and was treated for several minutes before being taken to a local hospital as a precaution. Kosgei outsprinted Ethiopia's Dire Tune, who collapsed after finishing and required medical attention. American Kara Goucher, who led with a mile to go, faded and finished third in 2:32.25 with Bezunesh Bekele of Ethiopia fourth.
