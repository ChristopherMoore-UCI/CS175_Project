In issuing the ruling, Salcedo Garcia said the fact that "the narcotics in question were found under seat number 39 of bus 323 of the Tufesa Bus Company which was occupied by the defendant does not lead us to conclude in an indisputable way that the drugs were in possession of Yanira Maldonado." The judge's ruling, obtained exclusively by CNN, shows the surveillance video from a bus terminal and the testimony of three witnesses, were more than sufficient to convince Maria del Carmen Salcedo Garcia, a Mexican federal judge in the border city of Nogales, Mexico; to give Maldonado her freedom back. Yanira Maldonado, an Arizona mother of three children and four stepchildren who spent nine days detained in Mexico under suspicion of smuggling marijuana, was released from a Nogales, Mexico, prison Friday, mainly because of that video. In the ruling, Salcedo Garcia calls the prosecution's case "not apt or sufficient to corroborate that Yanira Maldonado ... is the person who transported the narcotics. The surveillance video, shown to the court last Thursday at a hearing to which CNN had access, shows, in addition to the blankets and the purse, Yanira Maldonado was carrying two bottles of water and nothing more.
