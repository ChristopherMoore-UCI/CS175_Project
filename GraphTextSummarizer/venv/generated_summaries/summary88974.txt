Health Minute: The struggle of managing chronic pain Â» Oaklander says pain medications can help most patients, but there are other options. The organization defines chronic pain as "pain that continues a month or more beyond the usual recovery period for an injury or illness or that goes on for months or years because of a chronic condition." Much more difficult, she says, is the second group: "Patients who have chronic pain without an obvious cause of tissue injury." "Pain is the No. 1 reason why patients seek medical care, but until recently it hasn't been part of the medical school curriculum," she says. I think it's important for chronic pain patients to keep a sense of purpose, optimism and hope despite the indignities that many are subjected to."
