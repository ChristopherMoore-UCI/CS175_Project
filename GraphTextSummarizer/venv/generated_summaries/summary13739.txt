The ink had barely dried on the order signed by Judge Sharon Lovelace Blackburn, allowing most of Alabama's anti-illegal immigration law to go into effect, when fear settled into some in the state's Hispanic community. The law also requires public schools to ask about the legal status of children born in foreign countries and that of their parents. "We cannot even go out and buy food," said Perla Perez, who has lived in Alabama for the past five years without legal status. Larry Craven, the interim superintendent of the Alabama Department of Education, said in a news conference Friday that schools will comply with the law, checking the status of new students, but that nobody will be denied an education. State Sen. Scott Beason said the ruling is a victory for the state of Alabama because it allowed most of the law to go into effect.
