Government response On Wednesday, in a rare address to the country, Prime Minister Sharif refuted accusations of electoral rigging and stressed that Pakistan has moved forward over the past 14 months in terms of "currency value, foreign investment and economic growth." He has demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif amid claims of vote rigging during last year's election. In an apparent attempt to appease Khan's demands for an investigation into electoral fraud last year, Sharif offered to form a commission consisting of three Supreme Court judges to investigate the claims. Qadri, who led protests against Pakistan's government last year that brought the capital to a standstill, has accused the Sharif government of corruption. Representatives of opposition leader Khan told CNN that they planned to arrive in the capital at 6 p.m. local time (9 a.m. ET) on Thursday, where they will rally in the city's "red zone," a tightly controlled area containing many government buildings.
