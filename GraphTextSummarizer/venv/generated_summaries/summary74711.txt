Meanwhile, Wang expressed doubts Bo was involved in Heywood's murder. "If it's like what was reported, that Bo was shocked on learning of Heywood's murder, he may not have been involved previously but may have tried to hide or minimize its impact," Wang said. As for Bo's wife, Wang noted official Chinese reports allege Gu may have been complicit in Heywood's death. Born and bred in Chongqing, a sprawling metropolis of more than 30 million where Bo served as party chief for four years, Wang, 64, knows what makes the city tick. Bo has been stripped of his top Communist Party posts for unspecified "serious violations of discipline," while Gu has been detained in connection with the death of Neil Heywood, a British businessman.
