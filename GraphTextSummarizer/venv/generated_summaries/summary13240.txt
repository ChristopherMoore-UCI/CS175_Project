-- Gilles Frydman wasn't ready to see his friend Dr. Doreen Kossove in her condition: tethered to an oxygen tank, hardly able to speak, living with only one lung, her tiny, frail body ravaged by cancer and barely visible under her blankets. "I owe her my life," cancer patient Erica Gero wrote in tribute to Kossove on the ACOR Web site. With a mother-hen style, Kossove pushed the cancer patients under her "gimlet stare" to hire the right doctor, fire the wrong doctor and find the latest treatments, which can be very difficult for rare cancers. Kossove, he learned, didn't let cancer -- in her lungs, chest and brain, and on her spinal cord and her vocal cord nerves -- get in the way of helping others. "Her ability to be up on the latest research and to impart the knowledge was uncanny," wrote Susan Lowenbraun, nursing director of the Sarcoma Center at Cedars-Sinai Cancer Center in Los Angeles, California, who worked with Kossove to help patients on the ACOR site.
