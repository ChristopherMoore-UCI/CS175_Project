This approach appears to be bearing dividends, as the Department of Justice points out over 90 percent of Missouri youths avoid further incarceration for at least three years after graduating from the program. Other states are catching on to the Missouri model. The Missouri model has been shown to reduce recidivism, meaning states will have fewer repeat offenders to incarcerate. I think certain aspects of the Missouri model must be expanded beyond corrections systems. According to Harvard University's Ash Institute, the youths attend daily meetings with peers, partake in educational and volunteer programs and serve as role models for each other.
