Gen. Roberto Dawe Gonzalez, retired Lt. Col. Silvio Isidro de Jesus Hernandez Soto and retired Gen. Ricardo Escorcia Vargas, a former deputy defense secretary. The arrests shook confidence in the military, which under former President Felipe Calderon had done the heavy lifting in the offensive against drug cartels. Retired Gen. Tomas Angeles Dauahare, along with three other high-ranking military leaders, was accused of ties to drug traffickers. Angeles Dauahare walked out of prison Wednesday night wearing gray sweats and tennis shoes. Since then, a new president and new attorney general assumed posts, and in January prosecutors said they had no evidence to incriminate Angeles Dauahare.
