PG&E runs three major gas pipelines, including the one involved in the San Bruno explosion, under "nine high-population-density neighborhoods in San Francisco," Herrera said. The September 9, 2010, explosion created a 72-foot long, 26-foot-wide crater, destroyed 38 homes and left eight dead in San Bruno, near San Francisco International Airport. During a public board meeting, National Transportation Safety Board investigators delivered their final report on the matter, sharply criticizing pipeline owner Pacific Gas and Electric for the explosion in San Bruno, saying the pipe was inadequate from the time it was installed in 1956. "The regulators are the only ones that are standing between the operators and the public, and the public is counting on them to make sure the operators are doing the right thing." San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera, who has filed an intent to sue the California Public Utilities Commission and federal regulators "for their failure to reasonably enforce safety standards," said in a statement issued after the NTSB's meeting that the investigators' findings support his move. The NTSB closed the hearing with 26 recommendations, including requiring natural gas pipeline operators to equip their systems with real-time recognition tools to pinpoint leaks and line breaks, and automatic shut-off and remote control valves in "high-consequence areas.
