If losing the presidential election wasn't enough, Mitt Romney has been hemorrhaging Facebook friends. It's unlikely that Obama or Romney were posting to Facebook and Twitter very often themselves. After Obama was first elected four years ago, his official Twitter, Facebook and, yes, MySpace pages (it was 2008, after all) went quiet for a time. By contrast, President Barack Obama acknowledged his victory last week with a pair of posts on Twitter and Facebook that quickly went viral. After a flurry of activity leading up to the election, his official Facebook and Twitter accounts went silent for four days afterward.
