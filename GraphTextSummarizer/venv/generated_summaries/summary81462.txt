" On whether he will help bring about the release of thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, Shalit said, "I will be glad if they are released, as long as they do not return to fighting Israel. -- Gilad Shalit was a 19-year-old enlisted man guarding an Israeli army post when Palestinian militants attacked his tank, killed the two men he was serving with and took him prisoner more than five years ago. " The day after his capture, a trio of Palestinian groups, including members of Hamas, Fatah and Islamic Jihad, said they would release him in exchange for all female Palestinian prisoners and all security prisoners under the age of 18 held by Israel, the Shalit family said. " Shalit's parents led a 12-day march from their home in northern Israel to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office in Jerusalem in June 2010 and camped out in a tent there until last week. Shalit traveled via Egypt because it acted as a mediator between Israel and Hamas.
