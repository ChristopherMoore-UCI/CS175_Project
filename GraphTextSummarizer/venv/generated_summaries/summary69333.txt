Even outbreaks such as swine flu tend to follow standard flu season patterns, he said. So far, Longini said, it appears that everyone sickened by swine flu in the United States contracted the disease while traveling in Mexico, the apparent epicenter of the outbreak. And Longini says the apparent new strain of swine flu appears to be here to stay. "Through simulations and mathematical work we've shown that travel restrictions -- although potentially useful in slowing spread [of swine flu] -- they are not going to stop it," Longini said. "They are just coming into their flu season."
