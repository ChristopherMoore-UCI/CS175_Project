Lotus only returned to the grid this year but, along with fellow-newcomers Virgin Racing and Hispania, have failed to score a single point so far. The CNN-sponsored Lotus Racing Formula One team have revealed that chief technical officer Mike Gascoyne has signed a new five-year contract. Team principal Tony Fernandes added: "Mike's five-year deal is a major announcement for the Lotus Racing team. "I'm extremely grateful to everyone involved in Lotus Racing for having the confidence to take this into a long-term contract. Gascoyne -- who has also worked for McLaren, Tyrrell, Jordan, Benetton, Toyota and Spyker -- told the team's official website: "It was always my intention to finish my career here, so it's great to have formally agreed a five-year deal.
