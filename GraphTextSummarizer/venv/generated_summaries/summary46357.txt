Other problems he's suffering from include kidney stones, dizziness, blurred vision and loss of vision. North Korean state media have detailed the reasons why Bae was sentenced. Detention in North Korea has taken a heavy toll on Bae, who had already been dealing with other health problems, including diabetes. Hoping for release In a video released early last month, Bae appealed to North Korean authorities for forgiveness and asked the United States for help in securing his release. "We continue to urge the DPRK authorities to grant Mr. Bae amnesty an immediate release," said Marie Harf, the department's deputy spokeswoman.
