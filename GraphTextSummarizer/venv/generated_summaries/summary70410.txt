Earlier, forensic expert Francesca Torricelli, used by the Kercher family's attorney, questioned in her testimony why the independent experts had not tested the small amount of DNA material found on another key piece of evidence -- a knife from Sollecito's home that prosecutors in 2009 said had traces of Knox's genetic material on the handle and Kercher's in a tiny groove on the blade. The questions put to Patrizia Stefanoni focused on a key piece of evidence -- a clasp on a bra belonging to murdered British student Meredith Kercher. Two new forensic experts, professors Carla Vecchiotti and Stefano Conti, cast doubt this summer on the DNA evidence that played a role in the convictions of Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito in 2009. Vecchiotti and Conti said the clasp from Kercher's bloodied bra, which allegedly contained Sollecito's DNA, was "dirty" and had been allowed to rust, making further testing futile. The defense team is seeking to demonstrate that DNA evidence used in Knox's original trial is not conclusive as she appeals her conviction and 26-year sentence for the 2007 murder of her housemate.
