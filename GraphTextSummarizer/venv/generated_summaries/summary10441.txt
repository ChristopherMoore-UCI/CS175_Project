Syria has been wracked with protests that began in Daraa and took hold across the country as government forces cracked down on peaceful demonstrations. Security forces withdrew from the Hama city center last month and al-Aasi Square has been packed with protesters calling for the downfall of the regime, displays of grassroots anger that have been gaining momentum in recent days. Hama city, the provincial capital, has been the scene of very large demonstrations and the outpourings there have been compared to the gatherings in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where daily demonstrations earlier this year forced the removal of Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, was quoted in the report on Homs as saying that al-Assad's "promises of new laws allowing more political participation ring hollow when security forces are still above the most basic laws." Mark Toner, U.S. State Department spokesman, told reporters on Friday that despite a "little flicker of progress" this week, there has been a "continued clampdown by security forces on peaceful protests." On Friday, government minders escorted international journalists to anti-government protests.
