Senator Kennedy's legacy extends from the ADA to so many other critical bills: the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988, which added disability to the group of protected classes under that critical law; the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, which outlaws discrimination and guarantees a free appropriate public education to all children with disabilities; the Family Opportunity Act, which gives parents of disabled children the ability to purchase Medicaid coverage for their children even if they were not low-income; the Help America Vote Act, which requires every polling place to have a machine where disabled people could vote privately and independently; and the more recent Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act and mental health parity legislation. Senator Kennedy's commitment to the cause of disability rights was informed by his experience as the brother of Rosemary, who was born with an intellectual disability; and the brother of Eunice, who devoted her life to improving the world's treatment of people with intellectual disabilities. Senator Kennedy understood disability as a human issue because he had a front-row seat from which to witness society's all-too-often callous and bigoted treatment of children and adults with disabilities. In his heart of hearts, Senator Kennedy understood that America was at its best when it expanded opportunities for people with all types of disabilities, for women, for immigrants, for racial and ethnic minorities, for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people, for infants and children and for seniors. I cannot imagine a more effective champion for disability rights, for civil rights, for health care, for basic human decency, than Edward M. Kennedy.
