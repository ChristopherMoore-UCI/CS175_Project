" The dramatic finale added extra gloss to a game which PSG, whose average attendances were worryingly low just two years ago, say they could have sold up to a million tickets for, with the club contesting a first Champions League quarterfinal in 18 years -- with the return leg coming next Wednesday. The Swede was originally banned for the first leg but after winning an appeal with UEFA last week, the 31-year-old scored PSG's first equalizer before setting up their second for Blaise Matuidi, who scored with the very last kick of an entertaining game. It prevented him from reappearing for the second half and in the absence of a player with 57 goals, Vilanova's side struggled to break down a PSG team who stuck to their game plan, one which featured a surprise call-up for former Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham. The four-time European champions led at halftime with Lionel Messi having converted Dani Alves' exquisite pass after 38 minutes but Barca fans will be worried by the hamstring pull the Argentine suffered at the end of the first period. The hosts were the far stronger side in Munich and dominated proceedings in a 2-0 win, so much so that they may feel a little aggrieved to only lead by goals from David Alaba -- after 26 seconds -- and Thomas Mueller.
