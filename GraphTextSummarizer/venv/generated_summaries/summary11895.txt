Lionel Messi is just two goals behind Diego Maradona's international total of 34 after guiding Argentina ever closer to qualifying for next year's World Cup in Brazil. "We have a forward line that can be considered among the best in the world," Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella told reporters. " Messi will hope to move past Maradona on Tuesday when Argentina head to the high altitude city of La Paz to face a Bolivia side which won its last meeting between the two 6-1. Jose Pekerman's side is four points adrift of leader Argentina but has played a game less. Not since 1986 when Maradona led Argentina to glory has the country won the tournament -- a statistic that Messi is desperate to change.
