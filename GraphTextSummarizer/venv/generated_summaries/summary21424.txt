According to Graham, a public safety exception to reading Miranda rights will expire, meaning the ability to continue interrogating Tsarnaev could be jeopardized by his right to remain silent and be represented by an attorney. " Feinstein told reporters that Tsarnaev could be interrogated now for any information on possible further terrorism threats under a public safety exception to immediately informing a suspect of Miranda rights. Meanwhile, Democratic legislators pushed back against GOP calls for designating 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev a war enemy to allow unfettered interrogation and possible indefinite detention, like terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay. Republicans focused on a six-month trip last year to Russia and perhaps his former Dagestan homeland and other Caucusus regions by Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the elder brother who some family members said had become a radicalized Islamist in recent years. Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, brothers of northern Caucasus origin who had lived in the United States for years, allegedly set off two bombs near the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 170.
