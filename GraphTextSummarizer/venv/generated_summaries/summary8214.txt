Valerie Brewer told CNN in a later interview Wednesday that her son managed to shower "all by himself" Tuesday night. Brewer, who suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, has "a long road ahead of him," Dr. Louis Pizano, associate director of the burn center, said Wednesday. Brewer will be home-schooled for the rest of this year and possibly next to allow his recovery to progress, Valerie Brewer said. " "He's really looking forward to spending Christmas with his family," Valerie Brewer said of her son, who was released from the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center on Tuesday. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a "bad decision." Pizano said Wednesday he would have predicted a six-moth hospital stay for Brewer.
