Schenecker, 50, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the January 28 deaths of her 13-year-old son, Beau Powers Schenecker, and her 16-year-old daughter, Calyx Powers Schenecker. In November, police opened a child abuse investigation into allegations Schenecker had abused Calyx, according to a report from the Tampa Police. "She did tell us that they talked back, that they were mouthy," Tampa police spokeswoman Laura McElroy told CNN affiliate WTSP late last week. Julie Schenecker told police she had hit the girl three times in the first incident after the girl told her, "You're disgusting," and "You're not my parent," according to the police report. But McElroy said police determined on January 28 after they arrived at the family home that Schenecker had plotted to kill the teens.
