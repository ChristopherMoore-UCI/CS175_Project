-- A Moscow court has reduced the sentences of jailed Russian tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his former business partner Platon Lebedev by two years, the Russian Legal Information Agency said Thursday. Musicians' message: Free Russian political prisoners Russia has faced international criticism for its treatment of Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, with countries including the United States accusing it of "selective prosecution" and abuse of the legal system. The sentence was reduced Thursday after an appeal hearing over their sentence at Moscow City Court, state news agency RAPSI said. They will each continue to serve out an 11-year sentence, instead of 13 years, for oil theft and money laundering charges, the agency said in a statement. In 2010, when the pair's sentences on those counts were almost completed, they were convicted on oil theft and money laundering charges, effectively extending their prison term by six years.
