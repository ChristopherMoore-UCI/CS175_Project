The Chinese government's recent trip to central Europe revealed that the hiccup in Poland has not slowed China's plan to invest heavily in the former communist states. It cannot expect its companies to grow in the Chinese market, then be surprised when enriched Chinese companies come shopping for European companies to buy. It was reported that the leaders of 16 central European countries met with Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao while in Poland. But the economies now are so interlinked that stingy European consumers quickly translates into weaker manufacturing output in China. The details, denials and counter-claims aren't important for this article; far more interesting is the impact of any China-led project in Europe.
