Second seed Nadal defeated Gael Monflis in straight sets, to book his place against compatriot Nicolas Almagro. The Spaniard is aiming for his third consecutive clay-court title this year and record 18th ATP Masters success of his career. Meanwhile, Federer clinched a revenge win over Latvian Ernests Gulbis, who beat the Swiss maestro in Rome three weeks ago. "I knew it would be a tough match after losing to him in Rome," Federer told reporters. Earlier in the day, Almagro needed under an hour to dispose of Austria's Jurgen Melzer 6-3 6-1, to reach his first-ever masters tournament semifinal.
