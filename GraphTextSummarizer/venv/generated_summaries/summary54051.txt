The Washington Monument remains "structurally sound" and is "not going anywhere," a top National Park Service official said Monday, announcing the result of a comprehensive assessment of the structure's interior. Small pools of standing water were found in the monument during inspections following Hurricane Irene, the National Park Service said in late August. Its walls are 15 feet thick at the base and 18 inches at the top, and are composed primarily of white marble blocks, according to the National Park Service. "What happened was a lot of mortar popped out, so much so that you can see sunlight above 450 feet in the monument," spokeswoman Carol Johnson said at the time. Four cracks in the monument's marble were discovered shortly after a 5.8-magnitude earthquake struck the East Coast on August 23.
