But it is committed to permitting and staffing events to ensure they are conducted in a safe manner, she added, Bob Abbey, national director of the Bureau of Land Management, said that a directive to field offices stresses event safety. The Bureau of Land Management is investigating whether sanctioning body Mojave Desert Racing violated any safety regulations, spokeswoman Jan Bedrosian told CNN. The bureau found its procedures for race events are appropriate, but said that offices did not always carry them out. These include providing adequate Bureau of Land Management ranger and recreation staffing at all events, requiring companies to compensate the bureau for processing and administering permits that take up more than 50 hours of staff time, and requiring more oversight from the bureau's district and state offices to check for policy compliance and program consistency. Since the crash, the agency has approved 20 permits from organizers for events across the California desert, Bedrosian said.
