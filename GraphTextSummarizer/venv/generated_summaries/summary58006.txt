Although I am not convinced this was necessary to pick up any additional support for repeal, in light of concessions that were already in the works, it is important to keep in mind that statutory non-discrimination language would have been above and beyond what other minority groups have been given through military personnel policy legislation. These concessions, however, do not compromise the goal of full legislative repeal of DADT. The deal that was reached on DADT this week between the White House, the Pentagon, gay rights groups (including my own), and pro-repeal champions on Capitol Hill is that workable solution and will get us where we need to go. And the president should strongly consider creating a civilian oversight and advisory group to help make a smooth transition to a post-DADT military, as was done for ensuring smooth policy changes on women through the creation of the Defense Advisory Commission on Women in the Services. But there were three concessions that repeal supporters reluctantly agreed to in order to pick up White House and Pentagon support.
