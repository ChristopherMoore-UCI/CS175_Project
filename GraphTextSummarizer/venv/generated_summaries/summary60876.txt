" Farris was elected president after the death of his predecessor, the Rev. Howard W. Creecy Jr., in July 2011. After becoming SCLC president, Creecy selected Farris, 50, as his vice president, Eaton said. Creecy became president in January 2011 after King's daughter Bernice King turned down the position, saying she was "not interested in merely being a figurehead" and criticizing the "turmoil, chaos and confusion" that had surrounded the SCLC for more than a year. The Atlanta-based civil rights group is closely linked to the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who co-founded the organization along with Ralph David Abernathy and served as its first president. "There has been speculation" that President Isaac Newton Farris Jr. will be dismissed, "but that has not been decided," Maynard Eaton, the SCLC's communications director, said Tuesday night.
