About halfway through the first period of last Tuesday's game in Chicago, Blackhawks forward Marian Hossa gave up the puck near center ice. -- The NHL on Saturday suspended Phoenix Coyotes forward Raffi Torres for 25 games for launching himself into an opponent during a playoff game earlier this week. Brendan Shanahan, the NHL's senior vice president of player safety and hockey operations, explained in a statement that Torres violated three rules with the hit -- interference, charging and an illegal check to the head. Phoenix "accepts the NHL's decision," Coyotes General Manager Don Maloney said in a statement. Hossa, who was taken by ambulance to a nearby hospital that night for evaluation, according to a statement from the Blackhawks, remains sidelined indefinitely.
