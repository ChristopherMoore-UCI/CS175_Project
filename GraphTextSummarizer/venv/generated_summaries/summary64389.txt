PG&E is working closely with San Francisco city and county officials and the owner of Candlestick Park to determine the cause, said Geisha Williams, PG&E's executive vice president of electric operations, said in a statement. "While we have many customers at the stadium, Candlestick Park is the only facility impacted," PG&E said in a written statement. The delays in the game seemed to not hinder the 49ers as they walloped the Steelers in route to a 20-3 victory. We have all our available personnel working to confirm that," Steve Weakland, a spokesman for the 49ers, said in a written statement. -- San Francisco's Candlestick Park was in need of, well, candles after two power outages stalled Monday night's football game between the 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
