Ukraine President Viktor Yanukovych said a special investigation team will be set up to probe the explosions, the news agency reported. The incident raises concerns about security in Ukraine ahead of the European soccer championships, starting in June in both Poland and Ukraine. -- Four explosions that rocked an eastern Ukrainian city on Friday have prompted a terror probe, the Ukrainian News agency reported. The closest venue to Dnepropetrovsk will be in a Ukrainian city to the east, Donetsk. The first blast went off in a trash can at a tram stop, injuring 13 people, the country's Emergencies Ministry said.
