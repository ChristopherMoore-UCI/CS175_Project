-- President Barack Obama will participate in a full day of discussion with African leaders Wednesday, turning the conversation to "overall prosperity" in the third and final day of the African Leaders Summit in Washington, D.C. A White House official told CNN that the President will highlight the "complex security challenges" African countries face and how the United States can support them. Earlier in the week, the summit brought together heads of state from Africa and top White House officials -- Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden -- who addressed leaders on issues from economic development to human rights, as well as government corruption and transparency. According to White House National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, one of the key focuses of the discussion is Michelle Obama's commitment to girls' education and the empowerment of women in Africa. "Many African nations have made demonstrable progress instituting democratic reforms, though political institutions in many countries remain fragile. "U.S. assistance seeks to enable African governments to protect civilians, strengthen security forces that respect human rights, and move away from the need for costly outside intervention.
