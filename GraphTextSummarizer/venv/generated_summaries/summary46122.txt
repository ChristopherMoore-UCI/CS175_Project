The Iraqi government was bombing Islamic State long before U.S. drones and warplanes joined them, and the Kurdish government has begged for U.S. air support. Since Islamic State fighters entered Iraq from Syria, they have given the world a revolting look at their ruthlessness. Confusing battlefield Syria's war is a checkerboard battle -- government troops and Hezbollah in a fight against Islamic State and other resistance groups, who also battle each other. In Iraq, the battle lines are clearer -- the Iraqi government with U.S. support vs. Islamic State. Iraq would not be in this predicament, had U.S. forces not invaded and destabilized it.
