"I practiced perfectly before," said the 29-year-old, who next faces Spanish 15th seed Nicolas Almagro. The 17-time grand slam champion effortlessly dispatched Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic 6-1 6-2, and will next face Czech Lukas Rosol. "I'm very happy now that I'm doing well," said fourth seed Federer, a three-time runner-up in Monte Carlo. Nadal came within a point of going a double break down in Wednesday's opening set, but he recovered to wrap up victory in resounding fashion. This was getting in the way of my game last year, whereas now I can really enjoy myself."
