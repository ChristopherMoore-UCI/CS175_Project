As a society, we must accept that while it is nice to eat wild salmon, there is no wild Atlantic salmon out there; we must get used to eating farmed fish. Indeed, AquAdvantage salmon are sterile fish, and therefore unable to reproduce even if they escape. This is true not only because there are more mouths to feed, but also because as people become more aware of the health benefits associated with eating seafood, more are switching from meat to fish. Like any other animal or plant crop, fish and seafood must be produced through farming -- or aquaculture -- and the wild stocks should be protected so they can recover. As a society that is in dire need of more plentiful and healthier food, we must accept the practices of modern agriculture in fish farming.
