Those concerns were shared by the White House, where Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters aboard Air Force One, "We're monitoring that, obviously, but we also would say that Iran does not have a great track record for responsible behavior in the region, which is always a concern for us. Iran said earlier that the flotilla was on a yearlong intelligence-gathering and training mission to prepare cadets to defend Iran's cargo ships and oil tankers from the threat of attack by Somali pirates, according to the semi-official Fars News Agency. Before that, Egypt did not allow Israeli ships to sail through the canal. Asked about Iran's assertion that the ships are going to Syria for training, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday, "My initial response to that would be we're highly skeptical of that." "We expect the international community to act speedily with determination against the Iranian provocations, designed to deteriorate the situation in the area, and put the Iranians in their place," he said.
