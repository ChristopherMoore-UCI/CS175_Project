-- Beijing residents blanketed by smog are pointing to U.S. readings on pollution levels -- and slamming official reports from the Chinese government. " "Zeal for independent assessments of air quality has been on the rise nationwide in China recently, amid public distrust over official data resulting from the failure of national evaluations to include PM 2.5 level, an air pollution index used worldwide, in their calculations," the article states. "Beijing's weather has been dominated by high pressure, which means sinking air and dry days. China acknowledges the concerns and notes that it uses a different system to measure air pollution. " While pollution is an ongoing concern in the country, the weather in recent days has made matters worse, said CNN International weather anchor Mari Ramos.
