-- An increasingly bitter dispute between the United Kingdom and Iceland over billions of dollars lost when banks collapsed is likely to end up in court, a top British government minister said Sunday. Britain and the Netherlands came up with more than $5 billion to bail out savers in their own countries who lost money in the failure of Icesave -- an online retail bank branch of Landsbanki. Netherlands Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager is "very disappointed about the decision of the Icelandic electorate not to agree with the agreement reached between Iceland, the U.K. and the Netherlands," the Netherlands Finance Ministry said in a statement Sunday. Some payments will go ahead later this year, Iceland's government said Sunday, explaining that they were not affected by the vote. He was speaking Sunday after Iceland's people voted to repeal a law aimed at solving the dispute.
