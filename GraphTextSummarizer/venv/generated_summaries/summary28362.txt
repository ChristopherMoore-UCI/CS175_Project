In an open letter to a state budget committee, Broden and other Democrats requested "an independent audit ... to determine how this significant error occurred and how Indiana citizens can be assured that it will not happen again." Still, Daniels -- a Republican who served as Office of Management and Budget director under President George W. Bush -- has characterized the discovered money as positive, comparing it a successful move in the classic board game Monopoly. The latter effort has included several deep cuts -- including roughly $320 million in state funding for K-12 education, according to state Sen. John Broden. During a press conference Tuesday, Daniels cited a "programming omission" and modernized tax collection processes for unearthing the $320 million in corporate tax revenue. "Christmas came early," Gov. Mitch Daniels said. And Jane Jankowski, a spokeswoman for the governor, said she does not believe the inquiry called for by Broden and others is necessary.
