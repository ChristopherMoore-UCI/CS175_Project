But Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of "The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World." -- An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear Pope Benedict XVI preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his first trip to Africa. " Benedict also expressed "deep sorrow" at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in Angola on Saturday, papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said. Pope Benedict XVI celebrates Mass in Angola, where he told Angolans on Sunday to "trust in God's promises." Africa is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope.
