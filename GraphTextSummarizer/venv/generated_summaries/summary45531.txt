-- A man suspected in a series of attacks in Paris, including a shooting Monday at a daily newspaper, had written a "confused" letter accusing journalists of being paid "to make citizens swallow lies with a small spoon," Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters here Thursday. On Thursday, French President Francois Hollande said in a statement that Dekhar's capture "prevented the worst from happening again. The acquaintance, who met Dekhar 13 years ago in a London restaurant where they both worked, told police that he had accompanied Dekhar early Wednesday to an underground parking garage in the northwest suburb of Bois Colombes, and that Dekhar had told him he wanted to kill himself, Molins said. Dekhar, who was born in 1965 and had lived in London for several years, was arrested Wednesday night after the acquaintance identified him as the man whose picture had been circulated by police as the suspect in the shooting on Monday of a 23-year-old photographer's assistant at the daily newspaper Liberation in Paris. Investigators also found a letter typed by Dekhar expressing his last wishes and medication, but did not find the weapon used in the shooting, Molins said.
