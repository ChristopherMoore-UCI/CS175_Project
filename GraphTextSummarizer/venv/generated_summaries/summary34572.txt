The outcome is hardly in doubt: President Bashar al-Assad is almost guaranteed to emerge victorious in a vote that opposition groups and many Western countries say will be rigged from the start. When he came to power 14 years ago, al-Assad ran unopposed, securing more than 99% of votes, according to state media. The U.S. State Department says the Assad regime has taken steps "to make it difficult if not impossible to have a fair and free election in Syria. His father, Hafez al-Assad, ruled Syria with an iron fist for 29 years before he died in 2000. " Little known challengers One aspect of this year's election distinguishes it from the previous foregone conclusions, though: al-Assad actually has people running against him -- although it's questionable how much of a challenge they present.
