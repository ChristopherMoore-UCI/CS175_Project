Chen, a teacher at another primary school, entered Leicheng No.1 Primary School in Leizhou City with a 40-centimeter (16-inch) knife and attacked children on April 28. Although none of the children died in the attack, Chen Kangbing was convicted of murder by Intermediary People's Court of Zhanjiang City in southeastern China's Guangdong province, according to the Xinhua news agency. In some schools, security guards have been armed with "forks," long poles with semi-circular prongs that can be used to fight assailants. In April, the Ministry of Education ordered kindergartens, elementary and secondary schools to restrict strangers from entering the campuses. Since March at least four knife and cleaver attacks on school children in China have been reported.
