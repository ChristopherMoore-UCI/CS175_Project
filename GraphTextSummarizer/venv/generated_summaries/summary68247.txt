The American will next face Russian 17th seed Ekaterina Makarova, who defeated former world No. 1 Victoria Azarenka 6-4 6-2 to earn a last-four spot for the first time at a grand slam. The 24-year-old reached the last four of a grand slam for the first time in his career after a grueling 3-6 7-5 7-6 6-7 6-4 victory over third seed Stan Wawrinka. The Japanese veteran, who reached a quarterfinal in 1992, made the breakthrough in partnership with Czech Barbora Zahlavova -- 15 years her junior -- as they beat eighth seeds Andrea Hlavackova of the Czech Republic and Zheng Jie of China. Before Wednesday's arduous battle with the Swiss star, he beat Canadian fifth seed Milos Raonic in a four-hour, 19-minute marathon, which equaled the latest finish to a match at Flushing Meadows, ending at 2:26 a.m. He's Japan's first male grand slam semifinalist since Jiri Satoh made it this far at Wimbledon in 1933.
