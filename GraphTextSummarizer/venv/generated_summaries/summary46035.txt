"Laser weapons are powerful, affordable and will play a vital role in the future of naval combat operations," Rear Adm. Matthew L. Klunder, chief of naval research, said in a statement. The Office of Naval Research reported Wednesday that its laser weapons system -- dubbed LaWS -- had performed flawlessly in tests aboard the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce in the Arabian Gulf from September to November. The laser could be used to stop threats ranging from drones and helicopters to small patrol boats, Klunder said, according to the USNI report. "At less than a dollar per shot, there's no question about the value LaWS provides," Klunder said in the Navy statement. Navy video released Wednesday shows the LaWS hitting exactly those types of targets.
