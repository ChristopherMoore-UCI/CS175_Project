Head to Le Temple Du Scrap (13 Rue Ernest Cresson) for pretty paper supplies, trimmings, ribbons and associated frippery. Like a lot of things in Paris, it's an artwork in its own right, by French artist Jean-Michel Othoniel. The latest dance craze sweeping the city is Tecktonik, a fusion dance style usually accessorized with spiked hair and neon accessories. There are thousands of bikes stashed across the city at bike stations around 300m apart. His design of brightly colored class beads is a delight, and nearby Place Colette is a great spot for people watching: pull up a pew and enjoy.
