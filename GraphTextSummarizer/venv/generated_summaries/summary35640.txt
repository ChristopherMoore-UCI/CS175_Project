Long a baseball powerhouse, Cuba has never finished out of the top three in World Cup competition, according to International Baseball Federation spokesman Jake Fehling. But million-dollar contracts in professional baseball often have lured away top Cuban prospects and depleted national team talent, pulling star athletes such as Orlando "El Duque" Hernandez and Jose Contreras away from state salaries at home. For the Cubans, whose teams have brought home gold in 25 of the last 30 Baseball World Cup championships their country has played in, it was time to start looking ahead in quintessential baseball philosophy. Sunday's win is only the fourth U.S. championship in World Cup competition, with Americans having previously earned gold in 1973, 1974 and 2007. "Oh, it's already over," he groaned, listening to the staccato play-by-play of Sunday's Baseball World Cup championship.
