But prosecutors have yet to determine whether anyone was criminally culpable, Boston Police Commissioner William Evans told reporters. -- The blaze that killed two Boston firefighters last week was unintentionally caused by a welding operation, Boston fire officials said Friday. The nine-alarm fire occurred on March 26 at a brick brownstone in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. Lt. Edward Walsh, 43, and firefighter Michael Kennedy, 33, were killed. "Whether anyone should be held culpable for this event, as the investigation goes on, that will be a determination made by investigators in the District Attorney's Office."
