Small arms abound An AK-47 may look like a big gun to most people, but in conflict regions, they are referred to as "small arms." " "The illicit circulation of small arms, light weapons and their ammunition destabilizes communities, and impacts security and development in all regions of the world," the U.N. said. Widespread weapons problematic Abuses still go on, partly because of the high number of weapons still in the country. Despite a voluntary moratorium on arms imports, the rights group said, Gbagbo bought weapons from various continents, including Asia and the Middle East. The opposition had Polish, Chinese and Russian small arms, Amnesty said, escalating the weapons buildup of both sides.
