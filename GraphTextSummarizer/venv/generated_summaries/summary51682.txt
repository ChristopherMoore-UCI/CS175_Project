-- Hundreds of Kurdish fighters from Turkey have arrived in the Syrian Kurdish town of Ayn al-Arab to join a Kurdish militia group battling to hold off ISIS forces, activists said Saturday. Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said Saturday that more than 60,000 Kurds fleeing the violence had entered Turkish territories since Friday, according to Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency. ISIS, which refers to itself as the Islamic State, took 39 villages on Friday alone as Kurdish forces withdrew from their positions, the Observatory said. Hundred of Kurdish fighters are streaming in from Turkey to join fighters on the front lines and more continue to cross into the city as the minority prepares for what it believes will be an existential battle. The town was already mostly blockaded by ISIS, but in the past several days some 60 nearby villages fell under ISIS control, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
