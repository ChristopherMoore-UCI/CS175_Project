I know journalists who hold liberal views on some social issues -- favoring gay marriage, for instance -- while at the same time holding conservative views on other social issues -- expressing a strong pro-life position on abortion, for instance. I know journalists who hold what we traditionally think of as liberal views on certain social issues who, at the same time, also hold what we traditionally think of as conservative views on economic issues. I don't believe that ideological bias is the major problem that erodes quality and corrodes credible journalism. I have a serious concern with news reporting (as distinguished from the opinion role of journalism) that is driven by ideological bias or activist intentions. There are many weak points in the underbelly of American journalism.
