Canada is proposing to build a pipeline of its own through western Canada that would make oil exports to China faster and cheaper. In a phone conversation that came as little surprise, President Barack Obama called Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper Wednesday afternoon to explain why he had rejected the Keystone oil sands pipeline project. In fact, in a sign of warming relations, Harper is scheduled to make a high-profile trip to China in February. He indicated to President Obama that he hoped that this project would continue given the significant contribution it would make to jobs and economic growth both in Canada and the United States of America." But crucially, the statement also said that the prime minister reiterated to President Obama that Canada will continue to work to diversify its energy exports.
