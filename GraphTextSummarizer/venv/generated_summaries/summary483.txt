Iranian company wants to send toy drone to Obama Iran's newest warplane something from 'GI Joe' Why is Iran building giant mock-up of U.S. aircraft carrier? "No nation welcomes other countries' spy drones in its territory, and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin," Gen. Hossein Salami, deputy commander of Iran's military, said at the time, according to the semiofficial Fars News Agency. Iran on Sunday unveiled what it says is a copy of a U.S. stealth drone that it "commandeered" in 2011. The U.S. drone was identified as the RQ-170 Sentinel, made by Lockheed Martin. U.S. officials told CNN in December 2011 that the drone was part of a CIA reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in Afghanistan.
