-- Winning a World Cup can help bring a divided country together, but that sense of unity can all too easily be dissipated, according to France's Patrick Vieira, who helped his country secure football's greatest prize on home soil in 1998. "With what is going on in France, I feel the country is still divided because I think religion and people taking part try to divide people," Vieira said. Former France international Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches and fined Â£80,000 ($135,000) in February for making a "quenelle" gesture -- a sign believed to be an inverted Nazi salute -- although the striker denied that it had any antisemitic connotations. and I think we won the World Cup and we showed to the French nation what France is really," Vieira, who was eligible to play for France through his grandfather, told CNN. " Football, though, can only do so much, and Vieira, who won 107 international caps, feels that those running the country missed out on a golden opportunity to enable France to capitalize on that new found unity.
