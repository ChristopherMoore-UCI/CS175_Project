"Their competitors in charter schools and private schools are learning, while our kids are not." Interview with a parent on the impact of the strike With the strike continuing, the school system planned to open 147 "Children First" sites citywide Monday for students to go to, in addition to programs run by the city's park department and neighborhood organizations, Chicago Board of Education President David Vitale said. Teachers walked off the job September 10, objecting to a longer school day, evaluations tied to student performance and job losses from school closings. This contract calls for longer school days for elementary and high school-age students, 10 more "instructional days" each school year and a single calendar for the entire school system, as opposed to the two schedules now in place, depending on the school. "It is frustrating for me that the kids are not in school, and I have to find other ways to continue their education," said parent Will White, who said he's sympathetic to both sides in the dispute. Parents have juggled their families' schedules for more than a week to make sure their children are attended to while schools are closed.
