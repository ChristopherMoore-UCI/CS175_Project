Troops thwarted the bid Thursday after they saw six militants trying to enter near Uri area in north Kashmir, military officials said. "On being asked to surrender, the infiltrators opened heavy fire on our troops," said Lt Col. J. S. Brar, a defense spokesman. The Indian army said it gunned down five militants and foiled an infiltration bid near the border line that divides Kashmir between the nation and Pakistan. The line marks the de-facto border between India and Pakistan in Kashmir. " Troops are vigilant to thwart such attempts near the Line of Control, he said.
