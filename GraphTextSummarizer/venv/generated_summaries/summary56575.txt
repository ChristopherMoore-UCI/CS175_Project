The longer answer is that Somalia lacks the capacity to suppress piracy and other organized crime without international support. Hostage takers now demonstrate a familiarity with international law that prohibits negotiation with international terrorist groups. But such heroic and high-profile moves, by the United States or any other nation equipped for them, are not a long-term solution to Somalia's plague of organized crime, now spilling across borders. There are no Somali agencies that can effectively fight piracy and other crimes in Somalia, which has existed under a relatively impotent Transitional Federal Government since the central government collapsed in 1991. In September, key regional leaders from Somalia adopted a "Somali Roadmap" to improve security, the constitution, reconciliation and good governance.
