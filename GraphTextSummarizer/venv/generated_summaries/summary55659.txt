Jiroemon Kimura, a former postman, died of natural causes in hospital in his hometown of Kyotango, western Japan, in the early hours of Wednesday, city officials told CNN. On his passing, the mantle of oldest living person passes to fellow Japanese Misao Okawa, a 115-year old woman from Osaka. According to a 2010 study by a German demographic research institute, the countries with the highest number of "supercentenarians" -- those aged 110 and over --are the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, France and Italy. Researchers estimated there were more than 400 supercentenarians in the U.S., and found 78 in Japan. The world's oldest person has died in Japan, aged 116 -- just days after the passing of a Chinese woman with a rival claim to the title.
