-- Iraqi human rights activist Hanaa Edwar has proved she is not afraid to speak her mind. She said: "One day I remember my sister hit me and she told me 'Come on, cry,' because I couldn't drop any tear because I see dead people, I see people killed in front of me, so the life at that time doesn't matter for me." One entry from her blog at the time read: "I dream to sleep without painkillers, I dream to wake up in a home that gives me love and hope, not to end it up in a grave." " Al-Amal was founded in 1992 after the Gulf War to help relieve the suffering of Iraqi people and build a just and democratic society, according to the organization. " Edwar, the 65-year-old secretary of an Iraqi human rights association, Al-Amal, laughs as she looks back at the clip. Despite her long career in human rights, Edwar is pessimistic about the current state of her country.
