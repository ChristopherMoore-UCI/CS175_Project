Authorities said Tuesday that Tim Lambesis tried to contract an undercover detective posing as a killer for hire to murder his estranged wife, who lives in Encinitas, California. Asked last year in an interview with HardNoise Online Radio about how his time on the road affected his home life, Lambesis said, "If there was a way to be home but still make a living playing music, I would do that in a heartbeat. "But the catch is that, as a profession, this is what I'm passionate about. Last September, Meggan Lambesis filed with San Diego Superior Court to have the marriage dissolved. Arraignment was set for Thursday afternoon at North Division Court in Vista. " As I Lay Dying was nominated in 2008 for a Grammy Award for best metal performance.
