" Michael Stipe, Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Bill Berry started playing alternative rock together in Athens, Georgia, in 1980, but their first hit single came with "The One I Love" in 1987. Peter Buck said the band members "walk away as great friends" "I know I will be seeing them in the future, just as I know I will be seeing everyone who has followed us and supported us through the years," Buck said. "To our Fans and Friends: As R.E.M., and as lifelong friends and co-conspirators, we have decided to call it a day as a band," the message said. -- It's the end of the R.E.M. as we know them and they feel fine, according to a statement from the group posted online Wednesday. Front man Michael Stipe declined to be interviewed by CNN Wednesday about the decision to disband, which comes six months after the release of "Collapse into Now," their final album.
