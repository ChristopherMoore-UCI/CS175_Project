Rock-throwing incidents have been controversial on the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly when Mexicans have thrown projectiles from the Mexico side of the international line toward Border Patrol agents on the U.S. side. A social justice advocacy group on Wednesday criticized the Border Patrol's use of deadly force in the Tuesday incident, saying there's a disturbing trend of Border Patrol "killings of rock throwers, some of whom were teenagers and some whom were U.S. citizens" on the U.S.-Mexico border, said Andrea Guerrero, executive director of Alliance San Diego. In the San Diego sector on the U.S.-Mexico border, the Border Patrol has recorded more than 400 assaults, including rock throwings, on agents since 2010. "Border agents should adhere to best policing practices and only use lethal force as a last resort, not the only resort," Guerrero said. A U.S. Border Patrol agent has shot and killed an apparently undocumented migrant who allegedly threw rocks at the agent, striking his face, on the California-Mexico border near San Diego, authorities said.
