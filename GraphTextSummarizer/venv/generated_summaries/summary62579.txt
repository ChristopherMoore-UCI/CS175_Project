Delta-Virgin: When in doubt, merge Last year, neither Delta Airlines nor Virgin Atlantic held a particularly admirable market share of the London-New York route. Lie-flat beds and gourmet food (with wine pairings) are par for the course on business class flights, though Delta stands out by also providing Westin Heavenly in-flight bedding. Few airline routes are as cutthroat as the one between London and New York. Aimed at London's and New York's bankers, it is also one of the few flights to leave from London City Airport. On the New York-end, they fly into Newark, which offers smaller queues than JFK Airport.
