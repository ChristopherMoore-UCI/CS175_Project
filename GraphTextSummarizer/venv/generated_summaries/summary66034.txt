It acknowledges that primary health care isn't cheap, but asserts that the "investment provides better value for money than its alternatives." "The legitimacy of health authorities increasingly depends on how well they assume responsibility to develop and reform the health sector according to what people value -- in terms of health and of what is expected of health systems in society," the report says. "When countries at the same level of economic development are compared, those where health care is organized around the tenets of primary health care produce a higher level of health for the same investment," the report says. Currently, the most common means of paying for health care is out of pocket, which WHO says is the "most inequitable method for financing health care services." The report called for all sectors of society to help determine how health care is allocated, and it singled out the United States for spending just 0.1 percent of its health budget on health systems research -- the kind of research that policymakers use to decide how money is spent. Tajikistan and Sierra Leone both spend less than $100 per person on health care.
