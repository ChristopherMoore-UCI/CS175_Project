Unless the Egyptian authorities cannot be persuaded to drop the case, civil society in Egypt will be dealt a serious blow. But few expected that today, one month from presidential elections, Egypt would be moving toward more repression and less accountability than under the deposed dictator Hosni Mubarak. As SCAF safeguards its power, hard-line Islamists seek to control Egypt's narrative, tightening the noose around the neck of the Egyptian people. Egypt's crackdown on human-rights organizations, the prosecution and sentencing of the comic actor Adel Imam and the notorious imposition of Article 28, which removes the basic rights of citizens to challenge anything about the upcoming presidential election, create a trifecta of repression. The unthinkable occurred last month when Adel Imam, Egypt's most beloved actor, was convicted of "insulting Islam" with his films.
