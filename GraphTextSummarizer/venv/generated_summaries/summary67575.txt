Boaden served as director of BBC News when the decision was made to pull the Savile report, the BBC reported. Entwistle and others were called in front of lawmakers to answer for the scandal surrounding Savile, who authorities say was suspected of having sexually abused young women and girls, sometimes on BBC premises. In late September, the BBC became embroiled in a scandal over its handling of sexual abuse allegations against its late TV presenter Jimmy Savile. It is the latest fallout over the report that has rocked one of the world's oldest and most respected media organizations, and the move follows the weekend resignation of George Entwistle as BBC's director general. The scandal exploded amid revelations that BBC's Newsnight pulled a report into allegations against Savile ahead of a planned tribute to the late TV presenter by the news organization scheduled to air later this year.
