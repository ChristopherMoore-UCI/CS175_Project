Euro 2012 hosts Ukraine and Poland have told CNN World Sport a documentary accusing football fans from both nations of racism was "unbalanced and biased." An investigation by UK television channel the BBC featured right-wing supporters from both countries displaying racist and anti-Semitic attitudes. The Panorama episode broadcast footage filmed at matches in both Poland and Ukraine that purported to show fans displaying Nazi salutes in the stands and aiming monkey chants at black players. Former England defender Sol Campbell warned fans not to travel to Poland or Ukraine after seeing the pictures and questioned why both countries were awarded the tournament in the first place. Are Poland and Ukraine ready to host festival of football? But speaking to CNN World Sport, representatives from the governments of Ukraine and Poland said the show was misleading.
