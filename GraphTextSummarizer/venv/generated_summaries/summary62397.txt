And while black men remain disproportionately targeted by the criminal justice system, black women are one of the fastest growing prison populations. President Obama has already indicated his support for eliminating the crack and cocaine sentencing disparity that metes out mandatory prison time to poor black people while letting whites go with a slap on the wrist for basically the same offenses. It is cheaper to send nonviolent drug offenders to a drug treatment facility where they can get help than send them to prison. We triumphed this year in overturning the draconian Rockefeller drug laws in New York, which for 35 years forced long mandatory prison terms on first-time nonviolent drug offenders, most of them blacks and Latinos. Much of this growth has come as a result of nonviolent drug offenses.
