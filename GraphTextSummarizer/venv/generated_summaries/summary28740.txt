Fortunately, civil legal aid programs are working closely with private pro bono lawyers to ensure that more children will have legal representation and understand their rights. Now, as the Obama administration accelerates deportation hearings, many unaccompanied children may be processed and deported in a matter of monthsâ€”giving civil legal aid groups less time to help them find counsel, understand their options, and identify grounds for asylum. While we await the bipartisan agreement and action we need for comprehensive immigration reform, civil legal aid lawyers and volunteers will continue to protect the fundamental due process rights of many young children. Many people might think these problems are new, but civil legal aid lawyers have been helping unaccompanied minors caught up in the immigration system for a long time. It's simply not right that tens of thousands of unaccompanied children are facing deportation hearings all alone.
