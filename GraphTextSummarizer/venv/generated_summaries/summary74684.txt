FFAWN (Foundation for the Advancement of Women Now), which was founded by Blige and Steve Stoute, partnered with design house Gucci and Westchester Jewish Community Services to bring Blige's center to fruition.

Women from all walks of life, not just women from poverty-stricken areas. Mary J. Blige: I always felt that I wanted to help women, period. What I believe I've done for women is show them, look, I'm Mary J. Blige
