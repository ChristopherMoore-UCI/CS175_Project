Nel began his cross-examination by suggesting that Derman was not a trustworthy witness because he had a responsibility to Pistorius as his doctor. "His intention was to shoot, whoever he came across -- if he came across anyone" in his home on a February night last year, Nel put to the doctor, Wayne Derman. Did Oscar Pistorius have time to think before he shot and killed his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp last year? If Masipa accepts that Pistorius did not know that Steenkamp was the person he was shooting at, she could find him guilty of culpable homicide, a lesser charge than murder, or acquit him, according to CNN analyst Phelps. 'Two Oscars' Derman spent all day Thursday on the stand, first testifying under defense questioning that Pistorius' double amputation is key to understanding his behavior.
