Most international passengers were accommodated on flights Monday and overnight, while the backlog of domestic passengers is expected to be cleared by early Tuesday afternoon, said Qantas, which resumed flights on Monday. The decision "provides certainty for Qantas passengers," company CEO Alan Joyce said in a statement following the decision. Qantas, which has its headquarters in Sydney, is the second-oldest airline in the world, and marked its 90th anniversary last year. Union officials have accused Qantas of planning to outsource ground jobs at a cost of thousands of Australian jobs and of putting profits first. Labor relations tribunal Fair Work Australia ordered an end to the labor dispute "to avoid significant damage to the tourism industry" after Qantas grounded its jets Saturday afternoon.
