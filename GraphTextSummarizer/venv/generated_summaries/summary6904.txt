Eight Los Angeles police officers violated department policy for use of deadly force when they shot two women during last year's manhunt for renegade ex-officer Christopher Dorner, police chief Charlie Beck said Tuesday. Dorner died February 12 while holed up in a cabin in Bear Lake, California, that caught fire when police fired tear gas canisters into it. Beck said one of the officers mistook the sound of a paper hitting the ground as a gunshot and opened fire, followed by other officers also firing their weapons. Margie Carranza, 47, and her mother, Emma Hernandez, 71, were shot as police searched for Dorner, a former police officer who was wanted for killing several people in early February 2013. The police chief said Tuesday that state law prohibits him from discussing punishment for individual officers.
