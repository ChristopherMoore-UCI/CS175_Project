-- At least 29 students at a college in Nigeria are dead Tuesday after an attack authorities suspect was carried out by Boko Haram Islamists, according to the Nigerian military. The attack happened at a federal college in Buni Yadi, near the the capital of Yobe state. "There were burnt bodies of students who cannot be easily identified," State Police Commissioner Sanusi Rafai said. No group, including Boko Haram, immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. It came three days after President Goodluck Jonathan sent his top military chiefs to the northeastern part of the country to try to put down the violence there.
