The biggest talking point, in front of a huge Boxing Day crowd at the MCG, was the dismissal of senior batsman Michael Hussey -- who has been under pressure recently following a string of poor scores. Samaraweera (86 not out) and Chandimal (58) made 111 for the sixth wicket after South African pace bowler Marchant de Lange had taken three leading Sri Lankan wickets. The sporting year in pictures Hussey suffered his third first-ball duck in eight innings after being caught behind off a Zaheer Khan delivery. Meanwhile, Thilan Samaraweera and Dinesh Chandimal shared a century partnership as Sri Lanka ended the first day of the second Test against South Africa in Durban on 289-7. -- Australia lost three late wickets as they ended the opening day of the first Test against India in Melbourne on 277-6.
