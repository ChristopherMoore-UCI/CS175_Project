-- Rebels in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo began withdrawing from the key eastern city of Goma on Saturday, witnesses said, more than a week after they seized it from government forces. The rebel group has been accused of widespread looting by the United Nations and Goma residents. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country. Government forces also looted as they fled last week, witnesses said. The latest unrest continues a cycle of misery in eastern DR Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda.
