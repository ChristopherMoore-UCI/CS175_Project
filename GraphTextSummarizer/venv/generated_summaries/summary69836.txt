As controversy continues over underinflated footballs used in Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts, New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick insisted Saturday that the Patriots organization had done nothing wrong. "The net of one and a half, back to a half, is approximately one pound per square inch" of lower air pressure, Belichick said. Belichick also said losing a pound of air pressure in a football is hardly noticeable and that the feel of the ball is more important. " On Friday, the NFL said the footballs used by the Patriots on Sunday didn't meet league air pressure specifications in the first half of the  AFC title game, which the Patriots won 45-7. Belichick compared the situation to starting a car on a cold morning and finding a dashboard light showing low tire pressure.
