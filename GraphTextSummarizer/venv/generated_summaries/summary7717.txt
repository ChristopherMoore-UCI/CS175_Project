"I am good at exposing frauds, as I showed in my last fight," added Haye, who beat ex-Olympic champion Audley Harrison inside three rounds last November. Wladimir Klitschko has told reporters that he is finally looking forward to silencing David Haye, when the two face each other for their eagerly-awaited heavyweight showdown in Hamburg on July 2. Meanwhile, Haye, who holds the World Boxing Association (WBA) version of the title, continued his onslaught on Klitschko, saying: "I believe he is a fraud, down to the fact he wears shoulder pads into the ring and he only picks the guys who he knows he can beat. Klitschko, who holds the International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Organization (WBO) versions of the belt, said: "All this hype and interest is great for the division. The pair gave their first press conference on Monday ahead of the fight, and 35-year-old Klitschko made it clear that he has had enough of the insults thrown at him by his British opponent.
