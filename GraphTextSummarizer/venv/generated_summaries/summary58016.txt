The NAACP has called for the federal government to charge Zimmerman with violating Martin's civil rights after the acquittal, which Jealous said left the impression "that our young people have to fear the bad guys and the good guys -- the robbers and the cops and the self-appointed community watch volunteer who thinks that they're keeping folks safer." But he said he was confident that leaders in Congress -- including Democrats like civil rights movement veteran John Lewis and Republicans like James Sensenbrenner, a leading member of the House Judiciary Committee -- support restoring provisions the court struck down. " No successor was announced in the statement, in which NAACP board Chairman Roslyn Brock credited Jealous with building a staff able to "meet the civil rights challenges of the 21st century." Recently, Jealous condemned as "outrageous" the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a key portion of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and lobbied Congress to re-authorize the provisions that the court killed. "The NAACP has always been the largest civil rights organization in the streets, and today it is also the largest civil rights organization online, on mobile and at the ballot box too," Jealous said in a statement issued Sunday afternoon.
