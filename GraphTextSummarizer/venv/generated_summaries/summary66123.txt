" When not kidnapping penguins or looking to save the world, Pfannenstiel spends his time working for German football Bundesliga club 1899 Hoffenheim. Keen to distance himself from what he perceived was a superficial and materialistic way of life, Pfannenstiel came up with  the idea of 'Global United' -- a charity to raise awareness of climate change. " Jail time and his near death experience in England brought about Pfannenstiel's Damascene conversion. "It wasn't like a kaleidoscope -- there was no color, it was all black and white," Lutz Pfannenstiel tells CNN, recalling the moment 12 years ago when his life flashed before his eyes, the former goalkeeper suffering an injury which led the club's physio at Bradford Park Avenue to think the German was dead. Now Pfannenstiel hopes to take his football friends, who play in games to raise money, to Antarctica and bring attention to the effects of climate change.
