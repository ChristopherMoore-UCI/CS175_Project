"We're happy that a fresh pair of eyes is starting to look at Kendrick's case," Kendrick's father, Kenneth Johnson, told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday. On Thursday, Lowndes County Coronor Bill Watson said he has not made a decision yet on whether to open a coroner's inquest into the death. On Monday, a Lowndes County judge ruled that authorities had to turn over the surveillance records and files sought by the family -- the first step, family attorney Chevene King said -- in finding what they say is  the truth about what had happened. Michael Moore, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, said Thursday that federal authorities will investigate the circumstances behind the death of Johnson, whose bloody body was found inside a rolled-up gym mat on January 11. Within 24 hours of finding the body, Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine announced that investigators had no reason to suspect foul play in the death.
