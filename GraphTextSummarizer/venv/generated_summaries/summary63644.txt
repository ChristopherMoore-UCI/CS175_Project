China rejects Tibetan claims of independence or greater autonomy and claims sovereignty over the area. "The administration intervened in the so-called election because Nepal's foreign policy does not allow any activities against any friendly neighboring countries," Nepal's Home Ministry spokesman Jaya Mukunda Khanal told CNN. -- Nepalese authorities in Kathmandu seized ballot boxes Sunday, disrupting elections for Tibetans who were voting to elect a new prime minister and government in exile, officials said Monday. Nepal maintains that Tibet is part of China, and does not allow any anti-Chinese activities on its soil. But Thinley Gyatso, the regional Tibetan election commissioner in Nepal, said that authorities had given him permission to conduct the vote and that he is pressing the Nepalese government to return the ballot boxes, according to the Central Tibet Administration statement.
