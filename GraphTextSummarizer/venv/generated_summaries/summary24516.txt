Obama's former campaign advisers, as well as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and plenty others in the media piled on the criticism of Romney's anti-poverty message. But other than mourning the (substantial) loss of some well-tread fodder, the announcement that Mitt Romney will not be running for president a third time does little to change the 2016 outlook for Republicans. Proof that they were salivating over the opportunity was President Obama's open mockery of Romney at Thursday night's speech to House Democrats: "We've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty. So on its face, it would seem a dangerous gamble to attack Romney for trying to address poverty. It's pretty rich that the sitting president who has presided over a widening of the income gap and a worsening of poverty would take a shot at anyone else who tried to offer solutions.
