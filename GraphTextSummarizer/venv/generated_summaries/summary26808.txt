-- BP will try again within the next day to cap a well that has gushed millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, the energy company said Friday. Rep. Edward Markey, D-Massachusetts, sent BP a letter Friday asking for details from federal agencies about the methods they are using to analyze the oil leak. The latest attempt will involve inserting a tube into a ruptured pipe, collecting oil and sending it to a vessel on the surface, said Mark Proegler, a BP spokesman. Markey, who chairs a congressional subcommittee on energy and the environment, said he would launch a formal inquiry after learning of independent estimates that are significantly higher than the amount BP officials have provided. In Washington, President Barack Obama criticized executives from BP and two other companies for blaming each other for the catastrophe.
