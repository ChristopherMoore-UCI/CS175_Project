First responders to the fire found Carmen on top of Ledford, trying to shelter his face from the heat, smoke and flame, according to CNN affiliate WCPO. Carmen ended up at Cincinnati's Care Center, a critical care veterinary hospital. The injured dog, owned by Ben Ledford of Goshen Township, is doing much better in an animal hospital recovering from smoke inhalation, said Phil Ledford, the victim's brother, on the Crowdrise website. Carmen was initially battling severe lung damage, Dr. Daniel Carey, a vet at the hospital, told WCPO. "Carmen is still doing well," said Ledford.
