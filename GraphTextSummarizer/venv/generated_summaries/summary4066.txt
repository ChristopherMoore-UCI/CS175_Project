While Moore doesn't believe the high court has the jurisdiction to redefine the definitions of family and marriage, he concedes that if the justices rule same-sex marriage is constitutionally protected, Alabama judges would have to honor the unions under the U.S. Constitution's Supremacy Clause. Mobile County has the state's fourth-highest population of same-sex couples, according to the Williams Institute, and the ACLU of Alabama is involved in a lawsuit filed by four same-sex couples who were denied marriage licenses in the county, Watson said. " It's unclear exactly how many counties issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples after federal courts ruled they could go forward on Monday. Several counties, including Jefferson, Montgomery and Madison (which have the state's highest populations of same-sex couples, according to the Williams Institute) told CNN they were issuing licenses, while others said they were following a Sunday order from state Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore telling probate judges not to issue the licenses because the federal courts lacked jurisdiction. And since probate courts fall under Moore's authority as the administrative head of the judicial branch, he said, judges were free to disregard the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which declined to extend a stay on Alabama's prohibition of same-sex marriages beyond Monday.
