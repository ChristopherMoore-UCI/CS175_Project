"So much in our daily lives now, we only meet people online," said festival co-director Jeremy Boxer. Held every 18 months, the event is hosted by video-sharing site Vimeo to celebrate the Internet as a medium for film and bring together members of the Vimeo community who interact regularly online but rarely meet. Three "Dreamers" caught Rausch's attention when they shared their life stories with him last year in a private meeting. From 'Oden' to 'Limbo' Rausch won the grand prize at the first Vimeo Festival + Awards, held in late 2010, for his short film "Last Minutes with Oden." All three are undocumented teenagers from Mexico who are living with family members in East Los Angeles, Rausch said.
