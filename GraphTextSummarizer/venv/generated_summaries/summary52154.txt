The 25-year survival rate was 70.6% for women with breast cancer detected in the mammography group, but only 62.8% for women with cancers diagnosed in the control group. As such, the professional organizations said in their statement, the results should not be used to create breast cancer screening policy, "as this would place a great many women at increased risk of dying unnecessarily from breast cancer." Researchers with the Canadian National Breast Screening Study conducted a 25-year follow-up with their participants and concluded that "annual mammography in women aged 40 to 59 does not reduce mortality from breast cancer beyond that of physical examination or usual care when adjuvant therapy for breast cancer is freely available." Currently the American Cancer Society recommends yearly mammograms for women starting at age 40, and clinical breast exams every three years for women over the age of 20. In the mammography group, 180 patients died of breast cancer during the 25-year follow-up; 171 women died in the control group.
