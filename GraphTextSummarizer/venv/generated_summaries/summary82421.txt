-- Gov. David Paterson had no intention of appointing Caroline Kennedy to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hillary Clinton, a source close to the New York governor told CNN Thursday. Zimmerman was one of the first New York Democrats to say Kennedy wouldn't get the Senate seat and that Paterson wouldn't bow to pressure. People who move in New York political circles were buzzing Thursday about the endless finger pointing between people loyal to Paterson and those loyal to Kennedy. " Kennedy was widely considered the front-runner to replace Clinton, who won the New York Senate seat in 2000, and almost all of the buzz about a replacement centered around her. A poll earlier this month suggested New Yorkers preferred Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, to Kennedy, with 31 percent of respondents favoring Cuomo and 24 percent preferring Kennedy.
