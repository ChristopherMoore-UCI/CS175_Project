-- This year's Hollywood Issue of Vanity Fair magazine showcases a diverse group of actors and actresses -- which is generally making the Internet very happy. Among the performers featured on the magazine's March cover, an annual showcase for Hollywood's best and brightest, are six actors of color: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Idris Elba, Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong'o, Naomie Harris and Chadwick Boseman. Hollywood always make sure to include one black and then forgets that other colors and ethnic groups exist too. The 2010 cover, which included a host of young female stars such as Anna Kendrick and Carey Mulligan, probably came in for the most criticism. "(The cover shows) a healthy and interesting mix of celebrities on every rung of the star system, from the megastar Roberts to the emerging (Margot) Robbie, as well as more than just a group of white stars," he wrote.
