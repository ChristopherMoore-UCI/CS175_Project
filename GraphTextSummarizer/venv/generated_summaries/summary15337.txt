The deadly flash floods that swept through remote Arkansas valleys, killing some campers and leaving many others missing, are a grim reminder of the sudden nature of flash floods and the importance of being prepared for emergencies. However, being prepared for emergency situations is even more critical when people are out in the wilderness and further away from phones or cell phone access, hospitals and emergency help. With summer starting and more people getting outside, it is important that families include emergency preparedness in the summer planning. The course includes recommendations for the contents of wilderness and remote area first aid kits, and offers training on what to do in emergencies that include allergic reactions, altitude sickness, sprains, fractures, burns, heat-related illness, hypothermia, lightning strikes, heart attacks, drowning, wound treatment and snakebite. Media reports from Arkansas say that after more than a half foot of rain, water in the Caddo and Little Missouri rivers rose quickly overnight -- at times faster than 8 feet per hour -- inundating campgrounds in remote valleys and catching many campers asleep.
