Hansen said Ortega is the same man who the Secret Service is calling Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez. -- An Idaho man who acquaintances say called President Barack Obama "the anti-Christ" was charged Thursday with trying to assassinate him in a shooting incident outside the White House, federal authorities said. "W-7 stated that Ortega-Hernandez believed President Obama is 'the devil,' and that Ortega-Hernandez 'will not stop until it's done.'" This witness told agents Ortega-Hernandez told him he "needed to kill him." One bullet hit a window and was stopped by bulletproof glass, and another was found on the White House exterior, the Secret Service said.
