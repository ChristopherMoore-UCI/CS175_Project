The next day we were out on the Harbor filming for MainSail, onboard the mighty Comanche, the favorite for the prestigious Rolex Sydney to Hobart race. Sydney harbor could bite, you had to understand it, expect the unexpected -- and I did. With Olympic success in the balance it's too easy to keep that head in the boat, to miss the stunning beaches, the rugged beauty of the Heads, but the Harbor here in Sydney really is something else. You can almost feel the history, the stories and legacy of a fully working city harbor -- for over two hundred years thousands have made a living on the waters of this iconic sheltered inlet, it's far more than just a place to race. I didn't know what to say, I hadn't been back to Sydney for 14 years and now, here I was standing by the Opera House, looking at where I had leaped onto the top of the podium.
