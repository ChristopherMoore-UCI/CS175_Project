Speaking to CNN in July last year, R&A chief executive Peter Dawson insisted the single-sex policy of clubs such as 2013 British Open host venue Muirfield -- and others -- was a historic hangover. " The Royal and Ancient Golf Club has traditionally been the guardian of the rules of the game since 1754, although since 2004 it devolved responsibility for the administration of the game and the British Open to the newly-formed R&A. Last year the R&A was criticized for choosing East Lothian's Muirfield, which has a male-only membership policy, to host Europe's only major -- and Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond refused to attend the tournament. The move by the R&A brings it in line with Augusta National, which allowed female members to join the prestigious U.S. club for the first time in 80 years in 2012. Former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and South Carolina financier Darla Moore became the first women to be admitted as members. Augusta, which hosts the Masters, faced years of protests with President Obama also adding pressure on the organization.
