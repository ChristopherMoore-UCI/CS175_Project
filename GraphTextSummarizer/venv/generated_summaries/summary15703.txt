-- Ahh, summer -- a time of sun-drenched picnics where one partakes in three-legged races, whimsical games of croquet and copious pours of wine (the sweet nectar sucked from the recesses of paper bags so as to avoid the long arm of Johnny Law, of course). Well, put down the binoculars and download Color, a photo/video-sharing app for iPhone (and Android, soon) that allows you to see photos and videos from other users in your vicinity. Well, now you can document every leg of your spiritual journey with a new app for iPhone and iPod touch called Blurb Mobile, which allows you create stories with photo, video and audio. There's no "friending" on Color -- you're just shown pictures taken by people you hang out with on a regular basis (determined via location technology). Instagram is basically a photo-sharing social network, which allows you to follow other users and comment on and "Favorite" their snaps -- in which everyone is beautiful and '70sesque thanks to a cadre of flattering filters.
