Why all the fuss? Recognition of transgender people in the media shows mainstream America "we're real people," said Christine Connelly, a member of the board of directors of the Boston Alliance of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Youth who came out as transgender woman five years ago. Jazz appears in a video for the skincare company sharing the trials of growing up transgender. What makes Jazz so "special," in the words of transgender actor Laverne Cox? Her trajectory is unique, starting with her early debut in the public eye at a time when stories of transgender people -- adults or children -- were scarce. Her parents also demonstrated their unwavering support for her early on, something transgender children can't always count on, Connelly said.
