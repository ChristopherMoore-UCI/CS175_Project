"I think they (agents) are finally realizing the danger is not going away." 'One's too many' Carter was killed in September, "Realtor Safety Month," for the National Association of Realtors. Across the country, Realtors and agents are reeling in the wake of Carter's death. -- The suspect in the killing of Arkansas real estate agent Beverly Carter was asked this week by reporters: "Why Beverly?" Arron Lewis, 33, answered directly. "Because she was just a woman who worked alone -- a rich broker." Authorities have said they believe Lewis was a stranger to Carter, 49, whose body was found Tuesday in a shallow grave near Cabot, about 20 miles northeast of central Little Rock, Arkansas. It could have been me," said Karen Crowson, a broker and past president of the Arkansas Realtors Association.
