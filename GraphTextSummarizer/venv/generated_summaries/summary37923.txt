The suitcase was pulled out of the Yarkon River in Tel Aviv, where police have been searching for Rose Pizem, Mickey Rosenfeld said. Ron initially told police he accidentally killed Rose when he slapped her in a fit of rage but then changed his account. She told police she thought Ron sent Rose to an institution in France, although police, without elaborating, have said they have a telephone conversation that shows she knew the child's fate. Rose and her mother had been staying with Yaakov, who told police that Ron had taken the child and she never returned. French-Israeli girl Rose poses for a photograph with her mother, Marie Pizem.
