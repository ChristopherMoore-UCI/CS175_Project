Most of the sleeper's victims were discovered dumped in south Los Angeles alleys and covered with debris, authorities said. The bullet that doctors pulled from her body in 1988 became a key piece of evidence against the man now suspected of being the "Grim Sleeper" serial killer, blamed for the deaths of at least 10 women in the Los Angeles area between 1985 and 2007. The .25-caliber slug matched a weapon police now link to eight of those killings, which detectives say were committed by 58-year-old Lonnie David Franklin Jr. Washington is the only known survivor of an encounter with the Grim Sleeper, whose nickname comes from a 13-year gap between slayings police blamed on him. But now, investigators are looking into whether Franklin can be connected to any more of another 230 Los Angeles-area slayings, including some they previously considered solved. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty against Franklin, who was arrested in July 2010.
