A statement on the Northern Territory Police Force Facebook page said the victim's body had been recovered and a report would be prepared for the Coroner. The man had been fishing with his son, wife and daughter-in-law when the incident occurred, Northern Territory Police Sgt. Rangers shot dead two saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park on Sunday after searching through the night for a 62-year-old man who was reportedly snatched at a waterhole on the South Alligator River the previous afternoon. A crocodile expert, Grahame Webb, said it was unusual for the reptiles to attack at this time of year as they are rarely active during the cooler months, local media reported. "This is a tragic event and our thoughts are with the family during this very difficult time," said Commander Bruce Porter of the Northern Command.
