U.S. scientists, backed by a scientific engagement consortium that includes AAAS, Korea Society, U.S. Civilian Research & Development Foundation, Syracuse University and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, have worked with North Korean scientists and technical universities since 2007 to deliver lectures and share resources and knowledge about subjects such as reforestation, river reclamation, soil quality and agriculture. For 10 years, Syracuse University has worked with Kim Chaek University of Technology in North Korea to develop a digital information library so they would no longer have to rely on card catalogs. "To simply oppose and coerce the North Koreans without trying to engage them is a prescription for failure," wrote David Hillmers, the only U.S. astronaut to visit North Korea, in an opinion piece for the Houston Chronicle after his visit. And this practice continues, with U.S. scientists working with academics and researchers from adversarial states like Iran, Cuba and North Korea. "The level of exchanges between the United States and North Korea is quite limited when it comes to science engagement," she added.
