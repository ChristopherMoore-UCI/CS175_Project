The Briton, who will be hunting down a third successive win this season on Sunday, finished just over half-a-second ahead of Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo posting a time of one minute, 53.860 seconds in the third qualifying session (Q3). Force India's Nico Hulkenberg will start Sunday's race from eighth ahead of Toro Rosso's Jean Eric Vergne with Lotus' Romain Grosjean making up the top 10. And it was another disappointing day for the Spaniard's teammate Kimi Raikkonen -- the Finn failed to make it into Q3 and will start from 11th on Sunday. The 43-year-old, who replaced outgoing Stefano Domenicali, who quit as team boss on Monday, told reporters he was "extremely motivated" to succeed following Friday's practise session. Fernando Alonso, who won this race last season, found his Ferrari still off the pace and had to settle for fifth.
