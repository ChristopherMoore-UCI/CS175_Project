But they're not the only ones hanging around the remains of City Hall in Mariupol, recently the scene of clashes between supporters of the central government and backers of either independence or union with Russia for this part of eastern Ukraine.

He all but admitted he doesn't have enough men to control the city when asked whether he needed the steelworkers to help maintain order. And indeed, despite the destruction of City Hall, the scene is much calmer than it was a month ago, when the building stood behind a makeshift barricades of tires, bricks and paving stones. But steelworkers are not the only ones on patrol.
