" Chris Mooney, senior director of artist promotions at TuneCore, said artists looking for a No. 1 song have to prepare their fans for a release by using every social media tool available: YouTube videos, tweets, Facebook postings, etc. TuneCore distributes music for artists through partners such as iTunes and Spotify for a nominal fee. Two of the songs he helped produce are up for Grammys this year: Maroon 5's "Payphone," nominated for best pop duo or group performance, and Trey Songz's "Heart Attack," which is competing for best R&B song. There are plenty of songs that are good tunes, Stennett said, but "when you've got a record that works, you need a record label that will then work that record." " Silvio Pietroluongo, director of charts for Billboard, said the conundrum the music industry faces is that while albums aren't selling nearly as well as before, the music is bigger than ever. But for a label to justify the expense of promoting an artist, the singer and song have to gel in a way that will connect with the audience, she said.
