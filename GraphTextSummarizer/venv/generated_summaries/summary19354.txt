-- Former Illinois congressman Dan Rostenkowski, who rose through the ranks of Chicago's rough-and-tumble political scene to become one of the most powerful men on Capitol Hill, has died, according to the office of Chicago Alderman Richard Mell. Among other things, prosecutors alleged he used public funds for personal matters and to pay employees who did little actual work. "Dan Rostenkowski devoted his life to his community, Chicago and the state," Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan said Wednesday. During his tenure as chairman, the powerful Democrat played a key role in passing major reforms of both Social Security and the tax code, among other things. In 1988, Rostenkowski helped pass a controversial expansion of Medicare designed to protect seniors against catastrophic medical expenses.
