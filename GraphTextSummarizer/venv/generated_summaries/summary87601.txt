" Born and raised in London, Berners-Lee said his invention was "one of the many things in the show that Britain can be proud of -- and an essential thing of it was that it was an open thing, it wasn't something that could be controlled by any one government." Berners-Lee, who co-founded and is the director of both W3C and the World Wide Web Foundation -- devoted to improving and furthering the potential of the Web -- has called for governments to be more transparent in how they release data, and is also critical of government censorship of information on the internet. In an interview with CNN, the British computer scientist who invented the Web in 1989 said he was deeply moved to be honored for his pioneering role in the digital revolution -- and hopes the combination of the Web and the Olympics can create a new understanding between people across the world. "The Web is about connecting people through technology, not about documents," Berners-Lee told CNN. "The Olympics are about connecting people too. It would be nice if the Olympics bring people to use the Web to understand each other, break down national and cultural barriers and look at each other from a more beautiful point of view."
