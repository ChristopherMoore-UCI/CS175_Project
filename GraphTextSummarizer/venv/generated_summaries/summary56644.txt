He was much vaguer on the Liberal Democrats' greatest ambition -- electoral reform -- that would probably give them more seats in parliament. -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and his Conservative rival David Cameron both offered to form an alliance with the minority Liberal Democrats Friday as they jostled for power after an election that failed to create an outright winner. The center-right Conservatives won more seats than Brown's Labour party in Thursday's fiercely-contested vote but lacked the majority needed to form an effective government -- a rare outcome in British politics. Hung parliament casts shadow over markets Several high-profile incumbents lost their seats overnight, including former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, of Labour; and Liberal Democrat Lembit Opik, who had been in parliament for 13 years. Brown said Friday he would be willing to negotiate with any party leader, but said that Cameron and Liberal leader Nick Clegg were "entitled to take as much time as they feel necessary" to forge a coalition.
