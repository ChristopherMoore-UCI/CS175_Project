Friday, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen will face sharp questions about the missing emails and hard drive crashes in an appearance before the House Ways and Means Committee. This, after the tax agency revealed that it lost an unknown number of emails in the investigation due to hard drive crashes from years ago. Thus the only permanent storage of emails was on employees hard drives. We don't know exactly how many are missing because a) they are missing and b) the IRS has managed to retrieve 24,000 of the lost emails by searching through the accounts of dozens of other IRS employees who could have been included in those emails. The IRS has supplied CNN and others with emails between Lerner and the IT department during the time of the crash.
