Some band members have said Champion died after taking part in a rite of passage called "crossing Bus C." One member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that students "walk from the front of the bus to the back of the bus backward while the bus is full of other band members, and you get beaten until you get to the back. The medical examiner's office has said Champion "collapsed and died within an hour of a hazing incident during which he suffered multiple blunt trauma blows to his body." Ammons said in the Tuesday statement that he suspended the summer band camp because of the ongoing investigation into Champion's death and other band-related hazing incidents. Champion, 26, collapsed in Orlando on a bus carrying members of the band after a November football game that included a halftime performance by the group. "Our top priority is the health, safety and well being of students," said FAMU President James Ammons on Tuesday. Those charges are unrelated to the suspected hazing-related death of drum major Robert Champion in November.
