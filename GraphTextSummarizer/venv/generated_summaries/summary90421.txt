"Once the police made it clear that my drug dealing wasn't gonna affect the outcome of what was going on, I became a little bit more transparent." Lee and Syed were seniors at Woodlawn in Baltimore County, Maryland, in January 1999, when she disappeared. A star witness in the case against Syed was fellow Woodlawn High School student Jay Wilds, who stirred debate this week in a three-part interview with The Intercept. Wilds told police that he helped Syed dig the hole where her body was buried and led police to her missing car. Wilds originally told police that he saw Lee's body in the parking lot of a Best Buy near the high school. He says he was unfairly portrayed in the podcast, which revisited in-depth the investigation and trial of Syed -- a key part of which was centered on Wilds' testimony.
