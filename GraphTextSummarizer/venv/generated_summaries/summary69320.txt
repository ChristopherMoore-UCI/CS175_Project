"There are spies among our revolutionaries who send our coordinates to the snipers and Gadhafi loyalists firing from inside Bani Walid, and the proof is that their attacks have been precisely targeted," said Emad Ziglam, a field commander for anti-Gadhafi troops outside the city, about 170 kilometers (105 miles) southeast of Tripoli. The accuracy of attacks on forces in and around Bani Walid -- home to a powerful tribe loyal to Gadhafi -- has prompted allegations by at least one military field commander that Gadhafi supporters may have infiltrated into the ranks of anti-Gadhafi units. " But Gadhafi loyalists were still putting up stiff resistance in Bani Walid, Sabha and Sirte, the birthplace of the strongman. NATO estimates that 200,000 of Libya's 6 million people remain threatened by Gadhafi loyalists. Niger officials have refused to heed the demand of Libya's interim government that it hand over Gadhafi family remembers and/or regime officials who have fled there.
