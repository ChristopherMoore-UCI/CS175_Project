And for a moment, I asked myself, "Then what?" Bullying has been around as long as schools have; it's far older than Facebook, designer jeans and lunch money. Telling kids not to tattle does nothing to help them work through the problem; telling them that the bully will grow out of it or that people get nicer in high school and in college -- even if that's what we remember happening -- also falls on deaf ears. (In fact, one student who commented on our blog at CNNStudentNews.com wrote that whoever said sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me "has obviously never been to middle school.") This is why it is crucial, according to educators and counselors at the IBPA, that students themselves are involved in finding solutions to bullying. Another takeaway from the IBPA conference: Victims who've had someone defend them -- even if was just a single peer -- are better adjusted than undefended victims of bullying.
