-- Popular apps for the iPhone and iPad, some of which usually go for up to $20, were being offered for free in Apple's online App Store on Monday, possibly in conjunction with the store's fifth anniversary. MapMyRide+, photo-text app Over and recipe app How to Cook Everything also were among the apps being offered for free Monday. Apple argues that Amazon infringes on its trademark by calling its store that sells apps an "app store." Google's app store, for users of its mobile Android operating system, is called Google Play. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the free apps.
