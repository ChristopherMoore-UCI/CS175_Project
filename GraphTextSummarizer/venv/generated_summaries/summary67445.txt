The goal is to get all juveniles out of prison and change the laws governing minor offenders, Ihsan said. Students, teachers, construction workers, public transport drivers and lawyers among others dropped off pairs of sandals at centers set up around the country. There have been numerous cases of minors brought to court over petty crimes. Last year a 12 year-old-boy was tried and later acquitted for allegedly stealing loudspeakers from a mosque in West Java. To express disappointment over the verdict, the sandals would be given to different government institutions instead, Kurniawan said on Thursday -- namely the national police, the attorney general's office, the Supreme Court, the Justice and Human Rights Ministry and juvenile detention centers.
