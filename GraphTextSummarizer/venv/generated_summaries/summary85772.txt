-- The son of an Iranian woman facing imprisonment and possible execution by stoning has been told that Iranian authorities will contact him about his mother's case Thursday, a human rights activist said Sunday. Mostafaei has gone into hiding since last weekend after being interrogated by Iranian authorities, human rights groups say. Advocates and Mostafaei say his wife and brother-in-law are being held by Iranian authorities. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by another means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. Mina Ahadi, chairwoman of the International Committee Against Stoning and Execution, said authorities contacted the son of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani on Sunday.
