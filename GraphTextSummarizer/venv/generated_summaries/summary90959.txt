One figure in the group -- a 30-year-old British-Iranian identified only as "CE" who was allegedly trained by al Qaeda terrorists in Somalia in 2006 -- was later placed under a "control order," a British administrative measure to restrict the freedom of movement of terror suspects. The documents reveal British security services believed Emwazi was part of a radical West London recruitment network for terrorist groups in East Africa. British authorities believe he hailed a London taxi, and disappeared. According to the document, British Home Secretary Theresa May "maintained she has reasonable grounds for suspicion that since his return to the United Kingdom in February 2007, CE has continued to associate regularly with members of a network of United Kingdom and East African-based Islamist extremists which is involved in the provision of funds and equipment to Somalia for terrorism-related purposes and the facilitation of individuals' travel from the United Kingdom to Somalia to undertake terrorism-related activity. The Lebanese-born Berjawi, from St. John's Wood in West London, swiftly rose to a senior position in Al-Shabaab and likely continued to work closely with the senior al Qaeda operative Fazul Mohammed, according to a profile by Raffaello Pantucci, the director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute.
