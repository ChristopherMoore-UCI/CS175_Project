" Then there was the renewed rocket attack from "Gaza terrorists" that struck in the Hof Ashkelon area of southern Israel on Wednesday night, according to an Israeli military spokesman. But its military did respond to the new rocket attacks, by "targeting terror sites across" Gaza, according to Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner. -- One moment there are rocket attacks and claims Israel fired at Palestinian fishermen. Is Israel's military action a blip or does it signal a full-scale resumption of the offensive that left nearly 2,000 in Gaza dead, most of them civilians? Israel, as well as the United States and European Union, labels Hamas -- the Islamist militant group that controls Gaza -- a terrorist organization; Hamas rejects Israel's right to exist.
