" But it was Dick Etchberger and not John Daniel who died that day, and ever since, Daniel has wondered why fate spared him. Class Jerry W. Daniel, sits on a shelf in the living room alongside a painting depicting his grandfather being hoisted into the helicopter as Etchberger looks on: an artist's rendering of his last memory of Etchberger. -- That morning in March 1968 played out like a Hollywood movie: A secret CIA radar station on the top of a mountain in Laos, manned by a small group of Air Force airmen, is overrun by Vietnamese soldiers. In his last memory of that day, Etchberger is alive and hoisting Daniel, who was shot in both legs, into the helicopter. Daniel knows that if not for the bravery of Etchberger 42 years ago, it could easily be someone else sitting in this living room, living this life.
