She may have gotten her start singing power pop ballads in local contests in her native Philippines (which later translated to key performances for Oprah and Ellen), but her album has a more youthful, dance-pop feel. In 2008, she invited Charice on stage at Madison Square Garden in New York for a duet of her hit song "Because You Loved Me." And when she's not balancing on towering heels, Charice says she can pull off a pretty solid moonwalk: "When I was 4 years old, I thought that I wanted to be a dancer like Michael Jackson." Charice has already performed with her idols Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli, so who's next on her wish list? On that note, Charice says Oprah imparted sage advice during one of Charice's visits to "The Oprah Winfrey Show."
