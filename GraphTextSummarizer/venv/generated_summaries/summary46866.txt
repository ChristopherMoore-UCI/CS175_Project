RollingStone.com: Rage Against the Machine box set marks 20th anniversary of first LP Remastered to museum-clean standards, the reissued album comes with DVDs of live shows and music videos, plus demos that prove just how down and detailed the group had every song (even if Morello still couldn't resist changing solos). Tom Morello practiced an almost authoritarian control and extreme technical precision as he mimicked sampling, sent down thunderous power chords and, occasionally, indulged in almost New Age-y solos. Rage made hip-hop-tinged funk metal the new rebel music, taking over the alienation beat from grunge slackers and making Marxist sloganeering seem badass. Zack de la Rocha's blocky, academically aspirational rhymes preached leftist revolution, and guitarist and sonic architect RollingStone.com: 500 greatest albums of all time De la Rocha's throat-scraping eruptions about suicide (the fate of an outcast in "Settle for Nothing") and bullets in the head feel as primal as any lefty rock -- and maybe more so, heard from inside Morello's palace of sound.
