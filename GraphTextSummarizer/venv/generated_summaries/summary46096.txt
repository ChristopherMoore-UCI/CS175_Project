The 26-year-old from Dusseldorf takes over as world number one from Lee Westwood, almost 25 years to the month since Bernhard Langer became the first player -- and only other German -- to head the newly-created rankings in April 1986. Since winning his first European Tour tournament in Abu Dhabi in January 2008, Kaymer has gone on to lift eight more professional titles, including his first major success -- the 2010 U.S. PGA at Whistling Straits -- and two more victories in Abu Dhabi. Kaymer becomes only the 14th player, and sixth European, to become world number one and is the second youngest, behind Tiger Woods, to hold the honor. -- Germany's Martin Kaymer has been speaking about his rise to the top of the world golf rankings, despite losing the WGC-Accenture Match Play final to Luke Donald at the weekend. He also played a key role in Europe winning the Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor last year and won the 2010 Race to Dubai as Europe's leading golfer.
