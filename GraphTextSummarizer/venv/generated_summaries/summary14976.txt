A regular season game was first played in London in 2007 but, for the first time this season, two games were scheduled on the opposite side of the Atlantic. The Jacksonville Jaguars, Atlanta Falcons and Oakland Raiders will each host a home game at Wembley Stadium next season. "Our fans in the UK have continued to demonstrate that they love football and want more," NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. Both NFL games at Wembley Stadium sold out within hours. We hope that with three games in London next year we will attract even more people to our game."
