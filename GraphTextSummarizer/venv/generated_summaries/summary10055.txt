Bush said the prisoners would be questioned at the Guantanamo prison "subject to the new U.S. Army Field Manual" and "they will continue to be treated with the humanity that they denied others. In September of 2006, President Bush announced that 14 suspected terrorists who were being held in CIA custody had been transferred to the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. One of the 14 men has been moved from Guantanamo to U.S. soil and is being tried in federal court. During a news conference acknowledging the transfer of these prisoners, Bush told reporters what set them apart from other U.S. captives. "These are dangerous men with unparalleled knowledge about terrorist networks and their plans for new attacks," said Bush.
