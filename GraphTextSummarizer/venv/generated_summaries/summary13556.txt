While departments must closely referee to guard against excessive celebration with suspects, we can probably look the other way when it comes to some strategic use of otherwise standard equipment to honor a comrade. Not just because suspects are presumed innocent, but also because taunting suspects would undermine community confidence in police, and possibly undermine the arrest itself. -- When police arrested Eric Frein, accused in the death of a Pennsylvania state trooper, they symbolically used the equipment of their fallen brother, Cpl. Should the police be engaged in any symbolic taunting of suspects? Others might criticize the expenditure of government resources for purely symbolic gesturesâ€”like transporting an ordinary pair of handcuffs great distances, when a pair of local zip-ties could do the job.
