The society reviewed data from four randomized controlled trials and various observational studies that compared fertilization rates, embryo implantation rates and pregnancy rates of fresh eggs versus eggs that were frozen using a method called vitrification. Overall, frozen (or vitrified) eggs had fertilization rates between 71 and 79%, implantation rates between 17 and 41% and clinical pregnancy rates (positive pregnancy tests) between 36 and 61%. The lack of ice crystallization is key to the health of the egg because, as Nagy explained, "ice crystallization that happens during slow freezing is the biggest danger for egg ... cryopreservation because ice crystals can damage the cell membranes, and it results in the degeneration of the eggs. Freezing your eggs: the costs and other realities "Vitrification is basically the solidification of a solution without ice crystallization," said Dr. Zsolt Peter Nagy, embryologist and scientific director at Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta. "Doing fertility preservation by egg cryopreservation is an option for them today.
