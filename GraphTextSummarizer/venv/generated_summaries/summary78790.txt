He'll be strong enough to do that." Dujardin saw off strong competition in winning the accolade, with Winter Olympic skeleton gold medalist Lizzy Yarnold taking second place and athlete Jo Pavey, who won European gold in the 10,000 meters at the age of 40, coming third. Dujardin first became a European champion back in 2011, winning team gold in Rotterdam, before following that up two years later in Herning with two individual gold medals in the special and freestyle events. Sandwiched in between those triumphs came her team and individual Olympic gold medals in London -- the moment when she really first caught the British public's imagination. The 29-year-old -- riding Dutch gelding Valegro -- claimed two individual gold medals in the special and freestyle events, as well as a team silver, at the World Equestrian Games in Normandy earlier this year, while she also became the first ever Briton to win the World Cup dressage title in Lyon in April. -- Charlotte Dujardin's dressage dominance was recognized Wednesday evening in her native Britain as "The Girl with the Dancing Horse" was named the Sunday Times & Sky Sports Sportswoman of the Year.
