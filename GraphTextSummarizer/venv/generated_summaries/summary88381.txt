-- Egypt's interim leader on Sunday issued a strong warning to supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy, state news said. Fresh clashes erupted early Sunday in Helwan, south of Cairo, between residents there and pro-Morsy protesters, reported state TV, citing witnesses. Yet the prosecutor general's office, state-run Nile TV reported early Sunday, said protesters initiated the clashes, firing live bullets on security forces. It urged them to end their "incitement and hateful speech against Egyptian citizens and state institutions and end their violations of the law and endangering the safety of citizens," the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper said. Morsy is being held in relation for a jailbreak that took place during Egypt's 2011 revolution but well before he came to power, state media reported.
