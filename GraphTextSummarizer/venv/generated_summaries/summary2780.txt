-- When a couple left scathing comments on a travel review website that a hotel in northern England they had stayed at was a "filthy, dirty rotten stinking hovel," they thought no more about it. " Jenkinson told the BBC he would fight to get his money refunded, adding: "Annoyed isn't strong enough for how I feel about this, what happened to freedom of speech? " Jenkinson complained about the fine to local trading standards officers, who passed the complaint on to Blackpool Council. On investigating the couple found they had been fined by Broadway Hotel in the seaside resort of Blackpool, which reportedly told them its policy was to charge guests who had left bad reviews. The pair, from Whitehaven in Cumbria, wrote on TripAdvisor they chose the hotel because it had "ample parking," but the car park was so full they had to park at a nearby hotel.
