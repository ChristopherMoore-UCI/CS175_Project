But White House officials say Klain was picked because of his knowledge of the vast federal bureaucracy and his ability to pull the strings of government. Klain's appointment last week was meant partly to quell public anxiety about the virus. The White House says Klain won't be his own boss; he'll report both to Monaco and National Security Adviser Susan Rice. As such, aides say Klain's new job coordinating various federal agencies won't be public-facing, though they haven't ruled out putting him in front of cameras to address the government efforts. The seasoned Democratic operative President Barack Obama tapped last week to head his administration's Ebola fight got to work on Wednesday, though Ron Klain's new job is expected to unfold out of public sight.
