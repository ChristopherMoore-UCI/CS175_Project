A late-night robbery at a Wilmington, North Carolina, Pizza Hut ended with two suspects dead and one hospitalized, police said. Police were already monitoring area restaurants because of a recent spate of armed robberies. Police did not immediately say whether the three suspects were linked to other robberies. The suspects ignored commands from the officers, police say, and a shootout broke out. Three men forced a restaurant employee who was outside back inside at gunpoint and robbed those inside, police said.
