In a pre-release analysis, gaming site Polygon predicted "Mario Kart 8" will be the worst selling title in the franchise's history because of the relatively small number of Wii U consoles sold. Now, Nintendo is turning to "Super Mario Kart" once again, hoping the beloved, 22-year-old franchise can save sales of its faltering Wii U console. "The early response to Mario Kart 8 demonstrates that the best days for Wii U are still ahead," said Nintendo of America president and COO Reggie Fils-Aime in a press release. "Nintendo is preparing for a very strong first-party software line-up that people really want to try out," Nintendo President Satoru Iwata told CNN last June when the company let people try out six new Wii U titles including "Mario Kart 8." "By selling the software, we'd like to expand the hardware sales of the Wii U system. Mario Kart has always been a boon for the console it was released on since "Super Mario Kart" hit for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) 22 years ago.
