"I made a lot of good putts for pars on the front nine," he told reporters. But the Australian finished with a round of 68 to finish one clear of Fred Couples and fellow countryman Mark Leishman. "I respect the decision they make," Guan told reporters following his round. Guan is the first player to be punished for slow play in a major since France's Gregory Bourdy at the 2010 PGA Championship Leader Jason Day, who finished on six-under, could have ended the youngster's hopes had he managed to gain one more shot. He kept his cool on a difficult day where his participation in the final two rounds hung by a thread, after he was penalized on the 17th hole following a failure to heed the warnings given by referee John Paramor.
