Hundreds of people are feared dead following deep, devastating landslides Friday in a remote, mountainous part of far northeastern Afghanistan, a provincial governor said. "I want to say on behalf of the American people that our thoughts are with the people of Afghanistan, who have experienced an awful tragedy," Obama said during a wide-ranging news conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The United States is "ready to help our Afghan partners as they respond to this disaster," U.S. President Obama said Friday outside the White House. Close to 600 people from a nearby village then came to help dig people out when a new landslide struck, Adeeb said. A landslide crashed down around noon in an area with some 300 homes in the district of Argo in Badakhshan province, the area's governor, Shah Waliullah Adeeb, said.
