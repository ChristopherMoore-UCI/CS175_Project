On June 1, an Air France Airbus A330 crashed off Brazil while en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. Relatives of passengers on the doomed jet arrive at Marseille airport in southern France. But French Transport Minister Dominique Bussereau noted that France banned the Yemenia Airbus A310-300 several years ago because of safety concerns. The French navy and Yemeni authorities expanded search efforts for wreckage and bodies Wednesday, with a French frigate among the ships joining the search. -- Rescue workers have located the downed Yemenia Airways plane's distress signals, but not its flight data recorders, France's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
