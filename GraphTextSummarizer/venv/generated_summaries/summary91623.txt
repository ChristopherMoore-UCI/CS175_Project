Along with a charge of genocide, Mbanenande was convicted in the Stockholm District Court of gross violations of international law, including murder, attempted murder, inciting murder and kidnapping. At least 800,000 people in Rwanda were killed in the 1994 genocide, one of the worst mass slaughters in the post-World War II era. He also is accused of taking part in the hunt for Tutsis in the Ruhiro and Bisesero mountains where people had fled to seek safety. Mbanenande was accused of having an informal leadership role and using an automatic weapon to shoot at groups of people. The case involves several massacres in western Rwanda's Kibuye prefecture, where Mbanenande was born and raised.
