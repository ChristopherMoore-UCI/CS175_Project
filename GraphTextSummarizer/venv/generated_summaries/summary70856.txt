According to the American Cancer Society, previous studies have shown that removing the ovaries of a premenopausal woman with BRCA mutations can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer by 85% to 95%, and the risk of breast cancer is cut by 50% to 60%. "Importantly, for women who will be undergoing this surgery early in life, it's reassuring to see that it carries long-lasting benefits, substantially reducing ovarian cancer risk as well as total mortality risk," he added. "My doctors estimated that I had an 87 percent risk of breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer, although the risk is different in the case of each woman," Jolie wrote in a New York Times op-ed article in May. "Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much I could," she said. "I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex." According to Monday's study, women with BRCA1 mutations should have preventive ovarian surgery-- known as prophylactic oophorectomy -- by age 35, as waiting appears to increase the risk of ovarian cancer.
