With the playoff first leg in Bosnia tied 0-0, Portugal were looking for a fast start and got it as Real Madrid star Ronaldo netted early with a trademark free-kick. A second from Manchester United's Nani after 26 minutes looked to have eased Portugal's path to Ukraine and Poland next year, but Zvezjdan Misimovic converted an early second-half penalty following Fabio Coentrao's handball. An incident-packed second half saw Bosnia lose Senad Lulic for a second yellow, but a goal from Emir Spahic gave them renewed hope against the nervy hosts. Ronaldo then scored a superb second to equal Luis Figo's international record of 32 for Portugal and put his side 3-1 ahead. The Czechs led 2-0 from the first leg in Prague, and a fine individual goal from Petr Jiracek in the 81st minute sealed their qualification.
