The federal Immigration and Nationality Act allows U.S. citizens and lawful permanent resident aliens to petition for certain family members to obtain visas to immigrate to the country or to adjust their status to that of a lawful permanent resident alien. Referring to an aged-out applicant, Justice Elena Kagan said, "In the unavoidably zeroÂ¬-sum world of allocating a limited number of visas, the board could decide that he belongs behind any alien who has had a lengthier stand-alone entitlement to immigrate. But under complex immigration rules, which Kagan again said parts of which were "through and through perplexing," the government says several thousand other visa applicants age out of the process each year. " Under the court's ruling, only a small group of young visa applicants would be eligible under the Child Status Protection Act. -- Nearly all underage immigrants waiting for visas to stay in the United States will have to start the process all over again when they turn 21, the Supreme Court ruled on Monday.
