-- The FBI and New York police have released surveillance video of the unsolved 2008 bombing of a U.S. Armed Forces Recruiting Station in Times Square. The billboards will be seen in Times Square and much of New England, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. A federal law enforcement source told CNN that bomb technicians say the Times Square bomb was stronger than the device detonated during the Boston Marathon in terms of destructive capability. The grainy, seven-minute-long video shows a bird's-eye view of the explosive device and a suspect riding a blue bicycle around New York City between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said in 2008 that there is a "possibility" the three incidents are connected.
