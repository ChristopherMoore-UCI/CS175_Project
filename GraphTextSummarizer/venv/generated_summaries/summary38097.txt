" Redmond's excitement about solar energy has changed his family's daily routine and also saved money -- he paid $28.61 for electricity last month compared with $150 a month last year. Last year, 13,000 homes installed solar power. As concerns about global warming and rising energy costs grow, many families like the Redmonds are looking for ways to change the way they use energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates there are about 250,000 homes in the United States with some sort of solar power, although not all of them have taken the concept as far as the Redmonds. Yet he does look forward to many years of lower power bills.
