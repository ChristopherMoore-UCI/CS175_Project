" Meanwhile in Beaver Creek, America's Ted Ligety's victory in the men's giant slalom on Sunday saw him become the first man since the great Italian skier Alberto Tomba in 1991 to win four consecutive giant slaloms. -- Lindsey Vonn promising return to competitive skiing continued as she claimed fifth place in the women's World Cup Super-G at Lake Louise on Sunday. Vonn, who placed 11th in Saturday's downhill race and 40th in the same discipline on Friday, finished 0.85 seconds behind Sunday's winner Lara Gut. Vonn suffered a serious knee injury at the world championships in Schladming last February and her return to competition was delayed following a training crash last month. Following a 30-minute delay for wind and snow, Ligety won in a combined time of two minutes 35.77 seconds, comfortably quicker than compatriot Bode Miller (two minutes 37.09 seconds) who finished second.
