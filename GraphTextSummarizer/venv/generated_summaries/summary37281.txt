In a joint statement, MGM Studios and Dahlia Waingort, the producer of the film originally known as Raging Bull II, declared on Wednesday that Waingort's film now has the working title The Bronx Bull, and is in no way associated with Martin Scorsese's 1980 film Raging Bull. The announcement resolves a lawsuit brought by MGM in July that attempted to shut down production on the film, which traces the life of boxer Jake LaMotta in the years that span before and after Raging Bull. LaMotta, now 91 years old, has been cooperating with that project, but it otherwise had nothing to do with Scorsese's film, which won star Robert De Niro an Academy Award. That film is not related in any way to the 1980 motion picture entitled Raging Bull, and MGM is not associated with the film in any respect.
