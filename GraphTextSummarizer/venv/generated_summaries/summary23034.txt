" Shur recalled two instances when witnesses refused protection. The program has made some limited information available to the public on its website: It provides 24-hour protection to all witnesses while they are in a high-threat environment; witnesses receive financial assistance for housing and subsistence for basic living expenses and medical care; the program also provides for job training and employment assistance. Shur was an attorney in what was then the Justice Department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Section in the 1960s when he developed the idea to protect witnesses. While witnesses and their family members are free to return to their former identities, they do so at their own peril, Shur said. Shur said his work protecting witnesses put his family's life in danger.
