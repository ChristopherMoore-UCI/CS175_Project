"We lost points, but this is what we expected this weekend as we are not fast enough, but we lost minimum points and there will be better races to come," he added. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso showed his famed fighting qualities to take second place, limiting his losses in the title race, but he still trails Vettel by 13 points with three races to go. Alonso was able to take advantage of late technical problems for Webber to overtake the Australian for second place, but was still nearly 10 seconds adrift of Vettel by the finish. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber held off a fast finishing Lewis Hamilton in the McLaren for third place. Vettel took control of the race from pole at the Buddh International Circuit, while Alonso worked his way from fifth on the grid to third in the early stages as he moved past the McLaren pair of Hamilton and Jenson Button.
