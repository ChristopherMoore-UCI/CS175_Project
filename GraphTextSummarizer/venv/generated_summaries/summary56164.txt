There is no question that many powerful individuals and groups, some with whom Oswald had personal association, possessed the means, motive and opportunity to kill President Kennedy. Oswald's wife has recalled that he had also made a veiled threat against former vice president Richard Nixon. Lee Harvey Oswald almost certainly was the man who killed President Kennedy. To this day, the CIA says it did not have a relationship with Oswald and that it is not withholding anything important about the assassination from the public. If we could go back in time, maybe it would be possible to figure out why the CIA was so interested in Oswald or why the FBI was so responsive when Oswald demanded to see its agents while he was in a New Orleans jail in August 1963.
