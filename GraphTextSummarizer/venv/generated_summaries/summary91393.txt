The demonstration, in front the congressional building in Brasilia, seeks to stop the construction of the Belo Monte dam, which they say would flood at least 400,000 hectares (nearly a million acres) of forest, displacing 40,000 indigenous people and other local residents, and destroying various species of wildlife and insects. The construction of the controversial reservoir -- a $17 billion project -- was authorized in January by Brazil's Environmental Institute. The protesters want to give Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff a petition signed by half a million people from around the world who criticize the project. Set for completion in 2015, Belo Monte would be the second-largest dam in the country, behind Tucurui. -- Environmentalists and indigenous-rights supporters gathered in the Brazilian capital Tuesday to protest a hydroelectric dam project that they say would be devastating to the Amazon region.
