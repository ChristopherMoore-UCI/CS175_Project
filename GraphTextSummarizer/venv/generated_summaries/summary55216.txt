The analytics group, which monitors sales on more than 500 online retail sites, has been reporting Cyber Monday sales for the past four years. From Amazon to Best Buy to Macy's to Walmart, virtually every major online retailer was touting Cyber Monday deals. As of 3 p.m. ET, online sales were up 15% from last year, according to IBM Benchmark (formerly Coremetrics). "Now that we're starting to see some retailers promote Cyber Monday in their stores, I think we're really starting to ingrain this as the 'next big shopping day,' " said Squire, chief strategy officer for IBM Smarter Commerce. -- After years of being more hype than highlight, Cyber Monday appears on its way to its biggest outing ever.
