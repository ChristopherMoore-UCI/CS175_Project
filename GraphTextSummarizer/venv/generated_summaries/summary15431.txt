Early in 2013, just shortly after Hillary Clinton left her post as America's top diplomat, the foundation that was once simply known as the William J. Clinton Foundation was renamed to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation. Though the group said in a statement the boost came from a consolidation with other charities under the foundation, the jump could also be seen as the foundation moving to up its endowment and put itself on better footing in case Hillary Clinton runs for president in 2016. She led a number of sessions at the group's annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York this year and just last week led a session at a foundation event in Little Rock. The Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation brought in $144.4 million in 2013, a three-fold growth from the $51.5 million the foundation received in 2012, according to tax documents released on Wednesday. Hillary Clinton has been very visible at the foundation's events.
