The underworld we don't see every day," says architect Carlo Ratti. " "New techniques in biology allow us to characterize bacteria and viruses leaving our bodies. But he believes his team can build a robust platform to not only monitor changes in health, but also see what chemicals are being released into the water by industries, as well as monitor chemical security threats and even assess the impact of health policies by looking at other biological factors. His team is currently designing prototype smart platforms that collect sewage, filter it and use computational techniques to analyze any genetic material present to identify any viruses and bacteria, as well as spotting specific chemicals using a technique known as mass spectrometry. Their sewage success was indeed exciting as the types of organisms expected to be found are those associated with the gastrointestinal tract, such as salmonella, whereas flu viruses are respiratory.
