Already, the parent companies of the two ships that had most of the victims, Costa Cruises and MSC Cruises, have announced the cancellation of all scheduled stops in Tunis for 2015 and substituted them with other ports.

Such violence has been rare in Tunisia, at least on the scale of what happened Wednesday at the Bardo Museum in Tunis. "I hope other countries will support Tunisia, like they supported France after Charlie Hebdo,"  said Amir Foudieli, 33, who works for an export company, referring to the January massacre at the satirical magazine's offices in Paris. "They left the country illegally last December for Libya, and they were able to train with weapons there," he told private broadcaster AlHiwar Ettounsi TV.
