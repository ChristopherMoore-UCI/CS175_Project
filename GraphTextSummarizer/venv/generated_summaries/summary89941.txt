The government in Khartoum has in the past expelled aid agencies working in the Darfur region, where rebel groups and forces loyal to President Omar al-Bashir have fought. Sudan has seen raucous protests in recent months, some met with violent force by government security forces. "We help people affected by the conflict in Darfur, provide seed, tools, food and water, and re-establish contact between people separated by the fighting," it says on its website. In April, a splinter group from the largest rebel group in Darfur signed a peace agreement with Khartoum. -- Sudanese authorities ordered the Red Cross to halt its activities in the nation starting Saturday, citing technical reasons, the aid agency said.
