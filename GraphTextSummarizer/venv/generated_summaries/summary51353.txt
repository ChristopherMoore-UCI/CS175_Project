White House: Levinson not a government employee when he made Iran trip That allegation doesn't sit well with Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who is on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. The CIA did not tell the truth to the American Congress about Mr. Levinson," McCain said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union." " Levinson disappeared in Iran in March 2007 during a business trip, purportedly undertaken as a private investigator looking into cigarette smuggling. Iran's previous president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said he was willing to help find Levinson, and the family received what then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton described in 2010 as "proof of life. " McCain said he was "confident we are doing everything that we can" to get Levinson released from Iran, He added that any negotiations in Levinson's case should also include attempts to free other Americans who are believed to be in Iranian custody.
