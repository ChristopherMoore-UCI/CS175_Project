Khalifa Haftar said Libyan authorities had not been consulted and, in any event, military action would not solve the problem.

EU leaders are considering a plan that would involve military action against people smugglers at the source -- before they load their boats with human cargo. The European Union is struggling to cope with an increasing number of people crowding into unseaworthy boats and trying to reach European shores.
