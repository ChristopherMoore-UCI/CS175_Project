Ali says Moussavi campaign managers organized supporters, planned gatherings and garnered support through Facebook pages dedicated to the Reformist candidate. Moussavi supporters claim filtering particularly targeted their candidate after his popularity soared and authorities feared he would pose a serious challenge to Ahmadinejad. President Ahmadinejad also jumped on the social networking bandwagon ahead of the race. Supporters of defeated Iranian presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi protest in Tehran on June 13, 2009. Facebook is also very popular in Iran, says Ali.
