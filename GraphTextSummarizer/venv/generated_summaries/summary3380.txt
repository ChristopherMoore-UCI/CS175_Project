It's an entire industry of ideas and marrying the art of commerce with it," said Anne Kwon Keane, fashion director for Lucky magazine. From there, Fashion Week designs will eventually trickle down into mass market retail. Tamara Albu, an associate professor of fashion design at Parsons The New School of Design, said even for consumers who are "just not that into it," -- it being fashion -- the industry's influence is unavoidable. Insiders assert the pomp, circumstance and air kisses of Fashion Week don't just matter to the economy and your closet; they encourage creativity just like events that celebrate any other medium, such as music or fine art. On Thursday, Mellia will open his latest exhibition, "The Death of Fashion," which questions whether Fashion Week "has become an anonymous repeating stereotype."
