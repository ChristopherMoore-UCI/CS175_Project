At least 48 people died in the temblor, President Otto Perez Molina said in a Twitter post Wednesday night, and doctors treated at least 150 others for injuries. iReport: Video from the quake Roads collapsed in multiple locations around the Pacific coastal region of Guatemala, Perez Molina said. It was fortunate that the school year in Guatemala had recently come to end, so that no children were inside the school buildings that were damaged, Perez Molina said. "Fortunately, the damage that we have is not at the same level," Perez Molina said Wednesday.
