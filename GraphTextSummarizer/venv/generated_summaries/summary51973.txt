On Wednesday, a French defense firm provided new satellite images that showed 122 objects floating in the southern Indian Ocean, not far from other satellite sightings that could be related to Flight 370, Malaysia's acting Transportation Minister Hishammuddin Bin Hussein said. When photographed Monday, they were about 125 miles (201 kilometers) away from the spot where a French satellite captured images of a floating group of objects Sunday. On March 24, Australian officials said they saw two objects in the southern Indian Ocean that could be related to the flight. Here's a rundown of how many times we've been through this: On March 9, Vietnam's navy spotted a floating object about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Vietnam's Tho Chu Island, which is off the country's southwest coast in the Gulf of Thailand, Vietnam National Search and Rescue Committee spokesman Hung Nguyen told CNN. On March 20, CNN quoted Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott as saying that authorities had spotted two objects in the Indian Ocean that were possibly related to the search for missing Flight 370.
