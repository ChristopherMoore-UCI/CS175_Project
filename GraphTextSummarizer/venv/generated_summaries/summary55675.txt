The sport's governing body in Japan also said that they would make a final decision over whether to reschedule the upcoming friendly fixtures against Montenegro on March 25 and New Zealand on March 29 later this week. A number of high profile sporting events across Japan have been called off as the country continues to come to terms with the devastation caused by Friday's earthquake and tsunami. However, as the death toll rose to almost 2,000 and aftershocks continued across the country, the president of the International Skating Union (ISU) Ottavio Cinquanta said it would not be possible to hold their annual competition in Japan. "Taking into account the continued critical developments in Japan, the staging of the championships is not possible," he said in a statement. Following the 8.9 magnitude quake, it was confirmed on Monday that the World Figure Skating Championships, due to take place in Tokyo between March 21-27, have been postponed.
