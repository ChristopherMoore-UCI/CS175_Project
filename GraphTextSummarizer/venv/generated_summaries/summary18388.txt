None of the 8 Uber "competencies" that are expected of employees focuses on appealing to customers, much less consumer values like responsibility for passenger safety, privacy, data protection or the right to a rating-free experience after a ride. Uber's privacy policy is vague and not transparent, which could lead to abuses of customer data security, especially in full-steam-ahead cultures where the message is anything goes if it drives scale. If Uber changes its approach from narcissism to accountability by focusing on consumer relationships and loyalty, it will have a chance at a bright future. When taken to an extreme, corporate narcissism can put customers at risk. Or consider Target, whose CEO, Gregg Steinhafel, lost his job earlier this year after presiding over many missteps, including a massive credit card data breach that affected millions of customers.
