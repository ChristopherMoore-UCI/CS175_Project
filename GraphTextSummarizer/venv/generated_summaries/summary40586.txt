" Libyan guards exchanged kicks and blows with Ugandan security on Sunday, the first day of the summit, as they approached the entrance marquee for the opening ceremony, according to journalist Samson Ntale. "Fights are always a result of the lack of respect by the Libyans to their hosts," said Ejison Kwesiga, spokesman for Uganda's presidential brigade. -- Scuffles between Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi's presidential guard and Ugandan security personnel have twice broken out at the African Union summit on the shores of Lake Victoria, officials said. An argument erupted when Ugandan authorities attempted to escort Gadhafi through the entrance. Heads of state were being moved to another room, and a scuffle broke out when Ugandan authorities attempted to escort Gadhafi there.
