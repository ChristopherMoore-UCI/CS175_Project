This acknowledgment gives veterans suffering from ALS access to much-needed benefits such as health care, disability compensation, and many other essential support systems. Retired veteran Thomas Cuddy is so weakened by ALS that he often can't catch himself when he slips. Weisskopf was co-author of a study in 2005 that found that men with any history of military service are about 60 percent more likely to develop ALS than men who did not serve in the military. While it may seem as if the VA has moved slowly in reacting to these studies, Weisskopf notes that there is still a lot that is unknown about the connection between ALS and military service. Several subsequent studies published in the last decade have established an increased rate of ALS among Gulf War veterans.
