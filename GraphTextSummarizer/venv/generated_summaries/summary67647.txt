-- Endurance swimmer Diana Nyad was stung by a sea creature for a second time Saturday night and was being treated by doctors, her team said in a blog post, leaving the continuation of her swim in question. Doctors from the University of Miami gave the swimmer a shot to reduce inflammation, oxygen and other medication, the blog said, and after treading water for an hour Nyad said she felt better. A National Institutes of Health report says an encounter with a Portuguese man o' war can lead to "significant systemic reactions" but rarely death. The team initially said Nyad had likely been stung by a moon jellyfish but revised that to say it was the more troublesome Portuguese man o' war. Fortified by chicken soup, Nyad was making good progress until the Saturday evening incident.
