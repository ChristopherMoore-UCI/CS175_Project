Greenberg and his client for this survey -- the Women's Voices Women Vote Action Fund -- assert that Democrats can motivate more women to vote if party candidates push an agenda that includes equal pay, equal treatment by insurance companies and more affordable child care. The vote was 53-44, and Sen. Barbara Mikulski was on the losing side: Democrats did not have enough votes to advance Senate legislation designed to guarantee women equal pay. The downside, in his view: "Unmarried women are the key to 2014, but are underperforming now on vote margin and turnout. ... And at the same time their interest in voting is down, Greenberg warns -- as you can see in the chart to the left -- that the unmarried women who are planning to vote in November are not as supportive of the Democrats as they were in 2012 (Though the current 2014 numbers are better than in GOP midterm rout of 2010). In addition to unmarried women, Greenberg looks at voting sentiment among a broader group he labels the "Rising American Electorate": unmarried women, young voters and people of color.
