A report by state news agency Xinhua said that the group, which Beijing regards as a dangerous doomsday cult, cheated people, illegally collected money and "violated the law under the guise of religion. " "A series of acts by its members have harmed people's lives and property, and disrupted social stability," Xinhua said. In a statement provided to CNN in June, members of the group responsible for its English-language website said it was "very natural" for the Chinese Communist Party to blame the group for the McDonald's death because the Party slandered and then suppressed those that disagreed with it. The group has been on a list of 14 banned religious groups issued by China's Ministry of Public Security since 1995. Among those arrested were nearly 100 "backbone members", Xinhua said.
