The Mercedes team has denied reports that seven-time world Formula One champion Michael Schumacher must improve next season or face having his three-year contract cut short. German newspaper Bild reported this week that Schumacher's future was in doubt unless he did better in 2011, but Mercedes-Benz Motorsport vice-president Norbert Haug dismissed those claims while talking to reporters at a conference at the Japanese Grand Prix. Rosberg, 25, is seventh in the drivers' standings with four races to go -- while Schumacher is 76 points back in 10th as Mercedes has been unable to emulate the success of the double world champion Brawn team that the German manufacturer took over at the end of last year. "It's not easy for anybody to compete against such a guy, and Michael does that quite well -- not always in qualifying but if you look throughout the season, if you take into consideration that he was not in Formula One for three years, we are heading in the right direction and there is certainly not an ultimatum," he said. So therefore we have to discuss whether it makes better sense for one of the brands to go into LMP1, and the other brand into Formula One.
