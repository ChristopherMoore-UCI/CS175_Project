Throughout the one-day session in Washington's Woolly Mammoth Theatre, the flip sides of the crisis were invoked: What we can see -- stained beaches and boats, dizzying patterns of iridescent sheens on the Gulf's surface, birds drenched in petroleum, miles of boom, some of it hopelessly tangled or unable to prevent oil from drifting into vital marshland. " Watch Sylvia Earle's TED Prize talk Carl Safina Safina, of the Blue Ocean Institute, got emotional when he told a story about a bottlenose dolphin splattering oil out its blowhole and seeming to seek help as it followed a fishing boat in the Gulf. Casey DeMoss Roberts Roberts, of the Gulf Restoration Network, sketched the ways in which the oil industry has become embedded in Gulf communities that once relied only on fishing for their livelihood. She noted that oil spills tend to be "politically very galvanizing," with photos of oil-soaked birds drawing an emotional public response. She added that the military and political costs of getting oil from the Middle East and other regions of the world still have to be paid for, though it hits people when they pay their taxes, not at the pump.
