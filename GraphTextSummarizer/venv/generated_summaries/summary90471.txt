"Arizona may have good intentions, they may be trying to make up for where the U.S. government has failed, but what the judge is saying is, this is not the way to do it," he said As other states pass similar laws, Toobin said, the issue is "very much destined for the Supreme Court." State Sen. Russell Pearce, author of the law, said he foresaw a protracted legal fight from the beginning. The parts of the law that took effect Thursday include a ban on so-called "sanctuary cities" -- municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. Bolton's ruling Wednesday temporarily blocked some of the most controversial provisions of the law, known as SB 1070, including the requirement that police officers check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said the ruling reflects the government's argument that immigration enforcement should be dealt with at the federal level. The Justice Department had urged a slower schedule, and the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals agreed in a brief order issued Friday evening.
