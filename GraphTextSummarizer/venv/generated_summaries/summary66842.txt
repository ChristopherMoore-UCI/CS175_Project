In Oakland, California, police issued a third notice for demonstrators to vacate city parks on Saturday, police spokeswoman Officer Johnna Watson told CNN. This scuffle took place after, on Saturday night, police in riot gear arrested 17 people as they cleared furniture and tents from an Occupy encampment near the city's civic center, police spokesman Sonny Jackson told CNN. On Sunday, Mayor Sam Adams praised police for showing professionalism and restraint, noting the lack of serious injuries incurred over several police actions and stressing a calm, well-communicated approach. In the early-morning hours Sunday, police told demonstrators to leave the streets or face arrest. Protesters became upset when police began removing a food table from a park, some of them surrounding a police car.
