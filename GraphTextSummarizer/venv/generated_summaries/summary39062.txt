Roger Greenberg (Ben Stiller) is another neurotic narcissist, a middle-aged loner who comes back to Los Angeles to house-sit while his brother enjoys a long vacation in the Far East. Uneventful (the dog gets sick, and, uh, that's about it), "Greenberg" resembles the kind of films Gerwig has been making ("LOL," "Baghead"), but on a bigger budget and with one of Hollywood's most accomplished cinematographers on board (Harris Savides, whose credits include "Zodiac" and "Milk"). We soon learn that Greenberg used to front a band, but it fell apart after he turned down a recording deal, and he's been in New York ever since, under-achieving on a permanent basis. Greenberg throws himself on her with an awkward mixture of condescension and vulnerability, and their fumbling relationship -- physical but scarcely intimate -- serves as a kind of love story, or at least the unspoken promise of one. Stiller finds a note of defiance in this pathetic rationalization (along with his powerlessness, Greenberg has developed an angry streak), but it's clear to almost everyone how lost he really is.
