DePetrillo and Graham are so-called "white hat" hackers who investigate and expose security holes that have yet to be plugged by makers of new computer systems. The iPhone 5S, which went on sale Friday, has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. -- A group of hackers in Germany says it has found a way to bypass the fingerprint-sensor security system on the new iPhone 5S. The Touch ID system is meant for human fingerprints, of course, but it apparently works with animals, too. Tech companies generally appreciate being alerted to such security issues, which they can then patch before users' personal information is compromised.
