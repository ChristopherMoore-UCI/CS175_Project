Shapiro told Yahoo Sports this summer that he showered dozens of Miami players with cash and jewelry, paid restaurant and nightclub tabs and supplied prostitutes over an eight-year period -- and that several coaches were aware of the activity. -- The University of Miami announced Sunday that it is barring its football team from bowl consideration this year as it remains under investigation by the NCAA over allegations that a booster showered dozens of players with cash and jewelry, and supplied prostitutes for players. The Hurricanes community has been rocked since August by allegations leveled by Nevin Shapiro, a onetime Miami businessman serving a 20-year federal prison term for fraud. He pleaded guilty to securities fraud and money laundering in September, and his accusations against Miami were part of his agreement to cooperate with prosecutors, his lawyer told CNN in August. With their sixth win Saturday against the University of South Florida, the Hurricanes became bowl-eligible under NCAA requirements.
