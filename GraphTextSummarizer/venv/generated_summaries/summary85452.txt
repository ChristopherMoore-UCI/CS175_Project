According to international protocol, air crash investigations are handled by the country in which a crash occurs. Although air crash investigations can seem a lot like the TV show "CSI," though in the United States a crash is not legally considered a crime scene unless terrorism or sabotage is suspected early on. Before that an expert team of air crash investigators must complete a thorough analysis of the events leading up to the crash. Here, the NTSB relies largely on other parties, including the airline involved, the aircraft's manufacturer, and in the case of international flights, investigators from the airline's home country, to help examine evidence. But shortly after an incident, the NTSB interviews the pilots and then compares their stories with data from the plane's voice and data recorders to construct a picture of the plane's last moments.
