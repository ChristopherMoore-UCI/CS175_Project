"The Democrats policies are keeping people in minimum wage jobs, or worse, costing our economy jobs as Obamacare is doing," House GOP campaign chief Greg Walden said in a written statement to CNN. "Middle class security is the fundamental issue of this election and House Republicans are going to have to go home to their districts and explain to voters why they protected billions in subsidies for big oil companies but they won't give America's middle class a raise," Israel said in a statement to CNN. At their weekly Democratic caucus meeting, two top White House aides huddled with House Democrats to provide statistics and fact sheets they could use at home to demonstrate the economic impact of raising the minimum wage. Democratic candidates will point to the discharge petition in Washington and accuse House Republicans of blocking a vote on a higher minimum wage. Pressed on whether using the discharge petition was simply to make a political point, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Xavier Becerra told CNN said it comes down to a question a fairness.
