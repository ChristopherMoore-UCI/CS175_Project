The trio from Rio, having been rejected by other public notaries, found their way rural Sao Paulo state and to Domingues because she is a student of polyfidelitous relationships -- ones involving more than two partners, but where there is fidelity between the members. But to Domingues, a public notary in the city of Tupa in Sao Paulo state, there is nothing preventing nontraditional relationships from being granted "stable union" status. Through mutual friends, the trio found Domingues and traveled more than 600 miles from Rio, into the interior of Sao Paulo state, to Tupa. Formerly an IT manager, Domingues now is a doctoral student at the University of Sao Paulo, studying family law. Her research looks at cultures, places, sociology, anthropology, religion and the history of family and intimate relationships in Brazil.
