Referring to the film's back-and-forth chronology, which he calls "a very daring piece of work," he marvels at how Cassidy and Penn fit the pieces together. Holbrook has had a busy couple months, with his performance nominated for critics' awards as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award. But Holbrook also paid tribute to a person seldom considered by the audience: the film editor, in this case Jay Cassidy. Holbrook has nothing but praise for Penn's work on the film. By changing the sequence of two scenes, Cassidy gave the film an added power -- which made all the difference to how his performance was perceived, Holbrook says.
