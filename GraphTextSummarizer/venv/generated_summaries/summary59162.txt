What we need are more efficient ways of delivering legal help and less expensive nonlawyers who can provide legal assistance. But the demand for ordinary legal help is simply too massive to meet with increased court funding, legal aid or pro bono work. Some legal professionals have called for more public money for legal aid clinics and courts to provide free legal help and for lawyers to do more pro bono work. Giving these American households just one hour of help from a lawyer to manage a maze of legal documents and court procedures would cost close to $20 billion. This doesn't even consider the cost of what clients want most from lawyers -- advice about how to avoid legal problems.
