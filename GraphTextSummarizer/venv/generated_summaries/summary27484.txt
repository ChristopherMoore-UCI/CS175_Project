The government in South Korea says so, and it's sinking $1.5 billion into upgrades it says will make mobile communications there 1,000 times faster than they are today. Korea's compact geography and existing wireless infrastructure mean that upgrades can happen faster and cheaper, and will reach more of the population than in geographically spread-out countries like the United States. Arguably the most wired country in the world, South Korea has led in mobile adoption since the 1990s. 5G is expected to be about creating intelligent networks that can handle those billions of connected devices. The increasing number of smartphones and tablets used in the United States is already beginning to tax existing communications networks.
