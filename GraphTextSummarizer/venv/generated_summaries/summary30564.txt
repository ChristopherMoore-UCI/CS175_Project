Two other striking ways to ward off Alzheimer's: Stop smoking and avoid heavy drinking, especially binge drinking. Bottom line: Most Alzheimer's, like heart disease and cancer, is a slowly developing chronic disease of aging that takes a decade or more to produce memory loss and dementia. He urges preventing Alzheimer's by screening for and treating cardiovascular disease in middle age, years before signs of memory loss and dementia appear. "The answer," he says, as do thousands of other Alzheimer's researchers, "is prevention," the same strategy we use against other chronic diseases of aging, such as heart disease. Much research ties Alzheimer's to the same lifestyle factors that cause heart attacks and strokes: high cholesterol, blood pressure, high blood sugar, insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity.
