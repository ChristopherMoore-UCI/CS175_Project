Only 13 soldiers had to be relocated while repairs brought their rooms up to living standards, Army officials said. -- An inspection of barracks across the United States found that only a small fraction of rooms required immediate repairs, the Army said Friday. "In the interim, the Army must continue to use and maintain aging barracks in our inventory," a written statement said. " The inspection, which took place between April 26 and 30, was prompted by a video posted online by a soldier's father showing sewage backing up, rusty staircases, peeling paint and other substandard living conditions in a Korean War-era barracks at Fort Bragg. The inspection was a result of recent reports of substandard living conditions in some barracks at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
