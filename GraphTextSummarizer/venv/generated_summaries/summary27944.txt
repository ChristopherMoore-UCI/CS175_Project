Director Spike Lee poses for a shot during the filming of "Miracle at St. Anna" in Rome, Italy. His latest, "Miracle at St. Anna," is the first Hollywood feature to tell the story of the African-American soldiers who fought in the U.S. armed forces during World War II , and as such it's a movie with a monumental mission. After his arrest, Hector won't talk, but a reporter finds a clue in the form of a priceless artifact hidden in his apartment: the head of a statue that once adorned a bridge in Florence that was wrecked by bombs during World War II. The movie tries to be raw and real, yet it isn't above trotting out a tyke who might have stepped out of Cinema Paradiso II to tag along with the soldiers as a mascot of sentiment. "Miracle at St. Anna" winds up as a pastiche of racial-historical correction, showboat atrocity, murder mystery, love story, and windy meditation.
