It gives all who enter pause about the important role the base has played training generations of Marines in forging military doctrine and fighting America's wars. The Quantico base, started during World War I, has been integral in training, education and forging military doctrine for America's battles. "This is perhaps the only command whose mission touches the farthest reaches of the Corps; decisions made here impact Marines aboard ship, fighting in the Global War on Terrorism, on guard duty at embassies across the globe and reserve duty throughout the United States," the Marines said. Jack Ryan, writer Tom Clancy's well-known character in novels and films, for example, took officer training there. Federal agencies, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI, share training facilities there.
