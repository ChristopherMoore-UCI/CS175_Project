And in 2011, Gallup found that 68% of Americans believed crime was getting worse, despite the reality of declining crime rates nationwide. Facebook user Stacey James Gordon wrote on CNN's Facebook page. Pair that with figures on overall crime: According to the FBI, the violent crime rate in the United States is about half what it was in 1992. Nearly eight of every 10 murders in the United States between 1993 and 2008 were committed by someone the victim knew, according a 2010 report by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. Rape, robbery, assault, even property crimes also fell in a well-documented decline that has gone on for years, albeit with a small upturn in 2012.
