This "blended learning"—having some teaching done by a teacher and some through digital learning systems—is a revolutionary concept that when effectively implemented has led to impressive learning gains, especially among students who have traditionally underperformed. This week, Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Washington, introduced legislation to set up five state pilot programs to implement this new instructional method Her idea is to harness the extraordinary progress that charter schools, along with other innovative public and Catholic schools, have had by combining teachers with personalized digital learning systems. The long-term cost of educating students, which has been rising exponentially since the 1960s, declines dramatically under blended learning. In some cases, students skip whole grade levels while using blended learning. For several generations now, schools have been failing students the same ways over and over and expecting a different result.
