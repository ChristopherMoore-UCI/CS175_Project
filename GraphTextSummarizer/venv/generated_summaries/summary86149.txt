-- A Libyan-backed ship carrying humanitarian goods for Gaza docked Thursday at Al Arish in northern Egypt and unloaded tons of aid from the Gadhafi Foundation, a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Israel came under fierce international criticism after Israeli navy commandos boarded a Gaza-bound Turkish aid ship in May and nine people died. The vessel reached Egypt after sailing from Greece on Saturday with 2,000 tons of aid. Israel said it must inspect all goods prior to their entering Gaza to ensure that weapons do not get into the hands of militants. The aid includes food, medicine, and construction materials to be taken from the port to the Gaza border about 25 miles (42 km) away.
