The two men arrested on charges of illegally purchasing cell phone SIM cards, using fake identity papers, will be questioned by police who want to know whether they sold cards used by the Mumbai gunmen, according to Calcutta Deputy Police Commissioner Jawad Shamim. An Indian man was arrested along with five foreigners in north India in February with sketches and maps of Mumbai locations that included several of those attacked last month. -- Indian police arrested two suspected dealers in black market cell phone chips -- a vendor and a Srinigar police officer -- in the effort to trace how the Mumbai attackers got theirs. Indian security sources told CNN sister network CNN-IBN on Thursday that a Bangladeshi national bought cell phone SIM cards for the attackers at several locations inside India. SIM cards -- subscriber identity modules -- are portable memory chips that make it easy to switch cell phones.
