But a line of attack that was used consistently last night by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and later by Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, tried to call into question whether community organizers put their country first. But the one thing I know about community organizers is that they know how to organize communities. As a child growing up in the Clinton Park neighborhood in Houston, Texas, my parents were just regular folks trying to raise their five children (sounds like Gov. Sarah Palin). They were always present at our local elementary school (sounds like Gov. Sarah Palin) and were heavily involved in our church. Roland Martin says the Republican statements downplaying role of community organizers are a mistake.
