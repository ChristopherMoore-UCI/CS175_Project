She suggests patients educate themselves more on the process of living organ donation so that they become more comfortable speaking with potential donors. At the 275 transplant centers in the United States, African-Americans had at least a 35% lower chance of receiving a live kidney donation, said Dr. Erin Hall of the Department of Surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. "African-Americans had lower odds of obtaining living donor kidney transplantation at every transplant center in the country," Hall said. "Of course living donor kidney transplantation involves not only the recipient of the kidney, but also the donor," Hall said. "It could be the social networks of African-American populations." Hall advises frustrated African-American patients that it is never too late to take control of their medical care, and to continue to ask.
