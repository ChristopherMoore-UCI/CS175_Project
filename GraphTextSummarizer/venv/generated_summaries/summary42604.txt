Deterring future use of chemical weapons and degrading Assad's chemical weapons stockpile are the reason for U.S. military intervention, Rice argued. A stunning turn that could silence Syria war drums Obama told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday that he still needs the threat of military action in order to force a negotiated settlement. Obama must make a convincing case that the use of sarin gas in Syria was a moral abomination that the U.S. and the international community simply cannot tolerate, and that allowing it to go unpunished would leave an imminent and continued threat to U.S. national security. But with the Russian deal on the table, now even Iran has said it would support removing chemical weapons from Syria. As part of the president's media blitz, National Security Adviser Susan Rice said Monday that al-Assad's use of chemical weapons "threatens the national security of the U.S." and Israel.
