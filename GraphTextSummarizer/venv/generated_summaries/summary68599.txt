Even if Washington still thinks in terms of tidy lines separating nation states, mineral resources are about as influenced by such lines on a map as the water gushing down the Colorado River. In recognition of our shared destiny, the three countries should create a North American passport that would, over time, allow their citizens to travel, work, invest, learn and innovate anywhere in North America. If we established a North American passport and adapted our legal framework to economic realities, allowing people to move within our North American economy, we wouldn't need to debate whether to offer more than 10 million people U.S. citizenship. As evidenced by the recent political firestorm over President Obama's executive move to allow more undocumented workers to avoid deportation, it would take farsighted and courageous political leadership in all three countries to press for a North American passport. Work, tourist and student visas are necessities in the modern world to regulate the flow of people between sovereign states.
