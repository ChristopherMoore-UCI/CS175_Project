Since Ashya was born in Marbella, southern Spain, his family contacted a hospital there and then took Ashya to have proton therapy in  Prague in September. Ashya King, 5, had proton beam therapy and appears to have had no cancer for months, Jonathan Hartley said. Funes gave CNN details: In August, Ashya had surgery in Britain to remove the tumor. The Kings had serious concerns about the medical treatment that Ashya was receiving at University Hospital Southampton. Dr. Hernan Cortes Funes, who's overseeing Ashya's treatment, agrees with the assessment that Ashya is cancer-free, he told CNN on Monday.
