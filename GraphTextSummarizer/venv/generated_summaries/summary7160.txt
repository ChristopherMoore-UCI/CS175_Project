-- While Real Madrid signed Gareth Bale in the summer's highest-profile football transfer and added several other big names, Manchester United fans were left largely underwhelmed by the Premier League champion's moves in the off-season. But United, in its first season without legendary manager Alex Ferguson, was largely quiet under new boss David Moyes and Woodward as it defends its Premier League title, signing just Marouane Fellaini and relatively unknown Uruguayan Guillermo Varela. United has made a lukewarm start to the league season, winning two of its four games, although it began its Champions League campaign with a win Tuesday against Bayer Leverkusen. It left executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who replaced David Gill in the United hierarchy, to declare on United's website: "It has been a little over a year since our IPO (initial public offering) and in that time we have delivered on our targets and objectives. The record 20-time league winner in England -- self described as "one of the most popular and successful sports teams in the world" -- announced record revenues of $580 million for the year ended June 30, 2013 and said commercial revenues soared to a record $244 million.
