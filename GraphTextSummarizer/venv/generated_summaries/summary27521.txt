In reply Chris Gayle played in trademark fashion, smashing 43 runs off 21 balls and taking 18 off an over from Chris Tremlett before spinner James Tredwell made his mark on his first appearance in the tournament. First Russell was trapped LBW by Tredwell before fellow spinner Graeme Swann then dismissed Sarwan and Kemar Roach in consecutive balls. And England's thrilling victory was confirmed when a pinpoint throw from Trott allowed Matt Prior to run out Sulieman Benn. Batting first in Chennai, captain Andrew Strauss got England off to a bright start, hitting 31, while Jonathan Trott looked in good touch before he was dismissed for 47. Needing to win to stay in the tournament, England failed to capitalize on a quick start to their innings, losing a clutch of wickets in the middle period to post a modest total of 243.
