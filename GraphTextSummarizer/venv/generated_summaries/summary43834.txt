But what is urgently needed is the ability in politics but also in business and society as a whole to look beyond national borders, the next election or set of quarterly results. Yet we know what needs to be done, for example, to end the Ebola disaster, halt climate change, rid our world of hunger and begin the difficult process of healing deep divisions in our societies. In December, a global agreement must be reached in Paris on the framework and policies needed to halt climate change. How is it possible that climate change conferences continually fail to provide the breakthrough given that the science is so clear about the threat to future generations and our planet? Aggressive nationalism and politics based on prejudice and a false view of identity is on the increase in many countries.
