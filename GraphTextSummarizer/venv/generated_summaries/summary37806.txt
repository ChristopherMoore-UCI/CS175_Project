-- Award-winning pianist Roger Williams, who played before nine U.S. presidents and recorded dozens of albums over his long career, died early Saturday in Los Angeles after a struggle with pancreatic cancer, his assistant said. His records include "Born Free" and themes from the movies "Doctor Zhivago" and "Somewhere in Time." Williams' success helped land him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a 2011 induction into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame and many other honors. He then met Dave Kapp, the founder of Kapp Records, who suggested the musician change his name to Roger Williams, according to a biography on the Hit Parade Hall of Fame website. Former first lady Nancy Reagan noted in a statement Saturday that Williams played for nine presidential administrations, including her husband's. Even into his final weeks, Williams continued to perform and to champion such causes as music education.
