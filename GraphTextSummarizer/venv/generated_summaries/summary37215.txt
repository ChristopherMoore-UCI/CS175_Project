These laws  require a state photo ID to vote, limit  early voting, place strict requirements on voter registration and deny voting rights to Americans with criminal records who have paid their debt to society. Under the pretense of safeguarding elections against voter fraud, the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative advocacy group that receives funding from the billionaire Koch brothers (who also back the tea party), crafted and distributed model voter ID legislation introduced in more than 30 states this year. A report from the Brennan Center for Justice says strict ID verification requirements "address a sort of voter fraud more rare than death by lightning." While a diligent effort by citizens groups  compelled governors to veto photo ID laws in Montana, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina and New Hampshire and civil rights groups are urging the Justice Department to deny approval of laws passed in South Carolina, Florida and Texas under the Voting Rights Act, many states will reintroduce the legislation next year,  just in time for the 2012 elections. Unlike Butler, who is not a wealthy man, most Americans will not have to pay more than $100 to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed right.
