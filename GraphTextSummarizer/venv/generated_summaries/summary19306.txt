Big questions in Walker crash probe Next 'Fast & Furious' on hold Production of Walker's latest movie -- the seventh installment in the "Fast & Furious" franchise -- will be shut down "for a period of time," the studio said Wednesday. The studio also said it would donate "a percentage of proceeds from the upcoming home entertainment release of 'Fast & Furious 6'" to Walker's charity. "The groom was just back from duty in Iraq, and he was going to be deployed again soon and wanted to buy a wedding ring, but he said he just could not afford it," saleswoman Irene King told CNN. Since two different doctors did the separate autopsies, the difference in the description of their injuries does not mean the deaths were significantly different, Los Angeles County Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter told CNN. -- "Fast & Furious" star Paul Walker may have initially survived a horrific car crash but died moments later of a combination of injuries from the impact and the resulting fire, according to a coroner's report.
