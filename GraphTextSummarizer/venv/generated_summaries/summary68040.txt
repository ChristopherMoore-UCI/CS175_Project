Isla Vista is the adjacent residential quarter for students mostly enrolled in UCSB and others at Santa Barbara City College. "We know our students co-mingle with UCSB students and Isla Vista residents as part of our greater community and we all, as an extended family, are impacted by this unimaginable event. -- It all seemed like a Friday night prank in the beachfront paradise of Isla Vista, the off-campus housing quarter for students from University of California at Santa Barbara and the local community college. Officially, Isla Vista is an unincorporated community of 20,000 people -- 13,000 of them are students -- in Santa Barbara County, the county says. "Our hearts are aching as we learn about the tragedy that unfolded in Isla Vista last night," a Santa Barbara City College statement said Saturday.
