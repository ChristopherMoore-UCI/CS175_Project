The latest attacks raised concerns among ordinary people about the ability of Iraqi security forces to ensure security in this country, particularly after the United States withdrew troops by the end of 2011. And a fifth explosion, a car bomb, blew up near an elementary school in the Shulaa neighborhood of northwestern Baghdad, police said. But in the past week, a number of Sunni politicians who are members of Iraqiya bloc were arrested in Baghdad and Diyala province, officials with Iraqiya bloc said. A third car bomb exploded on a road in the al-Hurriya neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad, killing at least one person and wounding 13 others, police said. The first two attacks took place in Sadr City, an area in eastern Baghdad, police said.
