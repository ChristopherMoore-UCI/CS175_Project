The riots in July were prompted by long-simmering resentment between minority Uyghurs and majority Han Chinese. The unrest continued in August when Uyghurs were accused of attacking Han Chinese with syringes filled with different substances. The others received sentences ranging from 10 years in prison to life in prison. -- Five more defendants were sentenced to death for their roles in summer riots that killed around 200 people in western China, officials said Thursday. In September, China sent 7,000 security personnel to Urumqi to ease tensions after Han Chinese protested the syringe attacks.
