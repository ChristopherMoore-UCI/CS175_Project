I'm hoping because of the Olympics and the World Cup, they'll have to open up more air flights, because with fewer flights, that's how the cost skyrockets. " Similarly, airlines don't sell airfare to either host city until about 11 months beforehand -- for flights to London for July, 2012, start looking around June of 2011. [But] I think Rio is going to be a challenge because there are fewer hotels in Rio than London or Beijing; it'll be a challenge to get adequate accommodations for the event sponsors and the public. The Winter Olympic games haven't yet begun in Vancouver, so if you're thinking about a trip to London's July 2012 Olympics start looking for deals as early as next year, and for Rio, you'll have to wait until 2014. "We anticipate that we'll have packages for London by April of next year," said Don Williams, vice president of sales and marketing at tour operator Cartan Tours.
