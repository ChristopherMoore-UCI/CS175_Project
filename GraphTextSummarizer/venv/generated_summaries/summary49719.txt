"New races can take many years to get started, but there is significant momentum and we are close to realizing a New York City F1 race." "Our entire management team and our supporters in New Jersey, New York and throughout the Formula One community obviously want to see the inaugural Grand Prix of America at Port Imperial take place as soon as possible," Hindery said in a statement. New Jersey has encountered financial and logistical problems since it was proposed in 2012 but race organizer Leo Hindery is confident it will go ahead. "There is great demand for a race in New Jersey and I have no doubt we'll be racing at Port Imperial in 2015," he said in a statement Wednesday. It is the second time that the New Jersey race has been postponed, while Mexico is expected to host its first race since 1992 in two years time.
