" Through his Instituto Reação (Reaction Institute), Canto empowers youths by providing free judo training and education programs. Canto said the institute teaches the values of discipline, humility, courage and determination through judo -- Japanese for "gentle way" -- and applies them to other activities.

"I've never seen any place as beautiful as Rio de Janeiro, but it does have its dark side," said Canto, 34.
