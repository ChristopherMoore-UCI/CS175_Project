"We've got to look at our own business and try to extend the boundaries of where we can get into new markets, new territories, new audiences --we've just got to explore everything," added Kermode, who is approaching the end of his first year as ATP chairman. Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) chairman Chris Kermode believes tennis has never been in better health, with spectator numbers booming and new players bursting through to challenge established crowd-pullers Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray. After next year's edition, the event could be on the move as Kermode and his colleagues look to bring live tennis to more fans worldwide. The challenge now for Kermode is to discover if there's any part of the world that hasn't fallen in love with tennis. A former player who has been involved in tennis for the past three decades, Kermode believes interest in the game in Asia, both on and off the court, is surging, with the emergence of Kei Nishikori as Japan's first-ever top 10 male player a key factor.
