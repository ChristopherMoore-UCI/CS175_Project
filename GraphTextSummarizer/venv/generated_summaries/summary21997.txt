Nineteen tourists from southern China, a Chinese tour group leader and a Taiwanese bus driver went missing Thursday along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. -- Crews in Taiwan have found body parts as the search unfolds for victims of rock slides unleashed by Typhoon Megi last week, official media said. Four sets of body parts have been found, with DNA testing to be done, Taiwan's official Central News Agency said. Megi killed at least 13 people and injured nearly 100 others in Taiwan last week. Three dozen family members of the missing Chinese tourists arrived in Taiwan on Monday night.
