" Both teams are relatively new to the peloton, with RadioShack forming in 2010 around seven-time Tour de France champion Armstrong, while Leopard was set up last year and spearheaded by the Schleck brothers. Now thanks to the presence of riders like Fabian Cancellara and the Schleck brothers, we now have the potential to win not only Classics and major stage races but Grand Tours as well. A formidable line-up of 30 riders will be confirmed later this month, which will contain Leopard's Schleck brothers Andy and Frank -- who finished second and third in this year's Tour de France -- and world time-trial champion Fabian Cancellara. Team chief Johan Bruyneel announced the news on the official RadioShack website, saying: "With our sponsors' continuing commitment and the professionalism of our riders, I'm confident that RadioShack-Nissan-Trek will dominate cycling for years to come. -- Two of the biggest teams in world cycling are to merge next season, with the news that Lance Armstrong's RadioShack squad and Luxembourg outfit Leopard-Trek are to join forces.
