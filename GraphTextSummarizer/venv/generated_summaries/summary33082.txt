Searchers found the plane, a Twin Otter aircraft carrying three people, close to the summit of Mount Elizabeth in Queen Alexandra Range, in Antarctica. The plane was flying from the South Pole to an Italian base at Terra Nova Bay, Maritime New Zealand said. The plane "appears to have made a direct impact that was not survivable," Maritime New Zealand said Saturday. The missing crew had a kit that included survival suits, mountain tents, and enough food and water for five days. The aircraft was believed to have been flying at a height of 13,000 feet in the rugged Queen Alexandra Range.
