Kuznetsova lost to the French Open winner in the longest women's match in grand slam history in last month's Australian Open, four hours 44 minutes. Wozniacki, who needs to reach the semifinals in Dubai to dislodge Australian Open champion Clijsters, next plays Ayumi Morita as the Japanese qualifier continued her superb run. -- Caroline Wozniacki moved a win nearer to reclaiming the world number one spot from Kim Clijsters but her passage to the last 16 in Dubai only came after her Russian opponent, Anna Chakvetadze, fainted on court. Murray, beaten in the final of the Australian Open by Novak Djokovic, played last week in Rotterdam, but was well below his best and won only five games in losing his first-round clash to Marcos Baghdatis. Chakvetadze, who put out Pattaya Open winner Daniela Hantuchova in the first round, was later diagnosed with a gastro-intestinal illness.
