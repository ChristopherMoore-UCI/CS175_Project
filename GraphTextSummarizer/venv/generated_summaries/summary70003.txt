"Pastor Nadarkhani still faces the threat of execution for simply following his faith, and we repeat our call for Iranian authorities to release him immediately," said a statement from State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. " On Monday, the agency once again called on Iran to release Youcef Nadarkhani. The Voice of the Martyrs, an organization that monitors and attempts to assist with persecuted and minority churches around the world, has closely followed Nadarkhani's case and other developments involving Christians in Iran. In March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed on a 417-1 vote a resolution condemning Iran for imprisoning Nadarkhani, while calling for his immediate release. The American Center for Law and Justice -- a group "specifically dedicated to the ideal that religious freedom and freedom of speech are inalienable, God-given rights" -- was asked by the pastor's lawyers  last year to help publicize Nadarkhani's case, according to Jodran Sekulow, executive director of the group.
