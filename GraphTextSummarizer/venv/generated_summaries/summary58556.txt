New Mexico chimps won't be used in additional research, pending review The IOM, it noted, recognized that new or re-emerging diseases may require the use of chimps, and recommended NIH establish a breeding program for future research needs. "Americans have benefited greatly from the chimpanzees' service to biomedical research, but new scientific methods and technologies have rendered their use in research largely unnecessary," Collins said. " A provision currently limits the amount of funding NIH may put toward retiring chimps and caring for them in the Federal Sanctuary System. In its statement, the NIH also pledged to provide facilities similar to those chimps would encounter in their natural environments, with space requirements yet to be determined; and "wind down" research projects using NIH-owned or supported chimps that "do not meet IOM principles and criteria in a way that preserves the research and minimizes the impact on the animals.
