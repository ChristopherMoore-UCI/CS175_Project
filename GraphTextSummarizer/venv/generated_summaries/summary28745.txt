More than a week after a raid on an al Qaeda stronghold in Yemen to free hostages, an American captive, who was not rescued, appears in a video, begging into the camera for his life. The raid was planned after al Qaeda militants were spotted transferring the hostages into pickups, "chained and covered in blankets," according to a website associated with Yemen's defense ministry. He missed being saved in a raid last week by U.S. and Yemini special forces that freed eight hostages. In the recording recently posted by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also known as AQAP, the terror group threatens to kill Luke Somers, if Washington does not meet its demands. AQAP member Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, who reads a statement, does not say what the demands are but claims that the U.S. government knows them.
