France signed an agreement Monday with U.S. authorities to pay $60 million to Holocaust survivors transported to concentration camps, said Arnaud Guillois, a spokesman for the French Embassy in Washington. Patrizianna Sparacino-Thiellay, France's ambassador at large for human rights in charge of Holocaust issues, said Monday the agreement "is a further contribution to recognizing France's commitment to facing up to its historic responsibilities. Seven decades after being sent to Nazi concentration camps, survivors of the Holocaust will have the chance to get retribution -- from the government of France. But Americans aren't the only ones eligible for compensation; victims living in nations that haven't signed Holocaust compensation agreements also can benefit, according to the embassy spokesman. As Guillois noted, this latest agreement is one of several mechanisms by the French government to compensate Holocaust victims since 1946, the year after World War II ended.
