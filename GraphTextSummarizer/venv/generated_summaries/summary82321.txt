Plaquemines Parish on the southern tip of Louisiana planned to declare a state of emergency Sunday morning, said emergency preparedness director Guy Laigast. -- Newly formed Tropical Storm Debby hovered in the central Gulf of Mexico late Saturday as coastal communities from Texas to Florida waited for it to make a decisive turn. St. Mary Parish planned Monday to place warning signs at two communities built at sea level, said Duval Arthur, director of emergency preparedness. A slow northward movement was expected Sunday morning, followed by a gradual westward turn by late Sunday or early Monday. The Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness in Louisiana was in touch with parishes and the National Weather Service, said spokeswoman Veronica Mosgrove.
