Grant Holt's 19th minute goal -- slotting home after Arsenal keeper Vito Mannone could only parry Alexander Tettey's low drive -- consigned Arsene Wenger's side to their first defeat at Carrow Road since 1984. Teenager Raheem Sterling scored his first goal for the club which was enough to earn Brendan Rodgers his first league win at home since taking over in the summer. Norwich City recorded their first three points of the season with a battling 1-0 win over Arsenal. William Gallas netted his first goal for Spurs two minutes after the break to bring the home side level before Jermain Defoe turned in Aaron Lennon's cross to give Villas-Boas' new team the lead in the 54th minute. Both Manchester City and Manchester United recorded wins on Saturday to remain four points behind Roberto Di Matteo's side.
