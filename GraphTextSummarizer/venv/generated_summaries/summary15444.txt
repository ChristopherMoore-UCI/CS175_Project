The war of words came after North Korea launched two ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast Wednesday, violating United Nations resolutions that prohibits Pyongyang from conducting such tests. South Korea's defense ministry believes the North Korean missile tests were in reaction to the sideline meeting between President Park, U.S. President Barack Obama and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the The Hague's Nuclear Security Summit Monday, as well as ongoing joint U.S.-South -- North Korea has launched a vitriolic attack on South Korea's President Park Geun-hye over comments she made about the country's nuclear program, accusing her of "blabbering" like a "peasant woman." A previous attack on Park described the president and her government as "made up of ignorant hooligans hell-bent on hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of (North Korea) and on eclipsing the bright sunlight." The spokesman for North Korea's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea accused Park of violating a pact reached at a rare high-level meeting last month, that pledged to end "slander" between the two sides.
