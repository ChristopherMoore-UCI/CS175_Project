-- More than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures. FBI statistics show that 143,852 would-be gun buyers were turned down for domestic violence convictions or because they were subjected to a restraining order related to domestic violence issues, like stalking or making threats. Involuntary commitment to a psychiatric institution or an inability to manage personal affairs are reasons why someone would be rejected for mental health reasons. Statistics show about 1 percent of applicants who failed a background check, or 10,180 people, were turned down for reasons related to mental health. Nearly 60 percent of those failing background checks, or nearly 578,000 people, were rejected because of a felony or serious misdemeanor conviction, according to information on the FBI website that was updated this month.
