However, while the probationary terms apply to Florida, Thullbery did not know what action, if any, Florida prosecutors could take if Greaves sells the controversial book in another state where it could be considered legal. Officials said the book talks about safe sex and avoiding injury to children, grooming and preparing children for sex and teaching children how to lie to their parents. Judd said last year Greaves' book outlines a "code of ethics" that shows pedophiles how to look for the most vulnerable children. Greaves told reporters after his arrest the book could be used as a guide to rehabilitating pedophiles and instead of teaching them how to avoid arrest, teaches them to avoid illegal actions. Greaves and his book gained national attention last year after Amazon.com defended selling the book on its website despite angry comments and threats of boycotts from thousands of people.
