-- The Denver Post Editorial Board endorsed Republican House Rep. Cory Gardner on Friday, just six years after it backed Gardner's opponent Democratic Sen. Mark Udall for the position. However, they say that Udall has not been a prominent fighter on current issues, suggesting that Gardner's growing leadership in the House "would very likely match" Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet's influence in the upper chamber. Yet the Denver Post went defensive against Gardner's conservative opinions on same-sex marriage and abortion rights. The surprising decision could give Gardner the significant edge he needs to pull ahead of Udall in the closely contested race. Just last week, a CBS/New York Times poll found Gardner six percentage points ahead of Udall.
