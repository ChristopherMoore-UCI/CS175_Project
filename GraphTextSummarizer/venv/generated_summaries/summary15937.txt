" Among those links, he said, is the fact that three of the women had placed online ads dealing with "prearranged adult dating services" and posted on backpage.com, Godbee told reporters Monday. "At this point, we are working it as one case or one suspect or set of suspects," Chief Ralph L. Godbee told CNN. Three of the women have been linked to a website that accepts ads for escort services, police have said. "We felt it is imperative to alert the public that deciding to meet unknown persons via the Internet can be extremely dangerous," Godbee said. Referring to the advertisements on the website as "borderline prostitution," Godbee said that his priorities lie elsewhere.
