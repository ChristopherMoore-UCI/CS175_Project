One day after police say Kansas City Chiefs player Jovan Belcher fatally shot his girlfriend and then himself, the team faced off against the Carolina Panthers on Sunday, as scheduled. Eric Eucker was a member of the groundskeeping staff, "a good friend and colleague, and an outstanding employee," said team spokesman Neal Gulkis. But later, they learned the football player and his late girlfriend "had been arguing," including "before the shooting occurred," said police spokesman Darin Snapp. What is known, they say, is that linebacker Belcher, 25, killed his girlfriend, Kasandra Perkins, 22, before turning the gun on himself just outside the front door of the Chiefs' practice facility.
