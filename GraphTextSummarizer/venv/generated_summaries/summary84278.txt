Then there was the pre-match spice added by Uruguay captain Diego Lugano, who accused Brazil star Neymar of diving. Forlan, Uruguay's leading scorer, stepped up to take the kick but his effort was saved by Julio Cesar to send those draped in yellow inside the Estadio Mineirao into ecstasy. That miss appeared to wake Brazil from its slumber and with just two minutes of the first half remaining, Neymar flicked the ball into Fred's path and the striker fired home with aplomb. But with the prospect of extra time looming, Paulinho rose highest at the far post to meet Neymar's corner and spark wild scenes of celebration. -- Brazil moved into the final of the Confederations Cup following a tense and dramatic 2-1 victory over Uruguay.
