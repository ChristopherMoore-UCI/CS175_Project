Goodfella's Pizzeria co-owner Marc Cosentino says he will auction off the infamous fork that de Blasio used in a charity fundraiser. Now, the act that sent the Internet into a frenzy with chatter about what most New Yorkers scorn as a serious food flub portends to deliver some dough -- as in money -- to charity. Dubbed by some with tongues firmly in cheek as the new mayor's "pizzagate," the ensuing publicity has prompted multiple charities to reach out to Cosentino in hopes of getting a piece of the pie. When asked how much he thinks the renowned utensil would sell for, Cosentino referred to a previous charity benefit in 2013 for New York's hungry when a dozen "cronuts" -- half-croissant and half-doughnut pastries -- reportedly were auctioned for $14,000. -- Mayor Bill de Blasio bit into some unexpected publicity recently when he was photographed politely eating pizza -- with a knife and fork.
