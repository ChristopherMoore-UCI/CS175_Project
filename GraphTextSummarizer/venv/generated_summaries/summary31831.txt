Ivanovic lost in the 2007 Tokyo final before it became a premier-level event on the tour, and the 26-year-old has another chance for Japanese success after knocking out top seed Angelique Kerber in Saturday's semifinals. Unlike Wozniacki, she has a grand slam title to her name -- the 2008 French Open -- but has not done so well in this season's majors since reaching the Australian Open quarterfinals in January. Caroline Wozniacki will take on Ana Ivanovic in Sunday's final of the Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo in a battle of two players who have promised so much, but fallen frustratingly short. She came back from 5-3 down in the opening set, winning 10 of the next 13 games to triumph 7-5 6-3 against the German -- who lost to Petra Kvitova in last year's final. She had to show her renowned fighting qualities on Saturday before battling to a 6-4 2-6 6-2 win over 20-year-old Spaniard Garbine Muguruza, who this season has reached the first two finals of her career, winning one of them.
