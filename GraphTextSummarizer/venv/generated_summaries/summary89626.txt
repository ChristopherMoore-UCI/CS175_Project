-- Canadian authorities braced for protests expected to take place near Vancouver, British Columbia, on Thursday outside an event where former U.S. presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton are scheduled to appear. Amnesty International called on Canadian authorities to arrest Bush for "war crimes" while activists announced Occupy Wall Street-style protests of the economic summit in Surrey where the former presidents were scheduled to speak along with world finance experts. "We would prefer his home country try George W. Bush," said Alex Neve, secretary-general of Amnesty International Canada. Last month, protesters appeared at a Vancouver event for former vice president Dick Cheney promote his book. Neve said Bush should face trial for ordering the so-called enhanced interrogation, such as water boarding, of suspected terrorists.
