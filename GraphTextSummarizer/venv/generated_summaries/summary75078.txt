So, again, my thanks to the staff for, once again, putting up with something stupid I've gotten myself involved in," Letterman said, according to excerpts released Monday by production company World Wide Pants. The New York Times reported an unnamed source said CBS made the copyright infringement claim at the request of Worldwide Pants Inc., the production company owned by Letterman which produces his show. Although Letterman first admitted the plot and sexual relationships very publicly on his show, most videos of the segment were taken down from YouTube this weekend at the request of CBS. A CBS producer is accused of threatening to go public with allegedly embarrassing information about Letterman's private life, unless the 62-year-old funnyman paid $2 million. -- Late-night talk show host David Letterman offered a "heartfelt" apology before a live studio audience Monday to his wife and female staffers over last week's "sextortion" revelations, fans at the taping said.
