The Local Coordination Committees reported helicopters dropped phosphorus bombs over the town of Khirbet Ghazaleh in Daraa province Saturday. Thin streams of white smoke fall out of the clear sky onto pastoral farmland, where small fires then dot the landscape and create smoke that blankets the area. The mosque was the first place protesters gathered in March 2011 to protest the arrest and alleged torture of teenagers who sprayed anti-Assad graffiti, sparking the waves of weekly peaceful demonstrations that eventually spread across the country. Another video on YouTube, posted Saturday, apparently of Khirbet Ghazaleh, shows a small fire burning in the bricks and rubble of a house, emanating heavy white smoke. Activists reported an incident of phosphorus bombs in Merayiya, in Deir Ezzor province, on Friday.
