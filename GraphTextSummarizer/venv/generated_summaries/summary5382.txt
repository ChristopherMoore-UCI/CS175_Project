Maathai, an environmentalist, had long campaigned for human rights and the empowerment of Africa's most impoverished people. "We need people who love Africa so much that they want to protect her from destructive processes," Maathai said then. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki called Maathai a "global icon who has left an indelible mark in the world of environmental conservation. " British Foreign Secretary William Hague called the passing of the "charismatic figure ... a great loss to the world," and fellow environmental activist and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore recalled her as a woman who "worked tirelessly (to become) a true inspiration for us all. "Professor Maathai's departure is untimely and a very great loss to all who knew her -- as a mother, relative, co-worker, colleague, role model and heroine -- or who admired her determination to make the world a more peaceful, healthier and better place," her organization said.
