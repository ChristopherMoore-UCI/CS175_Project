Samm Farai Monro, AKA Comrade Fatso, is a blogger, protest poet and political activist in Zimbabwe. May 22, 2008 HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A sick, old man shuffled towards me as I walked towards my car from a civil society discussion on elections. Samm Farai Monro, better known as Comrade Fatso, is Zimbabwe's most popular protest poet as well as a leading political activist and grassroots blogger. Mugabe decided that multiple choice in elections was an imperialist creation so he has given the people a simplified election: a single candidate. So Zimbabwe's subversive, totemless urban dwellers have once again invoked their right to stay away, last used in the late 1990s against ZANU's failed Structural Adjustment Programmes.
