Jones began cutting records in the mid-1950s, turning out genre standards like "He Stopped Loving Her Today," "White Lighting" and "She Thinks I Still Care." -- Country music star George Jones has been hospitalized in Nashville for a respiratory infection but is scheduled to be released on Friday, his representatives said. But Jones' last known serious health problems were in 1999, when he survived a car accident that required rescuers to spend two hours cutting him out of his sport-utility vehicle. The 80-year-old performer was to stay overnight Thursday for observation, according to a statement on his website. He was long legendary for the hard living that he depicted in his songs -- and which earned him the nickname "No-Show" among concertgoers.
