-- President Obama reached out to citizens of the world Tuesday, saying in an op-ed piece that ran in 31 newspapers around the globe that there is an urgent need for worldwide economic cooperation. President Obama will discuss the economic downturn with other world leaders next week at the Group of 20 meeting. In the op-ed, Obama spoke about the upcoming G-20 meeting, saying that world leaders have to work together. Obama's move comes ahead of next week's Group of 20 meeting in London, England, in which leaders of the world's richest nations will discuss the global economic downturn. "We are living through a time of global economic challenges that cannot be met by half measures or the isolated efforts of any nation," Obama said.
