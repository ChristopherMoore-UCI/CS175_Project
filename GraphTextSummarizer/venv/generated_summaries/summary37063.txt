Thousands of anti-government demonstrators have packed Kiev's Independence Square since November, underscoring tensions in a country split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east. Last week, in the first concessions made by the government, the Prime Minister and Cabinet resigned, a controversial anti-protest law was repealed, and Yanukovych signed off on a contested amnesty bill for anti-government protesters. Ukraine's President returned to work Monday after four days of sick leave as neighbor Russia called on protesters who have tried to curb his powers to stop their "threats and ultimatums. In a statement Monday, Russia's Foreign Ministry told protesters who have set up tents and barricades in the central Independence Square to halt their "provocative steps." He and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price of natural gas.
