In 1979, the United States, Canada, France and the former Soviet Union teamed up to provide a global, satellite-based system to detect emergency beacons activated by planes, ships and backcountry hikers and to distribute those alerts to rescuers. Beacons -- more formally called emergency locator transmitters, or ELTs -- are devices that transmit an electronic distress signal in the event of a crash. Among other things, they are testing a new constellation of mid-altitude satellites that can better determine the location of an ELT. The organization also said it was the primary or sole source of location information in about 25 other cases involving aircraft with 10 or more passengers. The RESCU 406 AFN was designed "to provide emergency transmission for aircraft flying over land," according to Honeywell's published specifications.
