Born and raised in southern California surfing up and down the West Coast, the former Special Forces soldier, who has fought in the Balkans, Iraq and Afghanistan, is now in charge of making this program a success. He is paid a base wage of U.S. $400 per month, but if he qualifies for Special Forces, he will receive an extra U.S. $100-$200 a month in his pay packet. Combat to training While fighting and tactical operations were once carried out by U.S. soldiers, America's role in its longest war has now transitioned into training the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), made of 350,000 army and police. Among them, 1,000 have gone on to become the country's elite Special Forces. As for a war-weary United States that just wants its troops to come home, Petit can't help but respond as a man who has loved and lost fellow soldiers across this harsh and inhospitable terrain.
