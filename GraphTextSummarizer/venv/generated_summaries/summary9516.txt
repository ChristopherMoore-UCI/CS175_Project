But while bullish about the technology's potential, Weinstein admits there remains a way to go before floating turbines become profitable enterprises. "The (initial) turbine is capable of producing 2MW (megawatts) instantaneously at any one time, given enough wind," says Alla Weinstein, CEO of Principal Power. " Weinstein highlights lower construction costs -- the WindPlus turbine cost â‚¬20 million ($24.9 million) to build and install -- as a major advantage the technology has over existing offshore wind farms. The initial structure off the coast of Portugal is merely a pilot installation to prove the device works and is viable, says Weinstein.
