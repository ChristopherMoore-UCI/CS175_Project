Beginning in 1996, North Korean and U.S. military teams conducted 33 joint recovery missions looking for remains inside North Korea. The United States will send a team to North Korea this year to search for the remains of missing U.S. veterans of the Korean War, the Defense Department announced Friday. The mission, which will include both U.S. and North Korean military personnel, will search two areas of North Korea: Unsan County and near the Chosin/Jangjin reservoir, according to the Defense Department. "We're always grateful for the opportunity to recover the remains of our fallen heroes from past wars," Pentagon spokesman George Little said. But all that changed in 2005 when then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suspended the work, saying that due to rising nuclear tensions at the time, he felt the safety of the U.S. teams could not be guaranteed.
