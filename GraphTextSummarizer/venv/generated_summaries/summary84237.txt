Supporters of the project, which would carry 830,000 barrels of oil a day, say it would reduce imports from other more volatile areas and create jobs. But opponents warn against potential damage to the environment and question whether many long term jobs would be created. The results of an environmental impact study into the Keystone XL pipeline project will be announced Friday afternoon, two senior administration officials and another source familiar with the timing told CNN. "The (study) is in the final stages of preparation and we anticipate a release of the document soon," a State Department spokesperson told CNN. Secretary of State John Kerry will make a final recommendation to the White House.
