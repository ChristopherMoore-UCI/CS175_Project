-- An international judge has resigned from the special court set up in Cambodia to try people accused of committing atrocities under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s, saying his Cambodian counterpart was obstructing efforts to investigate cases. His predecessor, Siegfried Blunk, resigned as international co-investigating judge in October, complaining that statements by Cambodian government ministers about two of the court's cases threatened to undermine proceedings. At least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population -- died under the 1975-1979 Khmer Rouge regime from execution, disease, starvation and overwork, according to the Documentation Center of Cambodia. In that trial, four former Khmer Rouge government ministers face charges of crimes against humanity and genocide. In 2010, it issued its first verdict, convicting Kaing Guek Eav, commonly known by his alias, Duch, of war crimes, crimes against humanity, murder and torture.
