Model and TV personality Chrissy Teigen is usually one of Twitter's more resilient members. At one point, Teigen posted a photo of the responses she was getting on Twitter, suggesting the platform should be more proactive about stomping out threatening tweets. Here's what started it all: On Wednesday, as the shooting story unfolded, Teigen posted: "active shooting in Canada, or as we call it in america, wednesday. It seems the negative reaction fell on Teigen pretty quickly, as she then had to clarify that she was not making a joke at the expense of Canada, but as a sardonic observation about gun control in America. After sharing one more threatening message, this time from a Twitter user who hoped that "someone murders some(one) you love, like your f****t husband," Teigen posted what sounds like her final tweet -- at least for now.
