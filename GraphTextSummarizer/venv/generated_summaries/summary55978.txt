"I've investigated many accidents and trains do different things," National Transportation Safety Board investigator Tim DePaepe told reporters. A union official told reporters Monday that the train's driver may have fallen asleep, CNN affiliate WLS reported. The crash of the Chicago Transit Authority Blue Line train injured 32 people, although none seriously, according to Chicago Fire officials. A federal investigator said he's never seen a train climb an escalator like the one that jumped the tracks at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport early Monday. "There are indications that she dozed off, yes," Amalgamated Transit Union Local 308 President Robert Kelly said, according to WLS.
