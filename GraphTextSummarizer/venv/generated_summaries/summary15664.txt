-- Two sons of ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stood trial Monday in a Cairo criminal court on charges of insider stock trading, with prosecutors alleging they acquired millions illegally by using insider information about a bank sale. Hermes released a statement last May saying its two executives acted properly in the acquisition of the Al Watany bank. Gamal and Alaa Mubarak offered last month to pay a 2 billion-pound ($330 million) fine in reconciliation, but prosecutors denied the request, according to Adel Al-Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor. The two "purposely withheld vital information on the sale of the bank from other share traders to implement their crime and violated the principles of transparency and equality between traders," according to a statement from prosecutors. Yasser El-Malawny and Hassan Heikal, EFG Hermes joint chief executive officers, are among the other defendants in the case.
