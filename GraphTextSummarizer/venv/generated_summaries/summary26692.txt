Potassium iodide blocks the absorption of radioactive iodine isotopes by filling the thyroid with the benign iodine compound, stopping the thyroid from absorbing radioactive iodine. Since the crisis at a Japanese power station that followed the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, he has called for a safety review of U.S. nuclear plants. Rep. Ed Markey wants the federal government to distribute doses of the compound -- which can be used to block the thyroid gland's absorption of radioactive iodine -- to every household within a 20-mile radius of a U.S. nuclear power plant "in recognition of the probability that rapid evacuation during a nuclear meltdown will be difficult and time consuming. -- A Massachusetts congressman called on the federal government Tuesday to distribute potassium iodide pills to Americans living near nuclear reactors, a preventive step one expert warns might do more harm than good. "Despite more than 30 years of clear and unequivocal evidence that potassium iodide protects people, especially young children, who are most vulnerable, from cancer-causing releases of radioactive iodine that would occur if a nuclear disaster occurred, the nuclear industry has continued to fight its use," Markey said at a press conference.
