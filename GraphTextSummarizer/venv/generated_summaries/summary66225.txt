Williams says one special feature of Monsieur is its artificial intelligence: The machine can recommend drinks based on what you have ordered in the past, the season or time of day. When fully equipped, Monsieur can make up to 300 types of drinks. The Monsieur currently has no system to accept payments, but Givens and Williams would like to add a feature that would let patrons pay for drinks online or by swiping a card on the machine. Commercial customers will pay a one-time setup fee of $1,000 plus $299 per month for a subscription that includes tech support and access to a Web app allowing them to monitor the status of their Monsieur in real time. Consumers can also create themes and drinks and share them with others via social media.
