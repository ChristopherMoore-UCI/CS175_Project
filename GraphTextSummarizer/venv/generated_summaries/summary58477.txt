Jason Day's dramatic putt at the 18th gave the Australian and Graham DeLaet a win over Hunter Mahan and Brandt Snedeker after Woods and Matt Kuchar routed Angel Cabrera and Marc Leishman 5 and 4. The U.S. fell behind as Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley lost to Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel 2 and 1 before Scott and Hideki Matsuyama halved with Bill Haas and Webb Simpson. The International Team, by contrast, had one -- Masters champion Adam Scott. And while U.S. President Barack Obama wasn't in attendance in Ohio -- he has more important things to worry about -- a former president, George W. Bush, greeted both teams Thursday at the Muirfield Village Golf Club. The biennial competition, which pits the U.S. against the rest of the world minus Europe, has been kinder to the Americans than the more prestigious Ryder Cup.
