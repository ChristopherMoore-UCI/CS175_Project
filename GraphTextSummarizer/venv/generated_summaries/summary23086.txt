-- French Prime Minister Francois Fillon has apologized to his opposite number in New Zealand, John Key, over the recent "unacceptable behavior" of France rugby center Mathieu Bastareaud. The New Zealand nation and the world of rugby can legitimately feel wounded by the player's initial statements which have also tarnished the image of French rugby." "We, professional rugby players, lend our friendship and support to Mathieu Bastereaud and his family," Provale said in a statement. Fillon told Key in a letter: "France's tour of New Zealand has been marked by the unacceptable behavior of one of our players. French Rugby Federation (FRF) president Pierre Camou also offered his apology to New Zealand over the affair that blighted France's All Black tour.
