" The first five years of the Tour's new partnership with Leisurecorp, the company developing Dubai's leading residential golf community, will also see the building of a new international headquarters for the governing body and the creation of a global property company to develop new tournament venues around the world. O'Grady added: "The scale of this agreement is testament to the vision of Dubai and its ruler His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who has recognized the dynamic role golf can play in developing the global profile of this amazing city. European Tour chief executive George O'Grady said: "This is so much more than a tournament sponsorship. "It is also testament to Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem (chairman of Leisurecorp's parent company Dubai World), who has been instrumental in turning that vision into reality. It is a long-term partnership which will see the European Tour and Dubai joining together to significantly enhance the game worldwide and take golf to a new level for spectators everywhere.
