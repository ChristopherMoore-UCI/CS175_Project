-- When Jon Huntsman announced his campaign for president last summer, he received the type of media attention that presumed he would be an immediate and formidable challenger for the Republican nomination. Worse, Huntsman never developed a policy proposal that created a rationale for an insurgent candidacy the way McCain's embrace of campaign finance reform did for him that year. There was no spectacular immolation or flameout that rocked the political world, nor had there been the type of stratospheric rise that marked Cain and Bachmann's campaigns. Exacerbating his irrelevance was Huntsman's decision to skip the Iowa caucuses, condemning him to be overlooked in most daily campaign coverage. The conventional wisdom is that Huntsman was unnecessarily confrontational toward conservatives early in his campaign, the Republican who didn't seem to want to be a Republican.
