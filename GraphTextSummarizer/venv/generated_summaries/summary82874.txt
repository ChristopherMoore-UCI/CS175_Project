Wilander, himself a winner of seven grand slam titles, told Open Court that Borg's success, and the way he played, directly contributed to Sweden's subsequent production line of great players. -- Swedish tennis legend Bjorn Borg has been credited with changing how the modern game is played. In this month's Open Court program, Borg sits down with fellow-Wimbledon champion Pat Cash to discuss his life and the impact he had on tennis in Sweden and the world in general. Borg continued: "You know growing up in Sweden meant we had a lot of rain when we played tennis. "Basically I started playing double handed on both my forehand and backhand side because my first racket was very heavy," said Borg.
