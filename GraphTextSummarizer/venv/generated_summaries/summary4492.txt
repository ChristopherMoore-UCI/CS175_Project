A difference with political consequences 'Removing female detainees from their cells' for sex MALDEF's letter from Tuesday accuses facility workers of "removing female detainees from their cells late in the evening and during early morning hours for the purpose of engaging in sexual acts in various parts of the facility. Workers also kissed, fondled and groped detainees in front of other detainees, including children, the advocates alleged. In a September 25 letter, the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law asked federal immigration officials to investigate numerous complaints from detainees, including that children didn't have access to a variety of nutritious snacks between meals, that messages from attorneys weren't getting to their clients in a timely manner, and that -- although they had access to a nurse -- no doctor was on staff to handle significant medical issues such as respiratory infections and chronic illnesses. " Also, workers called detainees "their 'novias,' or 'girlfriends,' " and requested "sexual favors from female detainees in exchange for money, promises of assistance with their pending immigration cases, and shelter when and if the women are released," the advocates alleged. Some guards or other workers at the Karnes County Residential Center also asked sexual favors of female detainees in exchange for money or promises of assistance -- including help with their immigration cases or shelter if they are released -- the lawyers allege in the letter.
