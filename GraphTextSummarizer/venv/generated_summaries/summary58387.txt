The Winklevosses had claimed they were shortchanged in a $65 million settlement with Zuckerberg because Facebook had misrepresented the value of company stock. -- Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the former business partners and Harvard University classmates of  Mark Zuckerberg, have dropped their court appeal of a settlement with the Facebook founder. A California court ordered the parties to mediate the dispute, and according to court records, they signed an agreement in which the Winklevosses would give up ConnectU for cash and a share in Facebook stock. The Winklevosses and Narendra filed suit later that year against Facebook and Zuckerberg. In February 2004, however, Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com, which he later renamed Facebook.
