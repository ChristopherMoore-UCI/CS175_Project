Journalist Cokie Roberts spoke of Ford's service as a political wife when her late husband, President Gerald R. Ford, served in Congress. -- Former first lady Betty Ford was remembered Tuesday as a woman whose disclosures about her personal battles showed courage and grace and brought encouragement to others. " Among those attending were former President George W. Bush, who escorted former first lady Nancy Reagan to a pew, current first lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Hillary Clinton. While Clinton, the current secretary of state, was in Palm Desert, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was not at the service because of problems with the aircraft he was to take, said Ford spokeswoman Barbara Lewandrowski. A former president and first ladies present and past joined family members Tuesday afternoon at the first of two services for Ford.
