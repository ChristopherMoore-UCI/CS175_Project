Ramos and Compean were able to remove their electronic monitoring devices and leave their homes in El Paso, Texas, on Friday for the first time since they left prison in February. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a vocal critic of the decision to grant Aldrete-Davila immunity, said several key pieces of evidence were withheld from the jury that convicted Ramos and Compean. -- Jose Compean and Ignacio Ramos began their "supervised release" Friday after President Bush commuted their sentences in January for convictions related to the shooting of a Mexican drug smuggler. Like Ramos, Compean said the most difficult part of going to prison was leaving behind his wife and children. Ramos and Compean were convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon, lying about the incident and violating Aldrete-Davila's Fourth Amendment right against illegal search and seizure.
