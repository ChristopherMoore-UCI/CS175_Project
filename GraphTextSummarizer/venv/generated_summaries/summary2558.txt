"Lo and behold, it's me and it's Harry coming down this mountain," Letterman said, his voice clouding with emotion. On Wednesday's after-show (which is available online), Letterman told the story of how the Foos' "Miracle" provided the soundtrack for one of his most significant moments as a father: learning to ski with his then-4-year-old son, Harry. As Letterman tells it, he was hoping to find a bonding experience as the 60-something father of a young child and decided to try skiing. The Foo Fighters have made the most of their week-long residency on "The Late Show with David Letterman" -- and they've even moved the host to the verge of tears. After several days of skiing, the instructor concluded his lessons by taking a video of the pair coming down a mountain in Montana's Madison Range.
