Christopher Eric Wey was attempting to board a United Airlines flight to Los Angeles on Wednesday when Transportation Security  Administration screeners detected the presence of explosives in Wey's luggage. -- A 19-year-old Army private was arrested Thursday, one day after airport screeners allegedly found a small amount of C4 explosive in his checked luggage at Yuma, Arizona's International Airport. TSA personnel subsequently found one-half ounce of C4 explosive hidden in a tobacco can inside one of Wey's bags, officials said. "With a concerted effort to identify and find explosives, this incident demonstrates the abilities of our highly trained officers and cutting-edge technology." Wey was detained and interviewed by FBI agents.
