Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the "idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality." "She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth," said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of "leaning in" is a catch phrase among professional women. And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans. Clinton could be helped by an improving climate for women in politics.
