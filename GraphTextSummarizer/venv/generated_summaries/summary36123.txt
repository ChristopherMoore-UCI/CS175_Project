Victory for fourth seed Murray would give Britain its first male grand slam winner since the legendary Fred Perry in 1936. A single break in the fourth set was enough to leave the third seed to serve for his place in the final and he completed victory on his first match point. Earlier Friday, Federer beat top seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic in four sets to reach a record eighth final. It's tough to explain, it was such a close match," Murray told BBC Sport. The 30-year-old Federer had never lost a semifinal at Wimbledon and maintained that streak with a peerless performance against the Serbian, who has dominated the men's game since the start of last year.
