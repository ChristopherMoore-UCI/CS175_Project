In Boston on Monday -- with 62.5 inches of snowfall since January 15 -- the record for most snow in a 30-day period has already been broken. "I usually like snow, but this is just a little much." Boston has also set a record for the snowiest seven-day period, with over 40 inches, the National Weather Service said last week. The two other storms that hit the Northeast in the past two weeks closed airports, canceled classes and created mountains of snow along cleared roadways. "I know that it's frustrating right now, particularly with the amount of snow, and it's frustrating to all of us," said Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. Boston Logan International Airport remained open, but most flights are canceled, Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday.
