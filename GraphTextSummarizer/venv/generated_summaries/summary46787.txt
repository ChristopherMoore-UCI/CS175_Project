For her effort, she has been called the "Malala of Za'atari," in reference to Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai. Much of her time in Za'atari has been spent going from tent to tent, from mosque to mosque, talking to children and parents about why getting back in the classroom is important. She has spent her time promoting education in the camp, where half of the population is made up of children. In fact, Malala and Mizune are friends, having spent many hours together in the Za'atari camp when Malala visted there in February.. Mizune's work started when UNICEF began building schools in Za'atari.
