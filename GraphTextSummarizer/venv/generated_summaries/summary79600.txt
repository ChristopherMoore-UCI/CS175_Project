-- The trial of Michael Jackson's doctor reached another emotional peak Wednesday as jurors heard a recording of Jackson, using slow and slurred speech, telling Dr. Conrad Murray, "I hurt, you know, I hurt. Prosecutors argue that Murray, who was Jackson's personal doctor as he prepared for planned comeback concerts, is criminally responsible for the singer's death because of medical negligence and his reckless use of the propofol to help Jackson sleep. Murray's iPhone also contained e-mail attachments that appeared to be Jackson's medical records sent by Murray's office assistant to the doctor, who was gathering them for a British insurance agent who was arranging cancellation insurance for Jackson's London concerts. Dileo's message to Murray, left five days before Jackson's death, suggested that he "get a blood test" from Jackson because "we've got to see what he's doing." " Jurors should also soon hear the full recording of Murray's interview with Los Angeles police two days after Jackson's death.
