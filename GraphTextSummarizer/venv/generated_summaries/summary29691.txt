Despite the stereotype of them as an oppressed group, Arab women have a long history of participating in the region's upheavals, dating back at least to the anti-colonial movement when women emerged from the confinement of the household to take up crucial organizational positions. Where women are oppressed, oppression of all dissenting voices typically goes hand in hand. But rather than confining the story of women to an issue of religion or culture, it is important that the world uses what is happening to them as a barometer of the trajectory that individual societies are on. In doing so, their message to the older generation of feminists is that the rights of women must be included in the civil rights discussion of societies more broadly. Indeed, women should be seen as the bellwether for the direction of society at large -- where women thrive, so do opportunities for all.
