Misogyny is so deeply rooted in India's collective psychology that even the president's son -- in this case, Congress Parliament member Abhijit Mukherjee -- could entangle himself with a remark against women protesting gang rape. Unfortunately, in India rape is inextricably linked by men -- and women -- to shame: the ultimate desecration. The Hindi phrase most commonly used to describe sexual violence or rape against women is "izzat lootna," which means "to steal the honor of." It was still a topic that made most people uncomfortable, a topic that women and men alike were not able to freely express their opinions on. Men and women are collaborating to seek legal reform, to challenge the societal perceptions they have been force-fed.
