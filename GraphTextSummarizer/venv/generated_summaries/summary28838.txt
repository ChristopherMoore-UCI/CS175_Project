Ambassador Robert Ford visited Hama "to make absolutely clear with his physical presence that we stand with those Syrians who are expressing their right to speak for change," said State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. It is unclear whether Hama residents will turn out for nationwide demonstrations on Friday after Muslim prayers. Nuland, however, said U.S. officials notified the Syrian government that an embassy team was traveling to Hama. -- The U.S. ambassador to Syria visited the embattled town of Hama Thursday as part of what the State Department called an effort to show U.S. support for Syrians fighting for democracy. Hama has been wracked with violence and a general strike this week after a series of peaceful demonstrations, including a huge anti-government demonstration last Friday.
