The indictment seeks for van der Sloot to forfeit $25,100, which includes $100 Beth Holloway initially transferred to van der Sloot to confirm his account. Police said van der Sloot admitted that he attacked Flores on May 30 after she read an e-mail in his computer connected with the Holloway case. An arrest warrant on these same charges had been issued for van der Sloot earlier this month. The charges are unrelated to the killing of a student in Peru in which van der Sloot is the suspect. Wednesday's indictment alleges that van der Sloot exploited "Beth Holloway's fear that she would never find her daughter's body or know what happened to her unless she paid him $250,000," the Alabama U.S. Attorney's office said.
