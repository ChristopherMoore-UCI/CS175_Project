"There is simply no reason for Rep. Rangel alone to be held accountable for taking this trip when a number of other members were also present." -- Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, will be formally admonished Friday by the House's ethics committee for violating rules on receiving gifts, the committee announced Thursday. He will refund the costs as directed by the ethics committee, Rangel spokesmen Elbert Garcia and Emile Milne said in a written statement. An aide to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, "It's to soon to say anything" regarding whether Rangel will stay chairman of the committee. "The committee does not find sufficient evidence to conclude, nor does it believe that it would discover additional evidence to alter its conclusion, that Representative Rangel had actual knowledge of the memoranda written by his staff.
