"There was something thrilling about seeing the often bonkers but still delightful imagination of Bush run free after all this time," wrote Bernadette McNulty in the UK Telegraph about the show at London's Eventim Apollo, which included giant paper airplanes, reptilian monsters and sets with odd perspectives. Among those in attendance: David Gilmour (who helped get her career started), Bjork, Lily Allen and actress Gemma Arterton. In the U.S., she's probably best known for the 1985 album "Hounds of Love," which contained the single "Running Up That Hill," and her duet with Peter Gabriel, "Don't Give Up," which appeared on Gabriel's 1986 album "So." -- After 35 years away, British singer Kate Bush returned to the stage Tuesday night -- and the response was rapturous. "Kate Bush last night was phenomenal, one of the best shows I've ever seen," wrote singer Anna Calvi on Twitter.
