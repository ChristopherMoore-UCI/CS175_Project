Kimberly Munley was cleaning the car and topping off the gas tank, routine duties at the end of her shift, when she heard the report last Thursday that shots had been fired at the Army post, she told Oprah Winfrey via teleconference. At first, when he heard the shots from Fort Hood, he thought the soldiers were practicing the traditional rifle volleys they do at memorial services. He also said last Thursday began as a "typical day" for him, with only minor incidents. Winfrey asked her where she got her nickname, "Mighty Mouse." Winfrey showed a clip of Metroplex's Dr. Kelly Matlock saying that Munley's first words after the shooting were, "Did anybody die?" The 34-year-old mother of two said she recalled asking that, and she never lost consciousness after being shot.
