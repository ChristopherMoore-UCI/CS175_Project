Lt. Col. Robert E. Underwood, who has been undergoing "a nasty divorce" the past two years, made the threats between March 1 and Monday, said Pierce County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Lori Kooiman in a court document. He said the money is in foreign accounts and it would not be found," Kooiman said in court papers. However, Underwood witnessed his mother kill his two siblings, and she also shot Underwood "multiple times and left him for dead," the prosecutor stated in court papers. Underwood and his estranged wife have children and are dealing with custody and money issues, Kooiman said in the court document. She confronted the defendant about what she found and he told her that her head was on the chopping block," Kooiman said in a declaration for determination of probable cause.
