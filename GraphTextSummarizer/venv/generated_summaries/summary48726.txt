-- Talk of "bloodcurdling screams" and shots in the night took center stage Monday in the first day of testimony in the murder trial of South African amputee track star Oscar Pistorius, who killed his model girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, last year. He lives at his uncle Arnold Pistorius' house in Pretoria, and although video surfaced last year of him training, he has not officially returned to the track. Pistorius faces one charge of premeditated murder and a firearms charge associated with Steenkamp's killing, as well as two separate gun indictments from 2012. Pistorius on trial for murder Parts of Pistorius' trial are being televised live -- a first in South Africa -- after a judge's decision last week allowing cameras in the courtroom. He also faces weapons charges As the trial began, Pistorius pleaded not guilty to murdering Steenkamp inside his house a year ago.
