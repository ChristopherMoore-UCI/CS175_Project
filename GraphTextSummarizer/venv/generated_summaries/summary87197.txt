About 20 percent of the income comes from tourism, with Amboseli as the second -highest earner, Tikolo said Lions are among the big five -- the list of top wildlife tourist attractions in the nation. The animals will be hauled from four locations to restock Amboseli National Park's population, which lost 80 percent of its herbivores in a recent drought, said Kentice Tikolo, spokeswoman for the Kenya Wildlife Service. The imbalance has sparked a row with villagers who lost animals in the drought and have threatened to kill lions and hyenas preying on remaining livestock. -- Kenyan wildlife officials are ferrying thousands of zebras and wildebeest to a park in the country's south to feed starving lions and hyenas, and prevent a conflict with humans. Lots of herbivores died, carnivores don't have anything to feed on, and have been attacking neighboring livestock."
