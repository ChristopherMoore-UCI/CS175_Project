In addition to Feldman and Solis, police say Smith killed Alicia Torres, 41, in Eola, Texas, shot at two people in Eden, Texas, and wounded Concho County Sheriff Richard Doane just north of Eden in central Texas. Esteban J. Smith, 23, died Sunday in a shootout with Texas authorities after going on a two-hour rampage that left one person dead and five wounded, according to investigators. Esteban Smith was a Marine rifleman who had served two tours in Afghanistan with the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, according to the Marine Corps. Authorities don't know why Smith, an active duty Marine from Bakersfield, California, was 1,300 miles away from his duty station at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, said Tom Vinger, spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. Tuesday, survivors of Smith's Texas shooting spree said they were thankful to be alive.
