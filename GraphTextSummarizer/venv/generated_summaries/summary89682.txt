Impact Your World: How to help Syrian refugees With the war showing no sign of abating and one-third of Syria's housing destroyed, there is little hope that Samar, Adla, Ahmad and the hundreds of thousands of refugees like them in Lebanon will be able to return home any time soon. That means the remaining hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Lebanon are forced to rent what land or shelter they can find. Without more shelter options, hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees will fall through the cracks the moment they arrive, slipping into obscurity behind metal garage doors. Concern Worldwide, with support from UNCHR, is focusing on getting what unused buildings they can find into habitable condition so that more refugees can live in safe, rent-free accommodations with safe drinking water, electricity and plumbing. While Syrian refugees like Ahmad were able to escape to Lebanon with tens or hundreds of dollars in savings, the money will be gone soon and they will almost certainly be pushed over the edge into poverty, with few remaining assets, and no prospects for income.
