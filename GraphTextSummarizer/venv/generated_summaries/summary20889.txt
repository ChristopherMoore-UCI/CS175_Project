AEG dropped its claim Monday for a $17.5 million insurance policy for Michael Jackson, just days after e-mails revealed the concert promoter had doubts about Jackson's health at the time they were applying for the insurance. "He (Mann) definitely never received any documents from Katherine, Prince, Paris, or Blanket Jackson, nor from their lawyers in the wrongful death suit against AEG," said Jackson lawyer Kevin Boyle. " AEG served a subpoena on Mann, ordering him to testify under oath about the source of the e-mails, on Friday, Putnam said. "Whether these documents were leaked through an intermediary or directly by Mrs. Jackson and her counsel, this remains an egregious violation of the court's order requiring immediate sanctions and an investigation," the AEG lawyer said. " Source of leaked Michael Jackson e-mails identified The Michael Jackson estate, which controls Michael Jackson Company LLC, is still pursuing the insurance payout, its lawyer said Monday. A Lloyds of London underwriter sued AEG and Michael Jackson LLC after Jackson's death, claiming they failed to disclose information about the pop star's health and drug use.
