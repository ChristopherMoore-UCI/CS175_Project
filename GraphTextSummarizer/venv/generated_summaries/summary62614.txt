The families of Lebanese prisoners held in Syria protest outside the United Nations offices in Beirut last year. The envoy, Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman, said the United States and Syria found a lot of "common ground" on which to cooperate in the Middle East, but warned to "keep expectations in check" as Washington and Damascus re-engage after several years of strained relations. Syria maintained tens of thousands of troops in Lebanon from the 1970s until they were forced out by massive popular protests in 2005. -- Lebanon says it has approved the first ambassador to Beirut from Syria, the country which occupied Lebanon for decades. Syria and Lebanon established diplomatic ties in October 2008.
