At least three people died on a dust-covered stretch of highway Monday when at least 19 vehicles collided in a series of accidents because of poor visibility, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety said. Six tractor-trailers, one motor home and a dozen cars and trucks were involved in one of the wrecks on Interstate 10 near Picacho Peak. A pickup truck lay on its side ahead of the main entanglement of crashed commercial trucks and cars. Bart Graves said 12 other people were injured -- many of them seriously -- during the dust-storm-induced series of pileups that were flagged to CNN by Twitter. Other drivers were warned to avoid the area, because the highway will be closed for some time.
