-- For his first event in New Hampshire on Thursday, Sen. Rand Paul agreed to do some phone-banking at U.S. Senate candidate Scott Brown's headquarters in Manchester. Brown, who Paul endorsed at a separate event last month, was out of town. "I know he's had a lot of roots here," Paul continued, before spelling out Brown's connections to the state. Paul went on to describe Brown as an "honest" man and talked up the former senator's economic positions. Paul, Horn and Brown drove about 20 minutes to the next stop in Concord, where they would phone-bank once again.
