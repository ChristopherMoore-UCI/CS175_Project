Tomorrow, he will give the  keynote address at "The Future of Food" conference at Georgetown University on future sustainability of the  world's food system and the importance of resiliency of our ecosystem. Earlier Tuesday, the prince attended a  reception at the Supreme Court for Marshall Scholar alumni. The program is  funded by the British government to introduce top U.S.  college students to British culture. The British Embassy says the visit will  highlight environmental sustainability and that's why he stopped by the Common  Good City Farm where they grow fruits and vegetables and supply it  to the low income residents of the community who can't afford healthy food. On Wednesday, Prince Charles will go to the  White House to meet with President Obama.
