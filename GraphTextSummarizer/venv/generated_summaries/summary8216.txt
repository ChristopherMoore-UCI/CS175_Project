Decoding the layers of light Task lighting Vanity lighting gets top consideration because these fixtures work the hardest to illuminate the head and face for grooming. The shower is a secondary area of task lighting. The most common mistake people make is putting recessed ceiling fixtures directly over the mirror. In a very small space like a powder room, dimming the vanity fixtures might even provide all-in-one task, ambient, and accent lighting. Don't confuse this with the less rigorous "damp-location" rating that's ascribed to most outdoor lighting.
