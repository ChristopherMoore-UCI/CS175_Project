-- A line drive struck Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Alex Cobb flush in the head Saturday afternoon, sending him sprawling to the ground and eventually to a Florida hospital. Video shows Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer hitting a pitch right back up the middle -- hitting Cobb on the right ear, Tampa Bay explained in a tweet. The 25-year-old Cobb immediately clutched his head and fell to the ground as the ball careened back to Rays catcher Jose Lobaton, who proceeded to throw Hosmer out at first base. Cobb was later taken off the field on a stretcher and taken to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg. A few hours later -- after the Rays wrapped up a 5-3 win -- the team tweeted about Cobb's condition.
