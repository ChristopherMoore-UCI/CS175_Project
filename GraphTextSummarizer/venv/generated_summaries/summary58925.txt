"He was always searching for something greater." Leighton, who helped keep Akamai going in the dark days after Lewin's death, wonders as well. That was partly due to his low-profile life and business -- Akamai is an infrastructure company, and Lewin wasn't flashy with his instant dot-com millions -- and partly because his friends and family shied away from publicity. Some Akamai colleagues found him abrasive, and Lewin -- who had a fondness for words -- joked about being "obstreperous." Even by MIT standards, says Tom Leighton, Danny Lewin was special. By 2001, Akamai stock was selling for less than $5.
