I think we owe it to everybody," said Army Maj. Gen. Bennet Sacolick, the director of force management and development for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The Pentagon unveiled plans Tuesday for fully integrating women into front-line and special combat roles, including elite forces such as Army Rangers and Navy SEALs. It also comes as the U.S. military adjusts its mission and force to a post-war era for the first time in 12 years as it winds down combat operations in Afghanistan and confronts severe budget cuts. Services will evaluate cultural issues and physical demands associated with fully integrating forces and, in some cases, assessing the views of men who comprise the Rangers, SEALs and Army Green Beret units. Military leaders released individual plans for the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marines and special forces on Tuesday, and said they would spend the next year or so evaluating how they should be carried out.
