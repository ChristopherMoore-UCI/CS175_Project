In separate American laboratories, two men working separately -- Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Albert Sabin -- were determined to defeat the polio virus, to end the heartbreak. Jonas Salk died in 1995 at the age of 80; Albert Sabin died in 1993 at the age of 86. I can still hear Dr. Sabin's voice: "There is a line -- I believe it is by Sir Francis Drake -- that a superior officer of mine during World War II quoted to me. Salk developed the first, injectable polio vaccine; Sabin developed an oral vaccine that would eventually supplant it. Sabin was looking for the answer at the same time.
