Rivalry and fighting have emerged between extremist groups in Syria, such al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri exhorted his fighters to find out who killed his chief representative in war-torn Syria, where militants have had a strong presence and strong rivalries amid the country's civil war. Syria, now in its fourth year of civil warfare, has been the site of what many have called a deadly proxy war between Shiite and Sunni militants. Islamic militants, such as al Qaeda-linked groups, have taken up arms in the country. Iran has backed Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria, and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group, has fought in support of the government.
