The moderators tried to explain the disagreement while Republicans in the audience chided Crist for breaking rules -- at least as Scott saw them -- against props on stage. Scott's Democratic challenger, former Gov. Charlie Crist, had set up a small fan underneath his podium, apparently trying to keep himself from sweating under the Broward College stage's lights. Update: An earlier version of this story misstated how many jobs Gov. Rick Scott said were lost in Florida while Crist was governor. That could have actually been a solution to the standoff that took up the first seven minutes of the debate because Scott's protest flamed over Crist's apparent disregard for a previous agreement that electronic devices would be banned from the stage Scott saw the fan, a prop that often accompanies Crist at public appearances, as a violation of the debate's rules and said he wouldn't participate.
