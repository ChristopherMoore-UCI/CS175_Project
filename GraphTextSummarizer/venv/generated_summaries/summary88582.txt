-- Plans to drive the Taliban from Afghanistan's second-largest city and surrounding districts will start only when the plans have the support of the population, Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Monday. Asked whether the administration has confidence in Karzai, Gibbs said, "President Karzai is the elected leader of Afghanistan. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told reporters Monday that Karzai's remarks were "genuinely troubling." Karzai has told tribal leaders in the Kandahar region, the Taliban's traditional stronghold, that he would hold back the NATO offensive until he had their backing. He further aggravated Washington, his biggest backer, on Sunday when he told a gathering of tribal leaders that the U.S.-led alliance would not move against Taliban fighters in Kandahar "until you say we can."
