Leprich and Tittjung were armed guards at the Mauthausen concentration camp and Gross Raming subcamp, while Kumpf served at the Sachsenhausen camp, the court order said. Visitors mark 60th anniversary of liberation Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 2005. The 18-page document cited prior judicial investigative work from other countries regarding the backgrounds of the three alleged ex-Nazi guards and their suspected roles in the notorious Nazi death camps during World War II. Some Spaniards arrived at the Sachsenhausen camp, in convoys from France, the document said.
