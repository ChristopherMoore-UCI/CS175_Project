Abbreviations, misspellings and the introduction of many English words into Italian have impoverished language skills. At age 15, Italian students rank below the OECD average literacy level and Eurostat reports that Italy has the lowest percentage of university graduates aged 30-34 in the European Union. If you take a look at Italian language forums and debate websites it's clear that many Italians are clueless on grammar and don't even know how to use verbs properly. When I attended university, the most dreaded exam of all was the essay on Italian literature and history. The truth is that Italian education is badly in need of a restyle.
