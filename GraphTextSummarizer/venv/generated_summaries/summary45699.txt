Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin snubbed home state Republicans this year, instead endorsing an independent candidate for governor and his Democratic running mate for lieutenant governor. Republican-turned independent candidate Bill Walker posted a photo on Facebook on Thursday of himself, Sarah Palin and his Democratic running-mate Byron Mallott, all of whom are sporting Walker-Mallott pins. And it's unclear whether Palin's endorsement will help Walker: 54 percent of likely voters have an unfavorable view of the former governor, according to a survey from Public Policy Polling last month, a number which has steadily increased ever since she abruptly stepped down five years ago. Her across-the-aisle endorsement is a jab at incumbent Republican Gov. Sean Parnell, who served as Palin's lieutenant governor when she was the head of the Alaskan state government from 2006 to 2009. During her tenure as governor, Palin increased oil taxes in the state, a  revenue generator for Alaska heralded by the 2008 vice presidential candidate as one of her biggest achievements.
