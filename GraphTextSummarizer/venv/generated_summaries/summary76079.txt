This makes us vulnerable to microbial invaders and provides fuel for disease conflagrations, with consequences scarcely imaginable. We do know that widespread antibiotic treatments make us more susceptible to invaders by selecting for resistant bacteria. In today's hyperconnected globe, that means that we are at high risk of future plagues that could spread without natural boundaries from person to person and that we could not stop. To explain: In the early 1950's, scientists conducted experiments to determine whether our resident microbes -- the huge number of bacteria that live in and on our bodies, now called our "microbiome" -- help in fending off invading bacteria. In 2010, Americans were prescribed 258 million courses of antibiotics, a rate of 833 per thousand people.
