"Administrator Armendariz apologized yesterday for his 'poor choice of words' when he admitted that EPA's 'general philosophy' is to 'crucify' and 'make examples' of oil and gas companies, but he did not apologize for EPA's actions towards its apparent crucifixion victims," Inhofe said. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters Thursday that "the official's comments are inaccurate as a representation or characterization of the way the EPA has operated under President Obama." EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday that she accepted a letter of resignation from Al Armendariz. In the letter dated Sunday, Armendariz said he regrets his comments, adding that they did not reflect on his work or the work of the EPA. Armendariz was on a leave of absence from his job as a professor at Southern Methodist University while he served with the EPA.
