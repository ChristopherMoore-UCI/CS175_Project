-- A lightning strike sparked a fire Monday that destroyed the Caribbean island home of Virgin Group Chairman Richard Branson, a statement from the media mogul said. The island has been featured on such TV programs as "MTV Cribs," and TV personalities Nick Lachey and Vanessa Minnillo were recently married on the island. " In addition to Branson's private residences on the island, Necker is also open as a luxury resort that can accommodate up to 28 guests for those who can afford the hefty $54,500-a-night price tag. Branson said the house, located on Necker Island, the 74-acre private island the billionaire owns in the British Virgin Islands, was destroyed, along with "thousands of photographs and my notebooks." "But all my family and friends are well -- which in the end is all that really matters," he said. About 20 people, including Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet, were in the house at the time of the fire, which broke out around 4 a.m., Branson said.
