I grew up reading HergÃ©'s comic books about the escapades of the intrepid young reporter, his valiant fox terrier Snowy, and their blundering ally Captain Haddock. Jamie Bell's Tintin is fine, but as fans will know, it's the redoubtable dipsomaniac Captain Haddock who keeps the show ticking over. Like "Indiana Jones," "Tintin" exists in a lost world of colonial exploration and adventure. It's also the better of the two -- a buoyant, breathlessly-paced motion capture animated adventure that puts the last "Indiana Jones" movie to shame. The dastardly Ivanovich Sakharine has his hands on a second section and means to piece the whole thing together, but he also needs the drunken sea captain Haddock to help him decipher it.
