" In Thursday's other tie, Spanish Primera Liga strugglers Almeria claimed a 1-0 victory at home to Deportivo La Coruna. Real head coach Jose Mourinho was pleased his team were able to find a third goal, but warned against complacency ahead of the second leg at Atletico's Vicente Calderon Stadium on January 20. Real fell behind to a goal from Uruguay's Diego Forlan after seven minutes before defender Sergio Ramos headed an equalizer for the home team six minutes later. "The third goal gives us a little peace of mind, but we still have to play another 90 minutes in the Vicente Calderon, where Atletico are very strong. The match at Estadio del Mediterraneo was settled by an own goal from Deportivo's Norwegian defender Knut Olav Rindaroy after 34 minutes.
