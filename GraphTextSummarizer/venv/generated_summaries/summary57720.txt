It means teaching children to behave -- and telling them that America was built by people who behaved. In the Jefferson County, Colorado, school district, a new right-leaning school board recently tried to push through a history curriculum that would celebrate America more and downplay the role of protests and social unrest. But to impart such patriotism to children we should behave like adults and not children. This move, perhaps predictably, has led to protests and social unrest by students and teachers. Which means admitting that even though we Americans have done good things, and still do, we have also done bad things, and still do.
