-- Robin van Persie salvaged a point for Manchester United against English Premier League leader Chelsea with an injury-time equalizer in a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford Sunday. Everton capped a fine week by beating second bottom Burnley 3-1 with Samuel Eto'o scoring twice. Eyebrows were raised when Jose Mourinho re-signed the 36-year-old Drogba in the summer, but the Ivorian star rolled back the years with his second half effort. United was staring defeat in the face after trailing to a Didier Drogba goal when Angel Di Maria won a free kick which led to the dismissal of Branislav Ivanovic for a second yellow card. Goals in each half from Arturo Vidal and Fernando Llorente were enough to secure three points for Juve, whose nearest rival Roma was held to a goalless draw by Sampdoria Saturday night.
