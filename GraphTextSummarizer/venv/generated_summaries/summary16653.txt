Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader for two decades, took the stage during Friday prayers at Tehran University with a few notes on small pieces of paper in his left hand. A man in the crowd holds up a photo of Ahmadinejad during Khamenei's address at Friday prayers. The tens of thousands who showed up for Friday prayer were a stark contrast to the demonstrators. It was the man sitting in the front row: Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Editor's note: Reza Sayah is one of the few Western journalists reporting from Tehran after the Iranian government placed restrictions on coverage.
