A large part of the pilot program would also involve continuing its work in training local mechanics to maintain the water supply, which Charity: water says will spur job creation. Charity: water founder Scott Harrison announced the new plan today at the 2012 LeWeb conference in Paris. The sensors will transmit real-time data to the charity and its donors on the condition and flow of water at particular wells. The aid group -- founded in 2006 -- began its work in Uganda, installing wells in refugee camps. The non-profit group that builds water wells for communities in the developing world is hoping to install 4,000 low-cost remote sensors.
