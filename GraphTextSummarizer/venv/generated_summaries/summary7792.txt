Peek Retina was borne out of Bastawrous' frustration at having to transport bulky eye equipment to remote areas in Kenya during a community study as part of his PhD at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Developed by a team of eye care specialists, software developers and product designers, it aims to increase access to high-quality eye care worldwide. Dr Giardini, Lecturer in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Strathclyde, who also worked on the project said: "Peek Retina is the optimal combination of solid engineering experience, ingenuity and outlook to social impact. The tools have been developed through a collaboration between the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the University of Strathclyde and the NHS Glasgow Centre for Ophthalmic Research. "80% of this blindness is avoidable, but in many regions people don't have access to eye care," he said.
