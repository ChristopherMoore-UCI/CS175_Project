Last year, TV networks launched a flurry of lawsuits against Dish Network over its AdHop feature, which lets users automatically skip commercials while watching recorded shows. The number of hours people said they watch TV every week almost doubled in two years: from 10 hours in 2011 to 19 hours this year. The networks, led by Fox, NBC and CBS, claim that such features will ruin the system that finances their shows, while Dish argued that people have been skipping ads, in one way or another, since the invention of TV. But John Burke, a senior vice president and general manager of Motorola Mobility's "Converged Solutions" service, said consumers want more flexibility in how and where they watch movies and TV shows. The United States led the pack, reporting 23 hours of TV and six hours of movies per week.
