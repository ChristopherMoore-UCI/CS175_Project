"You will see a shift from live training where soldiers and airmen go out to fly or go to the range to shoot -- some of that will be moved more and more to simulation," he said. The United States military uses simulation technology to train pilots, soldiers who take part in convoys and medics, who are similar to civilian emergency medical technicians. The centers -- originally designed to train medics and first responders before deployment to Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan -- became so good at saving lives on the battlefield that training was added to include everyday soldiers. Col. Francisco Espaillat, manager of the U.S. Army Tactical Trainer Program, says military convoys are targets in Iraq and Afghanistan. " Large-scale simulators costing tens of millions of dollars still have their place, despite their price tag, said John Lenyo, president of CAE USA, which operates simulation training centers for military pilots.
