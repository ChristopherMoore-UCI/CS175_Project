Usher is "not capable of providing daily caregiving and supervision for the minor children of the parties as petitioner is preparing to film a movie in Panama and has ongoing commitments that require his presence in Los Angeles, New York and various other cities for the Voice and his upcoming album. -- Usher Raymond's ex-wife is asking a judge to give her custody of their two children after the oldest suffered a "near-death accident." Five-year-old Usher Raymond V "nearly drown in a swimming pool and is currently hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Hospital," Tameka Raymond said in an emergency motion filed in a Fulton County, Georgia, court Tuesday. Usher, as he is known professionally in his career as a singer, dancer and actor, won primary custody of the children last year after a bitter court fight in which Foster accused him of being an absentee father. Usher's former stepson -- also Foster's son -- died in a watercraft accident on a north Georgia lake last year. Foster renewed her arguments based on Monday's accident, contending the singer "continues to excessively travel, utilizes third-party caregivers to supervise the minor children rather than personally exercising parenting time and providing supervision for the minor children.
