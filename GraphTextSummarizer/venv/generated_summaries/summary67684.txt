" Martin Mogwanja, the UN's coordinator in Islamabad, Pakistan, said, "There is going to be a tremendous cost in terms of repairing roads, bridges, telecommunications and electricity infrastructure," and most importantly, the farming and irrigation infrastructure. Mogwanja said the response will cover 90 days initially and "will address the most pressing needs in the area of food security, health care, sanitation and shelter. Pakistan has reported that at least 12 million people are affected by the flood but Mogwanja said only 4 million have been affected and that the estimate could rise. Some people are traveling to higher ground to conduct burials, and others are waiting for family members and the appropriate time, Mogwanja said. The priorities which have been provided for so far include: 500 metric tons of food from the World Food Programme, clean drinking water from UNICEF to more than 700,000 people, and 40 cholera kits from the World Health Organization to health centers in Pakistan.
