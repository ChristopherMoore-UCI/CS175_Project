It has been a season of records for the Argentine international who, at just 27, already holds the record as Barcelona's highest ever scorer in European competition. Lionel Messi broke the Spanish league's all-time scoring record after hitting a hat trick in Barcelona's 5-1 victory over Sevilla. " More importantly, however, the comprehensive victory allowed Barcelona to close the gap on Real Madrid at the top of the table who had beaten Eibar 4-0 earlier on Saturday. Obviously for Leo, it is an incredible, brutal record," Barcelona midfielder Xavi told AFP after the game. In the end, Messi didn't just break the record: he equaled it, surpassed it and then extended it in typical fashion.
