Oldest Everest climber finally gets recognition Sherchan and Miura have been rivals for at least five years. Before he boarded his flight at Kathmandu airport on Sunday, Miura said he had scaled Everest for the last time. Veteran Nepali climber Min Bahadur Sherchan, 81, had been acclimatizing at base camp, ready to reclaim his title from longtime rival 80-year-old Yuichiro Miura who became the oldest climber to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain last week. The two mountaineers first clashed in 2008, when Sherchan, then 76, reached the 29,028-foot (8,848-meter) peak a day before Miura, then 75. However, it was Miura's ascent that made it into Guinness World Records, forcing Sherchan to travel to London to set the record straight.
