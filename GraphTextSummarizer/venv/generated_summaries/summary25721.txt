In the case of close races, CNN will wait for actual votes to be tabulated and reported. Shortly after poll closing time, CNN may make projections using models that combine exit polls and actual votes. What a projection call means CNN analysts will make all projections for CNN broadcasts. Using exit poll results, precincts scientifically selected at random, vote results from The AP, and a number of sophisticated analysis techniques, Edison also recommends projections of a winner for each race it covers. Projections from exit polls also take into account the consistency between exit poll results and pre-election polls.
