Oklahoma City Fire Department Deputy Chief Marc Woodard estimated that there were 20 to 30 rescues of people stranded in cars, homes or businesses Monday morning. The Weather Service said 3 inches of rain had fallen in both Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Kansas City, Missouri, which experienced flash floods Monday morning. -- Severe thunderstorms ripped through central Oklahoma Monday triggering vicious flash floods that left 136 people injured, roads and cars submerged, and thousands without power, authorities said. Meanwhile, thunderstorms continued to roll across the southwestern and south-central part of the state Monday evening, sparing Oklahoma City more rain that would have likely worsened the flooding there. According to Oklahoma Gas & Electric's website, close to 1,500 customers were still without power by 8 p.m. Monday, including 1,300 in the Oklahoma City metro area.
