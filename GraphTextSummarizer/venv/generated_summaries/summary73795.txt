No claim of responsibility was immediately made, but the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, as well as bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia, or Islamic law, across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Earlier this month, several African nations -- including Nigeria, Niger, Benin, Cameroon, and Chad -- pledged to deploy 8,700 troops, police and civilians as part of a regional effort to fight Boko Haram. Boko Haram has recently increased its attacks against troops and civilians in a country preparing for a March 28 presidential election. A female suicide bomber attacked a crowded market in northeastern Nigeria's Borno state on Thursday, killing seven people and seriously injuring 20 others, residents and a hospital source said.
