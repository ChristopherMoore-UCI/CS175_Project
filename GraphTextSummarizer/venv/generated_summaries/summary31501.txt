Science fiction writer Orson Scott Card has been commissioned by longtime "Superman" publisher DC Comics to write a two-part story launching its new "Adventures of Superman" digital series. In July 2012, in the second issue of "Earth 2," a new series in DC Comics' "The New 52," reimagining of many classic DC characters, Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern is an openly gay man. The decision to include Card comes at a time when the world of comics, while sometimes still criticized for over-sexualizing female characters, has moved to make homosexual characters a big part of storylines. "The public is running away with the Orson Scott Card story, but I don't want to short-change these other people working on the series." Phil Jimenez, an openly gay writer and comic-book artist who has worked on "Astonishing X-men," "Captain America Corps," "The Amazing Spiderman" and more, is not OK with the decision, and believes Card's stance on homosexuality and same-sex marriage takes away certain people's civil rights. News that Card would be among writers on the new "Adventures of Superman" digital comics prompted marriage-equality group AllOut.org to launch a petition drive aimed at DC Comics.
