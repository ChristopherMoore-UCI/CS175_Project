"While some of the footage provided from this facility shows unacceptable treatment of cattle, it does not show anything that would compromise food safety," a USDA statement sent to CNN by spokeswoman Alyn Kiel said. Mark Taylor, chief operating officer for In-N-Out, said Wednesday that the chain has stopped doing business with Central Valley Meat. "USDA is reviewing the corrective action plan to ensure that it would comply with humane handling regulations before the facility is allowed to resume operations," agency spokesman Dirk Fillpot told CNN in a statement. " Republican Reps. Devin Nunes, Jeff Denham and Kevin McCarthy wrote Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack on Thursday to urge the reopening of the plant because its closure caused "enormous economic stress in a community with double digit unemployment." In recent years, the area around Hanford, about 30 miles south of Fresno, has seen home values plummet and unemployment rates reach as high as 20%, according to Nunes.
