Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, and Martin Henrich, D-New Mexico, are lobbying their parties' top members, incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and incoming Minority Leader Harry Reid, to start holding the meetings. "We believe that regular bipartisan meetings like the one in July 2013 can help foster the kind of productive relationships that will be critical for the Senate to live up to its reputation as the world's most deliberative body," the senators wrote to McConnell and Reid. Republicans captured the Senate majority in this year's midterm elections. Democrats blame the GOP, saying its members have been bent for years on obstructing President Barack Obama's agenda. They pointed to a "frank, open and fruitful discussion" the two parties held in the Old Senate Chamber in July 2013, and said more of those meetings might help -- especially with nearly half the Senate's members serving their first terms.
