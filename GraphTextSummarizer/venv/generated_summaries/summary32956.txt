-- Shortly after Hawaii became a state in 1959, more than 90% of registered voters there participated in elections. Ask five friends to vote (seriously): On a recent trip to Hawaii, I met people who didn't know the presidential election would be in November (It's the 6th, in case that's you). That could change if elections came to younger people in the places they hang out: the beach (unlikely), or the Internet. Start the move toward online elections: Young people don't vote. It's especially true in Hawaii, where less than half of the eligible population casts ballots -- and, in 2008, less than a third of young people voted.
