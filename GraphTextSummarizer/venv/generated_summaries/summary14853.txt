Silent Running (Douglas Trumbull, 1972) "Take good care of the forest, Huey." Our number one: Jimmy Stewart discovers life is sweet in "It's A Wonderful Life" From heartwarming classics to instant blockbusters, these are the on-screen scenes that never fail to fill you with joie de vivre. As the gunfire pauses, Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) implores Private Ryan (Matt Damon) -- and, by proxy, us -- not to waste a drop of life: the greatest of gifts is too precious to be frittered away. A timely reminder of how one man's actions can preserve life and hope. Spartacus (Stanley Kubrick, 1960) After the battle, Crassus (Laurence Olivier) promises to spare the rebel slaves' lives if they give up Spartacus (Kirk Douglas).
