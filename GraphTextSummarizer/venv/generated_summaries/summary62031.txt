According to a recent article in the Clinics of Geriatric Medicine, home visits by doctors dropped from 40 percent of physician encounters in 1930 to 10 percent by 1950; by 1980 home visits represented less than 1 percent of physician encounters. It was easier and more lucrative for doctors to see more patients in their office than fewer patients in their homes. Many patients, the article stated, felt they could get better care at hospitals and clinics, and shied away from having a doctor come to their home. Reimbursement was spotty and in order to survive doctors had to put house calls on the back burner. Ten years ago, Medicare made it a bit easier for physicians to receive payments for house calls by modifying the way doctors bill for their procedures.
