Nowadays, we have things such as archery, badminton, beach volleyball, canoe slalom, equestrian, handball, modern pentathlon and water polo that you don't usually see on TV. The 1904 St. Louis Games had sports I could comprehend. I think they've had every kind of sport so far -- SO FAR -- except bungee jumping, elephant hunting and "Celebrity Apprentice." If I worked for NBC, for example, I would be absolutely begging the International Olympic Committee to give serious consideration to bikini judo. I wasn't yet ready for the National Judo League to put Monday Night Judo on TV, but I was having a good time.
