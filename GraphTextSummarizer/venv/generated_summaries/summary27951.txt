Rated XX: A brief history of female comedies Here are five revelations from the story: She started her career in comedy doing stand-up as a drag queen named Miss Y. When McCarthy moved to New York at age 20, her roommate, Brian Atwood, a friend from home who would go on to become a popular shoe designer, suggested she try stand-up. Doing improv with Kristen Wiig in front of Judd Apatow and Paul Feig, McCarthy blacked out and began rambling about inter-species dolphin sex. McCarthy may be known for swearing onscreen, but hanging out with contributing editor Erik Hedegaard, she offers more "holy smokies!" than f***s as she explains how she spent a decade kicking around comedy clubs in New York and Los Angeles, then gave herself a deadline: If she didn't catch a break by the time she turned 30, she'd consider giving up the dream. ("It was the time of Lady Miss Kier, RuPaul and Lady Bunny," says Atwood.)
