The very first wave of post-election protests in the summer of 2009 left the Iranian authorities with a massive log of anti-government messages, all stored on Twitter and Facebook for posterity to process, analyze and act upon. Even Twitter could become a potent tool of brainwashing: In early July, The Wall Street Journal reported that after two weeks of protests the number of pro-government messages on Twitter increased 200-fold compared with the period immediately after the election. One such video, which portrayed someone burning a poster of the country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei before a crowd of cheering people, circulated on foreign and Iranian Web sites in early December. For example, people turning out for two symbolic anniversaries on November 4, the religious holiday of Ashura and the death of Great Ayatollah Montazeri, were not spontaneous outbursts organized and publicized by the Twitterati. Such intelligence reports come in very handy when protests fizzle out and repressions commence.
