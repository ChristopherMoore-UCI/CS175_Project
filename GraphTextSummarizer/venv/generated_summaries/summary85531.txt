-- Jennie Garth is not ashamed to admit she gets hooked on "Beverly Hills, 90210" reruns on SOAPnet from time to time. Edgy." 2013 will mark the 20-year high school reunion of the fictional West Beverly Hills High School Class of '93, and Garth isn't opposed to a potential reunion special. Garth, who starred alongside Amanda Bynes on the sitcom "What I Like About You" from 2002-2006, has not spoken to Bynes since the young actress' legal woes began mounting this year. Garth's character, Kelly, did get shot at the very end of that episode. "There was a vending machine at The Peach Pit that had nuts and candy," said Garth.
