The decision to announce the pregnancy was made when it became apparent Catherine was not well enough to go on the Oxford trip and that a number of other forthcoming engagements could be affected, a royal source told CNN. She is being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace and didn't accompany Prince William on a planned visit Monday to Oxford. William told reporters in Oxford that the couple were thrilled and Catherine was "feeling OK." The new child will knock future uncle Prince Harry down to fifth. Prince Charles is first in line, followed by William, Prince George and then eventually the new baby.
