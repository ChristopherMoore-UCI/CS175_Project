" With national and state polling indicating that Obama holds a large advantage among younger voters over Romney, Ryan can only help. Then there was this line, sure to be remembered for its trenchant appeal to younger voters who had hoped for more from Obama: "College graduates should not have to live out their 20's in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life."

The former secretary of state said Romney and Ryan "know that our friends and allies must again be able to trust us," what she said was Obama's weakness on the international stage.
