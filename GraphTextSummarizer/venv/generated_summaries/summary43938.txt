"While the majority of Indian students studying in Australia, especially those enrolled in universities and reputable institutions, have a positive experience of living and studying in Australia, the number of such incidents of assault as well as of robbery has been on the rise in recent months, which has affected not only Indian students but also members of the larger Indian community in Australia," said a statement from India's Ministry of External Affairs. Police said at one point that Indian students had decided to take the law in their own hands and retaliate, which was condemned in India and Australia. Australia has seemed increasingly less safe for Indian students over the past year. But hundreds of Indian students saw it differently. Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard dismissed the notion that Australia is a unsafe for international students.
