Comments made by state Rep. John Kavanagh, they say, were racist jokes that used Latinos as the punchline. A lawmaker's remarks at a roast for Sheriff Joe Arpaio made audience members chuckle and applaud. The jokes were jabs against the sheriff based upon allegations of his department's engaging in racial profiling," Kavanagh said. The humor was typical of roasts and had I made the same jokes against Sheriff Arpaio at their annual dinner, I suspect that they would have been laughing as much as this audience laughed. In his roast, Kavanagh also joked about Arpaio's age and other topics, including singer Justin Bieber's legal problems.
