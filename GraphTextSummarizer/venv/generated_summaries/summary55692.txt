New Hampshire remains Clinton country. Sixty-two percent of Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire say that if the primary were held today, Hillary Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democrats' 2016 presidential nomination, would be their top choice, according to a Bloomberg Politics/Saint Anselm College poll released Monday. Likewise, in 2008, after finishing a disappointing third in the Iowa caucuses, Hillary Clinton used her New Hampshire primary win to right her campaign. With Romney out of the picture — though the former Massachusetts governor has left the door open, a third bid seems unlikely for him — Paul ties for first place with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. New Hampshire has always been welcome ground for the Clinton family.
