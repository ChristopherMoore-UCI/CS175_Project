-- CNN and Turner Broadcasting System founder Ted Turner says he's "recuperating well" after falling ill South America. In 1996, Turner sold Turner Broadcasting to Time Warner, though he remained active in the business for several more years. " Argentina's state-run Telam news agency reported Turner was initially treated in Bariloche, a lakeside city near the Chilean border, about 1,500 kilometers (940 miles) southwest of Buenos Aires. Turner was flown later that morning to the capital of Buenos Aires to have surgery, according to Telam. " Soon after graduating from Brown University and serving in the U.S. Coast Guard, Turner took over the family business -- Turner Advertising -- in 1963.
