The awards, announced annually since 2000, are chosen by an "international jury of architecture experts" who select nominated buildings completed in the last year and are at least 100 meters tall, according to "aesthetic and functional design criteria," an Emporis spokesperson said in a statement. -- London's The Shard has taken top honors in the annual Skyscraper Award from Hamburg-based building and construction data company Emporis. " Third place went to the Sheraton Huzhou Hot Spring Resort, on Lake Tai near Shanghai, China. "Construction of The Shard was complicated by the particularly tight site and therefore needed innovative planning," said Emporis. "Its daring design is further accentuated by its illumination at night, which creates imposing reflections of the building in the lake," said Emporis.
