In January, LaBeouf literally took his apologies to a higher level, hiring an airplane to sky write "I am sorry Daniel Clowes" in Los Angeles. In December, LaBeouf was hit with allegations that he plagiarized author Daniel Clowes' work for his short film, "HowardCantour.com," and the actor soon copped to using Clowes' art without proper credit. He began responding to the vitriol online with more plagiarism, borrowing from mea culpas by Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, UK Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and even "Nymphomaniac" director von Trier. Later on at the "Nymphomaniac" premiere, LaBeouf showed up on the red carpet wearing a tuxedo and a paper bag over his head. At a news conference to promote the sexually explicit film, LaBeouf answered just one question before abruptly walking out of the room 10 minutes after the event began.
