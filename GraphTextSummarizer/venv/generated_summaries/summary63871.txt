The group of nine -- three men, three women and three children -- departed Japan for South Korea in line with their wishes for long-term residence, said Foreign Ministry spokesman Masaru Sato. The government kept the group, who claimed to have escaped from North Korea, in an immigration facility in Nagasaki in southern Japan, for three weeks for questioning. The nine came under the custody of Japanese Coast Guard after they were discovered drifting in a small wooden boat off the coast of Noto Peninsula in northern Japan on September 13. -- Nine North Korean defectors found near Japan's coast in September were transferred to Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, a Japanese government spokesmen said. One was in 2006, when four North Koreans floated to northern Japan.
