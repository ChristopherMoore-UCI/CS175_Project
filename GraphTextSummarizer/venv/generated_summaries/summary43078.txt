The local anti-racket commission of Mesagne, a town in Brindisi province, issued a warning last week of heightened threats by both organized crime groups and anarchists against government agencies. Monti was informed of the blast during the night, and has been in close contact with Italy's president, interior minister and other local authorities since. Three days of mourning were declared in Brindisi, where schools will be closed through Tuesday. Italy's Prime Minister Mario Monti said the government was determined to combat crime and unite the country. The explosion occurred early Saturday as students were arriving at the school, which offers vocational training, Italy's ANSA news agency reported.
