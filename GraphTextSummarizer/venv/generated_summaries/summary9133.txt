Hundreds of Bani Walid residents have been arrested by armed militias, according to the human rights advocacy group Amnesty International. -- Libyan troops are surrounding the city of Bani Walid, awaiting orders to enter what had been a stronghold for late dictator Moammar Gadhafi as those inside appeal to the international community for help. Yet many in Bani Walid remained defiant Friday, turning out in large numbers to protest the national government's demands and call for the release of those from the city being held about 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the northeast in Misrata, according to al-Waer. " The petitioners claimed that pro-government "armed militias" were trying to indiscriminately kill large numbers of people in Bani Walid, because of the city's history in support of Gadhafi. But he said that many residents are "anticipating a military offensive, but will not leave the city and are ready to die in Bani Walid." Bani Walid was a holdout of pro-Gadhafi loyalists until the very end of the fighting late last year.
