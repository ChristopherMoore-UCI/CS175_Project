But, paying tribute to the MLS' all time top scorer, US Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati hailed Donovan's contribution to the game's rise in the U.S. "When the story of the growth of US Soccer is told, Landon Donovan will be one of the central figures," he said. Donovan himself gave no hint as to his plans in retirement other than helping soccer to continue to put down roots in the U.S. "As we enter a transformative time for the sport, I will do everything I can to help the continued growth of soccer in the United States," he said. The 32-year old LA Galaxy striker, who was also the U.S. national team's all time top scorer, made the announcement after scoring the winning goal in the MLS All Stars match against Bayern Munich Wednesday. "I feel incredibly blessed and lucky to have played a role in the remarkable growth of MLS and US Soccer during my playing career. But it was for a string of incredible performances for the U.S. national team, and for his partnership with David Beckham whilst both men were at LA Galaxy, that he will be most fondly remembered.
