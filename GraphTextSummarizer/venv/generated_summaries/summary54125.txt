-- A Wisconsin woman who cut in front of a long line of Black Friday shoppers was arrested, police say, after she allegedly threatened to shoot those she moved ahead of. " The store opened at 10 p.m. Thursday for Black Friday shopping, which often draws huge lines of customers searching for bargain deals during what is traditionally viewed as the start of the Christmas shopping season. Lanessa L. Lattimore, 21, attempted to cut in front of a line of "several hundred shoppers" at a Toys R Us store in Madison, Wisconsin, on Thursday, according to a Madison police report. "We have 600 stores across the country and we take security very seriously," said Toys R Us spokeswoman Kathleen Waugh. I'm not a violent person, but police charged me with disorderly conduct.
