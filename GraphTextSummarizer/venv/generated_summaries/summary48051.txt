-- U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warns that excessive partisanship could well "hollow out" the military, saying "we cannot tolerate" if Congress fails to reach an accord on debt reduction and thereby triggers hundreds of billions of dollars in across-the-board cuts. "They understand the threat of terrorism, but they also can't pick and choose among terrorists," Panetta said of Pakistani officials. "If the Congress is irresponsible enough to suddenly turn on this sequester idea (leading to massive, automatic cuts to defense) because they failed to meet their responsibility, that would clearly damage our national defense," Panetta said. He also pointed to -- as other top U.S. officials have in the past -- some Pakistani officials' relationship with members of the Haqqani network, which he claims goes into Afghanistan to attack U.S. troops then returns to its "safe haven" in Pakistan. But he described as potentially dangerous any deeper cuts, like the $1.2 trillion that would be unavoidable if a bipartisan panel does not reach a debt-reduction accord in the coming weeks that is then passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama.
