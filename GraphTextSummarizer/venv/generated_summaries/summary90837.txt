Adkins said Adam Baker faces similar charges, but police have held off serving an arrest warrant while he cooperates with police. "We are running out of time, folks," Police Chief Tom Adkins told reporters Monday afternoon. Adam Baker is cooperating with investigators, Adkins said. Elisa Baker was arrested Sunday morning on four counts of writing worthless checks, said Eric Farr, a spokesman for the Catawba County District Attorney's office. But Elisa Baker has been jailed on an outstanding warrant for a bad-check charge, prosecutors said, and Adkins said unspecified "inconsistencies" in her statement "has led us to believe that she has not been truthful to us."
