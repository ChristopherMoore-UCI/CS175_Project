"I love #southpark for ripping on the police for their mistreatment of black people," tweeted Dalyxman's World. -- Bill Cosby probably wasn't happy with Wednesday night's "South Park." Kyle has a gentle hashtag, #savethelivingroom, hijacked by television executives, thanks to a visit by Cosby, who tells him about a TV special that's being put together. "Oh Lorde, CartmanBrah, dead celebrity holograms, murdering cops, this #SouthPark episode is certainly making #SaveTheLivingRoom happen," added Brett Pender. "I think we take for granted how Trey Parker can jam a heap of current issues into a storyline thats a smart and funny #SouthPark episode," wrote Brent Veale.
