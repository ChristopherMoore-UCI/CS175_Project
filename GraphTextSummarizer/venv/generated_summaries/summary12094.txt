Sala is one of scores of animals orphaned by drought, poaching and shrinking habitats, which have decimated wildlife across Kenya. Kenya depends on tourism as a main source of income. The foundation takes in orphaned elephants and rhinos from across the country, a popular tourist destination because of its animals. Conservation groups such as the David Sheldrick Foundation, where Sala is, have seen an influx of wildlife. "You know if a human child came in need of care, you wouldn't put a bullet in or turn it away," said Daphne Sheldrick of the foundation.
