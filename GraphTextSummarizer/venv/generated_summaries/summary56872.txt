The 10 megawatts of power that will be generated by the Sound of Islay turbine farm pales into insignificance when compared to the output of a large nuclear or coal power station, which according to American hydro energy non-profit the Ocean Energy Council, can produce up to 100 times as much electricity. Mortimer is quick to point out that he believes such challenges are inevitable in developing new technologies and that costs would fall and efficiencies improve as the fledgling industry develops. Other countries with strong tidal resources and potential sites for tidal power farms include Argentina, Chile, the U.S. and Canada. "We have publicly stated that we expect the capital costs of the Islay project to be around Â£70 million ($110 million)," says Mortimer, which equates to roughly $11 million per turbine. Compared to offshore wind farms, tidal energy devices like the turbine trialed in Scotland are completely hidden from view.
