Myanmar state television broadcast for the first time an election campaign speech by the pro-democracy leader, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who was under house arrest for years until she was freed more than a year ago. She called for improvements in education, health care, agriculture and the lives of workers and younger people. Suu Kyi and her party, the National League for Democracy, will participate in by-elections on April 1 after boycotting previous elections. The country's election commission removed a passage from her speech because it didn't conform with current election law, Suu Kyi told a freelance reporter for CNN. The international community has applauded recent political reforms in Myanmar, also known as Burma, long secluded from the rest of the world after a military junta grabbed power in 1962.
