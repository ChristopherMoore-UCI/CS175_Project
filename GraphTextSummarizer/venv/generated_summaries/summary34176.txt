Bartolo "Buddy" Valastro, star of the reality show "Cake Boss," was arrested in Manhattan early Thursday for driving while intoxicated, according to police. In July, Valastro had a different type of encounter with public safety authorities when his 32-foot Boston Whaler got lost in heavy fog in New York Harbor. Best known for his role in TLC's "Cake Boss," Valastro also appears in the competition series "Next Great Baker." The vessel had been lost in thick fog in Ambrose Channel, a busy shipping channel that put it in danger of colliding with large commercial ships, police said. Valastro, 37, was pulled over shortly after 1 a.m. while driving north on 10th Avenue after officers saw his 2014 Chevrolet Corvette swerving through the lanes between 20th and 32nd streets, according to New York Police Det.
