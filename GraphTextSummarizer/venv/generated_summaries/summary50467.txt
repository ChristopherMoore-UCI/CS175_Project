While new businesses help create jobs in the economy, the failure rate is high. But if you must ... According to the Kauffman Foundation, America's leading entrepreneurship advocate, in 2013 about 476,000 new businesses started per month, including everything from hair salons to tech startups backed by Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins. But there's one problem: The startup world is cluttered with "wantrapreneurs" who fail to recognize that success demands a tenacity, resiliency and energy unlike any traditional job short of combat infantry soldier or SWAT team member. Because really, we don't need more startups that are lame, same and tame. The lesser entrepreneurs should go out and find regular jobs, clearing the clutter for those with the idea, drive and overwhelming ambition to build truly great companies.
