Red Bull, and every other team, was left in Mercedes' rear-view mirrors at the final preseason test in Barcelona last weekend, with Vettel failing to top the charts at any of the offseason practice. -- Sebastian Vettel and his Red Bull team have left their Formula One rivals trailing in their wake during a three-year domination of the sport. Vettel insists there is still time for Red Bull to turn it around ahead of 2013's curtain raiser on March 17, when he will begin his bid to become only the third driver to win four consecutive championships. " Vettel made a slow start to the 2012 as there were eight different winners in the first eight races, but a run of four straight victories in the autumn set him on the way to his title triple, while Red Bull retained the constructors' title. Regardless of preseason statistics, Vettel will be the man every driver on the grid will be targeting when the lights go out at Melbourne's Albert Park.
