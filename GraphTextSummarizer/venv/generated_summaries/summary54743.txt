-- Lazio's 0-0 home draw against Tottenham Hotspur in a top European club football match Thursday was marred by anti-semitic chanting, according to local media. A banner reading "Free Palestine" was also unveiled by Lazio fans during the key Europa League match. La Liga high flyers Atletico Madrid also secured their passage with a 1-0 home win over Hapoel Tel Aviv, while French side Bordeaux and EPL Newcastle have gone through from Group D. The European football season has been marked by a series of racist incidents, with England players in an under-21 international in Serbia, claiming they had been subjected to offensive chanting. The pre-match violence and offensive chanting was in sharp contrast to a warm reception given to former Tottenham and England football star Paul Gascoigne, who also played for Lazio. Former England captain John Terry was recently banned by the English FA for four games for racial language he directed at an opponent in an EPL game last year.
