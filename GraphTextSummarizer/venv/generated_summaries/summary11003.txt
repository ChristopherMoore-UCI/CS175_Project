Last week, dozens of Putin supporters formed a flash mob in front of the main government building in Moscow and sang "Blueberry Hill" -- a song Putin performed at a charity gala concert in December. Russia's parliamentary elections will take place in December, and the presidential election will take place in March 2012. Putin -- who already served two terms as the country's president from 2000 to 2008 -- has not announced yet whether he or his protege, incumbent Dmitry Medvedev, would run for the top office post again next year. -- "Putin's Army," a new group of female fans loyal to Russia's prime minister, is calling upon all "young, smart and beautiful" women in the country who ardently support Vladimir Putin to produce amateur video clips that show how far they would go to express their affection for him. And last October, a group of female journalism students from Moscow State University posed in bikinis for a calendar -- a birthday gift to Putin.
