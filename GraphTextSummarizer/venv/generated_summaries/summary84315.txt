In a Facebook video posted by Megan Nolen, two women who say they are Nolen's mother and sister apologize for his actions. A spokesman for Gov. Mary Fallin, Alex Weintz, noted the governor had blocked Nolen from receiving parole in 2012. Nolen, a recent convert to Islam, allegedly attacked a woman Thursday at a Vaughan Foods processing plant soon after he learned he'd lost his job there. No terrorism link found Nolen had tried to convert co-workers to Islam, officials said. CNN affiliate KOKI-TV in Tulsa reported Nolen was arrested in 2006 when an officer saw him throw a bag of crack cocaine and a bag of marijuana out of a vehicle window as the officer pulled him over for traffic violations.
