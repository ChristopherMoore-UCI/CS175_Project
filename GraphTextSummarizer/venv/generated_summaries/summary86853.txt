Asika hopes that artists like 2Face will get involved to help educate music fans about the problem of piracy. But while he has been recognized for his work he feels that back home there is a lack of respect for artists and that the police do not view piracy as a serious crime. The key issues facing the industry are the need to build a proper touring platform, a live scene, and also for major companies and government to begin to pay for the use of music across all platforms," he said. Idibia says the issue of piracy is even more aggravating considering the difficulties Nigerian artists face in getting their music to market. Last year the industry decided to close ranks and establish the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) to give advice to artists about copyright and licensing their music.
