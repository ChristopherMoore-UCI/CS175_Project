Health concerns have forced Catherine to pull out of several events in recent weeks, including the UK premiere of "The Hobbit" in London this week; Prince William attended the event alone. She handed over trophies for the night's two biggest awards: Sports Personality of the Year, which went to 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins; and the Lifetime Achievement honor, which went to Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Olympics organizing committee. Catherine appeared on stage at London's ExCel center to rousing applause, to present the awards at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year show. The duchess was last seen December 6 alongside her husband, Prince William, leaving the hospital where she had undergone several days of treatment for acute morning sickness. The pair made the hoax call to the hospital, pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles in an effort to find out details of Catherine's condition.
