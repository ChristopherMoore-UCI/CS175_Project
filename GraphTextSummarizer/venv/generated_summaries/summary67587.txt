This has motivated Njenga to dedicate his life helping mental health patients and raising awareness in a continent where mental disorders are often neglected and described as "un-African" and belonging to "people in the West." Njenga, however, discards such claims as "clear nonsense." "For as long as you are a self-confessed human being you will continue to suffer human conditions of which mental disorders are an integral part," he says. He's also authored several children's books in a bid to build better understanding of mental illness and advocated for an insurance cover for mental health patients as chairman of the largest insurance company in Kenya. Through awareness and affordable treatment, Njenga has changed how many people in Kenya think about mental health. "Whether you are looking at Rwanda or southern Sudan or Sierra Leone or DRC, the number of women and children and adults who have suffered severe trauma is greater than any other continent that I can think of." He underlines the link between good mental health and productivity and calls policy makers to make mental health services a priority in order to help their countries escape poverty. As Kenya's leading psychiatrist, Frank Njenga has been championing the cause of better mental health care on the east African country and the continent for more than three decades.
