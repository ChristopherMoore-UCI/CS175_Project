While the RSA got a pass, Colbert didn't go as easy on the NSA or Edward Snowden, whom he referred to as "practically a war criminal" for taking top secret U.S. intelligence to China and then to Russia. Colbert asked if it was fair to boycott this conference when other major companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Verizon and Yahoo had all been linked to the NSA. "We can trust the NSA because without a doubt it is history's most powerful, pervasive, sophisticated surveillance agency ever to be totally pwned by a 29-year-old with a thumb drive," said Colbert. Some called for the TV host to boycott the event, and privacy group Fight for the Future had started an online petition asking Colbert not to attend. -- Stephen Colbert is not terribly worried about the NSA reading his emails.
