The Federal Trade Commission is urging mobile phone app developers and phone companies to make it easier for parents to control the personal information being collected by smartphone apps. "Our study shows that kids' apps siphon an alarming amount of information from mobile devices without disclosing this fact to parents," said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz in a statement released with Monday's report. "Even more troubling, the results showed that many of the apps shared certain information with third parties -- such as device ID, geolocation, or phone number -- without disclosing that fact to parents," the FTC said. "Parents should be given the information they need to make informed decisions about whether to allow their children to use apps with these capabilities," the FTC report said. -- Parents are finding it more difficult to keep their children's private personal data from being collected by mobile phone apps, according to a new report.
