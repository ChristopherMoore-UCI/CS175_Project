"We're looking for human remains, clothing or other personal effects of Etan Patz," New York police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said of the current investigation. Though Ramos has been considered a key focus of the probe for years, he has never been charged in the case. The boy's disappearance was thought to raise awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. Etan was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a civil lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter, Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Stan and Julie Patz, Etan's parents, still live a block away from the scene and wouldn't comment on the new developments.
