" Pandev joins an Inter squad eight points clear at the top in Italy, although closest challengers AC Milan have a game in hand. -- Serie A champions Inter Milan have completed the signing of striker Goran Pandev on a deal until 2014. " Lazio were ordered to release Pandev from his contract by the Lega Calcio just before Christmas. The 26-year-old was branded a "rebel" by club president Claudio Lotito and frozen out of the squad, as well as being forced to train separately from his former team-mates. He was linked with several clubs across Europe, including Liverpool, but opted to remain in Italy.
