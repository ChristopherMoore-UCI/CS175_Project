Stuebing lodged his case with the European Court of Human Rights after being sent to prison in November 2005 by a Leipzig court and losing subsequent appeals against his conviction for incest. Their relationship intensified after the death of their mother, the court said, and from January 2001 they "had consensual sexual intercourse and lived together for several years. In convicting Stuebing, the German Federal Constitutional Court had "considered that sexual relationships between siblings could seriously damage family structures and, as a consequence, society as a whole," the court ruled. " Stuebing's sister was not prosecuted by German authorities because she was considered "only partially liable for her actions," Thursday's court ruling said. A German man sent to prison over an incestuous relationship with his sister has lost his case that the conviction violated his right to a private and family life at the European Court of Human Rights.
