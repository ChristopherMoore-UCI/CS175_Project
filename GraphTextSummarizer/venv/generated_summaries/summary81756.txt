Kabul Bank handled salary payments for thousands of Afghan soldiers, police and public workers and was reported to have held up to $1 billion in deposits belonging to Afghan citizens. He added that officials are working to change the country's banking laws to better monitor investments made by Afghan banks and their partners both domestically and abroad. But Afghan parliament member Haji Zaher Qader claimed share holders tried bribe him to keep quiet over the bank's lending practices. Qader would not elaborate as to who offered him the alleged bribe or provide specifics about banking practices that are a cause of concern. "They offered me a million dollars that I keep silent and not to talk about (the) Azizi Bank crisis, but I refused their offer," he told CNN.
