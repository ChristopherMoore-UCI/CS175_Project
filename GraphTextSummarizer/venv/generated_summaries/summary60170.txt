A car rental company isn't going to send you an e-mail letting you know that you're being charged more. I suggested you write a brief, polite e-mail to Alamo, asking it to reverse the charges. A snippy note that said, "Any changes to the basis of the reservation makes the rate subject to change," and adding, "We are disappointed that this policy is a source of dissatisfaction for you." I picked up the car the next day and returned it on time. As soon as you see a questionable charge on your card, mention it to the company or dispute it with your credit card company.
