Last week, after police announced the arrest of a suspect in the March killing of an openly gay man in Maplewood, authorities said sexual orientation could be a factor in both killings. The two are suspects in the killing of Victoria Carmen White, 28, of Newark, who was fatally shot on September 12 at an apartment in Maplewood, police said in a statement. Marquise L. Foster, 25, surrendered to Essex County officials Saturday night. Maplewood is a half-hour drive west of New York City. "What the prosecutor said today is their sexual orientation may have been a factor in their deaths," Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County prosecutor, said last week.
