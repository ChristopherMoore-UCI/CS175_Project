Texas Gov. Rick Perry suspended his struggling presidential campaign Thursday and threw his support to Newt Gingrich, a development that could alter the dynamics of the Republican race just two days before the tightening South Carolina primary. While there are no plans for Perry to campaign for Gingrich at this time, he said those plans will be re-evaluated after Saturday's South Carolina primary. On Wednesday, CNN asked Perry about a poll that showed him with only 6% support among likely voters in the South Carolina primary. On Thursday, his campaign website continued to say "help Rick Perry win South Carolina and get America back on track." Perry said at a press conference in Charleston, South Carolina.
