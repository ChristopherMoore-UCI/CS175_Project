Beckenbauer, who led Germany to twin World Cup triumphs as both a player and coach, showered praise on the current crop after the 4-0 quarterfinal rout of Argentina. -- Football legend Franz Beckenbauer has begun the mind games ahead of Germany's World Cup semifinal against Spain on Wednesday, describing his compatriots as "the perfect team" and calling them favorites to reach the final. " Saturday's win over Argentina was the third time in South Africa that Germany had scored four goals or more in a match and followed hard on the heels of the 4-1 rout of arch-rivals England. He was forced to apologize after claiming that England played "kick and rush" football and had "gone backwards" under coach Fabio Capello. But on reflection, his pre-match comments may have been prophetic as England disappointed hugely against the talented young German team and were well beaten.
