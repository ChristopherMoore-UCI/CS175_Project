After the gentle shock, zookeepers gave the cub's mother, Mei Xiang, access to the outdoor yard, and she spent the night keeping an eye on Bao Bao, "a likely scenario for a mother panda to stay with her cub in the wild," the zoo said on its Facebook page. The shocking experience sent Bao Bao (pronounced bow-BOW) up a tree Tuesday afternoon. -- Bao Bao did a no-no and the shock sent her scrambling up a tree. "Bao Bao is perfectly fine and like all Zoo animals, she is still learning the boundaries of her habitat." "The staff are adjusting the pandas' routine today and are confident that Bao Bao will come down when she is ready," the zoo said.
