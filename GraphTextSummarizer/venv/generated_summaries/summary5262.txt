Syed Ashraful Islam, secretary-general of the ruling Awami League and a government minister, said demonstrators set fire to the Communist Party of Bangladesh office and ransacked several other business establishments in central Dhaka. On any given Monday, Motijheel -- the commercial center of Dhaka -- is a bustling, chaotic mess of rickshaws and cars jockeying for space in overcrowded streets with an equally determined mass of pushing, shoving pedestrians. CNN's Saeed Ahmed reported and wrote this story from Atlanta with information provided by journalists Morshed Ali Khan, Farid Ahmed and Sajjad Hussein in Dhaka, Bangladesh. To avoid a repeat of Sunday's violence, police declared no rallies and gatherings can take place all day Monday in Dhaka. The Islamists let their presence known with larger and larger rallies and strikes, first in cities outside Dhaka and then in the capital city.
