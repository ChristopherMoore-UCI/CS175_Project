We can't let this happen again, we cannot allow services as fundamental as water, sanitation and hygiene that have such a broad range of impacts across human development to be missed off the international agenda once more. Read/Watch: Welcome to Alakamisy Over the last two decades an incredible two billion people have gained access to clean drinking water for the first time, so it's not such a pipe dream to argue that we should reach the remaining 783 million by this date. Access to clean water has always been the foundation of human development, and it continues to this day, but thankfully, most of us can now take this for granted. We at WaterAid and many other organizations around the globe convinced them to come back two years later and address this deficit, and in 2002 global targets were established to halve the proportion of the world's population without access to sanitation. Access for everyone to water, sanitation and hygiene would also save around 2.5 million lives every year.
