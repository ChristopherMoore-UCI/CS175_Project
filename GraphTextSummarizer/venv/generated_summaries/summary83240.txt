Mwanawasa's death "is a great loss for the Zambian people who respected and had great affection for him," according to a statement from French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Zambian President Levy Mwanawasa died Tuesday at a hospital in Paris nearly two months after suffering a stroke, Zambian and French officials confirmed. " "As President of Zambia, President Mwanawasa launched a sweeping anti-corruption campaign and dedicated himself to improving the welfare of all Zambians," according to the White House statement. "As Chairman of the Southern African Development Community, President Mwanawasa worked tirelessly to uphold the values of good governance, speaking out against human rights abuses and threats to democracy when many others were silent. Mwanawasa fell ill in late June at an African Union summit in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, Zambian officials said at the time.
