Detroit police Chief Ralph Godbee later explained that one reason murder charges haven't been filed is that, while all the bodies were found in his city, the women weren't necessarily killed there. " Around 6 a.m. Tuesday, authorities arrested Brown and "another black male, age 32" about 20 miles north of Detroit in Sterling Heights, Michigan, Detroit police said in a statement Saturday. "We've been waiting for four months, and we're just grateful," Chikita Madison told CNN Detroit affiliate WXYZ, describing her daughter Landers and niece Hunt as "good girls." James Brown, 24, mumbled his name with his head down while appearing via video during Saturday's session at Michigan's 36th District Court in Detroit. "We have reason to believe that the deaths did not occur within the city of Detroit proper," Godbee told reporters Saturday.
