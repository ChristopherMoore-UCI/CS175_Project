In Balochistan, four people died in Loop Sherani when gunmen on two motorcycles sprayed a vehicle with what police official Abdul Jabbar Baloch called "indiscriminate firing." Deputy Inspector General Wazir Khan Nasar said gunmen had earlier kidnapped the victims, who were later shot repeatedly in the head from close range. The Karachi explosion resulted from a bomb planted near an illegal gambling and drug center, according to police official Muhammad Aslam. -- Gunmen killed seven people Wednesday in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province, and two more died in a bomb blast in Karachi, police said. In addition to sectarian attacks on Shiites, unrest in the province is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban.
