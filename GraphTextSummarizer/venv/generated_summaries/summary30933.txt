India had resumed on 95-0 in reply to Sri Lanka's 642-4 declared, and Sehwag raced from his overnight 64 to 99 before being denied his 21st Test century when he was stumped by wicketkeeper Prasanna Jayawardene off the bowling of Suraj Randiv. Ajantha Mendis then trapped Vijay for 58 before Randiv dismissed Rahul Dravid in similar fashion for three. He smashed Randiv down the ground for six to bring up his 56th Test half-century, which took 115 deliveries, and he then accelerated as he swept the same bowler to the boundary for his ninth ton against Sri Lanka. -- Sachin Tendulkar extended his world record to 48 Test centuries as India battled to avoid the follow-on in the second match of the series against Sri Lanka in Colombo on Wednesday. The 37-year-old "Little Master" was unbeaten on 108 at the end of the third day, with the tourists on 382-4 -- still 60 runs away from making Sri Lanka have to bat again.
