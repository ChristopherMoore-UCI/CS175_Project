Using containers to build homes has increasingly become a trend in the past several years because it can be cheaper and faster than using traditional construction methods. According to Cross, modifying containers into homes uses significantly less energy than melting them down. "For container homes, it's usually two to four months." Steel shipping containers, like these at a depot, can be turned into homes. The construction becomes cheaper as you get into multi-family homes.
