" Amnesty International said there were 102 executions in Saudi Arabia in 2008 and is aware of 136 people believed to be awaiting execution. Government officials do use crucifixions, or public displays of executed bodies, as a tool to deter people from committing such a crime, he said. In its denunciation of the punishment, Amnesty International deplored the "extensive use of the death penalty" in Saudi Arabia. " Al-Anzi was a Saudi national, said Chirouf -- who added "nobody knows how many people are on death row" in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Interior Ministry said Ahmed Al-Shamlani Al-Anzi was sentenced to death and then "crucifixion" -- having his body displayed in public -- for the kidnapping and killing of an 11-year-old boy and for the killing of the boy's father, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
