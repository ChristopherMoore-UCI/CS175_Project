It's called MAVEN -- short for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution -- and it's the first mission dedicated to studying the red planet's upper atmosphere. The history of the atmosphere MAVEN won't make a cool, daring landing like the Mars Curiosity Rover, which has been roaming Mars for more than a year now. To see its climate state, to understand how the atmosphere is lost to space -- how Mars may have lost a magnetic field -- to take that information and map it back in time," said NASA's James Garvin. New spacecraft will find out "MAVEN will fill in a very big gap in our understanding of the planet by exploring the upper atmosphere and its influence on the Martian environment," principal investigator Bruce Jakosky, from the University of Colorado, says on his NASA webpage.
