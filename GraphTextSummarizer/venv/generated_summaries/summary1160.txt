But what happened to all that "shouldn't expand death penalty to crimes where the victim's life was not taken" language from the Supreme Court? Society's view of the death penalty is constantly evolving, and so is the view of appropriate death penalty crimes. Murder is a subcategory of the broader class of homicide, and death penalty crimes are normally a subcategory of murder. After all, the U.S. federal government lists dozens of capital offenses that are punishable by death, and not all of them involve a victim's life being taken. "As it relates to crimes against individuals ... the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim's life was not taken."
