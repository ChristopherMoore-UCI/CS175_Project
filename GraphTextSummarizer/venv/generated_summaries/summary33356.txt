"What we are seeing is a sense of insecurity or, perhaps you want to look at it from another side, looking for a sense of insurance policy," said Rupert Hoogewerf, publisher of Hurun Report, told CNN in November. Hurun Report, a magazine best known for its ranking of the wealthiest individuals in China, surveyed 1,000 super-rich Chinese in 2011 found that 55% of the respondents either in the process of leaving China or seriously considering it. Chinese millionaires are dissatisfied with their health and are looking to prioritize spending more time with their family, the report said. According to the inaugural report which surveyed 551 Mainland Chinese with a net worth of over 10 million yuan ($1.6 million), the average millionaire in China sleeps only 6.6 hours during the working week. At least that's what new findings suggest from "The Millionaires Happiness Report" released by the Shanghai-based Hurun Research Institute.
