Other DMV employees also received training on transgender situations, he said. The employee, who worked for the DMV for two years, resigned Wednesday and will not receive benefits or unemployment, according to department spokesman Mike Marando. "This in no way diminishes the severity of the situation," Marando said, adding officials believe the DMV employee's behavior was an isolated matter. The DMV employee went through a discipline process and received sensitivity training and counseling after that incident, Marando said. Amber Yust told HLN's Jane Velez-Mitchell on Wednesday night that she got the letter after she went to a San Francisco DMV office in October and successfully changed her name from David to Amber and updated the gender on her license.
