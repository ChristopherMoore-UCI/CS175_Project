-- Casey Stoner showed he will be a force to be reckoned with at new team Honda by dominating practice for the season-opening MotoGP event in Qatar on Friday, but seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi struggled as he seeks to replace the Australian at Ducati. " Stoner, the 2007 world champion in motorcycling's elite class, also set the fastest time in windy conditions in Friday's opening session of 1:55:457 as he again headed off Pedrosa, with Spies third. Repsol Honda claimed the three quickest times in the evening session at the Losail International Circuit, with Stoner's best of one minute 55:035 seconds heading off Spaniard Dani Pedrosa and Italian Andrea Dovizioso. Spanish motorcyclist Hector Barbera, who finished 12th overall last season, was the best of Ducati's three riders in sixth place. Yamaha's world champion Jorge Lorenzo was fourth fastest as he beat young American teammate Ben Spies for the first time in three sessions this week.
