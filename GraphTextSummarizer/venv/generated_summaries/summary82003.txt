It certainly saved me a lot of time -- I always find the worst thing about preparing for a marathon is the monotony of running mile after boring mile for months beforehand Ideally a marathon runner should be doing 40 to 50 miles a week for at least three or four months before race day. This year though, just like the excuses I used to give for failing to do my homework at school, I simply haven't had time to do enough practice runs. After worrying that I hadn't done nearly enough training for Sunday's Brighton marathon, I finished in a creditable three hours and 35 minutes -- only a couple of minutes slower than last year's time. I've heard several other runners recently talking smugly about tapering down in the final stages of marathon preparation.
