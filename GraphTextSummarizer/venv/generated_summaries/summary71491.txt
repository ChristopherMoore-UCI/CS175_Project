Watch Hirsch talk about life on the road Â» As he traveled through the West and Upper Plains on his way to Alaska, McCandless met farm workers, itinerant old hippies, a philosophical old man and a variety of other people, establishing short-lived relationships as he made his way along the road. In making "Into the Wild," Emile Hirsch forded rivers in Alaska, coped with blazing desert heat and rode raging rapids in the American Southwest. He describes "Speed Racer," a Wachowski brothers ("The Matrix") film based on the 1960s cartoon as "a really crazy, Andy Warhol-meets-'Blade Runner' kind of big colors, pop-art, really crazy special effects, very goofy movie. " With "Into the Wild" now safely in Hirsch's past, what he thinks about -- besides the outdoor travails -- was his work with several notable performers, including Catherine Keener, Hal Holbrook, William Hurt and Vince Vaughn. Of course, that's nothing like the shock of going from the wilds of Alaska to the green-screened studios of Berlin, Germany, where he just finished principal photography of next summer's big-budget production of "Speed Racer."
