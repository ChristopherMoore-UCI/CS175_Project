Imran Khan, a former cricket star, this month led a march to the border of Pakistan's tribal region to protest drone strikes, which he says end up killing more civilians than militants. Khan has been a fierce critic of U.S. policy in Pakistan and the use of drone strikes, calling them a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and a strategy that stokes militant anger toward Washington. In recent years, the U.S. government has sharply stepped up the use of drone attacks in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region, widely believed to be a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. Khan: "We'll sweep the election" Khan missed his flight, but he eventually made it to New York, and later Seattle, for fund-raisers for his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. Anti-drone peace march halted in Pakistan Khan says people he has spoken to in the tribal region say most of the people killed are innocent civilians.
