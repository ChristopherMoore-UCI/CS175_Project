At the time, the commission said that the level of co-operation envisaged between BA, American and Iberia appeared to be more extensive than among the alliance members generally -- and stretched to joint management of schedules, capacity and pricing on transatlantic routes, as well as revenue-sharing on these routes. Brussels competition officials have formally cleared the global tie-up between British Airways, American Airlines and Spain's Iberia as well as giving a green light to the merger between BA and Iberia, saying it would not significantly impede competition in Europe. But in February, officials in Brussels started consulting on concessions the three carriers offered to address potential anti-competitive implications of the deal, and in March put these out for public comment -- a move that signalled likely eventual approval for the deal. The European Commission first announced that it was looking at the alliance in April last year, along with the rival Star Alliance, which includes United Airlines, Continental Airlines and Lufthansa.
