It's not clear exactly what caused the roof to slide off, WMUR said, but state officials are warning about the dangers of roof collapses amid heavy snowfall. Up to 2 inches of sleet will fall in the Dallas-Fort Worth area Sunday and Monday, the National Weather Service office in Fort Worth said. Here's what to expect: Wind chills will plunge to about  minus 40 Sunday in parts of North Dakota and Minnesota as another Arctic blast barrels through, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said. And the roof slid off the top of a home in Concord, New Hampshire, CNN affiliate WMUR reported, leaving nothing to protect the family from relentless snow. The store in South Williamson was evacuated and closed indefinitely after store employees detected the cracks, apparently caused by the load of snow on the roof, Walmart spokeswoman Tricia Moriarty said Saturday.
