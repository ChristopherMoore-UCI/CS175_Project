-- A Seattle, Washington, woman who accused illusionist David Copperfield of sexually assaulting her more than two years ago has now been charged with prostitution and making a false accusation in another case, according to Copperfield's attorney and Washington state officials. "Local authorities have charged Mr. Copperfield's accuser with making yet another false claim of rape, this time against a Seattle-area businessman, and with prostitution," Copperfield lawyer Patty Eakes said Tuesday. "These developments vindicate Mr. Copperfield and confirm what he has said all along -- this woman tried to extort money from him by making a false claim," Eakes said. The investigation of Copperfield became public in October 2007 when FBI agents raided a warehouse owned by Copperfield in Las Vegas, Nevada. Federal agents also searched the Hollywood Theater at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, where Copperfield performed, a hotel spokesman said.
