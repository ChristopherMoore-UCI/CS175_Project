The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has contended in court that this legislation was unclear about to whom this language applies -- contending, for instance, that it is relevant for some groups but not those unmarried children who had been in line for derivative visas. Such visas are available only to spouses and unmarried children under 21. In other cases, he contends, the federal government "always credits for the time you stood in line." People applying for green cards often wait through administrative delays for their petitions to be processed, as well as often longer periods waiting for one of a limited number of visas to become available. Furthermore, the agency argued that changing the equation will unfairly affect those already waiting for a limited number of visas, by effectively skipping ahead of them (and making them wait longer).
