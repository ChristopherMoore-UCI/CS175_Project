The committee and the full House approved articles of impeachment stemming from the Lewinsky scandal, in which Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his sexual relationship with a White House intern, Monica Lewinsky. Hyde's death was confirmed by a spokesman in the office of House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. "He was a forceful advocate for maintaining the dignity of the House and for recognizing the sacrifices and struggles Members make while in its service," Boehner said in the statement. Henry Hyde served in the House for more than three decades. Born in 1924, Hyde served in the House from 1975 to 2006 and retired at end of the last session.
