Protesters vacated city hall, unblocked a major street and left other government buildings as part of an amnesty deal calling for the opposition to vacate government buildings in Kiev, opposition parliament member Arsen Avakov said. Its leader and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on a $15 billion deal for Russia to buy Ukrainian debt and slash the price of natural gas. Ukraine, a country of 45 million people, is split between pro-European regions in the West and a more Russia-oriented East. Thousands of demonstrators have packed Kiev's Independence Square since November, when President Viktor Yanukovych reversed a decision to sign a trade deal with the European Union and instead turned toward Russia. -- Ukrainian protesters vacated the capital's city hall Sunday in exchange for the government dropping charges against arrested demonstrators, an official said.
