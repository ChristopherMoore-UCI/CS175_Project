Greenhouse gas emitters What Darwin, Cleopatra or Aristotle could not have known however, is that worms could also have the potential to save us from toxic waste. According to the World Waste Survey, compiled by Veolia Environmental Services, we generated at least 1.2 billion metric tons of municipal waste in 2004. It turns out that worms used in composting emit a greenhouse gas -- nitrous oxide -- which is hundreds of times more powerful than carbon dioxide.
