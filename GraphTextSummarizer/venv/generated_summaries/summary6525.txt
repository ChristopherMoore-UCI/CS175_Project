Elizabeth Guyton, communications director for Brown's campaign, says the attack ad shows that "Shaheen is getting desperate" and "her D.C.-based special interest group allies have resorted to attacking Scott Brown with negative and false ads." -- A new political ad against Republican Scott Brown could easily have been an attack ad against Mitt Romney in 2012. Brown was ousted from Congress in 2012, but he's now fighting to reclaim a spot in the Senate, this time from New Hampshire where he's challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. While the ad never mentions Romney, who campaigned for Brown this summer, the outsourcing attack was a key strategy used by Democrats two years ago when Romney, a former private equity executive, was running for president. It's the group's fifth ad against Brown this cycle and comes as the Republican is in a dead heat with Shaheen, according to a new CNN/ORC International poll.
