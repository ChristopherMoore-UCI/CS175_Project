" Blagojevich was able to leverage a string of endorsements from popular figures like Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. "If anybody wants to tape my conversations, go right ahead, feel free to do it," Blagojevich said Monday outside a Chicago window factory where workers were protesting their layoffs. -- A day before Democratic Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was busted by federal investigators on corruption charges, he dared authorities to tape his phone calls if they thought he was guilty of anything. He went on to law school at Pepperdine University, then went back to Chicago after graduation to be a lawyer. Earlier this week, Blagojevich was in the news again -- standing beside and supporting the workers suddenly laid off at the Chicago window factory.
