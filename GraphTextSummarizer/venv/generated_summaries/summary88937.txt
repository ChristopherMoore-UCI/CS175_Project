While Hopkins' fearful, arrogant, rather pathetic Hitchcock seizes on "Psycho" to persuade himself he's not over the hill (after all, in the previous five years he only had "Rear Window," "Vertigo," "North by Northwest" and "The Wrong Man" and a couple more masterpieces to his name), his long-suffering wife, Alma Reville (Helen Mirren), watches from the sidelines as he mortgages their home, flirts with Leigh -- his latest blonde -- and pushes back the standards of taste and decency in American cultural life. And in championing the overlooked Alma, it not only denigrates Hitchcock's reputation but it also slights his many other collaborators, too, including the work of author Robert Bloch, editor George Tomasini and composer Bernard Herrmann. And now comes "Hitchcock," an Oscar wannabe scripted by John J. McLauglin ("Black Swan") and directed by Sacha Gervasi ("Anvil"), with Anthony Hopkins as the portly English master of suspense and Scarlett Johansson (very good) as "Psycho" star Janet Leigh. Certainly, one of the things that makes "Psycho" such a great film is that it takes this monstrous, deviant figure, Norman Bates, and forges a human connection, a slender cord of attraction and empathy between him and Leigh's character, Marion Crane. "Hitchcock," on the other hand, chooses to demonize the artist, finding something suspect and distasteful in his pursuit of the Gein story -- itself turned into a kind of obsession -- even as it plays the studio head's dismay for self-congratulatory laughs and cannibalizes Hollywood history.
