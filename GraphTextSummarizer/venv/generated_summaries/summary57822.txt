Anderson also allegedly reposted information from a now-invalid Instagram account known as "Rats215" that listed photos and information about witnesses in Philadelphia criminal cases, according to police spokeswoman Tanya Little. "The actions of this teenager could have lasting repercussions on untold cases here in Philadelphia," District Attorney Seth Williams said in a statement. -- Social media posts Wednesday landed a Philadelphia teenager in jail after prosecutors accused him of using Twitter to reveal the names of witnesses in court cases. The case against Nasheen Anderson, 17, who was charged with witness intimidation and making terroristic threats, offers a glimpse into how the reach and power of social media could be used to derail criminal cases. Anderson is accused of posting information related to a 2012 shooting in Southwest Philadelphia on his Twitter account, according to Tasha Jamerson, a spokeswoman for the district attorney.
