-- China's top foreign policy official met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il Thursday and the two sides "reached consensus" about defusing tensions on the Korean peninsula, officials said. China has also called for "emergency" talks among all the six countries -- North Korea, South Korea, China, the United States, Japan and Russia -- to address the tensions on the Korean peninsula. Tensions on the Korean peninsula escalated following North Korea's shelling of South Korea's Yeonpyeong Island last month, as well as the March sinking of a South Korean warship -- allegedly by a North Korean torpedo -- and recent revelations that it is enriching uranium for nuclear weapons. North Korean officials have been pushing for the resumption of six-party talks including China and Russia. For the second day in a row, the head of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff called on China to use its influence instead to rein in North Korea to prevent a full-blown crisis.
