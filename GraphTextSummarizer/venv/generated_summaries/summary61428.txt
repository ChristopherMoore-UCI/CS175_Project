But the flight attendant testified that she was pressured by another Korean Air manager to keep quiet about Cho's behavior. The case, dubbed "nut rage," gripped South Korea, especially because Cho is the Korean Air chairman's daughter. Heather Cho was working for Korean Air on December 5 when, as a first-class passenger on an international flight, an attendant served her macadamia nuts in a bag. The judge blasted Cho for her conduct, saying that she had used the plane as if it were her personal car and that as a passenger, she could not override crew members and give orders during a flight. Following public fury over the December incident, Korean Air chairman Cho Yang-ho apologized to the flight attendants and the public.
