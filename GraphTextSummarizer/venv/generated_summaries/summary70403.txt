"For eclipse watchers, this means that the moon will appear very high in the night sky, as the solstice marks the time when Earth's axial tilt is farthest away from the sun," NASA said. "Moon fully covered, appears red - very cool," said Adam Goodman in Toronto, Ontario. A lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth lines up between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's rays and casting its shadow on the moon, according to NASA. The new color stems from indirect sunlight that passes through Earth's atmosphere and casts a glow on the moon, NASA said. NASA will stream a live video feed of the eclipse from a camera mounted at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.
