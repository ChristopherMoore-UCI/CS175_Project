Thirty-year-old Hafez Nazeri told CNN he was pleased to present "another dimension of Iran and Iranian culture to the Western people." A father and son from Iran led American musicians in a hybrid session of traditional Iranian and classical Western music. The younger Nazeri said his music might be able to bridge cultural divides between Iran and the United States. With just a few musicians, they form a rare group, blending Persian traditional themes with Western classical style. Rachel Cooper, director of cultural programs and performing arts at the Asia Society, said, "You're seeing the Iranian culture and the Western culture in something that's a kind of hybrid, that I think represents the times that we live in." The Nazeris receive cultural support from the nonprofit New York-based Asia Society, Cooper told CNN.
