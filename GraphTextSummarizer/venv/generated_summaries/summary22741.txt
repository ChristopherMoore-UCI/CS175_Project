Oil magnate Calouste Gulbenkian acquired a huge collection of Egyptian, European and Oriental artifacts and Renaissance art, which was brought to Lisbon after his death. A rugged Moorish castle tops the skyline, and the streets are lined with baroque churches and Gaudíesque art nouveau buildings. Here's a snapshot of Portugal's defining experiences: beaches, cities, and food and wine. Families from Lisbon take weekends on the beaches of Cascais, less than 20 miles from the capital. The town is easily reached from Lisbon; trains leave from Belém station every 15 minutes and take just over half an hour ($4.50 round trip).
