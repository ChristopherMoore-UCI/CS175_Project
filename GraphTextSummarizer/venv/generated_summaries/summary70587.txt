" Patrick Sessions -- who, like some of the law enforcement officers on the scene, wore a baseball cap saying, "The search for Tiffany Sessions" -- encouraged anyone with the even "the vaguest information that we can use" to come forward and let authorities assess whether the information is useful. The missing woman's mother, Hilary Sessions, appeared at the press conference with the sheriff, at times smiling and optimistic, at other times teary. Tiffany Sessions is presumed dead, and she's been missing for more years than she lived, but her family and Florida authorities continue to hold out hope that they'll find the killer. Police unsuccessfully tried to interview Rowles before he died, but after his death, they gathered items from his cell, including a journal entry on a calendar that read "2/9/89" -- the date Sessions disappeared -- with "No. 2" scrawled on both sides of the notation. Police believe it's an indication that Sessions was Rowles' second victim.
