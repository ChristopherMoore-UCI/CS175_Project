A defense motion filed Monday in Seminole County court, which the prosecution replied to Friday, asks that Zimmerman's lawyers be allowed to question for a second time Sanford police investigator William Erwin. The document alleges that Zimmerman and his wife have lived "in fear of violence at the hands of those who would wish (him) harm based on their misinterpretation of the events." These and other court filings Friday follow other moves by Zimmerman's team in recent days to raise questions in court and in public about the prosecution's case. While driving through his Sanford, Florida, neighborhood that winter night, Zimmerman spotted Trayvon Martin, whom he described on a 911 call as "suspicious." NBC Universal disputed the accusations and issued a statement saying: "There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly. In an interview Thursday with "InSession's" Jean Casarez, Zimmerman's lawyer Mark O'Mara previewed the court action and reiterated the position that Martin, and not his client, was the aggressor in the February 26 incident.
