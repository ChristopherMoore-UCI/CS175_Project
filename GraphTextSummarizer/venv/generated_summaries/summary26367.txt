CNN's Max Foster: Tired, elated Prince William could be any new dad William's final search and rescue duty was Tuesday. -- After more than seven and a half years of military service, Prince William is leaving the armed forces to focus on royal duties and charity work, Kensington Palace said Thursday. The palace statement said that William is considering a "number of options" for public service. William will also focus on charities that deal with children, veterans and service members. There's no suggestion that William, 31, would ever drop out of public life, but he does crave normality.
