It was an increase in Cuban asylum claims that prompted Homeland Security Investigations Miami, the lead agency for the South Florida Document and Benefit Fraud Task force, to take a closer look at the application process. Investigators are going back as far as five years, the statute of limitation on these cases, in search of asylum claims made with fraudulent Cuban documents. Erichs says the initiative was specifically set up to "combat a rising trend of immigration fraud based on false claims to Cuban birth and citizenship."
