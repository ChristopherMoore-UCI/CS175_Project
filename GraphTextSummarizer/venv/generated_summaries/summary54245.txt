The only Washington type who was smiling on the front page of the newspaper this week was Janet Yellen, newly nominated by Obama to be the chair of the Federal Reserve, and anointed by one observer as the most powerful woman in world history.

The pictures in the news, day after day, tell the story: House Speaker John Boehner looks like he hasn't slept in weeks.
