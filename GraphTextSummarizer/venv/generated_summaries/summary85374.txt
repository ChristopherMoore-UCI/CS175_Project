Scientists were looking for a "boring" and "safe" Martian sand dune for this purpose to make sure that it wouldn't do something weird such as turn to paste or absorb water, Limonadi said. " In its first two months on Mars, Curiosity stumbled upon an area where it appears that water once flowed in a vigorous stream. "The request that the engineers made to the scientists was: Find us a good sandbox, a good sand pit, to play in here, on our way to Glenelg," said Mike Watkins, Curiosity mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, at a press conference Thursday. The handling of sand sample will be used as a way to accomplish this, Limonadi said. The sand also serves as a sort of "mouthwash" for Curiosity to finish cleaning out its hardware, NASA experts said.
