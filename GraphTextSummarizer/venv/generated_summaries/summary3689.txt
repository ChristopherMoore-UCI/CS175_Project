So far, according to the CDC, this year's North American vaccine matches well with the most predominant type of flu spreading in the United States, but is less well matched to the No. 2 type of virus. "It's the best vaccine we have, but there are cases of influenza that occur despite immunization," Schaffner said on "CNN Newsroom" Thursday morning. It can prevent the flu, and it can be beneficial even if you do get sick, said Dr. Bill Schaffner, chairman of the preventive medicine department at Vanderbilt University's School of Medicine. If you haven't been vaccinated, please, take advantage of the benefits of influenza vaccine," he said. The match for influenza B viruses, the second-most common this season, wasn't as good.
