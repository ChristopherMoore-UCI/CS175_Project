Kim Jong Il's death comes only days before 2012, the 100-year anniversary of the birth of North Korea's founder and Kim's father, Kim Il Sung. Just as Kim Jong Il was named head of the funeral committee for his father in 1994, Kim Jong Un will lead the funeral committee for his father. Kim Jong Il came to power in his 50s; Kim Jong Un in his late 20s. For this reason, North Korea's neighbors will exercise caution, keep their fingers crossed and hope against hope that North Korea's new leadership can chart a more reformist (and less nuclear) path than did Kim Jong Il. Over the last two years, Kim had put into place a succession plan (similar to the one his father had put into place for him) by naming his third son, Kim Jong Un, to key posts in the Korean Workers' Party and National Defense Committee.
