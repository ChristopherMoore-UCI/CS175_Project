-- The Obama administration asserts America is "not alone" in planning its proposed Syria strikes, though ally countries have yet to formally join the call for limited military action now advanced by the White House. But Jordan is perhaps the most vulnerable of U.S. allies because it's so close to Syria and has declared that it won't be a launching pad for Syrian attacks. Israel's vast military force -- fighter jets, surveillance, early warning systems -- would be an important asset to American forces if an attack on Syria proceeds. Kerry told the House Foreign Affairs Committee this week that Arab countries -- presumably including Saudi Arabia -- have offered to help bear the financial cost of the proposed military offensive against Syria. "Britain cannot be and will not be part of any military action" against Syria, he said, adding that he respects the outcome of last week's vote and "will not be bringing back plans for British participation in military action."
