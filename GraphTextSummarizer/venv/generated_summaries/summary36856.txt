Last week, the Scottish National Party's sport spokesman, MP Pete Wishart, suggested SPL referees should be forced to declare which team they support, an idea backed by Celtic chairman John Reid. Celtic have been at the forefront of the debate, with Reid last week calling for the resignation of referee Dougie McDonald after a controversial incident during the club's 2-1 victory at Dundee United on October 17. "The behavior of some people in recent weeks has tarnished the image of Scottish football. The Scottish Football Association (SFA) immediately vowed to avert the planned action with president George Peat calling the referees' decision "a sad day for Scottish football." But it seems that Scottish referees have blown the whistle and decided that enough is enough.
