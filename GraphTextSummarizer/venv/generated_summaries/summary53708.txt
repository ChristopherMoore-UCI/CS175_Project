The ISIS fighter, who speaks perfect English with a North American accent, is shown orchestrating the mass execution of a group of men. "Clearly ISIS had a calculated step to be able to put this guy on camera," said Frank Cilluffo, a security analyst at George Washington University. If so, Cruickshank said, he would be the first North American jihadist to commit a war crime on camera. In the video titled "Flames of War," the jihadist first appears speaking Arabic in a classical dialect and with the ease of a native Arabic speaker, CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. The video glamorizes ISIS, according to SITE Intelligence, which monitors terrorist groups.
