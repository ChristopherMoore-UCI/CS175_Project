Russia is much stronger militarily than Ukraine, even under the self-imposed condition of keeping Russian engagement on the level of deniability. While the first Minsk agreement, reached in September, stipulated that international observers would monitor the Russian-Ukrainian border, Minsk II makes the return of the border to Ukraine conditional on constitutional reform -- a new constitution to which representatives of the rebel-held territory must agree. The stronger Ukraine becomes -- politically, economically and also militarily -- the more difficult it will be for Russia to control the interpretation of Minsk II. Over the last year, the Kremlin had to learn some hard lessons: that the West is relatively united against Russia's attack on Ukraine, enough to impose tough sanctions; that Ukrainians in the east don't welcome Russians as liberators, and that many are ready to fight for their independence; and that the appetite for war with Ukraine is pretty low in Russia. Firstly, the EU and U.S. must make it as costly as possible for Russia to switch on war as a means to prevent Ukraine's reform.
