-- Two more churches in Malaysia were firebombed Sunday, bringing the total to six since a court ruled that non-Muslims can use the word "Allah" as a term for God. In Malay, the word for God is "Allah," as it is in Arabic. In recent months, authorities in Malaysia have seized more than 20,000 Bibles because they refer to God as Allah. They follow a high court's ruling that Christians can use the word "Allah" in literature printed in the country's official language, Malay. Malaysia has some of the tightest government restrictions on religion in the world, according to a study published last month by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life.
