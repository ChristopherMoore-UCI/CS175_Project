"The two men first worked together at The Sun, where, Hoare said, he played tape recordings of hacked messages for Coulson," the Times wrote in its report last September. Last week, the Times reported that Hoare, a former show-business reporter for News of the World, also described "pinging" by the newspaper. "At News of the World, Hoare said he continued to inform Coulson of his pursuits. The Times described Hoare has a "onetime close friend of Coulson's." In his remarks, he specifically accused Andy Coulson -- former editor of News of the World, who went on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director -- of wrongdoing.
