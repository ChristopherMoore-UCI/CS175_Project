As they have done for years, content owners will use technical methodologies to identify alleged infringements over peer-to-peer networks and will request that notices of such alleged infringement be passed on to subscribers by the participating ISPs. The program is designed to provide non-punitive tools that will help inform consumers about how to legally enjoy digital copyrighted content and avoid illegal peer-to-peer networks, through a system based on information and deterrence. As the executive director of the Center, I would like to respond to several concerns that article raised about how the program will work and its goals For background, the Copyright Alert System aims to inform consumers of inadvertent or purposeful unauthorized distribution of content over peer-to-peer networks and to help consumers find legal ways to obtain, share and enjoy movies and music protected by copyright. The CAS will only address activity over to peer-to-peer programs such as BitTorrent -- not streaming video or other general online content. The unfortunate reality of malware and other potential dangers on peer-to-peer programs makes this service to subscribers particularly important.
