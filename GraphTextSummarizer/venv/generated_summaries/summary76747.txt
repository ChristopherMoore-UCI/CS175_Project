Last month, a juvenile and a 19-year-old illegally accessed the property of Kraig Stockard, 54, of Delhi, California, according to a statement from Deputy Tom MacKenzie of the Merced County Sheriff's Department. Stockard was booked for possession of child pornography and posted $25,000 bail. Investigators said Stockard has been downloading indecent images of children since 2004. A central California man has been arrested for possession of child pornography, thanks to a tip from burglars who robbed the man's property, authorities said. Police said there were thousands of pictures and movies on the CDs -- more than 30 of the 50 discs had child pornography on them.
