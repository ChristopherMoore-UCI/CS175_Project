He finished 47th in the race dominated by fellow Africans Stephen  Kiprotich of Uganda, who won gold, and Kenyans Abel Kirui and Wilson Kiprotich, who won silver and bronze, respectively. The marathoner was born in what is now South Sudan, which split  from Sudan last year after years of conflict between the two that left millions dead. He attended high school in New Hampshire, where he gave competitive running a try after years of "running away from conflict," he said. "I'm hoping they will at least see me run in the Olympics," Marial said last month. South Sudan will be in my heart," he said before the race.
