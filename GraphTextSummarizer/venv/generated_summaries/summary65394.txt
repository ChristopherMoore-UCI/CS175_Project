The people who became his parents, Dora and Chester Fronczak of the Chicago area, were able to take possession of him in June 1966 under the belief that the boy was indeed their child, KLAS reported. Federal investigators in Chicago hope modern technology will help solve the 1964 case, said FBI special agent Joan Hyde. But now the life of Paul Joseph Fronczak has taken another extraordinary turn, he told CNN affiliate KLAS. A week later, the results of the test ruled out his being the biological son of Dora and Chester Fronczak, he said. Today's investigators will concentrate on who was the kidnapper -- and not on what is Fronczak's real identity, Hyde said.
