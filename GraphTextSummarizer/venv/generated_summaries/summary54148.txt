The change in the leadership of the Australian Labor Party comes a little over three years since Gillard toppled Kevin Rudd in a coup dubbed "the night of the long knives," and backed by key party power brokers. Gillard did not however name Kevin Rudd who promised to exit political life if he failed to win the support of his parliamentary colleagues. In the same week, while in Western Australia to discuss her reforms to education funding, Gillard was asked by a radio shock jock whether her partner, Tim Mathieson, a former hairdresser, was homosexual. With observers suggesting her government faces a landslide defeat in September's election, Prime Minister Julia Gillard was very much a leader under siege from within her own ranks when she called for a leadership ballot. He was a "no show" in March this year when Gillard reacted to leadership chatter by calling a ballot that was not contested.
