Shelburne Museum, Shelburne, Vermont Most art collectors limit purchases to what they can hang on the walls or set on their mantelpieces. The first significant new museum of American art in nearly half a century debuted in 2011. And with works inside just as varied, from landscape paintings at the Taos Art Museum to minimalist installations at Dia:Beacon to American folk art at the Shelburne, you're sure to find a small-town art museum to suit any artistic taste. Opened in 2010 in a thicket of live oaks, the museum encompasses brick-and-steel pavilions, twisted egg-shaped pods and examples of 19th-century vernacular architecture, with galleries on African American art, ceramics and Gulf Coast history. Casting her curatorial net (and considerable wealth) far and wide, Alice Walton gathered centuries of exceptional American art, from the Colonial era up to the present.
