Oosthuizen seals runaway British Open victory Oosthuizen is eternally grateful to the foundation, which was set up by Els in 1999 to help nurture South Africa's next generation of star golfers. -- The little-known South African Louis Oosthuizen shocked the world of golf as he stormed to his first ever major win on Sunday with a runaway seven-shot victory at the British Open at St. Andrews. Oosthuizen joins Bobby Locke, Gary Player and Ernie Els as South African winners of the famous Claret Jug. Oosthuizen, who also has a home in Manchester, England, was born in Mossel Bay, South Africa. The win really is a fairytale story for the 27-year-old who lives on a farm in Gourits River, South Africa, next door to his parents.
