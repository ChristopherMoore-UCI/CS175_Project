Put into bat by Rajasthan captain, Shane Warne, Deccan openers got off to a brisk start, but once Shikhar Dhawan and Ishank Jaggi were out, the runs dried up and wickets continued to fall with Siddharth Trivedi and Amit Singh claiming three victims each, while Warne bagged two. Meanwhile, in the other IPL match played Saturday, the Bangalore Royal Challengers beat the Kochi Tuskers Kerala by six wickets at the Nehru Stadium, Kochi. Earlier, New Zealand's Brendon McCullum and Indian legend VVS Laxman got the Tuskers off to a flier scoring at nearly 10-an-over until Laxman was out for 36 in the ninth over. An unbeaten half-century from South Africa's AB de Villiers helped the Challengers overhaul a Tuskers total of 161 for five with eight balls to spare. Australian Daniel Christian (26 runs) and Ravi Teja (28) boosted Deccan's run rate towards the end of the innings but it couldn't disguise a shortage of runs.
