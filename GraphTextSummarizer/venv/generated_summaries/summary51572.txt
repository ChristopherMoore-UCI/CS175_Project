Major General Vang Pao led thousands of Hmong soldiers as they fought alongside the United States against the North Vietnamese Army during the war in Southeast Asia, according to a news release from Congressman Jim Costa of California. A Pentagon spokesman said he did not know if any request regarding Pao's burial had reached Gates as of Friday afternoon. Costa, on behalf of Pao's family, asked the Army to grant an exception to Arlington's rules to allow Pao to be buried in the nation's most hallowed burial ground. After a comprehensive analysis, the board unanimously recommended denial of the request for exception to policy. Pao died recently of complications from pneumonia, according to Costa.
