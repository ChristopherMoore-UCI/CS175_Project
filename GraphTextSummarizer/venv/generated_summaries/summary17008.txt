His words were in sharp contrast with those of authorities in neighboring Suffolk County, where eight other sets of human remains have been found. Earlier Friday, police spokesman Kevin Smith cautioned against media speculation regarding a possible killer, saying that the two sets of human remains found in Nassau County have yet to be classified as a criminal homicide matter. The teeth were found near where a human skull was uncovered in Nassau County last week, and are the latest discovery in an ongoing search that has found 10 sets of human remains since December. That county's police commissioner, Richard Dormer, said the remains found in Suffolk could be the work of a serial killer or killers. Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said Friday's find takes authorities a step closer to bringing "this killer to justice," though he added that a medical examiner will have to determine if the teeth are indeed human.
