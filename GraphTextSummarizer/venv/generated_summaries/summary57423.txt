Widely admired among Cuban nationals, Almeida fought with Fidel and Raul Castro at the start of their campesino-led revolution, participating in the failed attacks on the Moncada army barracks in 1953 and later aboard the famed yacht, "Granma," that carried the small group of Cuban rebels who would later topple U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista. -- Juan Almeida, a Cuban revolutionary who fought alongside former Communist leader Fidel Castro, died of a heart attack Friday evening, according to state media. Almeida, left, sits with President Raul Castro on January 1, the 50th anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. Widespread speculation surrounding the health of Fidel Castro grew in 2006 after the former Communist leader underwent abdominal surgery and later ceded the presidency to his younger brother, Raul. Cuban state media reported that Sunday will be a day of national mourning and that flags will be flown at half-staff.
