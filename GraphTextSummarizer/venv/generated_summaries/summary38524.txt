In court documents filed in New Jersey Superior Court Wednesday, Helfand wrote that only a few days ago, Rachel indicated that she could not go back home. The lawsuit has not officially been dropped, but Angelo Sarno, who is representing Rachel's parents, Sean and Elizabeth, said the family conflict has been resolved. If Rachel wishes to dismiss the lawsuit, it should "be done of her own free will and not due to the extreme pressure of her parents and the media," Helfand wrote in court documents. Once she learned of the punishment, Canning cut school again and then decided to run away, her father said in court documents. Canning was suspended from school for truancy in October, according to court documents filed by her parents' former attorney, Laurie Rush-Masuret.
