Guantanamo Bay The U.S. occupation of Cuba lasts until 1902, during which U.S. forces modernize the capital's infrastructure. The United States is given temporary control of Cuba under the Treaty of Paris, and Roosevelt later becomes U.S. President. At gunpoint, U.S. agents remove the boy from his great-uncle's home, and Elian is returned to Cuba in 2000. By 1903, the new Republic of Cuba allows for the creation of a U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay in 1903, whose military moniker becomes "Gitmo." U.S. embargo After the Cuban Revolution leads to the nationalization of about $1 billion of U.S.-owned property on the island, the U.S. government imposes a trade embargo on Cuba in 1960 that's designed to destabilize the communist regime.
