But as the peace processes in Ireland and in South Africa demonstrate, no conflict is intractable. Transforming a situation from conflict to peace requires creating an alternative. For those familiar with the peace process in Ireland the language used by Abertzale Left is strikingly similar to that used in Ireland. If there is political will and imagination and a preparedness to take risks for peace it is possible to rewrite the script, make progress and achieve agreements. It is obvious that many of those in the Basque region who we met are committed to peace and that they have consciously sought to learn from the Irish experience.
