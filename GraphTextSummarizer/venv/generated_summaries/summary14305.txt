Besides the annual license fees, Freedom Registry provides Internet service to Tokelau with that satellite equipment Zuurbier brought with him. After some handshakes in New Zealand, Zuurbier took the long, faithful journey to Tokelau with satellite equipment in tow. Through Freedom Registry, Zuurbier didn't just bring hard cash to the people of Tokelau, he brought connectivity.
