The deal calls on nations to submit their "concrete commitments" into an appendix attached to the agreement to specifically lay out each country's intentions for climate change, Obama said. "For the first time in history, all major economies have come together to accept their responsibility to take action to confront the threat of climate change," Obama told reporters. However, he added that it is a first step, and that for many countries "this is going to be the first time in which even voluntary they offered up mitigation targets." " U.S. President Barack Obama praised the deal Friday before leaving the conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. Bringing world leaders to the table paid off," Ban said, according to CNN affiliate TV2 Denmark.
