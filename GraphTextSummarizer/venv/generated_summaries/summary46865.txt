During his news conference with reporters Thursday, Carson urged al-Bashir and President of South Sudan Salva Kiir to meet and resolve outstanding issues before July. South Sudan voted to split from the north and is scheduled to declare its independence in July. South Sudan voters overwhelmingly approved the split in January. The United States is slamming the Sudanese president's assertion that his government would not recognize the new state of South Sudan if it claims the disputed oil-rich region of Abyei. "Those comments are not helpful at all, and they only serve to inflame and heighten tensions," said Johnnie Carson, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs.
