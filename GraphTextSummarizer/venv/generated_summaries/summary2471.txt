When e-mail providers build their systems in ways to ensure privacy (such as by not collecting metadata or by using strong encryption), they come under government pressure, as Lavabit found out to its dismay. In a democracy committed to civil liberties, the basic contours of government power must be known by the people, so that the people can agree to them. Governments that are too efficient abuse their powers, often by trampling political dissent and civil liberties. A common response to this argument is the idea that making government surveillance powers public makes it easier for criminals and terrorists to commit crimes, and harder for the police to do their jobs. This is correct, but we need to acknowledge that privacy is a civil liberty, and civil liberties are inefficient.
