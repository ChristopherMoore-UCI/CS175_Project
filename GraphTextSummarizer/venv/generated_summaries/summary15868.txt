At least 21 people were killed and 97 others injured in Saturday's blast, which occurred shortly after midnight as Coptic Christians were attending services at the church, according to Egyptian government officials. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak called for a swift investigation of the "criminal act" and urged Egyptians to stand together "in the face of ... terrorism and those who want to disrupt the nation's security, stability and unity of its people," presidential spokesman Ambassador Sulaiman Awad said Saturday. Authorities believe the bomber was killed in the blast, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement Saturday. -- Emotional congregants returned to their church Sunday in Alexandria, Egypt, mourning the loss of fellow worshippers in a bombing a day earlier. Tensions have been running high between Egypt's Muslim majority and minority Christians.
