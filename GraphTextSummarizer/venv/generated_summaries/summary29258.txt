"Jersey Shore" didn't end because New Jersey residents complained about the negative depiction, especially of Italian-Americans. I'm from New Jersey, where we were subjected to an onslaught of similar reality shows. "Jersey Shore," "Jersey Couture" and "Jerseylicious" are our equivalent of the horsemen of the apocalypse. Because shows about rednecks are making Hollywood a lot of money. Also sharing that crown is 7-year-old Alana Thompson, better known as "Honey Boo Boo."
