President Mikheil Saakashvili said Wednesday what occurred at Gldani Number 8 penitentiary in Tbilisi is "a horrific affront to human rights and human dignity." Georgia television stations, including TV9, broadcast the videos Tuesday night. Videos purportedly showing guards abusing prisoners, including one male inmate being raped with a broom handle, have led to arrests and outrage both inside and outside the Eurasian country of Georgia. " Human Rights Watch said Gldani Number 8 has been referred to as one of Georgia's "most problematic prison facilities. "During my time in the office I tried my best and did everything possible to ensure the protection of human rights and to bring the corrections system, as much as possible, in conformity with the European standards," Khatuna Kalmakhelidze said in a statement. Georgia's minister of corrections and legal assistance, meanwhile, tendered her resignation.
