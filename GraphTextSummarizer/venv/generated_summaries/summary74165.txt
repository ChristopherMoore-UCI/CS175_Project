In another demo, Apple's Roger Rosner showed off textbooks for the iPad that allow students to zoom in on pictures of cells, dissect digital frogs and make notes and highlights on the e-book pages. Others questioned whether the move could give Apple too much control over educational content. "(It's) not clear so far whether Apple's new textbooks will be open formats (ePub etc.) or only in Apple format," Mathew Ingram, a senior writer for the blog GigaOm, posted on Twitter after the event. In a demo at the event, an Apple employee created an e-book with the app in about five minutes, according to live blogs. Apple said it is partnering with several major textbook companies -- including Pearson, McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who will make e-books for the store, according to Fortune. Books on the iPad are all of those things, he said, according to live blogs covering the event.
