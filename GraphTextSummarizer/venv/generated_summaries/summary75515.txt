Cue the flashbacks and a feeble fictional story about how Poe's heiress fiancee, Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve), gets interred alive ("The Premature Burial") and Poe labors to help police detective Emmett Fields (Luke Evans) find Emily before her breath runs nevermore. What if Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) spent the last days of his life trying to nab a serial killer who's been using macabre ideas from Poe's short stories to off his victims? What drew me into the film most was the depiction of Poe's life as an impoverished poet, trying to make a few bucks by composing detective fiction while fiercely criticizing the work of other writers. But it has compensations, chief of which is John Cusack, who plays Poe with just the right blend of romantic longing and tortuous doubt. Cusack captures that desperation vividly enough to make you wish this was the real Poe story, which "The Raven" onscreen leaves buried alive.
