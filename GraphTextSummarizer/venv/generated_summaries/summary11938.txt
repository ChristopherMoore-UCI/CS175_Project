Jordan Somers indirectly puts the question to al Qaeda militants in Yemen in a video message, in which he and his mother plead with them to let American Luke Somers go. Special forces raid A raid by U.S. and Yemeni special forces last month that freed eight hostages could have also rescued Luke Somers, but a move by his captors prevented it. Special forces planned the raid after al Qaeda militants were spotted transferring the hostages into pickups, "chained and covered in blankets," according to a website associated with Yemen's defense ministry. "We have no explanation as to why Luke was targeted as a victim, and we currently don't know why he is being held," Jordan Somers tells them. Please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for Luke, and we mean no harm to anyone," Jordan Somers said.
