"South Africans are against xenophobia," said Sooliman, who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals. "People are frustrated and unemployed, and people in South Africa pay foreign nationals a lot less," he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants. "In South Africa, everyone knows xenophobia," Sooliman said, "and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand. "A domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house, whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand, so it causes resentment." Imtiaz Sooliman, founder and chairman of the Gift of Givers Foundation in Durban, doesn't think most South Africans are against foreigners. As thousands of South Africans took to the streets of the city of Durban to rally against violence and xenophobia, an online community has joined the protests.
