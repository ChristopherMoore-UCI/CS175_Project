J.K. Rowling penning 'Harry Potter' encyclopedia According to Warner Bros., "Fantastic Beasts" will be the first in a planned series of films. J.K. Rowling revealed as secret author of crime novel Instead, Rowling is going to make her screenwriting debut with a movie centered around one of Harry Potter's textbooks, "Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them," and the sojourns of its author, Newt Scamander. Not just J.K. Rowling: Best-selling female authors with male monikers But while "Fantastic Beasts" pulls inspiration from the "Potter" universe, Rowling is very clear that this movie isn't a prequel or a sequel of that franchise, which ended with 2011's "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2." Instead, with the project being "set in the worldwide community of witches and wizards where I was so happy for 17 years," Rowling says it should be considered "an extension of the wizarding world. The laws and customs of the hidden magical society will be familiar to anyone who has read the 'Harry Potter' books or seen the films, but Newt's story will start in New York, 70 years before Harry's gets under way." According to Rowling, she became intrigued with the idea after a proposal from studio Warner Bros.
