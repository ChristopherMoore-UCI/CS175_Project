Webber pips Alonso to take British Grand Prix You'd put your money on the Australian having a better race than his 25-year-old colleague at this weekend's German Grand Prix. This year, though, he's had the measure of Vettel -- he's 16 points ahead in second place overall after heading off Alonso and Vettel to win the British Grand Prix, and he's arguably getting on better with this year's Red Bull. Webber led for much of the 2010 world championship only to lose out to Vettel at the season's end, but last year he was completely overshadowed: one win to the German's 11, and that came in the final grand prix when his younger teammate had a gearbox problem and let him through. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why Mark Webber, who was touted as a possible Ferrari driver, has signed up to race alongside two-time Formula One champion Sebastian Vettel for another year at Red Bull. Webber wins Monaco Grand Prix Ferrari has managed to transform its car into a competitive machine after a slow start to the season, and McLaren should improve following a "crisis meeting" after the British Grand Prix.
