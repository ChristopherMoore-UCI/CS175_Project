Exactly a week ago, French President Francois Hollande suffered a momentous blow, the first real shock of his presidency. "L'Affaire Cahuzac" has struck French consciences as deeply as Dominique Strauss-Kahn's sex scandal in 2011. Significantly, centrist FranÃ§ois Bayrou, whose last-minute decision to back FranÃ§ois Hollande was a crucial factor in Hollande's presidential election victory, and who has campaigned for years to clean up French political life, made a public statement and declared himself ready to serve. Polls suggested that 65% of the French wanted Parliament to be dissolved and new elections to take place, others that 60% of the French people wanted, at the very least, a cabinet reshuffle or change of government. The atmosphere became toxic; rumours started circulating about other potential tax fraudsters serving in government.
