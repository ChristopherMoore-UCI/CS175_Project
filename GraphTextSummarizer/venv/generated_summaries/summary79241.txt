"The Future": We love Miranda July, so will forgive the fact that the plot of her new movie -- a 30-something couple slowly falls apart -- sounds an awful lot like "Blue Valentine," only with brown, curly hair rather than blondes. In this comedy, Paul stars as the slacker brother of three uber-ambituous sisters, played by Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer. "Project Nim": Back in the 1970s, scientists conducted an experiment an a young chimp named Nim. "The Greatest Movie Ever Sold": Morgan Spurlock, the man who ate Big Macs for science in "Super Size Me," takes on the world of product placement in this new doc. "Red State": Kevin Smith's publicity stunt for his new religious horror film is ... that he won't be doing any publicity for it.
