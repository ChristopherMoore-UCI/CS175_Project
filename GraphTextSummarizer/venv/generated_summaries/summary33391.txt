Iran's parliament could pick the country's leaders "in the distant future" rather than having Iranians elect a president by popular vote, the Islamic republic's supreme leader suggested Sunday. His allies dominate the Majlis, Iran's parliament, as well as the judiciary, and they have been critical of Ahmadinejad in recent months. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei floated the idea in a speech to university students in western Iran's Kermanshah province on Sunday, according to a transcript posted on his website. But Sunday, he noted that the Islamic republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, eliminated the post of prime minister in the 1980s and suggested the same thing could be done for the presidency. The supreme leader backed Ahmadinejad through the tumult that followed his hotly disputed 2009 re-election, urging Iranians to accept the results of the balloting when protesters in the streets declared it a fraud.
