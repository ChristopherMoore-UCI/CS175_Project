Artillery and rocket fire can be heard almost constantly in the village Talakovka, about 10 kilometers from the strategic port city of Mariupol in southern Ukraine. The Ukrainian army has dug in here, fearing a possible last-minute assault by pro-Russian separatists ahead of a planned ceasefire late Saturday. Pavel says pro-Russian separatists have tried several times to overrun his positions, but were repelled each time. Armored vehicles with cannons mounted on top fired from a front line position with tanks standing nearby. Ukrainian government officials including the prime minister have expressed doubts that the Minsk truce will succeed, and those doubts are also on display in Mariupol.
