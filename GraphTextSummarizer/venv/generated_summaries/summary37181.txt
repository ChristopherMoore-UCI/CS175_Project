On Thursday, Fort Lauderdale police said in a statement that those remains belonged to Warren Danzig, whose last known mailing address was in Davie, about 10 miles southwest of downtown Fort Lauderdale. "As the multijurisdictional investigation progressed, further evidence led investigators to suspect Saffran's involvement in the homicide," Fort Lauderdale police said. -- A 65-year-old man's remains were stashed in containers across South Florida, police said Thursday, releasing the victim's identity one day after charging another man in his murder. " The police affidavit says the gruesome discoveries of his remains began in Fort Lauderdale on November 6, when police responded to a call about a suspicious container. Additional agencies became involved in the investigation as more body parts -- which included the victim's head and torso -- were found in similar containers in three counties, the affidavit says.
