The magnets can link together inside a child's intestines, "causing intestinal obstructions, perforations, sepsis and death." The product safety commission said in a release, "Magnets holding the pumpkin shell pieces together can become loose, posing an ingestion hazard to young children." -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued a voluntary recall of a craft kit to create a foam pumpkin turkey following concerns the magnets included with the seasonal adult product could pose a hazard if ingested by small children. About 1,800 kits, manufactured in China, were sold exclusively by Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores, based in Hudson, Ohio, between August and October of this year. The kit comes with various foam pieces to decorate the outer pumpkin shell and six small magnets that hold it together.
