"I just think that so many women can kind of identify with the experiences and emotions and underlying message of how difficult it is to make choices in life." Since so many of "Twilight" fan sites were overrun with teenagers, adult women have erected their own digital havens for fans who could take only so much of the "OMG Edward's so hot!!!" While they resemble the youthful, squealing "Twilight" fans on occasion -- Kellan Lutz, who plays vampire Emmett Cullen in the films, admitted some of the mail he gets from older fans makes him blush -- they're still not the typical fan girls. There's Hansen's Twilight Moms Web site, which she started for married women and mothers who want to revel in their "Twilight" fandom, and sites like 49-year-old Patricia Kopicki's, which is for any adult "Twilight" fan, parent or not. Both of them say they get steady streams of messages from women thanking them for helping them come out of their "Twilight" closet. Jenny, a 32-year-old financial administrator who runs an adults-only "Twilight" blog mature enough to make her shy away from providing a last name, said women have thanked her for being so openly crass about her love of "Twilight" because it frees them to express desires in a way they wouldn't in real life.
