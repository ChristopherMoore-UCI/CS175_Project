"I have handled some of the world's most desirable and important motor cars during a motoring auction career spanning five decades, but I have reached a peak with this legendary grand prix car," Robert Brooks, the Bonhams chairman, said. "If he were here today Fangio would shake his head and smile his slow smile," Doug Nye, a racing historian, told Bonhams' website. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196R fetched $29.65 million Friday at the auction in southern England, said Bonhams, with the identity of the buyer not disclosed. Fangio won a record 45 percent of the grand prix he entered and started nearly 60 percent of his races from pole position -- reigning Formula One king Sebastian Vettel doesn't come close to matching that. That figure beat the previous record -- a 1957 Ferrari was purchased in 2011 -- by about $13 million, added Bonhams.
