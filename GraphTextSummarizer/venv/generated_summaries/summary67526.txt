Indeed it was Carter who made a crucial error as South Africa raced into a 29-12 lead when his attempted pass to Isaia Toeava was collected by Jean de Villiers, who sprinted away to score unopposed and Morne Steyn was able to convert. -- World rugby champions South Africa held off spirited second-half fightback from New Zealand to win 32-29 and clinch their first Tri-Nations crown in five years on Saturday. The All Blacks rallied as winger Sitiveni Sivivatu ran over for their first try and Carter successfully kicked the conversion and a penalty to cut the margin to seven points, but Morne Steyn kept the Springboks ahead with a second penalty. Additional penalties from Carter and both Steyns completed the first-half scoring with the All Blacks guilty of missing at least two try-scoring chances when star flyhalf Carter and then center Stephen Donald surrendered possession attempting to kick through the posts. It also meant that the final match of the tournament between bottom side Australia and their trans-Tasman rivals New Zealand next weekend in Wellington will be largely played for pride.
