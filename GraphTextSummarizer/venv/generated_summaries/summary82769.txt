A NATO military officer said Friday that the alliance -- which doesn't include Ukraine but does include several of its neighbors -- is looking into these reports and knows of an increase in Russian troops and equipment on its eastern border. "If this crossing into Ukraine is confirmed, it would be further evidence of Russia's aggression and direct involvement in destabilizing Ukraine," the officer said. Earlier this week, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird said that he was "deeply concerned by reports of Russian troops moving closer to the border of Ukraine," calling such movement "provocative" and "further proof that the Kremlin only seeks to hamper the peace process in Ukraine." Wherever the truth lies, southeastern Ukraine itself remains very unsettled -- with separatists claiming control over some of the region, despite the efforts of Ukraine's central government in Kiev. High turnout in separatist Ukraine vote Kremlin officials have consistently denied such claims and accused Kiev authorities of stirring up further unrest.
