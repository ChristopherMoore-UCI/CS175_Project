"Arctic offshore drilling is fraught with dangers that defy rational economic development," Margaret Williams, the head of the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic programs, said in a written statement. The shrinking of Arctic sea ice, which hit record summer lows in 2012, has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region. A federal appeals court ruled last week that federal regulators used "an unrealistically low estimate" of the amount of oil Shell might be able to produce when calculating the project's impact on the Arctic environment. "Shell's decision to abandon efforts to drill in this remote and extreme environment in 2014 means that Alaskan communities and wildlife will be able to go at least another year without the added threat of spills from exploratory drilling." Oil giant Royal Dutch Shell has canceled plans to drill in the Arctic waters off Alaska  this year after a federal court ruling put the company's multibillion-dollar project on hold, the company said Thursday.
