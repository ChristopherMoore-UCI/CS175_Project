"She's a filly whose best form, her only form, is on the turf," says trainer John Gosden. "I've ridden a lot of good horses in a relatively short period of time and she's right up there with the very best. and she's won some lovely races but a couple of times she's been unlucky and not had the rub of the green," says Gosden, a former economist who -- with Buick -- makes up an unconventional team behind The Fugue. If Madeleine Lloyd Webber -- who met the theater impresario through his horse-loving neighbors in the southern English county of Hampshire -- is the mastermind behind the stud since its inception in 1992, then Gosden is the former "wayward son" who has rediscovered his true path in life. "I tried to forge my own path away from racing, which was why I went into land management initially," Gosden recalls.
