The first shooting, just after midnight outside a Bourbon Street nightclub, sent people running for cover, CNN affiliate WWL reported. Video from the scene showed evidence markers lying next to Mardi Gras beads on the street and the area cordoned off with crime scene tape as music continued to spill from nearby Bourbon Street bars. -- Two people died and 13 others were injured in four separate shootings in New Orleans early Tuesday, including one on Bourbon Street where costumed revelers were celebrating Halloween. "Apparently one or two people were shooting or shooting at each other for reasons unknown when eight people were struck by the gunfire," New Orleans police said in a statement. "I've never seen so many people on Bourbon Street scatter to the sides," one woman, who was not identified, told WWL.
