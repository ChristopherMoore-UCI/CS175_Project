By comparing the specimens to each other, to other mammoths, and to their only living cousinsâ€”elephantsâ€”researchers have added a lot to what we know about mammoths. The two mummies set a baseline for comparing other young mammoth remains and will help researchers build a fuller picture of how they grew and were cared for, Fisher says. That summer at an annual conference on mammoths, the scientists tried to come up with a strategy to save Khroma. For example, Khroma's skull is slightly smaller than an elephant's of the same age, which suggests mammoths developed more slowly. Still frozen (Lyuba was chemically desiccated in a manner similar to Vladimir Lenin), Fisher says Khroma spent five days at a French power plant and then went to a French hospital for partial-body scanning.
