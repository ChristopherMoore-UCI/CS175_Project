Healthy people are cheap for insurance companies, and sick people are not. Since Romney seems so enamored of firing bad insurance companies, you might think he'd want to protect and promote other people's ability to do so. Thanks to Romney's legislation there, insurance companies can't deny you coverage and also can't charge you more for being sick. Even his Republican primary competitors latched onto the comment, especially as it might relate to his work at Bain Capital Ventures, to show that Romney is in the business of making people unemployed. Healthy people often don't know their insurance plans are bad until they get sick.
