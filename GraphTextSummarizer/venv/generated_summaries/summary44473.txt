Jeff Schettler coaches handlers on how to work with detection dogs, including Kaden, far right, in the field. Police dogs remain the most affordable and reliable solution to solving crimes that require scent detection, police officers say. Training detection dogs such as Kaden often begins during puppyhood so imprinting scent differentiation becomes innate, handlers say. Most trainers in the police dog world dislike experimenting with new dogs, preferring to stick to breeds with a proven track record. Trained dogs can track down cocaine camouflaged inside car seats.
