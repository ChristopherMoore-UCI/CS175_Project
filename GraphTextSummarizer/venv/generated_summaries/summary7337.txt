A flick of the pen President Barack Obama signed legislation this week to end budget-related FAA air traffic controller furloughs that caused widespread travel delays last week. More than 7,000 flight delays were linked directly to the furloughs last week, according to Federal Aviation Administration figures. Good news for air travelers, both domestic and international:  A budget-related furlough of air traffic controllers is over -- and with it, the resulting travel delays. The bill gives the FAA permission to move money from other accounts that allows it to stop furloughing controllers. The flight tracking site does not separate furlough-related delays from delays caused by weather or other factors.
