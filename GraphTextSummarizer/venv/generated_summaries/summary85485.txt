But after investigating the drawing and finding no problems, lottery officials certified Saturday's results, leading to three first-prize winners earning over $1 million dollars each. "Usually, this is the type of numbers they use to describe the probability of life on Mars," Zvi Gilula, a professor of statistics at the Hebrew University said. Lottery officials at first pulled Saturday's result, fearing there was a mechanical error or some sort of tampering with the results. The lottery's official website cited a statistician explaining, "this is a rare coincidence of identical results in two different lotteries." But a quick look at the results caused panic and amazement: the same first six numbers had been picked in exact reverse order and won the lottery on September 21.
