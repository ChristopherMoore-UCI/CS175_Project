Saeed Abedini is a U.S. citizen of Iranian birth. But she feels shocked and deeply disappointed because she's had "to battle my own government." U.S. President Barack Obama pushed for the release of Abedini and two other detained Americans --  Robert Levinson and Amir Hekmati -- when he spoke on the phone with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in September. Between 2000 and 2005, her husband had previously gotten into trouble with Iran's government because he was talking about his Christian faith with Iranian Christians in their homes, she said. Iran's detention and torture of her 33-year-old husband constitutes an assault against U.S. national security, she said. In January, he was sentenced to eight years in prison, accused of attempting to undermine the Iranian government and endangering national security by establishing home churches.
