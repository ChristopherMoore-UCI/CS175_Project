The new government brings months of political infighting to an end following Prime Minister Najib Mikati's resignation in March 2013. There have been increased tensions in Lebanon in recent months, where sectarian divisions reflect those in neighboring war-torn Syria, and a number of explosions have rocked the capital. -- A new Lebanese government was announced Saturday by Suhail Bawji, secretary general of Lebanon's Council of Ministers. Mikati urged the Lebanese people last month to overcome their differences and engage in dialogue or see the situation worsen. Another presidential decree accepted Salam's suggested Cabinet and named the new ministers, while a third formally accepted Mikati's resignation.
