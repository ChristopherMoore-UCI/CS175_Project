At Denver International Airport, this year's group of kids was greeted by United Airlines ticket agents, who had boarding passes ready to go -- stamped with the code for the kids' final destination: NTP. After being entertained by a dance group and treated to lunch, the children and their families were escorted through airport security to their gate, where flight attendants and several pilots greeted them with Christmas carols. -- While most children wait and hope Santa visits them at home on Christmas Eve, this year dozens of Denver-area children went directly to the big man's Arctic home turf. Children are selected from the Make-A-Wish-Foundation, children's hospitals and various youth social service establishments. Singing and cheers filled the plane, and children jockeyed to meet their host.
