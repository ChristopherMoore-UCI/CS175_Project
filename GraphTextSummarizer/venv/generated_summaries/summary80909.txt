The party pulled its two cabinet ministers in the federal government last week, a move MQM leaders said was a warning to the government. Pakistan's government raised gasoline prices by 9.2% and increased kerosene by nearly 6%, blaming higher crude oil costs for the move. And MQM leader Faisal Sabzwari said Sunday that the PPP-led government also has imposed unfair taxes on the poor and allowed an energy crisis to fester. The second-largest party in Pakistan's ruling coalition quit the government Sunday over fuel price increases and other complaints, leaving the country with a minority government. The MQM is one of the largest and most liberal parties in Pakistan, with its stronghold in the southern city of Karachi.
