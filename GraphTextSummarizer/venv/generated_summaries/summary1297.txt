Top Democratic contenders weigh California Senate run "There's an entire generation of Democratic politicians who have been waiting for an opportunity like this one," said Dan Schnur, executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. Beyond those big names -- which rose to the top because of their strong fundraising potential in California, and Steyer's ability to self-fund -- the list of potential candidates seemed almost endless Thursday. Barbara Boxer's announcement that she would step down from her U.S. Senate seat is the golden opportunity that many of California's Democratic stars have waited years for, and it's touching off one of the most unpredictable and expensive scrambles for federal office in the Golden State in years. If pitted against one another, they could split that region of the state between them -- clearing a path for a strong Southern California candidate like Villaraigosa, who has won prior races with strong support from Latinos. With California's two Senate seats locked down for more than two decades by Boxer and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Boxer's announcement Thursday -- via a video with her grandson -- set up a key test of the state's top-two primary system.
