-- AC Milan have moved up to second place in the Italian Serie A table, just four points behind city rivals Inter, after Brazilian international Alexandre Pato scored a last-gasp winner to give them a 2-1 victory at Fiorentina. Fiorentina opened the scoring in the 14th minute when former AC Milan striker Alberto Gilardino tapped-home after Milan had not dealt properly with Stevan Jovetic's pass. Brazilian striker Jeda headed Cagliari into a third-minute lead but two goals in as many second-half minutes from Alexis Sanchez and top scorer Antonio Di Natale marked coach Pasquale Marino's return to the club with a victory. Meanwhile, in the evening's other Serie A match, Udinese fought back to claim a hard-fought 2-1 home win over Cagliari. But substitute Klass-Jan Huntelaar levelled with 10 minutes remaining, after a superb one-two with Ronaldinho, before Pato won it for Milan at the death.
