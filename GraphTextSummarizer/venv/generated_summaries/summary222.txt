The price we are paying to bring peace back to the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine is too high. We are encouraged with the growing understanding in both the West and the East of the nature of terrorism in eastern Ukraine. From now on Russian exporters of terrorism bring tragedy and tears to people across the planet -- from the Netherlands to Australia. -- During the last four months, the people of Ukraine have been fighting for their freedom, independence and European path in a war started by Russia-backed terrorists and their accomplices. Ukraine has been consistently advocating not only international control of nuclear weapons, but today we also stand for the creation of a universal mechanism for international control of conventional arms.
