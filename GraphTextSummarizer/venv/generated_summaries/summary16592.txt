Jose Feliciano stabbed the Rev. Ed Hinds 32 times with a knife after the two got into an argument on Thursday, Morris County Prosecutor Robert Bianchi said. Hinds called 911 from his cell phone at 5:11 p.m. Thursday, saying he was being attacked and asking for help, Bianchi said. Feliciano told police that he entered the rectory around 5 p.m. Thursday, where he and the priest argued, the affidavit said. Feliciano, 64, has been employed with the church for 17 years, Bianchi said. Feliciano also faces two weapons charges, Bianchi said at a news conference.
