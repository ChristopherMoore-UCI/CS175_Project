The six, who are between ages 27 and 38, lived in a tight space the size of six buses in a row, said Rosita Suenson, the agency's program officer for human spaceflight. "This was like taking a psychological trip to Mars ... it was the first full-duration of a human mission to Mars," Suenson said. Extra seclusion will allow them to get reacquainted with their surroundings, including sound and light, Suenson said. Scientists placed the six male volunteers in isolation in 2010 to simulate a mission to Mars, part of the European Space Agency's experiment to determine challenges facing future space travelers. Data from the mission will give experts an idea of how the mind and body would cope with a long spaceflight to the Red Planet, according to Suenson.
