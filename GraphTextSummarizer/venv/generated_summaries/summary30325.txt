New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says he wants to generate alternative energy for the city. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced plans to generate power from skyscraper-mounted turbines and offshore wind farms as part of an ambitious alternative-energy program. For offshore locations, city aides told CNN the city is looking at the windy coast off Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island for turbines that could generate 10 percent of the city's electricity needs within 10 years. He was not specific about which of the city's skyscrapers or bridges would be candidates for turbines, but aides said some companies are experimenting with smaller turbine models that could be made to appear part of the design, reducing potential changes to the city's famous skyline. Bloomberg said the city is already asking companies with strong track records in producing renewable energy for "their best ideas for creating both small- and large-scale projects serving New Yorkers."
