-- Dangerous cocktails of prescription drugs were pumped into Anna Nicole Smith "almost to the point of stupefaction" and eventually led to her death, California Attorney General Jerry Brown said Friday. Brown said his office will aggressively target California doctors who over-prescribe dangerous drugs. Brown called Smith's longtime partner and attorney Howard K. Stern the "principal enabler" in a conspiracy with two doctors for giving the "known addict" thousands of prescription pills. The former Playboy playmate and reality TV star died from an accidental overdose of prescription drugs, a coroner said.
