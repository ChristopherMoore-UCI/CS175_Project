The Israeli government was being accused of assassinating an Iranian general on the Israel-Syria border, and the White House was, according to eminent Israeli journalist Nahum Barnea, exerting significant effort in an attempt to de-escalate the situation with Iran. Yet in the middle of an Israeli election and with a congressional battle over Iran sanctions looming, sometimes an invitation is more political gamesmanship than diplomatic honor. As a proud pro-Israel American, I am grateful that an Israeli prime minister has been invited to address Congress for a third time -- a high honor shared only by Sir Winston Churchill. And it's not likely to work now for Boehner, who is essentially enlisting the Israeli leader to help him try to deal the President of the United States a political blow by derailing nuclear negotiations with Iran through legislating new sanctions. White House spokesman Josh Earnest diplomatically called the invitation "a departure from protocol," and even staunch pro-Israel advocate and Anti-Defamation League head Abe Foxman termed it "ill-advised."
