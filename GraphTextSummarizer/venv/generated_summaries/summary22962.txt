Indiana will expand Medicaid coverage, Pence says, but only if it's allowed to do it through a tweaked version called the "Healthy Indiana Plan," which also requires users to make small payments into health savings accounts. -- As soon as Air Force One touched down in Indiana on Friday, Gov. Mike Pence met President Barack Obama on the tarmac with a plea: Chase Downham, Americans for Prosperity's Indiana state director, called it a "troubling deviation from the solid, free-market approach Gov. Pence has taken on most other matters," and said he hopes Pence is firm with Obama to keep from giving "any ground which would result in Hoosier taxpayers paying even more." He called Indiana's plan "a better and more effective alternative" to traditional Medicaid in a letter to Obama on Thursday. The Healthy Indiana Plan's key departure from traditional Medicaid is that users are required to contribute small amounts of their own money to personal health savings accounts.
