Here in the United States, after gaining the right to vote, women drew attention to underappreciated issues such as maternal health and child care, resulting in policy shifts that significantly reduced child mortality rates. The country's current constitution affords equal protection to men and women, guaranteeing women the right to education, political participation and economic opportunity. Women also provide an indispensable voice in political institutions. Educated women are less likely to die during childbirth and more likely to send their own children to school. This is why it is crucial to retain and expand the hard-won rights of Afghan women.
