Today, President Obama walked into the White House briefing room and took some questions, and one of them revolved around recess appointments. The actions of Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, and other Republican obstructionists will continue if President Obama allows them to run roughshod over him. If the Senate does not act --  and I made this very clear -- if the Senate does not act to confirm these nominees, I will consider making several recess appointments during the upcoming recess, because we can't afford to allow politics to stand in the way of a well-functioning government." If there are members of your own party who stand in the way, such as Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Nebraska, then you also blast them and make them pay for acting so foolishly. The political right used its base to go after Democrats who blocked appointments to the federal bench and other positions.
