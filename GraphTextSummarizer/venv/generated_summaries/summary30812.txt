"We're all relieved to hear Lucy's condition remains stable, and we're continuing to provide support for her family and fellow keepers, while we continue our programs for the whole herd," said zoo director Cameron Kerr. An Asian elephant, Pathi Harn showed no signs of his life while his mother was in labor for eight days before his birth -- alive and well -- at 3:27 a.m. on March 10, 2010, according to Taronga's website. The 2-year-old elephant -- known as Pathi Harn, which means miracle in Thai -- pinned Melo to a post around 11:30 a.m., according to the zoo. "Playful and inquisitive," Pathi Harn is often found "sparring and wrestling" with Luk Chai, a 3-year-old elephant at the zoo. The Sydney zoo launched an investigation, but as of Saturday it was unclear why Pathi Harn "challenged" the zookeeper.
