-- After news hit that "Teen Mom's" Farrah Abraham made a so-called sex tape with Lindsay Lohan's "The Canyons" co-star James Deen, there were conflicting stories about its existence and its origins. When asked how, between Abraham and his "The Canyons" co-star Lindsay Lohan, Deen has managed to get tangled up with controversial starlets, he said, "I don't know. Then professional porn actor Deen said he and Abraham had shot a full-fledged adult film together. I think everybody has kind of figured out that sex tapes are a hoax, so I think now management is like, you should just hang out with James Deen.
