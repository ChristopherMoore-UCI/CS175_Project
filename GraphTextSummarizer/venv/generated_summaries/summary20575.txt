The reviews were prompted by outrage from members of Congress over a case involving an Air Force officer found guilty last year in military court of sexual assault who was later cleared of the charges by his top commander. "Eliminating sexual assault in the military is one of his top priorities," Little said about Hagel's commitment to members of Congress and military leaders. -- Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has ordered two reviews of whether the military justice system is properly dispensing punishments and suitably protecting sexual assault victims, the Pentagon said Tuesday. In a second and broader review, Hagel ordered Taylor to examine military law covering the actions of the convening authority and to see whether changes should be made. Hagel asked that the review "assess whether all aspects of the (code of military justice) were correctly applied and to make recommendations on how the convening authority's decision in this case could be more transparent," Pentagon spokesman George Little told reporters at a briefing.
