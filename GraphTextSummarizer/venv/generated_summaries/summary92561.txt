"The sanctions that are available to the Control and Disciplinary Body can be found in the UEFA Disciplinary Regulations, edition 2008, Article 14, and range from a reprimand or fine, up to a stadium closure or "disqualification from competitions in progress and/or exclusion from future competitions". European football's governing body said that sanctions open to them include disqualifying Serbia from Euro 2012 and excluding them from future competitions. On Wednesday AFP said Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini told reporters: "I have just received a phone call from Serbian Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic, who presented a formal apology from the government." Jeremic vowed "to intensify the search for those responsible and to capture the criminals who will be punished to set an example," Frattini added. AFP reported that 16 people had been hospitalized and 17 arrested on what Italy coach Cesare Prandelli told reporters had been a "night of torment." -- UEFA have promised a "full and thorough investigation" into the violence that forced Italy's Euro 2012 qualifying match with Serbia to be abandoned on Tuesday night.
