The folks at Amazon and Google must have been wringing their hands on Monday when Apple CEO Steve Jobs showed off a new service called iTunes Match. Apple executives provided the record labels with a glimpse into their crystal ball, and nine months later, Jobs' team was getting calls from the music companies, he said. Because technology companies treat record labels like clearing houses for content, Silicon Valley bigwigs have trouble getting through the door, Jobs suggested. So it was perhaps Jobs' expertise from Pixar, during his exodus period from Apple, that has given him the edge to secure risky deals with entertainment giants first. In that interview eight years ago, Jobs described the vast divide between technology and entertainment executives, and he talked about how he bridged it.
