Authorities have increased aviation security, especially on air carriers heading to the United States from the United Kingdom, other parts of Europe and the Middle East in the days surrounding the one-year anniversary of the death of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, said the official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the information and to protect the specifics of how the risk came to light. ABC reported on Monday officials fear al Qaeda may soon attempt to explode United States-bound aircraft with the body bombs. " Department of Homeland Security spokesman Peter Boogaard said Monday authorities have "no indication of any specific, credible threats or plots against the United States tied to the bin Laden anniversary." Their group, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was determined to show that even well-protected targets outside Yemen were not beyond their reach. Never had al Qaeda come so close to killing a member of the Saudi royal family.
