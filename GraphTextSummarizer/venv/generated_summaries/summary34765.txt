Clara Shih, founder of Hearsay Social, started out with a long and varied list of possible careers -- she went through phases of wanting to be a teacher (like her mother), a police officer, an astronaut and an attorney. By contrast, where fathers demonstrated their beliefs in gender equality by taking on an equal distribution of domestic tasks then their daughters would select roles "that are more gender neutral or even sort of male-stereotypic like being a scientist or athlete," Croft says. A survey of the childhood career aspirations of more than 8,000 professionals from around the world, carried out for social networking site LinkedIn, found that 30.3% of the site's members were either currently in the job they had always dreamed of, or in a career linked to those plans. "When we're small most of us have a limited idea of what's out there," explains career coach Meredith Haberfeld. "The dream jobs we aspire to as children are a window into our passions and talents," says LinkedIn's career expert Nicole Williams.
