" Sorenstam retired just at the time when Asian players were beginning to dominate the LPGA Tour, including World No.1 Yani Tseng, who the Swede has mentored. But she was not going to allow something as trivial as economic turmoil to divert her from her goals and Sorenstam has put her name to a growing portfolio of signature golf courses, mostly in Asia. The introduction of golf at the 2016 Rio Olympics -- Sorenstam was in the delegation which presented to the IOC -- will she believes further fuel the ambition of women golfers from all over the world to challenge the traditional American domination of the LPGA Tour. To boost interest, she would like to see the two tours run combined events as the same venue as happens with ATP and WTA tennis tournaments. Sorenstam led the charge of overseas players during her glittering career, which saw her win 72 LPGA events, including 10 majors, and 21 other tournaments.
