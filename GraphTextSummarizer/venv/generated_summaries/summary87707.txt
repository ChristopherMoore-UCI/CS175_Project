According to police, Madison was convicted of attempted rape in 2001 and is a registered sex offender. Shaeaun Child, a neighbor who tipped police off about the foul smell in the garage, told CNN he knows Madison. Authorities obtained a search warrant for Madison's apartment and found "additional evidence of decomposition" there, he said.
