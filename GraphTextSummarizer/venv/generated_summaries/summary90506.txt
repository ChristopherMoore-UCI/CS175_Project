The Thursday morning explosion killed one other worker and injured more than 100 others in what company CEO Alan Armstrong characterized Friday as "a terrible and unprecedented tragedy and an extremely difficult time for all of us." -- A second man has died as a result of Thursday's explosion at a Louisiana chemical plant, the Louisiana State Police said Friday. More than 830 people were at the site -- more than usual, because of a plant-expansion project, plant manager Larry Bayer said Friday. Scott Thrower, 47, of St. Amant, died at a Baton Rouge hospital after suffering burns in the blast at the Williams plant in Geismar, state police trooper Jared Sandifer said. About 25 workers were in the facility's control room Friday to monitor the situation, but the plant has effectively shut down, company officials said.
