-- A Los Angeles police officer has been charged with assaulting a woman under arrest, Alesia Thomas, who lost consciousness in a patrol car and was declared dead soon thereafter, prosecutors announced Thursday. This was after Thomas had dropped off her two children at a police station because she felt her drug abuse had made her an unfit parent, according to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. Thomas's relatives, though, believe O'Callaghan is responsible, family spokesman Najee Ali said Thursday. "We want to have the whole truth of what happened to Alesia Thomas," Ali said. But they're not satisfied yet, pushing for the public release of the video showing Thomas' final moments.
