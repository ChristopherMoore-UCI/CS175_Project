Latiker: What I want people to know is that the work that I and so many others do can literally be the difference between life and death for a generation that seems to have lost all hope. This proves to me that giving hope to others is the key to changing lives. Deciding eight years ago to open my life to others has enriched not only my life, but the lives of hundreds of young people. Buying the building will help us serve thousands of young people. Since 2003, Latiker's nonprofit has taught valuable life skills and provided recreational activities to more than 1,500 young people.
