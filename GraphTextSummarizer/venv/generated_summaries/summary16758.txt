-- Starbucks Coffee Company is the leading retailer, roaster and brand of specialty coffee in the world, with more than 6,000 retail locations in North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim. In the 1990s the demand for high quality coffee allowed Starbucks to expand beyond Seattle, first to the rest of the U.S., then further afield. The first Starbucks opened in 1971, in Seattle, Washington. After becoming one of the first companies to offer stock options to its part-time employees, Starbucks became a publicly traded company. The seafaring name seems appropriate for a store that imports the world's finest coffees to the cold, thirsty people of Seattle.
