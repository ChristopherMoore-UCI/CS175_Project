Bauer was the stronger of the duo and made his run for the finish to be denied by Katusha fast man Kristoff, who was claiming his second stage win of the 2014 Tour. German Heinrich Haussler finished second behind Kristoff, with green jersey holder Peter Sagan in third. Out in front of the peloton for over 200km, Bauer was desperately holding on to his lead as he approached the finishing line in Nimes only for Alexander Kristoff of Norway to lead a surging group of sprinters past him. Cycling can be the cruelest of sports and just when New Zealand's Jack Bauer was ready to celebrate a Tour de France stage win it was snatched away from him in an instant. Kristoff took the victory, Bauer could only finish 10th and with tears in his eyes.
