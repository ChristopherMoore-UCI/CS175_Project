Tajikistan gained independence with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but has been troubled ever since by bloody war, widespread corruption and poverty. Gorno-Badakshan was cut off Tuesday after communication lines, including cell phones and internet service, was severed. Journalist Mirzojalol Shohjamolov said a group of residents gathered in front of Khorog Square, near the government building, with signs that said: "Stop military actions in Khorog." The news agency said Ayombekov refused to surrender to police and instigated the attack against government forces. Fighting erupted Tuesday in an autonomous region of Tajikistan after central government forces moved in on a former opposition warlord believed to be behind the killing of a top security general.
