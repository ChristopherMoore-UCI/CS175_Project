A man who won a contest to meet the cast of "Breaking Bad" back in September has been arrested on drug charges, CNN affiliate WBBH reported. Carroll, who was reportedly taken into custody on felony charges of alleged possession of synthetic narcotics and a misdemeanor charge of allegedly keeping a shop or vehicle for dangerous drugs, won a national contest to meet the "Breaking Bad" actors prior to that hit show's series finale. Ryan Lee Carroll, 28, was arrested Tuesday following a raid on a home in the San Carlos Park neighborhood in Fort Myers, Florida, the station reported. Another character on the show, Saul Goodman, is a slick lawyer who employs questionable methods to help his clients. "It's just so addicting," Carroll told WBBH of "Breaking Bad" at the time he won the contest.
