"We look forward to welcoming Sir Alex Ferguson on the HBS campus to share his remarkable leadership journey, and contribute to our Executive Education participants' ability to make a profound difference in the world," Elberse said. " Ferguson has previously participated in several classes with HBS professor Anita Elberse and has also collaborated with her on an analysis of his management methods. "The time I have already spent at Harvard has been a stimulating experience and I look forward to developing my relationship and activities with the students, faculty and friends of the Harvard Business School community. -- Alex Ferguson has spent half a lifetime pacing touchlines pointing at his watch, but the boot might be on the other foot if his new lectures overrun at Harvard Business School (HBS).
