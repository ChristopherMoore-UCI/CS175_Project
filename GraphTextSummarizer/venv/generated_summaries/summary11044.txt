Men such as Ali Duba (the former head of the Syrian military intelligence and a close adviser to Hafez al-Assad), as well as hardliners such as Maher al-Assad (Bashar al-Assad's brother and commander of the Republican Guard and the Army's elite Fourth Armored Division) disagreed with Bashar's departure from Socialist Ba'ath policies. Growing up as a child in Damascus, it was evident that the current president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, was first perceived by majority of Syrian people as a shy, reserved, introverted, weak, and hesitant child. As Bashar was far from the public eye and not as involved in political affairs, Hafez al-Assad and his old guard advisors trained Bashar for several years in military and political affairs, along with Socialist Ba'ath and secular ideals. Even a sympathizer with the Assad regime, an Alawite named Abu Hisham said to me: "Bashar cannot stand against powers such as Israel and the United States. Secondly, Bashar is cognizant of the international political structure and how he can use the strategic and geopolitical significance of Syria in order to gain financial, military, and intelligence support from the Islamic Republic of Iran, Hezbollah, and Russia.
