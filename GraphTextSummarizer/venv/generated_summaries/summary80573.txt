-- Emergency officials sifted through damage and debris scattered across roadways Saturday after a line of fast-moving storms and high winds swept through northwestern Wisconsin the night before, leaving at least one person dead and 39 others injured. The towns of Grantsburg, Washburn, Danbury and Web Lake were among the hardest-hit areas, said Wisconsin's emergency management spokeswoman Rhonda Reynolds. Three people were critically injured and a second person died, though not as a result of the storm, Burnett County spokeswoman Dawn Sargent said. "We ask nonresidents to avoid the area because of the road closures and the presence of emergency crews trying to clear debris from the roadways," Sargent added. A hardware store owner in neighboring Washburn described gusty winds, heavy rains and lightning that preceded power outages.
