A highlight of the trial came when al-Masri took the stand in his own defense and accused federal prosecutors of using "pay-as-you-go witnesses" and a "cut-and-paste" approach to his inflammatory comments, including statements about his admiration for late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Radical Islamic cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was convicted of supporting al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists, was sentenced to life in prison Friday by a federal judge in New York. A federal jury in Manhattan convicted al-Masri in May of aiding kidnappers during a 1998 hostage-taking in Yemen, sending a young recruit to jihadists in Afghanistan, violating U.S. sanctions against the Taliban, and attempting to establish an al Qaeda-style training camp on the West Coast of the United States. "Abu Hamza's blood-soaked journey from cleric to convict, from Imam to inmate, is now complete," Preet Bharara, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement after sentencing. In imposing the life term, U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest told al-Masri: "I don't believe the world would be safe with you in 10 years, 15 years or longer.
