"I've thought about my dad quite a bit this week," Rose explained to Living Golf anchor Shane O'Donoghue. " Rose held his nerve at the end of a day that fluctuated wildly, as crowd favorite Phil Mickelson desperately tried to nail down victory in a tournament he had finished runner up in five times. It meant success at the 37th time of asking for Rose, who became the first Englishman to win a major since Nick Faldo's Masters success in 1996. When Phil Mickelson failed to birdie the same hole moments later, Rose had sealed his first major triumph. With thoughts of his late father Ken swirling round his mind, Rose struck a near-perfect approach shot and duly completed par.
