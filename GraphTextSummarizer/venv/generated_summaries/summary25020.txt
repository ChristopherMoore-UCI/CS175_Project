The University at Buffalo, New York, and the Harry Ransom Center in Austin, Texas -- both already home to large Dylan Thomas collections -- may also take an interest, Goodby added. Goodby, professor of English language and literature at the University of Swansea (Thomas's hometown) said major libraries and university collections around the world would love to own the book. Hailed as a "terrific discovery" by one leading Thomas expert, the workbook is set to sell at auction for upwards of Â£100,000 ($156,430), capping off the writer's centenary year and tantalizing poetry scholars around the world. Thomas and Macnamara did not get on, and he wrote to a friend of his dislike for both her and the place -- Blashford in Hampshire -- in southern England. Thomas, one of the leading poets of the 20th Century, is thought to have discarded the notebook during a stay at the home of his mother-in-law, Yvonne Macnamara, at some point in the late 1930s.
