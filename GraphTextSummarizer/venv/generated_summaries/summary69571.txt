No evidence has surfaced of an explosion aboard a UPS cargo plane that crashed in Dubai last September, officials in the United Arab Emirates said Saturday. "Dubai police investigations revealed that an explosive parcel would have blown up the plane into pieces." WAM, the United Arab Emirates News Agency, quotes the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority on Saturday as saying that probe did not uncover evidence of a blast on board. The statement by AQAP said that since Western media did not link the September UPS plane crash to the group, "we decided not to announce it so we could carry on a similar operation. A U.S. counterterrorism official said Friday that while "there are very strong indications that AQAP was responsible for plotting last week's disrupted cargo plane plot ... we can't confirm at this point their claims about the early September incident." " White House counterterrorism chief John Brennan said Sunday that the United States is "looking very carefully" at the September crash to see if it could be related to the recent terror threat involving cargo aircraft.
