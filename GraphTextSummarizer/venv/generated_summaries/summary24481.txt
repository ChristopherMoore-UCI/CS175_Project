Tennessee: Meningitis outbreak investigated The Tennessee victims range in age from 49 to 89, state Health Commissioner Dr. John Dreyzehner said Wednesday. "The prime suspect for this outbreak is methylprednisolone acetate," Dreyzehner said Wednesday. The Nashville facility contacted 737 patients who had lumbar epidural steroid injections between July 30 and September 20, health officials said previously. Five additional cases were reported in Tennessee, health officials said Tuesday. Biopsies from two patients are consistent with the aspergillus fungus found in another patient, according to Dreyzehner, but he was careful to note that the findings need to be confirmed by the CDC.
