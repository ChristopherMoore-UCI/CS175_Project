It's the first of the Marquis brand of JW Marriotts -- "reserved only for the most iconic properties within the Marriott International portfolio," according to the company -- to be built outside North America. The JW Marriott Marquis Dubai hopes to tap into the MICE market (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions), a segment that in the United States is worth about $106 billion, according to JW Marriott. "The hotel will fill a long identified gap in the market where groups, meetings and conventions of up to 1,000 people can meet, sleep and dine under one roof," said Rupprecht Queitsch, general manager of the new property. The JW Marriott Marquis Dubai officially opened Wednesday as the world's tallest hotel. At Dubai's newest hotel, an elevator ride is a journey in itself.
