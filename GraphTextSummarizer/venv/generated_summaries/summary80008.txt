Editor's note: Reed Dickens was White House assistant press secretary for President George W. Bush from 2001-2003 and worked with Scott McClellan almost three years. Obviously, had Scott actually been disillusioned while he was in the West Wing -- that would have been the time to share it with those standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him. Former White House press secretary Scott McClellan wrote a tell-all book blasting the Bush administration. It is an outright attempt to undermine the president that made Scott's career and hurt those who served alongside him for years. I thought surely there will be some conversation that he claims to have overheard between adviser Karl Rove and President Bush, crafting some story to cover up the truth about Iraq or making the Iraq War sound political in nature.
