Competent authorities have taken measures to educate Chinese fishermen and management of outbound fishing boats to prohibit cross-border fishing and irregularities. The South Korean coast guard has stopped hundreds of Chinese boats this year on suspicion of illegal fishing in the sea. First Vice Foreign Minister Park Suk-hwan "strongly demanded the Chinese government strictly clamp down on illegal fishing and the illegal acts of Chinese fishermen," the news agency quoted him as saying. "At the same time," Liu added, "we hope the (South Korean) side will fully protect the rights and interests of Chinese fishermen and provide them with due humanitarian treatment." The incident started after South Korean commandos boarded the Chinese ship.
