It helps if white people know how to be better white people. But it's not something that's accomplished by white people knowing lots of black people. Many black writers responded to the Reuters poll with essays on why they didn't want white friends, and didn't need them. Even when programs like school busing and affirmative action give black people access to white spaces, when those people go to climb the social ladder there's nothing there for them to grab onto, because there's very little reciprocal effort coming from the other direction. Black people have been systematically excluded from white neighborhoods.
