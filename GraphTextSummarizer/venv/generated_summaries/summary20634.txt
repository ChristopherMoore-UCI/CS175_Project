The new Cabinet retains the Ministry of Indigenisation, the policy of seizing the majority stake of foreign owned firms and giving them to black Zimbabweans. "I am glad we now have a government of Zimbabwe following the harmonized elections," Misheck Sibanda, chief secretary to the president and Cabinet, told journalists at the State House. He was the minister who drafted tough media laws in 2002 that have resulted in the deportation of foreign journalists and the closing of some media organizations. In the list released, Jonathan Moyo bounces back as media, information and broadcasting services minister. Prior to that, Mugabe's Zanu PF party and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's MDC party shared power.
