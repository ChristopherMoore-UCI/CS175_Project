Police arrested the man on charges of trespassing, impersonating a public servant and lying to police, Inspector Joseph Sullivan said. Jeannard, who is from La Rochelle, on the west coast of France, is a retired winemaker who was on a layover from France and was changing planes to his final destination in West Palm Beach, Florida, said Philadelphia Inspector Joseph Sullivan. Unlike Leonardo DiCaprio in the film based on the true story of a successful con artist posing as a pilot, Jeannard was caught right away at Philadelphia International Airport and is now being held on $1 million bail, Philadelphia police said Friday. Corporate security contacted Philadelphia police, who found and arrested the man at his new terminal, Sullivan said. He also was carrying a bad fake of an Air France crew badge and a fake crew identification card, according to police and Air France spokesman Cedric Leurquin.
