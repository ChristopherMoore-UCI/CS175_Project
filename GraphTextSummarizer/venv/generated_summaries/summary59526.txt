-- Microsoft and Google are getting help from other tech companies in their fight to release more information about government surveillance orders, which companies say is their First Amendment right to provide. They cite disclosures by Edward Snowden, a fugitive former National Security Agency contractor who says he leaked thousands of documents on government surveillance, which has led to erroneous news stories, the companies say. James Clapper, director of national intelligence, has said the agency plans to publish broad data on criminal and national security surveillance requests. The companies argue that they are acting to correct the public record on national security requests they are compelled to obey. Microsoft and Google first made their request to publish surveillance data in June and then spent the last few months negotiating with the government.
