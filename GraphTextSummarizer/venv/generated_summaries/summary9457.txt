Michael Nachmanoff, Chesser's federal public defender, said the case was different from other recent terrorism cases. In April, Chesser, who also goes by the name Abu Talhah al Amrikee, authored a post on a radical Islamic website that included a warning to the creators of "South Park" after an episode of the cartoon series depicted the Prophet Mohammed in a bear suit. The three charges carry a total maximum prison sentence of 30 years, and U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady told Wednesday's court hearing that Chesser's defense agreed to a sentence of at least 20 years for acts "intended to promote a federal crime of terrorism. "Mr. Chesser has renounced violent jihad," Nachmanoff said. Chesser, a convert to Islam, is accused of posting an online attack against the creators of the animated TV series "South Park," as well as information on explosives meant to be used to kill civilians.
