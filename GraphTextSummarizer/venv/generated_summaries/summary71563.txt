Actress Goldie Hawn says world leaders are discovering how "mindfulness" helps with stress -- but that she despairs at seeing young stars like Justin Bieber struggling to deal with fame. " When asked about Justin Bieber, the Canadian pop star facing allegations of driving under the influence and drag racing, Hawn said his situation was "heartbreaking." "It's extraordinary that this Davos this year seems to be centered a lot around the brain, a lot around stress reduction, mindfulness, all of these areas," she said.

Hawn said when she started her foundation 12 years ago, mindfulness had been a "what is that" concept, but she was optimistic that was changing.
