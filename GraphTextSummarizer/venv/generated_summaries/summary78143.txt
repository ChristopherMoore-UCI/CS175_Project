Spectators can arrange flights privately with pilots. Mass balloon launches at dawn and dusk bookend nine days filled with live music performances that range from Canadian folk group Cowboys Fringants to rapper T Pain, and family activities, including Balloon Planet, an inflatable amusement park. The free event keeps the fun going in the afternoons with live music, aircraft displays, kite flying and meet-and-greets with pilots. The company also offers seasonal flights in other areas of the park during the annual wildebeest migration. Glen Falls, New York Adirondack Balloon Festival (September 20-23):
