-- CNN's David McKenzie in Nairobi, Kenya, and Caroline Faraj in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed to this report. Russian and British warships have fended off pirate attacks on commercial shipping in the past week, authorities in those countries have reported. The hijacking of the Sirius Star, which launched earlier this year, is part of a recent upsurge of attacks off east Africa, according to the International Maritime Bureau. But the U.S.-led naval mission that patrols the Horn of Africa said successful attacks have decreased in recent weeks. "It is a huge step, but what we have seen is that the piracy activity in the area has increased," the company's president, Terje Storeng, told CNN.
