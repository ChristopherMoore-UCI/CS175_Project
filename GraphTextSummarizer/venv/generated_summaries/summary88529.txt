Snow days are for those simple pleasures you'd feel too guilty dedicating an hour to any other day. That's 82 work days a year dealing with email! To be sure, massive snow storms are not all fun and games. And for those of us with kids in school, even when we can take a personal day we usually use the time to get errands done and race the kids from one activity to another. Who knows how many more snow days we have left to enjoy.
