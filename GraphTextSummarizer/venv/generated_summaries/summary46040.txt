North Korea agrees to family reunions with the South North Korea expelled South Korean workers and suspended activity at the zone, which sits on the North's side of the Koreas' demilitarized zone. The agreement also called for a joint panel to discuss compensating South Korean companies hurt by the closing. The zone, which made its debut nine years ago, is considered an important source of hard currency for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime. About 53,000 North Koreans worked at more than 120 South Korean companies at the complex. The Kaesong Industrial Complex is seen as a key symbol of inter-Korean cooperation.
