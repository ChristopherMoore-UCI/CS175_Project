Nine facts about armed drones Attack on Afghanistan-Pakistan border police kills 3 A few hundred miles to the southwest, two suicide bombers and three other insurgents attacked a border police post in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province on Wednesday evening, killing three police officers and injuring five other people, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi said. Afghanistan's Nangarhar province borders Pakistan's loosely governed tribal region. The attack targeted militants in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Haroon Zarghoon, a spokesman of a armed resistance movement, Hizb-e-Islami Afghanistan, said his group was not affected. But, citing his group's fighters in the region, he said one attack was in the Afghan province's Nazyan district, 1 to 2 miles (2 to 3 kilometers) from the border with Pakistan.
