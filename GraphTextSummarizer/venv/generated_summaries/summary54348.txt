Playing the blame game Blasting Obama's handling of the crisis, an exasperated Brooks said the administration is giving families coming from Central America "free goodies, free food, free clothing, free health care, free transportation, free entertainment." -- House Republicans unveiled a $1.5 billion border funding package Wednesday to address the situation on the southern border, almost $1 billion dollars smaller than the version introduced by Senate Democrats on Tuesday, and less than half of what President Barack Obama requested. Immigration fast facts "The administration ought to get their act together," Boehner told reporters after the closed- door meeting with House Republicans. Since Congress controls the purse strings, House Republicans realize that if they don't pass a bill they'll get blamed for the situation getting worse. For Boehner getting the 218 votes needed to pass a border bill mostly with House Republican votes is proving to be a big lift.
