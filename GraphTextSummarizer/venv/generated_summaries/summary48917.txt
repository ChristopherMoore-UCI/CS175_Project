This president's problem is that he wants the government to helpâ€”only he hasn't been able to convince the public that government has changed. Small wonder we don't believe government can do it, because it cannot. It is true that distrust of government is nothing new. Ronald Reagan understood the public's skepticism about government. And it prompted the president to famously declare "the era of big government is over."
