In Borno, police spokesman Isa Azare said that two policemen were killed in an attack on police headquarters late Monday. Police and troops were dispatched to the militants' hideouts after they began attacks on government establishments Sunday, said police spokesman Moses Anegbode. The violence has pitted Islamic militants against government police and troops in the north-central part of the nation, officials said. There is a history of religious violence in central Nigeria, where majority-Muslim north Africa meets largely Christian sub-Saharan Africa. More than 150 alleged militants were arrested by Nigerian police after clashes.
