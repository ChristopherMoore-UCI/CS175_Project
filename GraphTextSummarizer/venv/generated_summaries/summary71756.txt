A terrible mistake from Zambia keeper Kennedy Mweene allowed Geremi to equalise and Samuel Eto'o gave Cameroon the lead in the 72nd minute. But Kameni handed Zambia a way back into the match with his own rash bit of goalkeeping, scything down Mulenga on the left edge of his penalty area to concede an 82nd-minute spot-kick, which was coolly dispatched by Christopher Katongo. Christopher Katongo thought he had earned a point with an 82nd-minute penalty but Idrissou had the last word for Cameroon just four minutes later. -- Mohammad Idrissou put Cameroon on course for a spot in the African Nations Cup quarterfinals with a late winner in a topsy-turvy 3-2 Group D victory over Zambia. And that was made to look very costly in the 68th minute when a calamitous mistake from Mweene saw Cameroon draw level.
