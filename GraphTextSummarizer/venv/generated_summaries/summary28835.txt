Will she ever leave her fictional cheating husband? To which author Laura Munson says, "Stop." Munson, author of the memoir "This Is Not the Story You Think It Is," had recently committed to the end of suffering. One of Munson's friends was so unhappy in her life that she decided she had to get out of her marriage. "The advice for anyone going through a trauma is to allow the sorrow and vision for what you thought life should be to dissolve and see what's left," says Piver. When her own husband, suffering through a midlife crisis, threatened to break up their marriage to end his pain, Munson chose not to play the victim.
