Facebook has weighed in on a practice by some businesses asking employees or job applicants for their passwords to the popular social-media site. Egan said that Facebook has seen a "distressing increase" in reports of job candidates being asked for their passwords over the past few months. " We'll take action to protect the privacy and security of our users, whether by engaging policymakers or, where appropriate, by initiating legal action, including by shutting down applications that abuse their privileges." The group said they've gotten multiple reports of people either being asked for their passwords or required to "friend" managers when they were applying for jobs. "I did not want to do it, but because I really needed my job and he implied that this was a condition of recertification, I reluctantly gave him the password," he told Maryland lawmakers, who are considering outlawing the practice.
