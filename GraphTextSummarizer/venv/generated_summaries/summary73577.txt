The case, Zarifi said, highlights how women continue to suffer in parts of Afghanistan despite overall progress since the fall of the Taliban. Authorities in the northern Baghlan province said they were aware of reports that the girl was tortured after she refused to be forced into prostitution. And she said with broken voice that her husband used to cut her flesh using pliers," Basharat said. Last year, 2,700 cases were recorded.
