The first blast, relatively small, went off in the restroom of a restaurant in the crowded Khyber Super Market, according to Shafqat Malik, chief of bomb disposal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. More than two dozen militants wielding automatic weapons attacked NATO oil tankers on February 25, at a terminal on the outskirts of Peshawar. Peshawar and the surrounding region have been swamped by a wave of violence in recent months. Muhammad Ejaz Khan, a senior police official in Peshawar, said about 10 kilograms of explosives were used in the second blast. A suicide bomber detonated explosives during a funeral procession on the outskirts of Peshawar.
