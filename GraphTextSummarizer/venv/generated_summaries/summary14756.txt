Following a goalless first half, the match burst into life during the second period when Germany took the lead through a 61st minute Bastian Schweinsteiger  penalty, dubiously awarded after Brazilian defender Lucio clipped midfielder Toni Kroos in the box. Fulham defender Aaron Hughes scored his first international goal before Steve Davis added a second and Paddy McCourt netted twice, lifting Northern Ireland to third in Group C a point behind Slovenia with a game in hand. Germany soon added a second through 19-year-old prodigy Mario Goetze. -- Germany recorded their first win over Brazil in 18 years in stunning fashion by defeating the five-time world champions 3-2 in Stuttgart. Robinho pulled one back from the penalty spot before Schweinsteiger set up Schuerrle for Germany's third.
