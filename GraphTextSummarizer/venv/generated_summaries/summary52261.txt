London's Metropolitan Police confirmed this week that Terry was questioned under caution last Friday over claims that he abused Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers during a match in October. -- Britain's Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to charge England international footballer John Terry with racist abuse after receiving a full police file on the Chelsea captain. Terry's case is one of two that have rocked English football in recent months, and came shortly before FIFA president Sepp Blatter told CNN that there is no problem with on-pitch racism. Liverpool's Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez has been charged by the FA over allegedly racist remarks he made to Manchester United's Senegal-born France international Patrice Evra during a Premier League match on October 15. "We now have a full file on John Terry and that is now under consideration," a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed to CNN on Thursday.
