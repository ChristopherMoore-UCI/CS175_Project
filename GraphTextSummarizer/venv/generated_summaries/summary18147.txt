The wide variety of native birds that thrive in urban areas underscores the importance of these artificial habitats to the survival of many bird populations. -- Bird populations native to several areas of the globe are in decline, with some teetering on the brink of extinction, according to a multi-agency report, the first of its kind, released Thursday. " Wetland bird populations remain below historic levels, but "management and conservation measures have contributed to increases of many wetland birds, including hunted waterfowl. "Hawaiian birds and ocean birds appear most at risk, with populations in danger of collapse if immediate conservation measures are not implemented." Of the more than 800 species of birds in the United States, 67 are federally listed as endangered or threatened, the report said. " Research shows that wetland bird species began to increase in the late 1970s, "coinciding with major policy shifts from draining to protecting wetlands," the report said.
