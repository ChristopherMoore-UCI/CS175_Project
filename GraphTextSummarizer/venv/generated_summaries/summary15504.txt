-- Elisabeth Moss is having quite the year: She won a Golden Globe for her performance in the mini-series Top of the Lake, she's co-starring in the final season of Mad Men beginning this spring, and now, she's on the cover of this week's New York magazine. The cast of Mad Men play iPhone games in their off-time Moss and her costars get along a lot better than their characters do on the show, apparently — so much so that Moss and co. tend to stick around after filming to hang out in what they call the set's "base camp," an area by the hair and makeup trailers that acts as a sort of living room for the cast. "She's joking around casually and then you yell 'Action' and her heartbeat goes to 150 beats per minute," says co-star Mark Duplass. Moss comes off as a Cool Girl in the New York profile, talking about how normal she is — she watches a lot of TV! Helen Mirren's a fan Moss introduced herself to Dame Mirren when they sat at the same table at this year's Golden Globes, to which Mirren replied: "I know who the f— you are."
