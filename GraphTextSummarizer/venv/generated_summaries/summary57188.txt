-- NASA officials said Saturday they are confident that space shuttle Discovery's Wednesday launch will go as scheduled, sending a crew of six astronauts to the International Space Station on an 11-day mission. NASA Test Director Jeff Spaulding said mechanical repairs on the shuttle's system used to pressurize Discovery's right hand Orbital Maneuvering System Pod have been successful. Discovery's 11-day flight is expected to be a "very busy mission," NASA Flight Director Bryan Lunney said. "After we fly around the Earth about 170 times, Discovery will come home for its last flight," Lunney said during a news conference last month. The weather forecast for Wednesday's launch calls for a 70 percent chance of acceptable conditions, NASA weather officials said.
