He also says that the use of a second Gaga song -- after "Bad Romance" in the previous season -- is all due to co-creator Ryan Murphy. According to the series' music supervisor, P.J. Bloom, the episode's plot paved the way for the Jay-Z track: Having placed at the Regional competition in last season's finale, New Directions will travel to New York for the Nationals. "Ryan's a huge Lady Gaga fan," Bloom says. "So we needed a New York song," explains Bloom. Bloom is also promising an "additional recording" for the episode, but is mum on details.
