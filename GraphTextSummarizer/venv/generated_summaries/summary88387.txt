New Jersey and New York had just started requiring anyone who had contact with Ebola patients in West Africa to be quarantined for 21 days. A nurse who was quarantined against her will in New Jersey after treating Ebola patients in West Africa will not obey officials' instructions to seclude herself at home in Maine, she and her lawyers said on the "Today" show and to the Bangor Daily News. On Tuesday, the state's health commissioner -- without naming Hickox -- warned that the state would force the quarantine if she didn't isolate herself willingly. "If an individual who came in direct contact with Ebola patients has returned to Maine and is not willing to avoid public contact and stay in their home voluntarily during the period they are at some risk, we will take additional measures and pursue appropriate authority to ensure they make no public contact," Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Mary Mayhew told reporters Tuesday. "Stating it plainly, what we are asking for is that individuals who had direct contact with Ebola patients stay in their home and avoid public contact until the 21 days for potential incubation has passed. New Jersey officials additionally said that screeners determined that she had a fever at the airport.
