The major toll of secondhand smoke Huxley and the study authors note that compared with those who don't smoke, women who smoke are at greater risk of heart disease than male smokers. Those who quit smoking before they reached 40 avoided more than 90% of the increased risk of premature death from cigarettes, while women who stopped even earlier -- before age 30 -- avoided 97% of the added risk. Largest ever survey on global tobacco use issues dire warnings "Only in the 21st century could we observe directly the full effects of prolonged smoking, and of prolonged cessation, on premature mortality among women," said Peto in a statement. Lead study author Richard Peto, a professor at the University of Oxford in the U.K., and his colleagues conducted one of the largest studies looking at the hazards of smoking and the benefits of quitting among women born around the 1940s. Rachel Huxley, a professor at the University of Minnesota who wrote an accompanying editorial to the study, says that the latest data on women are a welcome addition to existing knowledge, which have underestimated the full impact of smoking on women.
