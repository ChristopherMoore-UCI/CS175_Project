Japan's exports to the country plunged 10.8% in December year-on-year. Japan, a nation whose export-driven wealth has traditionally been built on trade surpluses, had a second straight year of trade deficits thanks to a persistently high yen, trouble with trading partner China and weakening demand in the eurozone. Exports fell 5.8% in December 2012 compared to a year earlier due in large part to a strong yen which makes Japanese exports more expensive overseas. "Beating deflation and curbing the yen's appreciation is crucially important," Abe said on January 10 and that a "daring monetary policy is essential." Earlier this week, the Bank of Japan signed on to Abe's plan to raise inflation to 2%, with the hope of pulling the world's third largest economy out of a two-decade slump of deflation. Abe, who served as Japan's premier from 2006 to 2007, was sworn back into the office on December 26.
