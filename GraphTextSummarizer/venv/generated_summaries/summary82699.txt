-- Italy international midfielder Alberto Aquilani has left English Premier League side Liverpool to join AC Milan on loan for the rest of the season. Aquilani, 27, joined Liverpool from Roma in 2009, but the playmaker has struggled with form and fitness during his two years on Merseyside, spending last term on loan at Juventus. "Alberto Aquilani has completed his loan transfer from Liverpool to AC Milan," read a statement on five-time European champions Liverpool's web site. Meanwhile, in Italy, Macedonian international striker Goran Pandev has left Inter Milan to join Champions League rivals Napoli on loan. Barton, 28, fell out with the Newcastle hierarchy after criticizing the way the club was run on the social-networking site Twitter.
