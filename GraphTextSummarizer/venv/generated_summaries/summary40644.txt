Based at Nottingham University, Professor Garvey -- whose interest in wind turbines stretches back to his school days -- began his research into compressed air storage two years ago. Wind power is a success story of renewable energy. The argument against wind power being intermittent and therefore unreliable may dissolve as Professor Garvey continues his research. But in reality, wind power currently contributes about one percent of the UK's energy needs, with around 2000 on and offshore turbines up and running. At a depth of around 600 meters, Professor Garvey calculates that the bags would be able to store 25 megajoules of energy for every meter cubed.
