LAX victim shot 12 times If convicted, he could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole, U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. has said. On November 1, authorities claim, Ciancia walked up to Transportation Security Administration checkpoint and opened fire, shooting TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez "at point-blank range," according to a court document. At the end, the judge ordered him "detained" after determining he posed a flight risk and danger to the community, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for California's central district, in a statement. Authorities have said that Ciancia faces charges for two felony offenses -- murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport. His next court hearing -- unless he is indicted before then -- is scheduled for December 18, with an arraignment set for December 26, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
