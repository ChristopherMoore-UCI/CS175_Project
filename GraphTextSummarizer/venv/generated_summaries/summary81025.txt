"Sanctions can be imposed on Libya by the UN Security Council for Libya's non-compliance, and Libya's membership in various international organizations could be suspended and/or made conditional on Libya surrendering Saif Gadhafi to the ICC, if states wish to insist on it," John Jones, Gadhafi's ICC-appointed defense lawyer, told CNN on Saturday. "Libya is paralyzed and unable to protect the rights and security of Libyans, including judges, lawyers and judicial police and detainees, much less the rights of a person like Mr. Gadhafi," Jones said. The trial of the son of former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and dozens of other former regime officials resumed in Tripoli on Sunday, in continued defiance of the International Criminal Court that last week rejected Libya's plea to try Saif al-Islam Gadhafi domestically. "The ICC appeals decision only reinforces Libya's long overdue obligation to surrender Saif Gadhafi to The Hague," said Richard Dicker, international justice director. "Libyan authorities should show the same respect for ICC procedures as they did when they first engaged the court on Gadhafi's case."
