Because Jonathan took office after Yar'Adua's death in May, the northern leaders say the presidency should rotate back to the north. Atiku Abubakar emerged Monday as the consensus candidate put forward by a bloc of leaders from Nigeria's influential Northern Political Leaders Forum, which announced in September that it would name someone to take on Jonathan in the presidential primaries for the People's Democratic Party. -- Party primaries for Nigeria's presidential election will begin November 26, the Independent National Electoral Commission announced Tuesday. President Goodluck Jonathan, who became president after the death of Umaru Yar'Adua earlier this year, is running for election to the office. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket with Yar'Adua, who was from the north.
