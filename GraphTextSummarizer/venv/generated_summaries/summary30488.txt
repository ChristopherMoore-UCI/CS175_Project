Dubbed Chimurenga, which means "revolutionary struggle" in Zimbabwe's Shona language, Edjabe's creation is an award-winning, pan African literary magazine that addresses and embraces the continent's diversity, with a focus on "the complexity of life. More recently, Edjabe, who is also a DJ, created the Pan African Space Station, a music platform that brings together diverse African genres both online and in venues across the continent.

As an African who's lived away from home for decades now, this is a topic close to Edjabe's heart.
