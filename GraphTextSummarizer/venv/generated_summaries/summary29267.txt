It was recently announced that "Greek" actor Scott Michael Foster had been cast to play the role of Kristoff, the rugged mountain man who befriends Queen Elsa's younger sister, Anna, who'll be played by newcomer Elizabeth Lail. Disney is the parent company of ABC, and with the mega-success of its animated film "Frozen," there was little doubt that some of those characters would eventually be incorporated into the ABC series. Haig, 28, has been cast as Queen Elsa on ABC's "Once Upon a Time" series. But fans were still eagerly waiting to learn who would play the role of Queen Elsa of Arendelle, a part that's voiced by Idina Menzel in the animated film. Is Haig a good choice to play Queen Elsa?
