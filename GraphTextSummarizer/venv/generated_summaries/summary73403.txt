-- A U.S.-born Muslim cleric and his son are exploring the possibility of legal action after they said they were prevented from traveling aboard an American Airlines flight from New York to Charlotte, North Carolina, their attorney says. Ramadan points to last week's killing of al Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden as a reason for what he calls "an uptick" in racial profiling against Muslims. Idlibi said the elder Abdul Latif and his son have reached out to American Airlines for "accountability of the embarrassment and humiliation" that they said they endured. Shortly thereafter, federal agents then boarded the American Airlines plane and removed the younger Abdul Latif as well. The younger Abdul Latif was permitted on the following day to fly to Charlotte.
