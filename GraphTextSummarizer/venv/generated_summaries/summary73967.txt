-- After 2,000 years of Christian prayer, many faithful still don't know how to pray effectively, pastor Daniel Henderson says. Henderson teaches that prayer should be about worshipping God, having a one-to-one relationship through prayer. "It changed my perspective on prayer from being ask, ask, ask to building a relationship with God," Johnson said. The prayer workshop was life-changing, said pastor Jeremy Johnson of Arcade Church in Sacramento, California. "Most Christians pray out of crisis or pray a grocery list," he said, making "God a lifeline of last resort."
