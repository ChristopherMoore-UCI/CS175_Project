"Was there or was there not an order to fire?" A federal investigation found the audio quality to be poor and "shouting to be unintelligible," according to a letter from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. The students had been protesting the Vietnam War and the U.S. invasion of Cambodia when Ohio National Guard members opened fire. The agency's decision came last week in response to a letter from former student Alan Canfora, 63, who was shot in the wrist during the incident and submitted the evidence to authorities in 2010. -- The Justice Department has declined to reopen an investigation into the 1970 shootings at Kent State University that left four student protesters dead, after the agency found that enhanced audio recordings of the incident were inconclusive as to whether an order to fire was given. Canfora argued that he never wanted the case retried but is seeking a "grand pronouncement of truth for the sake of the historical record.
