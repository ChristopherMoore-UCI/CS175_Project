Appropriate for the 140-character format, Twitter trending topics disappear almost as fast as they come, suggesting users are hungry for more news. This is especially true in the wake of the Egyptian unrest, when Twitter hashtags (#Mubarak, etc.) for the protests were constantly trending on Twitter, but filtering users to mainstream media outlets for the most breaking news. On Twitter, mainstream media outlets such as CNN, the New York Times, and the BBC dominate trending topics. Of these 22 influentials, 72% were Twitter accounts run by traditional news organizations, including Reuters and the Washington Post, but other digital-age media outlets such as the Huffington Post were also featured on the top trenders list. "Twitter users then seem to be acting more as filter and amplifier of traditional media in most cases," said Bernardo Huberman, HP Senior Fellow and director of HP Labs' Social Computing Research Group.
