-- Russia and China vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution Friday that would have imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe's longtime president, Robert Mugabe, and 11 senior members of his government. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe meets this week with Arthur Mutambara, an opposition leader. "China and Russia have stood with Mugabe against the people of Zimbabwe ... for reasons that we think are not borne out by the facts on the ground," he said. " Chinese Ambassador Wang Guangya said his nation believes the international community should allow the talks in South Africa on the Zimbabwe situation a chance to progress before imposing sanctions. The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai.
