In addition to rum, ale, whiskey, and wines, an 1879 collection of recipes from Virginia housewives features a recipe that calls for 12 eggs, eight wine-glassfuls of brandy, and four wine-glassfuls of wine. In 1800, author Isaac Weld, Jr. described the American recipe for eggnog as consisting of "new milk, eggs, rum, and sugar, beat up together. If you pick up a carton of commercial eggnog at the supermarket, you're probably getting much more nog than egg. Since many Americans had their own chickens and dairy cattle, tossing together a glass of eggnog was no problem, and the drink's popularity soared among the colonists even as it sagged back home. The Madeira and sherry that English aristocrats had used for their version of eggnog were scarce on this side of the pond, but we had plenty of rum and whiskey.
