Humans lead complex lives, and one of the traits we've developed that has allowed us to be such productive creatures is the ability to make many learned traits and responses an automatic part of our lives, buried so deeply in the inner workings of our subconscious that they no longer require conscious thought. What makes it easier is focusing on "keystone habits"; when you change one of them, it makes changing other habits easier. When we do that, no matter what life throws our way, we can use the thread to help us navigate the labyrinth of daily life and come back to our center. In the weeks after, as I waited to get test results from various doctors on my health, I kept asking myself what kind of life was I living? I have worked to integrate certain practices into my day -- meditation, walking, exercise -- but the connection that conscious breathing gives me is something I can return to in an instant during many times of the day.
