-- Baseball legend Barry Bonds will get another day in court to convince judges he did not obstruct justice during a federal investigation into illegal steroids use by pro athletes. Jurors said at the time they found Bonds to be "evasive" in his testimony to the federal grand jury investigating illegal steroids use by pro athletes, but they said that it was not proven that he lied when he said he had not knowingly used steroids. In 2011 Bonds was on trial facing three counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice stemming from the illegal steroid investigation within major league baseball. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco issued an order Tuesday to have the case reheard by a larger panel of judges. Last year a three-judge panel of that court upheld the former San Francisco Giants star's conviction.
