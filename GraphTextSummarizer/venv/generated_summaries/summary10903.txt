Firefighters would remain at the hotel until "the fire is completely knocked out," said Clark County Fire Chief Steven M. Smith. Four U.S. Air Force HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopters with rescue crews were put on standby at Nellis Air Force Base during the afternoon to assist in any rescue efforts, but were not needed, a Nellis spokeswoman said. "It was horrible, there was fire everywhere," a hotel worker who watched the flames from a parking lot told CNN affiliate KVBC. A bit over an hour after it began, the fire was fully contained, according to the fire departments in Las Vegas and Clark County. No one was trapped, and there were no reports of major injuries, said Ed Cagalo of the Clark County Fire Department.
