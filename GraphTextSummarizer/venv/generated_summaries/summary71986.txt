The attack, presumably from NATO forces, came shortly after Deputy Foreign Minister Khaled Khaim announced that Libya's army will withdraw from the besieged coastal city of Misrata and allow tribal leaders to attempt to deal with the rebels. And who are the tribes that are supporting Gadhafi, anyway?" He predicted that if Gadhafi forces leave Misrata, "it will mean that this game is over." "This confirms that our rebels in Misrata have liberated Misrata and that Libya is still in one piece, not two, the way Gadhafi hoped. Earlier Friday, Bani said that Libyan rebels had wrested control of a key building in Misrata and made other advances in the city. We will leave it for the tribes and Misrata people to deal with the situation -- either to use force or negotiations."
