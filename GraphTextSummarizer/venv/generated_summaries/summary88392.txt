She was joined by her friend, Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, on a boulder above the river. " With dusk approaching and no crossings to be found, King and Bachmann loaded back into their SUV and drove east toward McAllen, where they met with border control agents at a Homeland Security outpost. They arrived in Texas a day after President Barack Obama announced a controversial plan to invite certain immigrants living in the United States illegally to "come out of the shadows" with an offer for temporary legal status to some who pass background checks and pay back taxes. The duo represent a coalition of House lawmakers who are staunchly opposed to any legislative action on immigration that would offer lawful status to immigrants living in the United States illegally. " King's claim about the woman isn't accurate: To receive legal status under Obama's new plan, immigrants must have lived in the United States for a minimum of five years.
