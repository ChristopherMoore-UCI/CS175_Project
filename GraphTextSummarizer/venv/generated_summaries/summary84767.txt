-- Drew Peterson, the former police sergeant who authorities call the prime suspect in the disappearance of his fourth wife, Stacy Peterson, has been indicted on murder charges related to his third wife, Kathleen Savio, the Illinois state attorney's office said. Watch family members react to the arrest Â» After Stacy Peterson went missing in October 2007, media frenzy and police scrutiny on Peterson revealed Savio had died mysteriously a few years earlier during a nasty divorce. Brodsky said in a written statement that prosecutors won't be able to prove their case because "he didn't do it." "There is no evidence that links Drew Peterson to the death of Kathleen Savio or anyone else for that matter," Brodsky said. Drew Peterson was arrested Thursday on murder charges relating to his third wife, Kathleen Savio. Savio died just before the division of the marital assets was finalized, making Drew Peterson the sole beneficiary.
