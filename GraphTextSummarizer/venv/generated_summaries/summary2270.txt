Syrian rebels seize military base outside Aleppo Several world leaders have expressed deep concern about a "devastating" government counterattack in Aleppo. In just a few months, Syria's rebels have transformed themselves from ragtag village defense forces into an armed movement capable of attacking the country's two largest cities, Aleppo and Damascus. War crimes in Aleppo, Arab League chief says "We will fight this dictator and all of his aircraft, tanks and rockets," said Ahmed Afash, a rebel squad leader based in Anadan, a rebel-controlled town just six miles north of Aleppo. Both the rebels and the regime are building up their manpower in and around Aleppo, Syria's largest city, where the rebels have made inroads this past week. "I go to war for my family, for my country," said Soukrot Amin, a 23-year-old Aleppo native who recently volunteered to be in the Free Syrian Army.
