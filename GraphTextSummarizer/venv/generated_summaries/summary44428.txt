But months before "Delivery Man" comes out, American moviegoers are getting a chance to see the French-language original. But given how middle-of-the-road many American comedies can be, it seems unlikely "Delivery Man" will begin, as "Starbuck" does, with a masturbation scene. In a conversation with CNN in Los Angeles, Scott and his star described "Starbuck" as the rare comedy that translates across cultures. Scott wouldn't reveal what changes he made for Hollywood other than the title (the studio perhaps thinking "Starbuck" would suggest a film about coffee). "We felt that it was a great premise to explore what fatherhood is all about today," says director and co-writer Ken Scott.
