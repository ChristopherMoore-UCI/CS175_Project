World number one Djokovic is hoping to end Nadal's seven-year winning run in Monte Carlo having sat out the tournament last year. Murray reached the semifinals of the Masters 1000 tournament last year and the French Open, beaten on both occasions by the 'king of clay' Rafael Nadal. In first round action, Switzerland's Stanislas Wawrinka shocked 10th seed Feliciano Lopez of Spain 6-1 6-4, while Andreas Seppi of Italy beat Romania's Victor Hanescu 6-3 6-1 to set up a meeting with Novak Djokovic. The Frenchman was earning a tough third round clash against 13th-seeded Spaniard Fernando Verdasco, who recovered from a set down to beat Ivan Dodig of Croatia 3-6 6-3 6-1. Both will be in action Wednesday with Nadal opening against Finn Jarkko Nieminen.
