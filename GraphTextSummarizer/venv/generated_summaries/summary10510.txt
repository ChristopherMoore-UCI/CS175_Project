Could former U.S. State Department contractor Alan Gross be part of a new prisoner swap? But Cuban authorities say Gross was part of a plot to create "a Cuban spring" and destabilize the island's single-party communist government. "Cuban government interlocutors frequently attempt to compare Mr. Gross' imprisonment to that of five convicted Cuban intelligence agents, three of whom continue to serve sentences in the United States." U.S. officials said Gross was merely trying to help Cubans bypass the island's stringent restrictions on Internet access. Gonzalez is one of the "Cuban Five," a group of Cuban agents who were arrested in South Florida in 1998 and convicted of espionage in 2001. "We are not talking about an exchange, we are talking about unilateral decisions which, obviously, would have to be interrelated," said Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Caba√±as.
