They say the U.S. must maintain a healthy nuclear deterrent, even as it works toward President Obama's goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. We ended our day at Livermore's National Ignition Facility, where the world's largest laser generates the temperatures and pressures found only in stars, the sun and in nuclear weapons. And, given that the United States stopped testing nuclear weapons by blowing them up -- both above and below ground -- 18 years ago, how will we know? "We found failure modes in the stockpile that we could never have found with nuclear testing because we're able to do these massive simulations," he said. At HEAF, scientists conduct up to 1,000 explosions a year and heat up explosives to react to thermal changes.
