Having broken her state record for cookie sales two years running, Katie Francis did herself -- and everyone else, ever -- one better this year by selling more than 18,000 boxes of Girl Scout cookies. She and her mom have wagons and a hatchback car packed with shortbread cookies and Savannah Smiles, looking for customers. For three weeks, every day after school and on weekends, she pitched her products door to door. Katie hopes to smash the 20,000-cookie mark before the official end date for cookie sales on Sunday, March 30. That said, especially in recent decades -- and perhaps especially for those not directly involved in scouting beyond buying a box -- the Girl Scouts have also become synonymous with Do-si-dos, Tagalongs, Trefoils and other popular cookies.
