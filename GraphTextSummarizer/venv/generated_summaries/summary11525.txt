"Surprise" special guests are in store, so our fingers are crossed for double Chris action: "Thor's" Chris Hemsworth and "Captain America's" Chris Evans. There'll be an opportunity to ask questions, of course, and fans will get to see a sneak peek at the final episodes of season 5 ahead of the August 11 premiere. Author Veronica Roth, whose best-selling young adult novel has spawned a series and a massive following, will be here to take fan questions, along with the movie's stars, Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Miles Teller, Mekhi Phifer, and Maggie Q, among others. Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, David Zayas and James Remar will join the series' executive producers to take fan questions about the eighth and final season, which began in June. Writer-producers like David Amann, Vince Gilligan and Howard Gordon, plus creator Chris Carter, will be here as well.
