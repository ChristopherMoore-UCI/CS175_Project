Camp was arrested Friday after federal agents said he bought drugs from an undercover agent. -- A federal judge in Georgia has been arrested on drug and weapons charges after federal agents say he bought drugs for a stripper with whom he was having an affair. "This is really a case between Judge Camp and his wife," Morrison told reporters outside the Atlanta federal courthouse. The charges allege that Camp had been paying the stripper for sex since the past spring and was fronting money to buy drugs for both of them. He is also charged with possessing a firearm as an unlawful user of controlled substances and with aiding and abetting the possession of drugs by the stripper, who had a prior drug conviction.
