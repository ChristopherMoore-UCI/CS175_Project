Gaviria and two other former Latin American presidents -- Fernando Cardoso of Brazil and Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico -- are all arguing the war on drugs has failed and it is time to replace current policy with what they call a more humane and efficient approach. "What you need to do with addicts and people who consume drugs is deal with them as a health problem, an education problem," he said. In a wide ranging interview, Gaviria said the United States now has more people in jail for narco-trafficking or related crimes than there are prisoners in the whole of Europe. Thousands of people have been killed there in drug-related violence in recent years. -- Former Colombian President Cesar Gaviria on Tuesday strongly criticized the United States' approach to fighting drugs.
