Despite compelling data and evidence showing that illegal logging is a worldwide epidemic, most forest crimes go undetected, unreported, or are ignored," says the 56-page report released Tuesday. Estimates of financial losses from illegal logging don't consider "the enormous environmental, economic and societal costsâ€” biodiversity threats, increased carbon emissions and undermined livelihoods of rural peoples," the report says. The report says the logging is mostly controlled by organized crime, and ill-gotten gains are used to pay corrupt government officials at all levels to turn a blind eye.
