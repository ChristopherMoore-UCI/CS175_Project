" 'Provocative' Edelle Field-Fote, PT, Ph.D., director of spinal cord injury research at Shepherd Center in U.S. city of Atlanta said the researchers' findings were a "very provocative outcome. Surgeons at Wroclaw University in Poland led by Dr Pawel Tabakow injected the OECs above and below Fidyka's spinal cord gap, then used nerve tissue taken from his ankle to act as a bridge for spinal nerves to grow across, UCL said. I believe we have now opened the door to a treatment of spinal cord injury that will get patients out of wheel chairs," Raisman said. "The problem with spinal injury is that nerve fibers are severed by the injury so that impulses that carry movement -- the desire for movement -- down from the brain to the body are cut off. Previous studies have shown these cells to be popular candidates for research on repairing spinal cord injuries.
