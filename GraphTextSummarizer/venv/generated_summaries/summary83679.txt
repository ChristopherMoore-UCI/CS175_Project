He's really good at impressions His turn on "Saturday Night Live" may not have gotten as much attention as, say, Justin Timberlake's, but there was no denying Mars was out of this world when he portrayed an intern at Pandora who has to imitate several artists -- including Green Day, Michael Jackson, Steven Tyler and Justin Bieber -- when the power goes out. While struggling to be discovered as a singer, he got his start in the industry writing and producing hit songs for other artists, including Travie McCoy's "Billionaire," Flo Rida's hit "Right Round," and K'Naan's "Wavin' Flag," which became the theme song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Four of his sisters have formed a singing group called The Lylas, and last year they launched a reality show on the WE network. He can always find the bright spot -- even when being arrested How can we forget that famous mug shot with him grinning when he was arrested for alleged drug possession? Heck, we were rooting for Bruno Mars.
