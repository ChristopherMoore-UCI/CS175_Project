, authorities said Friday, after photos allegedly showed them shooting three unarmed men on a busy street in central Nairobi. A 2009 U.N. report accused Kenyan police of misusing its power, and called for the removal of the nation's police commissioner at the time. Kiraithe said the victims have criminal records, and one injured a police officer in a shooting last week. The killings sparked condemnation nationwide, with human rights groups renewing calls for reform in the Kenyan police. "They (officers) are very much innocent until declared guilty, let's not forget that," Eric Kiraithe said by phone from Nairobi.
