But in the first minute of injury time, Pilar struck to deliver the Czechs' first win over the Netherlands since a 3-2 result -- that match was a classic -- at Euro 2004. It was the second straight time Italy fell at the first hurdle at a World Cup and overshadowed the team's surprising run to the final at Euro 2012. It wasn't the start Hiddink wanted in his second stint in charge as national team boss, especially after he saw his team fall 2-0 to Italy in a glamor friendly last week. His appointment was met with approval from the likes of Juventus and Italy legend Gianluigi Buffon, and the Azzurri duly upended the Dutch in Bari, Italy. In Conte's first competitive match as manager Tuesday, Italy ended a 77-year drought by topping Norway 2-0 in Group H. Not since 1937 had Italy triumphed in Norway.
