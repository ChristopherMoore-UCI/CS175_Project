Many people have legitimate concerns about how much regulation goes into the approval of drugs in the United States. The New York Times documents many instances in many countries where improperly made or counterfeit drugs led to serious consequences, including deaths. For some time, many people, including me, have been advocating for greater use of generic and over-the-counter drugs over bioequivalent name brand drugs because they would result in significantly decreased health care spending. Without proper oversight, people in the United States, not some Third World nation, are at risk for buying counterfeit drugs in their pharmacies. Moreover, it's a concern that ignores that the vast, vast majority of drugs we buy here are not manufactured here.
