-- Two late goals from Robin van Persie and Andrey Arshavin gave Arsenal a 2-1 win over Spanish champions Barcelona in their last 16, first leg tie at the Emirates Wednesday night. The prolific Van Persie scored his 13th goal of an injury-truncated season and Arshavin's winner, after a flowing Arsenal move reminiscent of Barcelona at their best, capped a memorable night for the Gunners. Barcelona led through a 26th minute goal from David Villa and might have added to their tally as Lionel Messi endured a frustrating night. In Wednesday's other Champions League action, Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk scored a 3-2 win over AS Roma in the Italian capital to take a firm grip on the last 16 tie. Arshavin capped a dream comeback for Arsene Wenger's men with a curling shot past Valdes five minutes later after the ball had been perfectly laid into his path by Samir Nasri.
