Scanlon represented tribes from Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Michigan who were interested in obtaining or keeping gaming licenses to operate casinos on Indian lands. -- Michael Scanlon, a former close business associate of now-disgraced ex-lobbyist Jack Abramoff, was sentenced to 20 months in prison Friday. Judge Ellen Huvelle also ordered Scanlon to pay more than $20 million to victims of his scheme to defraud four Native American tribes. The Abramoff investigation eventually netted a total of 20 lobbyists and public officials who pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial. After spending additional time in a Baltimore halfway house, Abramoff was released last December.
