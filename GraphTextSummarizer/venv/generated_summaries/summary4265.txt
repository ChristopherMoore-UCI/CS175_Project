Later in the day the Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim said security forces had recovered 15 guns, a small number relative to the thousands of protesters at the encampment. The front line was a major intersection where protesters erected and set on fire a heaping pile of debris to stop the advance of security forces. By 6 p.m., security forces had taken full control of the area, demolishing hundreds of tents and bulldozing anything in sight -- including charred remains of protesters. About one hour later I was at Rabaa with my team -- CNN producer Salma Abdelaziz and cameraman Ahmed Zeidan. Authorities claim they used loudspeakers to warn protesters to clear out and provided two safe exits, but witnesses say police immediately opened fire and bulldozed through the camp's tents and makeshift shelters.
