Angry and frustrated over both the search and rescue operation and the flow of information from South Korean authorities, dozens of relatives of missing ferry passengers intending to march in protest to Seoul were blocked by police from leaving Jindo. Though the police were not aggressive to the protesting families, Nam questioned why there were so many officers at the site of anguished relatives. Jindo is the port city where the search, rescue and recovery operation has been based since the ferry, carrying 476 passengers, capsized and sank on Wednesday. Several families stayed in the street, attempting to break through police lines in their march. The residence is located in the capital, Seoul -- some 275 miles north of Jindo.
