Lucas Barrios picked up the ball outside the Slovakia penalty area before slipping the ball through to Enrique Vera who, with Zendo Strba and Jan Durica bearing down on him, clipped the ball with the outside of his boot past Slovak keeper Jan Mucha. Cristian Riveros' 86th minute strike sealed a comfortable victory for the South American team after midfielder Enrique Vera had given them the lead in the first half. A win against Slovakia would ensure qualification, but they must rely on New Zealand getting a result against Paraguay to have any chance of topping their group. Roque Santa Cruz should have doubled Paraguay's in the 38th minute, when he latched onto a loose ball on the edge of Slovakia's penalty area. Italy continued to press in the second half but found no route through a spirited and steadfast defense expertly organized by Kiwi captain Ryan Nelsen.
