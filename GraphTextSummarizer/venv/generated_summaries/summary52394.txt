" Many news sites have moderating systems that remove offensive comments, and some sites have sought to make commenters more accountable by requiring them to register via an account on Facebook or other social platform. " Huffington's decision to prohibit anonymous comments is better than banning all comments, said Sarah Sobieraj, a media expert and sociology professor at Tufts University in suburban Boston. Huffington made the off-the-cuff comment in a Q&A session after a speech Wednesday to a crowd of 4,000 at a conference in Boston, according to spokeswoman Katie Burke of HubSpot, a marketing software company that hosts the conference. CNN requires people to create accounts to participate in discussions on CNN.com, but it's not a foolproof system, says David E. Williams, community manager for CNN Digital. "It's valuable that she is not shutting down comments altogether, though it's sort of a Pandora's box," said Sobieraj, who believes that people who really want to post offensive messages will still find a way to do that make other efforts to post their opinions.
