Motorists often see bands of bikes on the streets on the final Fridays of each month as cyclists across the nation gather for evening group rides called Critical Mass. The purpose, advocates say, is to make cars and trucks more aware of bicyclists. Denver received $250,000 of stimulus money for cycling projects and is going to add 11 miles of bike lanes. The city, working with the state, has decided to redo the four-lane road, and when the project is done, there will be two lanes for cars, a center median and bike lanes on each side. The city has little room for new roads, municipal bike planner Emily Kreisa said. The city is using its own funds to paint sharrows (painted bike symbols on the asphalt with arrows showing cyclists the way) to connect the roads of the network.
