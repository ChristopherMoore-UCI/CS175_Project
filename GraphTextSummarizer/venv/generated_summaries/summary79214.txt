After the first day of Cairo street  protests on Tuesday, Israeli Knesset member Benjamin Ben Eliezer, known as the Israeli  politician with the closest ties to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,  told Israeli Army Radio that he did not  believe the demonstrations would bring down the regime for lack of a viable leadership in the opposition. It was an assessment shared by more  than a few Israeli analysts and government  officials, but by Friday night, underscoring just  how rapidly events were  moving, Arab affairs analysts for the two major Israeli television  networks were talking about the possibility of Mubarak being forced from  power. Neither officials from Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office nor the Israeli foreign ministry offered  any public comment on the  growing  political instability in Israel's most important regional ally  . The two countries signed a historic peace agreement in  1979, and during his 28 years in office, Mubarak has worked with eight  Israeli prime ministers. -- Israel was silent Friday as a week of massive street protests engulfed the streets of Cairo and other Egyptian  cities.
