The Justice officials were in Mexico City to coordinate with that nation's authorities after the death of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry near the Mexican border. They show a top Justice Department official and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives acting director suggested illegally purchased weapons be allowed to cross into Mexico where Mexican officials would be waiting to arrest, prosecute and convict the gun traffickers. Breuer "suggested allowing straw purchasers cross into Mexico so (Mexican federal police) can arrest and (the Mexican attorney general's office] can prosecute and convict." Justice also sent a letter to Capitol Hill leaders providing details of a series of reforms made by the Justice Department and ATF to ensure there is no repeat of the controversial operation which allowed hundreds of illegal weapons to be sold in the United States and trafficked into Mexico. The ATF plan was to track the weapons to Mexican drug cartels.
