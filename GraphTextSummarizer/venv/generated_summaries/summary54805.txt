He passed along the information to Ronald, who isolated the gene, called Sub1, and introduced it into normal rice varieties, generating rice that could withstand being submerged in water for 17 days. But rice plants do not like it when they are submerged in water for long periods, Ronald said. Ronald's team works with rice, a grain most Americans take for granted, but which is a matter of life and death to much of the world. "People [in the United States] think, well, if I don't have enough rice, I'll go to the store," said Ronald, a professor of plant pathology at UC-Davis. " Normal rice dies after three days of complete flooding.
