-- Several Israeli government websites appeared to crash as anti-Israeli hackers launched cyberattacks Sunday, but Israeli hackers also claimed their own victory. Instead of anti-Israeli messages, it was playing Israel's national anthem, "Hatikvah." Yitzhak Ben Yisrael, the head of the Israel'sÂ National Cyber Directorate, downplayed the effects of the cyberattacks in an interview Sunday with Israel Radio. The websites for Israel's Knesset and elections agency appeared to be down Sunday. A group calling itself Anonymous Arab said in a YouTube video posted last week its cyberattack plan would come in three phases.
