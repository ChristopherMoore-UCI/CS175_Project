In describing the crash site, Sumwalt said, "The main part of fuselage is rested up against the second house, with the tail of the airplane actually at the front door of that house, and then finally it appears that one of the wings was catapulted over into the third house where the majority of the fire damage occurred. "This a tragic loss for the Montgomery County community," Fire Chief Steven Lohr said at the news conference. The crash occurred at about 10:44 a.m. Monday as the twin-engine Embraer EMB-500/Phenom 100 made an instrument approach to Montgomery County Airport, Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB said at a news conference near the wreckage. The National Transportation Safety Board has not said who piloted the plane, but Rosenberg was certified to fly that type of aircraft, according to Federal Aviation Administration records. He said the device contained the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder.
