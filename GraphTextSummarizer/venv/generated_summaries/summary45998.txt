CNN -- Spanish giants Real Madrid have confirmed they have reached an agreement with Portuguese club Benfica for the transfer of Argentina striker Angel di Maria. He started his career at CA Rosario Central of Argentina before moving to Benfica in 2007 after a host of impressive displays. Di Maria is currently on international duty at the World Cup in South Africa, and has started all four of Argentina's matches. Di Maria is expected to be the first in a string of big name signings as Mourinho attempts to wrest the Spanish league title back from rivals Barcelona. Di Maria is Jose Mourinho's first signing since taking over as manager from Manual Pellegrini at Madrid on May 31.
