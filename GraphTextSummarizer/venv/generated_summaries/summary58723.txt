The lawyer, Kuwait-based Salem Al-Hashash, told CNN on Tuesday that he was representing Jassem Emwazi and planned to file lawsuits against anyone who has claimed that Mohammed Emwazi is Jihadi John. Last week, two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed to CNN that "Jihadi John" is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. "There is nothing that proves what is being circulated in the media, especially through video clips and footage, that the accused is my son Mohammed, who is being referred to as the alleged executioner" of ISIS, Jassem Emwazi told the Kuwaiti newspaper al Qabas. A man who says he's Mohammed Emwazi's father has reportedly said there is no proof that his son is the masked ISIS killer known as "Jihadi John." Jassem Emwazi's statements to al Qabas appear to contradict reports this week that his wife recognized Jihadi John's voice as her son's when she saw footage that shows the man, whose face is covered, brandishing a knife and threatening ISIS hostages.
