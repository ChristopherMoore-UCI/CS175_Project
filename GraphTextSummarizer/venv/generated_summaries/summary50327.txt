As part of this Service Year City effort, cities would commit to growing service year opportunities for young people and include this in the city's strategic planning, as Mayor Dayne Walling has done in Flint, Michigan. Creating model towns and cities of service across America could provide powerful local examples that capture our collective imagination and create ripple effects for more service opportunities. New York City plans to double its number of service year opportunities from 5,000 to 10,000. What if, upon graduating from high school, every young person in these cities is given an opportunity to complete a service year with other young people? In return for four years of education, I owed the nation at least five years of Army service.
