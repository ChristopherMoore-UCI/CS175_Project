"If anything, this year's CoolBrands rankings illustrate that a solid reputation is hard to undermine or, in the case of rivals, overcome," the head of CoolBrands Council Stephen Cheliotis said. Its rival Instagram has made its first appearance in the elite club. The U.S. streaming and DVD service Netflix broke into the top 20 for the first time, a result of its popularity rising in Europe. High-end luxury brands continue to dominate the ranking with Aston Martin, CHANEL, Dom Perignon and Rolex all making appearance in the top 10. In total, 13 brands retained their Top 20 status from last year.
