LaBeouf had been sitting in the audience at Studio 54, CNN affiliate WABC reported, when he allegedly disrupted the show during the first act. Actor Shia LaBeouf has literally made an art of apologizing for a chain of ill deeds. Two women in the audience thought that LaBeouf's outburst was an act, they told WABC. In court, a prosecutor voiced concern about releasing LaBeouf without bail, but the defense lawyer noted the media buzz that his failure to appear for his July 24 court day would generate. Represented by a legal aid lawyer during his brief court appearance, the actor was formally charged with criminal trespass, disorderly conduct and harassment.
