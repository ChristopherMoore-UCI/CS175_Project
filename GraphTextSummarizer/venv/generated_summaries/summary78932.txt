The chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence said that the U.S. government was warned about the radicalization of suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, of Nigeria, more than a month before he flew from Nigeria to the Netherlands and then to Detroit, Michigan. "Yet apparently no action was taken other than to put Mr. AbdulMutallab in the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment. The failed bombing "is a reminder that attempts to attack the U.S. homeland continue and that al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups are searching for new ways to use explosive devices and operatives that will not arouse suspicion in order to carry out attacks in this country," the California Democrat wrote Wednesday in a letter to the president posted on her Web site. A U.S. government official said the United States had intelligence more than a month before the attack -- between August and October -- that extremists in Yemen were discussing operations; that someone known as "the Nigerian" was mentioned; and that U.S. intelligence had a partial name, Umar Farouk. Feinstein said she understood that AbdulMutallab wasn't put on a no-fly list because of a policy established last year during the administration of George W. Bush, "that limits the circumstances under which the government adds an individual to the watch list." He said security officials cannot count on perfection and therefore have created a layered security strategy "so that even if one fails, another one gets picked up.
