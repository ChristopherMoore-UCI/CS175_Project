The Pakistani Taliban represent a confederation of Taliban groups in northwestern Pakistan, where they are based, said Bill Roggio, military affairs analyst who is managing editor of The Long War Journal. The indictment describes a number of occasions where Hafiz Khan transferred money to Pakistan, and where money was withdrawn once there. FBI agents arrested Hafiz Khan and his son Izhar Khan in South Florida, the department said. Both groups swear allegiance to Taliban leader Mullah Omar and have close ties to al Qaeda, he said. The elder Khan also built a madrassa in Pakistan's Swat Valley that provided shelter for the terrorist group, the indictment states.
