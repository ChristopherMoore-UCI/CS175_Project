Children beheaded as violence grows in Central African Republic 'Unprecedented levels of violence against children' "I was born in CAR and started to do commerce with my parents at an early age. The first road convoy organized by the Chadian government to evacuate stranded Chadian migrants arrived at the Chadian border village of Sido this week to help evacuate about 1,800 women and children who were living in very desperate conditions. " "We are witnessing unprecedented levels of violence against children. Concrete action is needed now to prevent violence against children," Diabate said. More than half the population of the capital city of Bangui has been displaced, and nearly 60% of them are displaced children, according to the latest report from UNHCR, the United Nations' refugee agency.
