But since losing hundreds of pounds, Mills has appeared on the "Rachael Ray Show" for a makeover and talks regularly in schools. But most importantly, Mills wants to be around to take care of her husband, 23- and 19-year-old sons, and elderly parents for as long as she can. "I tell the kids this doesn't just mean weight loss; if you put your mind to anything, nothing can stop you," says Mills. Mills can't even eat a full 8 ounces of food anymore -- her stomach has gotten so small -- and she needs to be very picky about what she eats. It helps with eating healthy food portions, even if she's noshing on her favorite meal: fried chicken fingers and deep fried potato chips.
