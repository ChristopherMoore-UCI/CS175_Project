When I opened up Thursday's New York Times and saw a story at the top of the page about a proposal calling on Chicago billionaire Joe Ricketts to spend upwards of $10 million on a vicious attack on Obama with Wright at the center of it, I frankly laughed. Obama's weakness in 2012 isn't a sermon by Wright called "Confusing God and Government" -- that's the one he was ripped for saying "goddamn America" -- it's the weak economy and him as its chief steward. Making Wright a central campaign theme would have done nothing to keep Obama from beating McCain. Yet for a band of GOP strategists, they somehow think trying to replay a bunch of old sermons by the president's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, will result in electoral gold. When Sen. John McCain declared tying Obama to Wright was off limits in 2008, GOP stalwarts seethed, angry that they couldn't portray the then-senator as an acolyte of someone they considered to be a crazed, deranged pastor who hated America.
