Korovin was authorized only to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said. Rivers, 81, died a week after suffering cardiac arrest during an appointment at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic. The clinic denies published reports that a vocal cord biopsy was performed moments before Rivers went into cardiac arrest. Dr. Gwen Korovin also "categorically denies" taking a selfie photo of Rivers while she was under anesthesia at a medical clinic, the source said Thursday. The statement disputes what a source close to the Rivers death investigation told CNN: that staff members at the clinic told investigators that Korovin snapped the selfie while Rivers was under anesthesia and also performed an unauthorized procedure on Rivers.
