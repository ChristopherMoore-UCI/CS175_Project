I've had a nice parade of co-stars, co-girlfriends for Ted. How they knew the show would last Carter Bays (co-creator): When we first started making the show, we had this weird, na√Øve idea that it would run a long time. Craig Thomas (co-creator): The cast were like, "This is too fun, this is doomed to fail, we can't be allowed to do this for nine years." Now that we've said goodbye to Ted and his friends and the hit sitcom that often challenged the conventions (like, say, telling stories in chronological order), let's turn to the cast and the creators as they look back. It does things differently than other shows.
