Competing arguments were made about whether the high court ruling would end either arbitration or class action, as both currently exist. Writing for the majority, Justice Antonin Scalia said class arbitration cannot be forced on parties when their contract explicitly prohibits it. "The aggregation of claims in class arbitration greatly increases the stakes for the defendant," said Scalia. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's litigation arm had filed an amicus brief that said "class arbitration does not deter misconduct, but rather forces parties into costly litigation." "The Federal Arbitration Act is in no way hostile to class actions, and it specifically preserves a critical role for state law."
