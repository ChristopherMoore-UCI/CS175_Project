" Paid-media campaigns such as The Meth Project pay for air time, allowing the ads to be more graphic than donated media, said Peggy Conlon, the president and CEO of Ad Council. She said the goal was to produce PSAs that mirrored the content their target audience -- teens and young adults -- is used to. For example, Ad Council's "buzzed driving" campaign infuses gore with humor to get through to teens and young adults. The network uses humor in their newest campaign Get Yourself Tested, or GYT, meant to get teens and young adults talking about sexually transmitted disease prevention. " Despite the graphic nature of the PSAs, they have appeared in prime-time slots in the eight states with which The Meth Project works.
