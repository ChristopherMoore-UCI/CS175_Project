Recently, comet ISON was mostly destroyed in its close encounter with the sun in November last year but it did provide scientists with fresh data in the process. "Astronomers believe comets are made of pristine solar system material before the solar system was formed," he said. ESA says the mission's objective is to help understand the origin and evolution of the solar system and investigate the role that comets may have played in seeding Earth with water. Since then, ESA says it has been around the sun five times as controllers line it up to meet comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in August this year. ESA project scientist Matt Taylor said if the project is successful it will advance the knowledge about comets.
