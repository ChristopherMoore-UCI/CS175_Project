They recounted that the three lay judges, led by Giuseppe Dalla Torre, heard that Vatican investigators had seized 82 boxes of various sizes of evidence from Gabriele's apartments in Vatican City and Castel Gondolfo, a small town near Rome. Gabriele was arrested in May, following a top-level Vatican investigation into how the pope's private documents appeared in the best-selling book "Sua Santita" ("His Holiness"), by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi. Gabriele did not enter a plea but has admitted leaking the papers to the Vatican prosecutor, according to Vatican statements. The Vatican City State penal code for proceedings involving its citizens is based on the Italian penal code of the second half of the 19th century. Prison terms handed down by the court are served in the Italian prison system, under an agreement between the Vatican City State and Italy.
