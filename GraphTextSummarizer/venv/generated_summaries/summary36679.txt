For those who celebrated Murray's victory last year -- well, they'll just be hoping they won't have to wait another 77 years for their next Wimbledon party. Murray, the man who had cried his way into the nation's hearts after his 2012 final defeat by Federer, dispatched Novak Djokovic in straight sets on to become the first British man to the win the singles title since Fred Perry in 1936. Born in Haskovo, Bulgaria, Dimitrov trained at the same tennis academy in Spain as Murray, albeit not at the same time. Showing little or no sign of being nervous or overawed by the occasion, Dimitrov broke not just Murray's serve -- he broke his spirit. There was an inevitability about the result and Dimitrov could celebrate when Murray placed his final shot into the net.
