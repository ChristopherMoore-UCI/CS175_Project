Former Vice President Dick Cheney called a Senate panel's report on U.S. interrogation tactics during George W. Bush's administration is "deeply flawed" and a "terrible piece of work. Contrary to the report's conclusion that Bush didn't know the extent of the CIA's efforts, Cheney said the President was involved in discussions about the interrogation techniques, and that Bush even pointed out some of those conversations in a book he wrote after leaving office. Bush's Republican vice president insisted that the Central Intelligence Agency's rough tactics -- which the report said included mock executions, beatings, "rectal rehydration" and feeding, sleep deprivation and more -- helped the United States "catch the bastards who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11." " "The report's full of crap," he said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday evening. "It did in fact produce actionable intelligence that was vital in the success of keeping the country safe from further attacks," he said.
