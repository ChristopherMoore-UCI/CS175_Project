Beginning this month, its agenda will also focus on the increasing mobility of nurses throughout Europe and its potential social and economic impact. As the member states of the Joint Action begin to meet, some have expressed concern that the migration of nurses within Europe may have unintended consequences. The migration of nurses is further exacerbated by a significant wage disparity within Europe. Add to that an economic recession and more seniors requiring long-term care, and Europe may be facing a shortage of 1 million health professionals by 2020, according to a European Union Joint Action on Health Workforce Planning estimate. In other countries, such as Germany, the shortage is particularly acute, and the immigration of health care workers from poorer economies even outside of Europe is becoming part of the solution.
