-- New York City officials on Monday were preparing the site where a part believed to be from one of the 9/11 airliners was found so that they can begin the search for human remains, according to the New York Police Department. Staff from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will start sifting through soil for human remains on Tuesday, police said. In recent years, debris and human remains have been discovered in various spots around Lower Manhattan. Contrary to an initial theory that the piece could have been lowered by a rope found still wrapped to it, the police department clarified Monday that a police officer had attached the rope last week to maneuver the part to better see a serial number and other indicators. It could not be determined from which of the two planes the part came, police said Monday.
