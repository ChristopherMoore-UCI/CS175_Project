The poorest country in the region, Yemen is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which U.S. officials consider to be the most dangerous branch of the terrorist network, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Sunni majority Saudi Arabia, which provides energy and financial support to Yemen and shares a long border with it, is looking on with growing anxiety, fearful of the prospect of another Shiite-dominated state in the region. "That makes Saudi Arabia very uncomfortable," said CNN global affairs analyst Bobby Ghosh. " Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy in Washington, told CNN on Wednesday that without Saudi support, "Yemen will become a failed state." "This will terrify the Saudis, just as the Shia uprising in Bahrain did," said CNN intelligence and security analyst Bob Baer.
