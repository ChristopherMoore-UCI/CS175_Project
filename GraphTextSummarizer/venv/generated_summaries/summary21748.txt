Finally, I do want to thank you for harshly reminding of one thing: Because the essay was published just before the Fourth of July  -- and incidentally, just a few weeks before India's own independence day -- you and your publication reminded me with no uncertainty that racism, ignorance and fear of new people are as American as apple pie and Time magazine. (Time Warner Inc. is the parent company of CNN.com and Time magazine.) Last I checked, your essay was one of the most read and e-mailed articles at Time.com. Normally, I write about health care, but your essay in Time, "My Own Private India," caught my attention for reasons that have nothing to do with medicine. Should we make our parents throw their Hindi language newsmagazine in the garbage and subscribe to Time?
