The Italian government is vowing to fight a European court ruling that crucifixes in classrooms violate students' right to freedom of religion. The European Court of Human Rights was set up in Strasbourg by the Council of Europe Member States in 1959 to deal with alleged violations of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights. "How could someone not share such a symbol?" Italy has three months to file a request for a new hearing, court spokesman Stefano Piedimonte told CNN. Italian courts had ruled earlier that the cross was a symbol of Italy's history and culture, prompting Lautsi to take her case to the European court in Strasbourg, France. The European Court of Human Rights found unanimously Tuesday that the display of a particular religious symbol -- such as the Christian cross -- in a classroom "restricted the right of parents to educate their children in conformity with their convictions, and the right of children to believe or not to believe," a court statement said.
