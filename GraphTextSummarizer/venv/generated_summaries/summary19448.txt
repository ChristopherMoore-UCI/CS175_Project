However, it came far too late -- the last kick of the match -- as Vallecano moved up to fifth place on goal difference above Valencia thanks to first-half goals from Guinean striker Alhassane Bangoura and Brazilian forward Leo Baptistao. Third-placed Marseille also dropped points, drawing 1-1 at Evian -- who moved out of the bottom three on goal difference. David Villa and substitute Cristian Tello scored in the second half before Getafe hit back through striker Alvaro Vazquez, but then Andres Iniesta and defender Gerard Pique netted in time added on. An 87th-minute goal from Czech player Pavel Krmas put Freiburg above Mainz and Hamburg on goal difference. Italy Mario Balotelli scored his second successive penalty for AC Milan to rescue a 1-1 draw at Cagliari, but his team surrendered fourth place in Serie A to city rivals Internazionale.
