At last year's major Emmy ceremony, HBO led all networks with seven wins, as other cable networks and Netflix combined for another 12 statues. It might well be a last stand, with an increasing number of cable networks making original and praiseworthy drama or comedy series. Why would they do that?" Meyers could have been speaking for host network NBC, which was shut out Monday night along with Fox. Netflix still keeps its audience numbers secret for its streaming original series and also may have riled some voters by submitting "Orange is the New Black" as a comedy in what looked like a craven grab for Emmy gold. Also left at Emmy's altar Monday night was movie star Billy Bob Thornton, an early favorite for his villainous lead role in FX's "Fargo."
