-- At least 1,000 prisoners are on death row in Iraq, which now has one of the highest rates of execution in the world, the human rights group Amnesty International says in a report being released Tuesday. When asked by CNN about pleas not to execute women on death row, many of them mothers, al-Deen said, "For us, there is no difference between men and women who commit crimes. The courts that sentence people to death do not meet international standards, the report charged, and Iraqi authorities "provide very little information on executions, and some have been carried out secretly. " It criticizes the Central Criminal Court of Iraq and the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal, which issue the majority of death sentences in the country. The report lists a wide variety of crimes that can result in the death penalty, including murder, crimes compromising state security, attempting to overthrow the government by violent means and damaging public property.
