A provision called Part D, which has given individuals with low incomes access to cheap medications, has at the same time enabled doctors to prescribe name-brand drugs without complaint from low-income patients, ProPublica said. Many of these doctors also had financial ties to the companies that manufacture the drugs they prescribed, ProPublica reports, and have accepted thousands of dollars from drug companies in the form of promotional or consulting fees. They should look at the issues presented in the ProPublica report to help control rising health care costs, she said. The biggest offenders are 913 practitioners who, thanks to disproportionately prescribing name-brand drugs, cost taxpayers an extra $300 million in 2011, say ProPublica's Charles Ornstein, Tracy Weber and Jennifer LaFleur. The report's findings about money wasted on brand-name drugs aren't too surprising, said Dr. Tara Bishop, assistant professor of public health and medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.
