By Sunday night, state and local officials -- plus the Facebook page for Louisiana's emergency management division and New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu -- had reported flooding in numerous Louisiana parishes including Iberia, Terrebone, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Tammany and Jefferson. In a press conference in New Orleans on Sunday afternoon, Landrieu characterized Lee as a "very stubborn, persistent, slow-moving unpredictable event." By Sunday afternoon, water levels were as high as 2 to 4 feet above ground level over parts of the Louisiana coast, and up to 3 feet above ground level along the Mississippi and Alabama coasts, the hurricane center said. Centered over southern Louisiana, the storm continued to pump out rain -- as much as 20 inches expected in spots through Monday night, according to the National Hurricane Center -- as it chugged northward Sunday toward the Tennessee Valley. -- Lee weakened to a tropical depression late Sunday, the National Hurricane Center reported, but not before dumping vast amounts of rain and causing extensive flooding in Gulf Coast states.
