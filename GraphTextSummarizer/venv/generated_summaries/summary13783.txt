"TSA has the statutory responsibility for requiring employment investigations, including a criminal history record check and a review of available law enforcement databases and other records for individuals who have unescorted access to the secure areas of airports and aircraft," it said. -- The inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security is asking airports to deliver personal information on workers who have access to secure or sensitive areas. Airports submit monthly information to the TSA, but the request this week requires additional information and the agency is not being flexible, the official said. A memo sent to airport security badge offices by a senior analyst at the department is asking for the names, Social Security numbers, birthdates and 13 other personal data points in a review of the Transportation Security Administration's credentialing process. A transportation official familiar with the request told CNN it came in late Wednesday afternoon, giving airports just two business days before the busy Thanksgiving week to comply.
