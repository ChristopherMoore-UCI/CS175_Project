Unlike crop farmers, livestock farmers and ranchers do not have insurance programs to ease the losses during disaster years. Food availability will be affected because farmers will be producing less food. We were able to purchase crop insurance for most of our crops, but unfortunately that alone will not help make our farm or equipment payments to the bank since most of our crops are ruined. Our farm, like most other U.S. farms, is really suffering right now and in desperate need of rain. The price to purchase corn and soybeans is skyrocketing because of crop losses across most of the United States.
