Will Bartlett, a senior research fellow in the political economy of South East Europe at the London School of Economics, told CNN: "The EU will not be a panacea for Croatia's economy." Bartlett says that at the turn of the century, Croatia's banking industry became largely foreign-owned by European banks. Brussels is embracing recession-marred Croatia, three years into a debt crisis that is plaguing countries across southern Europe. With a low credit rating of junk and a political class stained by accusations of endemic corruption, the Balkan state of Croatia is soon to become the EU's latest addition. " Croatia joining the EU will be "highly beneficial" for the accession process, according to Bender, as it will inspire other "young democracies" in the Balkans and beyond to join the European movement.
