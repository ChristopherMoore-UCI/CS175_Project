If you're a literary nerd like Teresa Fields, not only do you fall in love with imagined characters who sit on your bookshelf, but you also fall in love with the minds that have penned them to life. Wanting to explore the world of English novelist Jane Austen, Fields set off from her home in Virginia to the charming Hampshire countryside -- the place of inspiration for stories that would become timeless novels like "Sense and Sensibility" and "Pride and Prejudice." Austen fans can take a stroll through the 17th-century cottage, now a museum, where the author spent the last eight years of her life in the village of Chawton. But faithful fans aren't leaving their love for their interests at home. Designed by legendary anime filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, renowned for movies like "Spirited Away" and "My Neighbor Totoro," the whimsical Ghibli Museum is the perfect place to see Miyazaki's animations come to life.
