At a U.S. Senate Committee hearing on March 9, Napolitano said that the U.S. government remains "very concerned about drug cartel violence in Mexico and we must vigorously guard against potential spillover effects into the United States." Should Mexican drug cartels be considered terrorist organizations? Mexican officials have repeatedly said that drug cartels are neither an insurgency nor terrorist organizations because their purpose is neither to destabilize the government nor promote a political ideology. In the letter, Sarukhan says that "if you label these organizations as terrorist, you will have to start calling drug consumers in the U.S. 'financiers of terrorist organizations' and gun dealers 'providers of material support to terrorists.' They have taken control of much of northern Mexico and spillover crime has resulted in the abandonment of property and loss of security on the U.S. side of the border."
