After a trip to Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War with her husband, musician David Broza, Lotan decided to combine her interests in fashion and current affairs. A resident of Israel, Lotan served the mandatory two years of military service for women, as social services chair of the air force. Lotan, who moved to New York from Israel in 1980, said like most creatives, she draws on what she knows -- her upbringing and subsequent life experiences -- to find inspiration. " While the rest of her collections tend to focus on a classic, modern and minimal aesthetic, Lotan debuted a gun-print, silk charmeuse dress, blouse and scarf. Designer Nili Lotan has been culling imagery from socio-political issues like the fall of the Berlin Wall and the West Bank's "separation barrier" to create high fashion for nearly a decade.
