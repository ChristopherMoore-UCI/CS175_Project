Seoul has expressed its sympathy to the North Korean people and gave the green light for the visit by the civilian group -- which includes Hyundai Group Chairwoman Hyun Jeong-Eun and the widow of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung. Under Kim Jong Il, North Korea suffered a devastating famine, even as it built up its million-strong army, expanded its arsenal of ballistic missiles and became the world's eighth declared nuclear power. During that ceremony, Kim Yong Nam -- the president of North Korea's parliament -- declared that Kim Jong Un "is the supreme leader who has inherited (his father's) beliefs, leadership, courage and guts. A delegation of 18 South Korean citizens returned Tuesday from a two-day visit to the north to pay their respects to the fallen leader and meet with his successor, Kim. -- A top U.S. diplomat will travel to three nations around North Korea early next year in the first such talks since longtime leader Kim Jong Il's death, the State Department announced Thursday.
