That's the claim for First Warning Systems new bra, equipped with a series of sensors embedded in the cups that pick up temperature changes in breast tissue and, says the Reno, Nev.-based company, provide a thermal fingerprint that can alert doctors to the presence of malignant cells. Women wear it for 12 hours to accumulate a stable enough reading of temperature, and the measurements are fed into the company's algorithm that then spits out a result: normal, benign, suspected for breast tissue abnormalities, or probable for breast tissue abnormalities. "And we have women with breast cancers that are not seen on the thermograms. It's not clear yet whether predicting, and ideally treating breast cancer with the bra can reduce deaths from the disease, or help women avoid more advanced and aggressive cancers. It's not perfect, and needs to undergo much more rigorous testing to understand what role temperature readings can play in cancer screening."
