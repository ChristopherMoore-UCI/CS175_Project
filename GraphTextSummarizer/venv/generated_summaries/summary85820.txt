On Monday evening, Suffern police dispatcher Jeremy Kaufer spotted a media story about New York authorities trying to identify the couple who jumped to their deaths from the George Washington Bridge, according to the police statement. The couple floated about 1,000 feet down the Hudson River before New York fire and police responders were able to pull them out at 12:09 p.m., Pentangelo said. Monday, police in the village of Suffern, New York -- about 35 miles northwest of the bridge -- received a call from a man who said he had just found his uncle dead, Suffern police said in a statement. On Tuesday, Suffern detectives traveled to the New York City morgue with members of the New York and Port Authority police departments. Monday, when workers on the lower level of the bridge -- which connects New York to New Jersey -- saw something go by them over the side of the iconic structure, said Port Authority of New York and New Jersey spokesman Joe Pentangelo.
