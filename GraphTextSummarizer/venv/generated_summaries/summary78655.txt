Earlier this week, the rivalry was evident when dozens of fighters clashed at a Tripoli hospital in what residents said was the biggest armed confrontation in the capital in weeks. The scene on Tripoli's streets these days -- heavily armed men brandishing guns and racing across the city with no central command and little or no accountability -- has raised concerns among residents. Witnesses said both sides were using heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. At least three of the Tripoli fighters were wounded in the clashes, according to Salem Abaza, who is in charge of hospital security. "We are really afraid, we do not want stethoscopes to be fighting guns," Dr. Ali Osman said.
