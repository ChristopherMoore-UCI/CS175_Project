Dismissal of murder charges Masipa said the prosecution failed to prove its case that Pistorius and Steenkamp argued on the night of the killing, and that the Olympic track star shot her in a rage through a closed toilet door. Pistorius, 27, has always admitted firing the bullets that killed Steenkamp, 29, his girlfriend at the time of the shooting on Valentine's Day last year. Pistorius was found not guilty of two -- a car sunroof shooting incident and illegal possession of ammunition found at his house after Steenkamp's shooting. In her first comments since the verdict, June Steenkamp said Pistorius got off too easy for her daughter's killing. A judge found Oscar Pistorius guilty Friday of culpable homicide, which is akin to negligent killing.
