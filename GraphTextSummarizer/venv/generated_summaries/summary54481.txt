When officers arrested her on Monday, she had green paint on her clothes and shoes, and paint cans were found in three bags she had with her, according to a police report obtained by CNN. In other incidents, green paint was used recently to deface the Lincoln Memorial, a statue of Martin Luther in Thomas Circle and a statue in front of a Smithsonian building, the court documents said. "She's been in the community for only a few days, and the government would argue that there is strong evidence that the defendant's presence in the district is for no other purpose than to deface national monuments and landmarks," said prosecutor Kevin Chambers. White paint mixed with urine and feces was splattered on the church's organ.
