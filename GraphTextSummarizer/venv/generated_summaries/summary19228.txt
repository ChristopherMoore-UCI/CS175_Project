-- Pakistan's former President Pervez Musharraf is expected to be indicted next week in connection with the death of opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, his lawyer said. They say Musharraf rejected Bhutto's request to use a western private security contractor for protection when she returned to Pakistan. Musharraf is not expected to be charged with murder, but over his alleged failure to provide adequate security for Bhutto, the lawyer Ahmed Raza Kasuri said Tuesday. Bhutto, Pakistan's first female prime minister, was assassinated in a gun-suicide attack in December 2007, shortly after she came back to Pakistan from self-imposed exile to take part in the 2008 general elections. Musharraf did receive one piece of good news Tuesday when the court in Rawalpindi agreed to unfreeze his assets in Pakistan and abroad.
