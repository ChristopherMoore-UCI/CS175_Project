Watch: Games medals versus GDP Nigeria, an unrepentantly heavy trader in the stock market of optimism, went to London the way it likes to travel to global engagements (be they sporting events or climate change summits) -- eschewing serious preparation, expecting the best, and inevitably attracting the worst, which actually varies in degree depending on the amount of good luck in the air. Watch: Looking back at London 2012 Abdullahi will have to do several things all at once -- fight mafias and cabals for whom self-enrichment is the pre-eminent sport, enlist private sector funding (long stifled by corruption) on a larger scale, rebuild a comatose school sports, raise the standard of the National Sports Festival, and offer his unconditional support to the Segun Odegbamis and Mobolaji Akiodes and others who, against many odds, and often in spite of the government, are striving to build the next generation of sporting talent. Government funds meant to help Nigeria's contingent prepare for London 2012 -- a total of $14 million, according to Sports Minister Bolaji Abdullahi -- weren't released to the ministry until April, just three months before the opening ceremony. For me that tragic turn of events symbolizes all that is wrong with sports administration in many African countries. Two weeks ago I visited the Africa Village at London's Kensington Gardens, to appear on a radio show being broadcast from there.
