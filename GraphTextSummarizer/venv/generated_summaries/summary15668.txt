People in the town of Shaqra contacted by phone said al Qaeda fighters drove out local tribesmen defending the town Wednesday. Yemen's opposition has accused the government of allowing towns to fall to al Qaeda in an effort to show that the turmoil in the country is being exploited by Islamist extremists. The southern provinces of Yemen have seen growing activity by Islamist militant groups said to be affiliated with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula since unrest began across the country in February. At the end of last month there were several days of clashes around Shaqra between tribal fighters and militants. Zinjibar, the provincial capital 35 kilometers away, is still largely in the hands of Islamist militia fighters calling themselves Partisans of Sharia.
