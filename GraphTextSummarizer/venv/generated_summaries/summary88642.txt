I'd wanted to go to that museum for ages, but instead, I took my place in the audience and watched my friend Karla battle through several more rounds before butting up against, I believe the word was, "dentifrice." Spelling Bee kicked off Wednesday Karla, herself, wasn't going to be skimping on socializing and sightseeing, but she was going to sequester herself for some last-minute studying in the hopes of making one last run at the title in her final year of eligibility. Phyllophorous: an adjective meaning "leaf-bearing" or, alternately, "the word that exiled me to the oft-fabled Crying Room at the 1986 National Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C." Strangely, I didn't mind; I'd already gotten my prize. I wasn't, for once, the dorkiest girl in the room, and instead was surrounded by kids who lived for language play, lovely books, good grades and a life of the mind. Very few of us are lovely on the outside at age 13, and even less so are those of us inclined toward worrying words down to their etymological nubbins.
