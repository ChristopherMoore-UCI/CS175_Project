According to state police Lt. Michael Baylous, two police officers from the town of Lewisburg pulled over a white Chevrolet SUV with North Carolina plates after learning it had been reported stolen. Baylous said, "the two suspects will be arrested for malicious assault and attempted murder of a police officer." "It is believed that the victims are from North Carolina," Baylous said. As the officers were conducting the traffic stop, a red Chevrolet truck pulled alongside them and the driver "pulled a handgun and shot at both officers," Baylous said. The drivers of both Chevrolets then fled: the red truck "went over the hillside and was eventually taken into custody," while the other motorist "drove behind a guardrail on the interstate and hid for a short amount of time," according to Baylous.
