Among returning films, Colin Firth and "Kingsman: The Secret Service" shone the brightest, topping the $100 million mark in total domestic grosses and actually rising a spot on the chart, while last weekend's winner, "Chappie," and runner-up, "Focus," duked it out for fourth place. Disney timed the release well: It's been more than a month since a family film hit theaters (if you can call the "SpongeBob" sequel a "family" film), and some American school districts just began spring break. Next weekend, Shailene Woodley returns in the young adult action sequel "The Divergent Series: Insurgent," while Sean Penn tries the action genre with Idris Elba and Javier Bardem in "The Gunman." In limited release, the critically acclaimed horror thriller "It Follows" made $163,000 in just four theaters, far and away the weekend's best per-theater average. This version, however is sweetness and light, thanks to veteran director Kenneth Branagh.
