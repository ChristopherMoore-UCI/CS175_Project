NASA spent the day tweeting facts about black holes, including a handful of Black Friday-themed jokes. NASA defines a black hole as "a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even light cannot get out," where "the gravity is so strong because matter has been squeezed into a tiny space. Shoppers may have Black Friday, but NASA scientists have something that's arguably better: Black Hole Friday. " The space agency also posted some fun and less-known facts about black holes: For example, some scientists believe that the smallest black holes are the size of a single atom. The space agency sent out over a dozen tweets and retweets on black holes.
