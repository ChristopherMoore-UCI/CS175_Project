"We were wondering why insects were so capable of going inside any building -- yet had limited senses such as eyesight," explained co-creator Adrien Briod. "Technology is developing really fast in the field of remote control -- drones are used in rescue missions, fire, or inspecting unstable buildings, bridges, and boats. Briod now hopes the pioneering design will be used in real lifesaving missions within the next year, and said we were on the brink of a new era in technology where drones were used in everyday life. In the last decade, robotics has come a long way, with scientists increasingly looking at the benefits of flying machines in disaster zones. Watch: Flying robots perform amazing acrobatics
