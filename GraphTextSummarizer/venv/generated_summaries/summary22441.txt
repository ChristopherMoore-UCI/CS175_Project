-- Zimbabwe's prime minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, said late Friday that "with deep regret and sadness" he has withdrawn a court case challenging President Robert Mugabe's re-election on July 31. In the court challenge, Tsvangirai had said ZEC had rigged the election for Mugabe and his Zanu PF party, which won a two-thirds majority in parliament. "This in my view seriously handicaps my prosecution of the petition and it has rendered in impracticable," said Tsvangirai, who has since 2000 made three attempts to unseat the now-89-year old Mugabe, Zimbabwe's only ruler since 1980. ZEC declared that Mugabe had defeated Tsvangirai with 61% of the vote to 34% in the July 31 polls. In two-page affidavit filed at Constitutional Court, Tsvangirai said he was not happy that the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) had not released election material he wanted to use in the court case.
