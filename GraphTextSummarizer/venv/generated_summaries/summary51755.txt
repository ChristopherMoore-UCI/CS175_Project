Kidnappers seized the three Friday in Egypt's Sinai region after gunmen boarded the bus, which was on its way to Israel, family members said. Kidnappers in Egypt released Louis, Lisa Alphonse and their tour guide Monday after holding them hostage since Friday. The family was not aware of security concerns in the Sinai region, where Americans had been kidnapped and swiftly released in two incidents since February, said Louis' son, Jean Louis. -- Two Americans reunited with their families Tuesday in northern Israel, a day after kidnappers freed them unharmed after three days of captivity in Egypt. Louis is the pastor of a Pentecostal church in Boston and Alphonse is a parishioner at another American church.
