As the uprising took hold, she said, activists used cell phones and uploaded videos. It's one of thousands of videos that Syrian activists have uploaded or smuggled out of the country to document the actions of Bashar al-Assad's regime -- vilified by governments and people across the globe for its fierce crackdown on protesters. Activists inside the country work to confirm details that would be suitable for print as well as video. After the Syrian uprising started last spring, activists soon realized immediately that their revolution needed video documentation to make their fight credible to the world. Cell phones soon became an identifier of opposition activists.
