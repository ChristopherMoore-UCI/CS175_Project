Taliban fighters attempted to abduct Fahim Ur Rehman, but police and residents resisted and a gun battle ensued. He said their ammunition was seized when supply vehicles coming to assist government forces were stopped by Taliban mines. In recent months, militants aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda have carried out several attacks to disrupt supplies, Pakistani officials said. There are conflicting details about the incident, in which Taliban forces attacked the Shamozai check post in the Barikot area of Swat Valley on Tuesday night and captured the people after a nightlong firefight. Khan said the personnel surrendered after Taliban forces mined the area, preventing access.
