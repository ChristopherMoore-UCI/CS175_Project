Ironically, the cold might have actually helped Lily survive, said Dr. Barbara Walsh, with the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Dry cold temperatures are more survivable than wet cold temperatures. We tend to over bundle our children, so the fact that she was dry, she probably had on multiple layers because it's winter, and there's always a chance that she had just been sort of fed right before this happened probably all played a role," Walsh said. Doctors say that such low temperatures are dangerous, but would be even more so if the baby were wet. She's going to need less sugar," Walsh said.
