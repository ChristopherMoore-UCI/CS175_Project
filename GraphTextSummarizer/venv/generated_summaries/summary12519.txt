Another was for gas pedals that can stick on some floor mats, and a third was for braking problems on Toyota Prius hybrid cars. The Transportation Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sought the fine after it learned, through documents obtained from Toyota, that the automaker knew of sticky gas pedal problems since at least September last year, the agency said this month. The Toyota Motor Corp. has indicated to the U.S. government it will pay a $16.4 million fine -- the largest ever against an automaker -- for failing to notify the Department of Transportation of a "sticky pedal" defect in its cars for at least four months, according to a senior Transportation Department official. "By paying the full civil penalty, Toyota is accepting responsibility for hiding this safety defect from NHTSA in violation of the law" the senior DOT official said Sunday. Toyota cars and trucks have been the subject of at least three separate major recalls in the past year.
