Human Rights Watch also reported that security forces had prevented medical personnel from reaching wounded people in several Homs neighborhoods. Five of them were taken from the operating room, including two who were still unconscious." Human Rights Watch said it has documented a pattern of security forces preventing medical personnel from getting to wounded protesters. Human Rights Watch said Syria's actions violate its obligation "to respect and protect the right to life and the right to health and not to subject anyone to inhuman treatment. The report came days after Syrian security forces barged into a hospital and snatched 18 wounded patients, including five from an operating room, the Human Rights Watch reported, citing witness accounts. " "Snatching wounded people from the operating room is inhumane and illegal, not to mention life-threatening," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch.
