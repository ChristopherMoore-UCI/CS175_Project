Since graduating from the police academy in 2010, a supervisor twice noted in training reports that he "spoke with (Slager) in reference to certain procedures in reference to conducting motor vehicle stops and citizen contacts." His wife is eight months' pregnant and the city will continue paying for her medical insurance until the baby is born, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey told reporters. Slager initially told investigators that he used a Taser in a confrontation Saturday with Walter Scott, who was pulled over for a busted taillight. Slager's annual in-service mandatory training included a range of topics from first aid to firearms and Taser use. Personnel documents describe Slager as "enthused" when he joined the force and said he demonstrated "great officer safety tactics" in dealing with suspects.
