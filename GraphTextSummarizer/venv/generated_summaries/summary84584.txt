Delta Air Lines has no plans to stop offering salads on flights out of Europe, but the airline is talking to European caterers daily, Delta spokeswoman Chris Kelly Singley said. Authorities are advising that people avoid raw cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuce in Germany and other European countries. -- Salads are off the menu for all American Airlines flights departing from Europe. In light of the recent E. coli strain scare, American Airlines is pulling "green salads, lettuce and tomato garnishes" to alleviate any concerns its passengers may have. Other airlines are monitoring the situation.
