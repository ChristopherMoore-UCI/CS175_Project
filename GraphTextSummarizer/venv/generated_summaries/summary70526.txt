Mullah Abdul Salam was arrested last week, according to Afghan government officials, Taliban sources and a U.S. official. Salam was directing Taliban military operations in the province, including ordering terrorist actions, mine planting and suicide attacks, said Abdul Razaq Yaqubi, police chief in Kunduz. Taliban fighters are resisting Operation Moshtarak, an allied military push into areas the Taliban control in southern Afghanistan's Helmand province. Taliban sources and Omar said other suspected members of the Afghan Taliban were arrested with Salam, but their identities are not clear. The Nad-e Ali district is "broadly secure," Carter said, noting there is still Taliban resistance in Marjah.
