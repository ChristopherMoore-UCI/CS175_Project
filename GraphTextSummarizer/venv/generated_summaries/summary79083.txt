So I go on the computer one night just researching dieting, and I come across this website that has the BMI, body mass index, of celebrities. My point is if we have more people engaging in healthy lifestyle behaviors, we will become a healthier nation, whether we lose weight or not. And what we also show in the film is that health problems come to people with or without weight. I was sitting around watching my film one day and it occurred to me -- it just hit me -- all these three things: plastic surgery, cosmetics and eating disorders, are things that primarily affect women. And we still have an archaic appreciation for women in our country because if things primarily affect women, nobody does anything about it.
