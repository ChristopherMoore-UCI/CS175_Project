-- The grooved, gray concrete wall rising from a few inches to a few feet seems to be solely for blocking the noise from the nearby highway, but like many parts of the new Pentagon memorial, there is more to the wall than meets the eye. " "The Pentagon memorial will stand as an everlasting tribute to 184 innocent souls who perished on these grounds," Bush said. If the person was inside the Pentagon, you read the name looking at the building, facing east. The stone in which that infamous date is carved was recovered from the smoldering ruins of the Pentagon, still stained with the burn marks from the explosion and fire from Flight 77 slamming into the building. Family members who lost loved ones have already begun leaving flowers and notes at the benches.
