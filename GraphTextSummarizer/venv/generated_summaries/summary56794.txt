CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo breaks down the responsibilities around runways. "One pilot might say, 'oh that was no problem,' but he might have learned how to fly in northern Canada." Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Patrick Foye told reporters that the runway in question had been plowed shortly before the incident. A Delta airplane had a close call Thursday, skidding off a snowy runway and stopping within feet of icy waters. "As to whether the runways are slippery, that is breaking action, and the airport gets that from the reports of previous pilots," she said.
