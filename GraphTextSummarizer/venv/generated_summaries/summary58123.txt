In the wake of his decision to devalue Venezuela's currency, President Hugo Chavez on Sunday said he would put the military on the streets to ensure that business owners don't raise prices. Chavez showed a photograph in a newspaper of consumers in long lines over the weekend to buy goods, fearing that the sharp devaluation could result in higher prices. The government would transfer ownership of such businesses to the workers, Chavez said. He encouraged people to publicly denounce businesses where prices increase and threatened to expropriate businesses that do. "I want the national guard in the streets, with the people, to fight speculation," Chavez said, calling re-pricing a form of robbery.
