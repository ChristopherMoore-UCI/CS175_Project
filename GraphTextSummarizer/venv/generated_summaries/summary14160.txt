Freud's work has been exhibited at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Irish Museum of Modern Art in Dublin, the Museo Correr in Venice, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Tate Britain, the Scottish National Gallery of Art, the Stadtisches Kunstmuseum Spendhaus Reutlingen in Germany, the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst Frankfurt, Whitechapel Art Gallery in London, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the Art Gallery of New South Wales in Sydney, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid, the Fundacio La Caixa in Barcelona, the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, and the Setagaya Art Museum in Tokyo. He studied for a brief time at the Central School of Art in London and at Cedric Morris' East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing in Dedham, according to a biography posted by the Tate Modern in London, where he had an exhibition. In 2008, one of Freud's works -- the 1995 painting "Benefits Supervisor Sleeping" -- fetched $33.6 million during bidding at Christie's auction house in New York, setting a then-record for a work by a living artist. He died Wednesday night of an unspecified illness at his home in London. The painting depicts Sue Tilley, a manager of a government-run job center in London, lying naked on her side on a worn-out couch with nothing to hide her folds of flesh.
