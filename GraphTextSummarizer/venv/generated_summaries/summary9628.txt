Underwood, who now pitches with tinted safety glasses covering his acrylic left eye, is undefeated this season, 4-0, for Southeast Missouri State. Some 10 separate signatures and a batter's box full of NCAA paperwork later, Underwood got cleared and began fooling hitters again last spring. Ky Burgess catches for Underwood at Southeast Missouri State now and was behind the plate to see and hear a baseball obliterate an eye-socket, but not a young man's will. The 22-year-old explains he needed to focus more on certain spots around home plate to make up for the change in depth perception. Underwood is left handed, so his remaining good right eye has a wide open view of the plate.
