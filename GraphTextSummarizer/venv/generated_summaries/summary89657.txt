The cast includes Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. as Simpson, "American Horror Story" vet Sarah Paulson as prosecuting attorney Marcia Clarke and "Friends" star David Schwimmer as defense attorney  Robert Kardashian. But the spinoff prequel, "Better Call Saul," will at least give us a dose of one of our favorite characters in the form of sleazy attorney Saul Goodman, played masterfully by Bob Odenkirk. Can you see Cuba Gooding Jr. playing O.J. Simpson? Marvel already owns the new year with "Avengers: Age of Ultron" and "Ant-Man" hitting theaters in  the summer, ABC's "Marvel's Agent Carter" on the small screen in January and Netflix's "Marvel's A.K.A. Jessica Jones" later in 2015. 'American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson' Pretty much everything Ryan Murphy touches for FX turns to gold, so it will be interesting to see how his miniseries fares.
