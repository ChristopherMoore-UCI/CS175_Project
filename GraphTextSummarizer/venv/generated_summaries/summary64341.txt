Palin critics will find some of their worst assumptions about the former governor reinforced by McGinniss; Palin defenders will be outraged. "Mr. McGinniss's most quotable, inflammatory lines call Ms. Palin a clown, a nitwit, a rabid wolf and a lap dancer -- and those aren't the parts that assail her as a wife and parent. McGinniss also cites unnamed friends in characterizing Palin as a subpar mother. "I'm not saying Todd and Sarah Palin today abuse cocaine or even use it, but there is no question they both did at one point in their lives," McGinniss told NBC. The "Doonesbury" story line has Hedley's boss at Fox News warning him to protect fellow Fox contributor Palin in his coverage of the book, and Hedley tweeting misleading depictions of the real excerpts.
