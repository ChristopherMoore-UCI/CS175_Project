The ministry cited data on retail sales and unemployment in the United States, industrial production in Europe and on Asian exports for the weaker outlook. The Ministry of Trade and Industry said it expected a GDP reduction of between 2 and 5 percent this year. The global financial crisis led to a "significant decline in fund management and stock broking activities in the second half of 2008," and a sharper downturn was expected in 2009, the ministry said. Singapore's economy grew by 1.2 percent in 2008, the government said, far lower than its 7.7 percent growth in 2007. The finance minister is expected to deliver the 2009 budget statement on Thursday.
