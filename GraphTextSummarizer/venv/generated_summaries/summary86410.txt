While McQuaid has denied all knowledge of Armstrong's activities, both he and the UCI have come in for criticism following the publication of a hugely detrimental report from the USADA last October. When pushed by CNN on whether the UCI covered up suspicious samples from Armstrong, McQuaid replied: "No. It follows a catalog of perceived errors by the UCI, including the acceptance of a $100,000 donation from Armstrong in 2002 -- four years before McQuaid took up his role. "The UCI wasn't the only anti-doping agency, so to speak, who was testing Armstrong. But its failure to catch Armstrong remains an albatross around its neck -- despite McQuaid vehemently insisting his organization is not to blame.
