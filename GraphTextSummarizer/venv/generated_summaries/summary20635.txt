The iPhone 5C gives Apple an affordable phone for those that it has yet to lure into buying an iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. -- For the first time, Apple has launched not one, but two iPhones at its now-annual iPhone launch event. More importantly, they will open the iPhone to a global audience that is looking for its first smartphone, especially in the new markets like China and Japan. As the rumors predicted, Apple has split its phone line into a premium all singing, all dancing flagship phone for the early tech adopters and one that will play to the so-called "budget" crowd looking for an iPhone with a more colourful, youthful approach. In the hand, it feels great and very much akin to the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS we all raved about over five years ago.
