, the Hyatt Regency's atmospheric, antiques-filled 28 Hubin Road (dinner for two $66) serves classic Hangzhou fare, such as beggar's chicken and Dongpo rou -- a fork-tender pork dish named after the city's 11th-century poet Su Dongpo. A 25-minute drive away, Banyan Tree Hangzhou (doubles from $550) abuts the 2,800-acre Xixi National Wetland Park. A number of restaurants offer views of West Lake, but West Lake One (dinner for two $45) stands out with its covered terrace and extensive menu featuring dishes from throughout China. Tip: Beyond West Lake, Hangzhou is a sprawling city. Close by, on the edge of the verdant, waterway-filled Xixi National Wetland Park, the National Wetland Museum (free admission) will open an Arata Isozaki --designed viewing platform later this year.
