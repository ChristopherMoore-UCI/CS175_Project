Freudenberg apparently misled his company's communications center that he had adequate fuel for the mission, radioing from the hospital that he had 45 minutes of fuel when he had only 30 minutes. Asked by NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman if Freudenberg could have been mistaken, investigators responded, "We do not believe so." Freudenberg, a former Army helicopter pilot who served in Iraq, had worked for the company just under a year, and probably wanted to avoid revealing that he had taken off with inadequate fuel, which is a violation of FAA regulations, investigators said. The NTSB said other factors leading to the crash included the pilot's inability to perform a crucial flight maneuver known as autorotation after he ran out of fuel. Because of those distractions, Freudenberg missed two opportunities to detect that his helicopter did not have sufficient fuel for his mission, investigators said. His actions could re-write the rules on when pilots can send private messages or make personal phone calls.
