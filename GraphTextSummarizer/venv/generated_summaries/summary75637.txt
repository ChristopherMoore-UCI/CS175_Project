-- For table tennis players Pam Fontaine and Tara Profitt, competing at the London 2012 Paralympics marks the climax of a remarkable journey. Profitt is accompanied on the trip to London by her husband, Matt -- who was introduced to her by Fontaine when they were all students at Wright State University, in Dayton. The idea had an added piquancy because it was Fontaine who had first introduced Profitt to table tennis -- also known as ping pong -- at the Ohio college where they met in 1983. They retired from the game to concentrate on other aspects of life -- in Fontaine's case, on her first love, wheelchair basketball. Fontaine is aware of how much things have changed for Paralympic athletes over the years.
