Chris Walla, left, and Nick Harmer of indie band Death Cab for Cutie discuss their newly released EP. -- Death Cab for Cutie, the Grammy-nominated indie band that shot to the top of the Billboard charts with its latest album, "Narrow Stairs," has come a long way since its basement-recording beginnings in Bellingham, Washington. We do this because music totally moves us in a complete and absolute sort of way. " Death Cab for Cutie, which is named after a song performed by the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band in the 1967 Beatles film "Magical Mystery Tour," released "The Open Door EP" last month. Together for more than 10 years and formed while its members attended Western Washington University, the band has six studio albums behind them, their songs have graced popular TV and film soundtracks, and their sell-out tours have brought the musicians all over the globe.
