The revelation that Catherine was pregnant came after she was admitted to a London hospital in December for acute morning sickness. She and Prince William announced at the start of the year that the baby was due in July, but did not announce the date. The baby will be third in line to the throne after Prince Charles and Prince William, regardless of gender. Britain's Telegraph newspaper reports that a contingency plan is in place for Catherine to give birth at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, if she goes into labor while staying at her parents' home in Berkshire, and its swift progress means the journey back to London is impractical. The Duchess of Cambridge is expected, however, to give birth at the private Lindo wing of St. Mary's Hospital, next to Paddington Station in London.
