Russia emerged as genuine contenders for football's European crown with a thumping 4-1 win over Czech Republic after co-hosts Poland and 2004 champions Greece had opened the tournament with a dramatic 1-1 draw in Warsaw. Co-hosts Poland looked to be cruising to their first-ever European Championship finals victory when Borussia Dortmund striker Lewandowski headed home Jakub Blaszczykowski's cross, with Greece keeper Kostas Chalkias stuck in no-man's land. Russia, who reached the semi-finals of Euro 2008 under Guus Hiddink, next face co-hosts Poland, who saw Robert Lewandowski's first-half header cancelled out by Greece substitute Dimitris Salpingidis' second-half goal in Warsaw. Both sides had a player sent off - Sokratis Papastathopoulos for Greece and Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny -- before the Arsenal goalkeeper's replacement Przemyslaw Tyton emerged as the hero by saving a penalty from Giorgos Karagounis. " Czech Republic coach Michal Bilek admitted his side had struggled to cope with the Russians' forward movement and link-up play.
