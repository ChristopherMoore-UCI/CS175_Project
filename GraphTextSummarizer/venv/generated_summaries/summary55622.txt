Then later Sunday, the First Deputy Speaker of Libya's interim parliament, Ezzedin al-Awami, announced that the vote naming Mitig as interim PM was invalid. Initial reports indicated the country's General National Congress elected businessman Ahmad Mitig as interim prime minister Sunday. Meanwhile, other parliament members insisted the vote on Mitig was legal and that he was rightfully elected interim Prime Minister. Mitig was sworn in after reportedly receiving 121 votes in a volatile debate in the GNC that included multiple votes. Al-Thinni, the country's former defense minister, was chosen by parliament to temporarily take over for acting Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, who was voted out by parliament in March.
