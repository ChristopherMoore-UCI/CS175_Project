Two goals in injury time by striker Giampaolo Pazzini ensured Inter stay in touch with their city rivals, closing the gap to five points until Sunday at least, when Milan host mid-table Bologna. Inter Milan did all they could to keep the pressure up on Serie A leaders AC Milan as they beat lowly Cesena 2-1. In Saturday's other game third-placed Napoli kept up the pressure on Inter with a 1-0 win over Genoa -- Slovak midfielder Marek Hamsik with the goal seven minutes before the final whistle. The result means Napoli remain a point behind Inter in the table whilst extending their lead over fourth-placed Lazio who host Juventus on Monday evening. Cesena took the lead after 56 minutes thanks to Croatian striker Igor Budan and, as the finals minutes ticked down, looked to have claimed three vital points.
