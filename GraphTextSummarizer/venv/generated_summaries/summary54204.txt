the proper answer to this would have been LOL -- "laughing out loud" -- because in reality, texting is sprouting new grammar all the time. Or an exchange such as "LOL theres only one slice left" / "don't deprive me LOL" -- text exchanges often drip with these LOL's the way normal writing drips with commas. LOL is one of several texting expressions that convey nuance in a system where you don't have the voice and face to do it the way you normally would. LOL is, of all things, grammar. -- or sometimes even just a single one, roughly: "Msehn?" It, too, is now a piece of grammar, soliciting the same sense of empathy and group membership that LOL does.
