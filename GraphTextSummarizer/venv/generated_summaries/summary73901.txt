Muslim women do not need the West to tell them that inequality and second-class status for women are unacceptable. The inability to drive creates a host of practical problems for Saudi women -- problems that make them even more beholden to the whims of men. Saudi women chafe under many rules. Nobody, however, has gained the fame of Malala, whose call for girls to receive an education crossed the line for those who think women should remain subservient, with society under the full control of men. The extraordinary displays of courage from women challenging restrictions on their lives include the case of Malala Yousafzai -- the Pakistani girl who nearly died after Taliban gunmen shot her in the face -- and other young girls, like Yemen's Nujood Ali, divorced at the age of 10 and now a campaigner against child marriage, and thousands of others.
