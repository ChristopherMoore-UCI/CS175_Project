-- Former Nazi death camp guard and onetime Ohio Demjanjuk, 91, was found guilty last May in a German court of assisting in mass murder as a guard at the Nazi-run Sobibor death camp in German-occupied Poland, and sentenced to five years in prison. He was convicted in an Israeli court in 1988 and sentenced to death, but that conviction was overturned in 1993 amid evidence that someone else was "Ivan the Terrible." The accusations against Demjanjuk date to the late 1970s, when the U.S. Justice Department accused him of being a Nazi guard known as "Ivan the Terrible." The Ukraine native, who moved to the U.S. after World War II, raised a family and worked in the auto industry in Ohio, was finally extradited from the United States in 2009 to face trial following a long legal battle.
