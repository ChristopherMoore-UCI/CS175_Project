Syrian forces and Hezbollah fighters have now turned their focus on retaking Aleppo. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head of al Qaeda in Iraq, may have defied an order from the terror organization's leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, to stop trying to claim control of al-Nusra. In the recording, al-Baghdadi said al Qaeda in Iraq and the al-Nusra Front will operate as one, under the title "The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant." The recording follows a statement released this month by al-Zawahiri that said al Qaeda in Iraq and al-Nusra will operate as separate entities with separate leadership. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said any attempt to enforce a no-fly zone over Syria using F-16 fighter jets and Patriot missiles from Jordan would violate international law, according to Russian state broadcaster Russia Today.
