Tiger Woods, a 14-time major champion, will attempt to reverse a run of poor form which has seen him slide to 30th in the world when the 35-year-old starts his challenge alongside previous winners Davis Love III (1997) and Padraig Harrington (2008). Former world number one, and current number two, Lee Westwood will also be in search of his maiden major win, and the Briton will play with world number 11 Matt Kuchar and Australia's Jason Day. World number one Luke Donald, bidding to clinch his first major championship, will play alongside Spaniard Alvaro Quiros and American Nick Watney. Clarke, the winner of July's British Open, and fellow Northern Irishman McIlroy, who claimed the U.S. Open, will tee off with Masters champion Schwartzel for the final golf major of the year -- which is set to begin on Thursday. Graeme McDowell, the 2010 U.S. Open winner will begin the first two rounds with 2007 Masters champion Zach Johnson and Australian Geoff Oglivy -- who was claimed the U.S. Open in 2006.
