The news ballooned on Thursday morning when the conservative Weekly Standard cited the radio station in a post, the influential Drudge Report linked to the story and the anti-Clinton super PAC America Rising blasted an email to reporters about Clinton's "army of Secret Service agents, paid for at taxpayer expense." Hillary Clinton did not have 65 Secret Service agents protecting her in Canada on Wednesday, a Secret Service source told CNN, despite a report from a Canadian radio station to the contrary. When Clinton is traveling for speaking engagements and events, her personal protection is regularly increased by local agents. Because Clinton is a former first lady and secretary of state, she regularly travels with a cadre of agents who protect her wherever she goes. News Talk 980 CJME, a local radio station in Saskatoon, reported on Wednesday night that a security supervisor from the venue hosting Clinton said "approximately 65 agents" were in house to protect the former first lady.
