As a result, young men are hair-trigger sensitive to their circumstances, and when the number of men who will never find a mate rises, so does the intensity of the striving. When a society allows powerful men to take several wives, too few women remain for many poor men to take even a single wife. This story of the Nien Rebellion foreshadows one of the biggest issues that China will face in coming decades: the dramatic excess of young men. Over millions of years of evolution, large numbers of women and even larger numbers of men left no offspring at all. Outlaw bands, known as nien, attracted young men in unprecedented numbers, aggregating into militias that wrought chaos on the troops and infrastructure of the ruling Qing.
