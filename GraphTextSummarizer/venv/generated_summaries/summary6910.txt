Deep in the untouched areas of Ukraine and Russia live men who have decided to leave human establishments and live isolated in nature. Photographer Danila Tkachenko tracked some of them down by calling local authorities, park rangers, newspapers and nature reserves, though it's difficult to track down a man who has chosen to be lost. If they fall ill, Tkachenko said, they live with the condition or treat themselves with folk methods. Tkachenko grew up in a city but has always been drawn to nature. He chose to shoot on film because it draws less attention and because some of the religious hermits do not like digital technology, he said.
