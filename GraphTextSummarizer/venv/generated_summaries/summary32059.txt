This undermined growth opportunities for many local industries and led to the closure of several African clothing factories, say experts. Yet Brooks claims the figure is an underestimation, largely because of the widespread smuggling of used clothes that occurs in many countries, as well as trans-shipments that are not documented in official statistics. "So if you ban second-hand clothing sometimes this gets replaced with imports of clothing from China or elsewhere in the Far East. A large portion of these previously owned clothes ends up in market stalls across Africa -- according to an Oxfam report, used garments account for over 50% of the clothing sector by volume in many sub-Saharan African countries. Whilst exact continent-wide figures are hard to come by, global used clothing exports from OECD countries stood at $1.9 billion in 2009, according to 2011 U.N. Comtrade data.
