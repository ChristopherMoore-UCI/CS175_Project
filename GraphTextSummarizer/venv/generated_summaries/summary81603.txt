Meanwhile, a CNN/ORC International Poll last week put Cruz as the choice of 4% of likely Republican voters. This is exactly the kind of coalition of youthful Christian idealists Cruz must win over and get to work in early voting states if his presidential hopes are to catch fire.

Rick Santorum and Dr. Ben Carson to win evangelicals -- a tough task.
