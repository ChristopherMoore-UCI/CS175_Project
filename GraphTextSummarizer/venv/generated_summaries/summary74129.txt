"It's our belief that after the investigation by the state and DCFS (the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services) is concluded, Andre Curry will be vindicated," said assistant public defender Anand Sundaram. Andre Curry, 21, is charged with aggravated domestic battery, which is a felony, Chicago police said. Curry has no history of child abuse and the girl has not shown injuries, Sundaram said, adding that the family is cooperating in the investigation. If that's the case, he said, prosecutors could at most seek a charge of misdemeanor battery. With the photo "going viral on the Internet, things may have been blown out of proportion," Sundaram said.
