When asked whether the BRIC label would bring with it a huge degree of international investment interest for South Africa, O'Neill remained cautious. In December 2010, following the BRIC nations' invitation, South Africa's minister of international relations and cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane said: "The rationale for South Africa's approach was in consideration of a matter of crucial importance to BRIC's member states -- namely the role of emerging economies in advancing the restructuring of the global political, economic and financial architecture into one that is more equitable, balanced and rests on the important pillar of multilateralism." O'Neill said: "South Africa has played on the notion that because they do have developed markets and Western governing standards in some areas they've said 'look, we are the gateway to the rest of Africa.'" The BRIC partnership took a new turn last December when its four members invited South Africa to join them at their third heads-of-states summit, to be held in Beijing this month. "At this particular point in time, just because South Africa has been accepted into that club doesn't change the way that I'll think about it in terms of how we focus on what constitutes a BRIC or not and whether it affects others in terms of investment flows.
