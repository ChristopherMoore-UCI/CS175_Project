Flash floods from torrential rains over the past three days have killed 15 people and displaced more than 20,000 others in Pakistan's Balochistan province, Abdul Katif Kakar, the director of planning for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said Monday. And in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, flood waters have receded, and people are cleaning up mud and debris and assessing damage to their properties and businesses. In Jhal Magsi, one of the worst-affected areas, 27 villages have been overwhelmed, forcing thousands of people to flee to shelter on higher ground in deserted mountainous areas. Monsoon rains and flash flooding continue to bring misery to people living in Khuzdar, Jhal Magsi and Loralai districts. He said two people were missing in Lasbella district, feared to have been swept away by flood waters.
