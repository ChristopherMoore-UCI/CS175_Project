"Every layoff letter has a name, and every name has a story," Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said in an interview with CNN. With a workforce of some 200,000, Puerto Rico, with a population of about 4 million, has more public employees than any state in the union, with the exception of California and New York, McClintock said. To cut spending, Puerto Rico announced last month that thousands of government employees would be fired in the second round of layoffs this year. Puerto Rico is "still the pharmaceutical capital of the world, but we have to try to manufacture even more Tylenol to resolve our economic headaches," McClintock said. Thousands last week protest government layoffs in Puerto Rico.
