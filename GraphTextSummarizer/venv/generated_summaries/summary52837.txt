U.S. officials have long insisted their goal is to make sure that Iran doesn't develop nuclear weapons. It describes efforts by Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer to lobby U.S. lawmakers before an interim agreement with Iran in November 2013 and briefings by Dermer and other Israeli officials in the early months of this year. It is another thing for Israel to steal U.S. secrets and play them back to U.S. legislators to undermine U.S. diplomacy," a senior U.S. official briefed on the matter said, according to the newspaper. The Israeli leader predicted that not only would such a deal not stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons, it would "all but guarantee that Iran gets (nuclear) weapons, lots of them. That's not to say Israeli officials haven't been asking around about the Iran nuclear talks, as participating parties race to get a framework agreement ahead of a March 31 deadline.
