Amerson was inspired by the global art project "Inside Out" started by Parisian photographer JR, who wanted to get people talking about social issues like poverty, hunger and homelessness through large wall postings. Amerson conceptualized the community art project Appetite 4 ART, which combines food with images of iconic films, musicals and TV shows to get people talking about hunger and poverty. Bill Shore, founder and CEO of the national hunger nonprofit Share Our Strength, said organizations need to get creative to get people to pay attention to hunger and poverty, perennial issues. Looking for an edgy way to raise awareness about poverty and hunger in the local community, the group turned to CNN iReporter James Amerson, a photographer and long-time friend of many of the board members of the nonprofit. Images like Marie Antoinette savagely biting into a blood-red slice of red velvet or Marilyn Monroe trying to hold down a white dress of splashing milk are meant to provoke people to question the message behind them, said Amerson, who served as creative director.
