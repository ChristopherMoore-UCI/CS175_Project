The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility Thursday for a suicide bombing outside a police station in northwestern Pakistan that left at least 25 people dead, saying it was part of a series of attacks to avenge the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. The district is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, not far from the border with Afghanistan. In a phone call to CNN, Taliban spokesman Ihsan Ullah Ihsan said Pakistani security forces and government officials are killing innocent mujahedeen and "we will take revenge from them by killing their loved ones, as we did in Thursday's attack. " At least 56 people were injured in the explosion, which happened near local law-enforcement and court buildings, said Abdul Rasheed, the police chief of Hangu district. Several al Qaeda-affiliated groups have vowed to launch attacks in retaliation.
