Peter Jackson's latest Middle-earth adventure The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug earned $73.6 million in its opening weekend, marking a 13 percent drop from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey's $84.6 million bow in December 2012. Smaug notched the fourth-best December opening weekend ever, after An Unexpected Journey, I Am Legend ($77.2 million), and Avatar ($77 million), and although it undercut its predecessor's debut, Warner Bros., who co-financed the film with MGM for about $225 million, can't be too disappointed with the result. At the same point in its run, Tangled had earned $115 million en route to a $200 million finish â€” and that film is a perfect comparison since it also opened wide over Thanksgiving weekend. Even if Smaug can't match those figures (if it plays like Journey, it's headed for $263 million domestically), it will be a hugely profitable venture for the studio. In order to differentiate it from the first Hobbit, Warner Bros. marketed The Desolation of Smaug by focusing heavily on Evangeline Lilly's elvish character, Tauriel, who didn't appear in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, as well as Orlando Bloom's Legolas, who returned for the prequels, and Benedict Cumberbatch as the voice of Smaug.
