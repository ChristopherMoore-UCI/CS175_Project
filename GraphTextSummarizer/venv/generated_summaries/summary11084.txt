Gunmen opened fire at buses carrying students and soccer players in southern Mexico. Along a dirt road in a remote part of Mexico's Guerrero state, authorities turned up unmarked graves full of human remains on Saturday. A bus carrying members of the third division Chilpancingo Hornets soccer club was also among those ambushed in what authorities described as three attacks on September 26. Investigators found the remains of at least 28 people inside the graves, Guerrero State Attorney General IÃ±aky Blanco Cabrera told reporters Sunday. State prosecutors first said last week that the violence started after the college students commandeered three buses, and city police opened fire.
