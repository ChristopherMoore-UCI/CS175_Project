One critic of the Rhode Island plan said giving parents a outlet for petty complaints "opens up a can of worms. The council would act as mediator in disputes between parents of youth athletes and sports officials. But the parents are the biggest problem, said Matt Rodrigues, general manager and owner of Teamworks youth sports program in Warwick, Rhode Island. The bill cites the need for a third party to step in at times, stating that "parents lack a proper outlet to share concerns and objections about youth sports." -- An overcompetitive parent gets into an argument with a stubborn coach because he thinks his child isn't getting enough playing time -- it's a familiar scene on youth sports fields across America.
