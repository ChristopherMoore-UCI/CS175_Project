A daring raid by U.S. and Yemeni forces into an al Qaeda stronghold in Yemen freed eight hostages, but not before kidnappers stole away with some Westerners, including an American. While the Yemeni version does not mention U.S. involvement, an American official confirmed to CNN that U.S. Special Forces were part of the raid team. They told the rescue team that two days earlier, kidnappers had moved five others, including an American, a Briton, a South African and a Yemeni. The mission was planned after al Qaeda militants were seen transferring hostages "chained and covered with blankets" into pickups that were driven to a cave about 68 miles (109 kilometers) from Hajir al-Saiyer, according to the website. The raid took place Monday, according to an American official and information posted on a Yemini website associated with the country's Defense Ministry.
