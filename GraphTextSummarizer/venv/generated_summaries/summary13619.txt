Green energy not only reduces the risks of such devastating spills and leaks but -- an important bonus --  according to studies, green energy production actually creates more jobs than fossil fuel energy production. That is a terrible risk to bear for a pipeline that many experts believe will simply pump a lot of Canadian crude oil over United States soil in order to be processed and sold internationally and which will actually increase the domestic price of oil in America, according to a study by Cornell University and a report by Bloomberg news. The storage site has been closed since the Valentine's Day leak, but just this week, officials reported that more airborne radiation has been detected in southeastern New Mexico. And yet for people along the Mississippi River or in southeastern New Mexico or throughout West Virginia, the disaster doesn't go away. In addition to strengthening EPA oversight, we must seriously invest in green energy and new fuel technologies.
