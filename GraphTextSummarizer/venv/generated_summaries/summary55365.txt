Thanks to huge critical kudos (including Lawrence's Oscar win for Best Actress) that movie eventually grossed $132.1 million â€” a number that's certainly in American Hustle's sights considering the film's intense Oscar buzz and guaranteed exposure at the Golden Globes, where it's nominated for seven awards, including Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy. (The movie has already garnered Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture, Musical or Comedy and Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy). Earlier this year, the actor's The Great Gatsby made $50.1 million in its opening weekend in May. The Wolf of Wall Street -- $18.5 million Outside the top five, the weekend's biggest story was Universal's 47 Ronin, the long-delayed, $175 million Keanu Reeves samurai epic that grossed just $9.9 million over the three-day weekend, bringing its five-day total to $20.6 million. But the weekend's lowest scoring wide-release belonged to Justin Bieber, whose concert doc Believe took in a mere $2 million.
