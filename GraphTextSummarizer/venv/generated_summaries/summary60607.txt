The spacewalk outside the International Space Station was planned to last for six and a half hours, but ended after one hour and 32 minutes, said NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries. Water observed pooling inside an astronaut's helmet was reason enough for NASA to cut short a spacewalk Tuesday morning. Cassidy told mission control that Parmitano said the water didn't taste like normal drinking water, Humphries said. Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano and U.S. astronaut Chris Cassidy were to install backup power equipment to critical station components and prepare cables for a new laboratory module that is due to arrive later this year, NASA said. Both astronauts were called back into the station after they and mission control personnel noticed what appeared to be water pooling inside Parmitano's space suit, Humphries said.
