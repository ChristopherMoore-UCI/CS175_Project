This week, the Supreme Court, on the eve of early voting, ruled that efforts by Ohio Republicans to restrict early voting days were acceptable. It ended convenient voting hours, when Ohioans could vote after a long day at work -- as late as 9 p.m. It also ended voting on one of the two Sundays before Election Day when many folks head to their polling place after church. And in Georgia, a GOP legislator lamented a county's move to expand early voting, saying he would "prefer more educated voters" over black early voters. And unfortunately it's not just Ohio where Republicans have doggedly tried to restrict or cut early voting days or hours. In North Carolina, the Republican governor and legislature took away a week of early voting.
