The United Nations called for an immediate end to fighting between the Bafuliru and Barundi/Banyamulenge communities in the province of South Kivu. Martin Kobler, the chief of the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo, said troops would be deployed to Mutarule to assist the Congolese army and local officials. Government troops have also battled rebel groups such as M23, which was defeated in November. At least 15 people were wounded in Friday's unrest, part of ongoing violence in this area of the country, the United Nations said. Eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region, has been at the center of a political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda, for two decades.
