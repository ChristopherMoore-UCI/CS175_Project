Seth's father said that Seth will have heart surgery in February to have a shunt replaced. The Petreikises told CNN that because Seth's surgery is covered in full now, all of the money will be going to a foundation to get the procedure deemed non-experimental so that other families and children can be helped. After having an open heart surgery at about 2 Â½ weeks, doctors diagnosed Seth with Complete DiGeorge Syndrome, a rare disease that leaves him with no immune system. Bruce said that MDwise came to a decision to cover Seth's transplant mid-day Friday. The family set up a website and bank account asking for donations to help them afford Seth's surgery.
