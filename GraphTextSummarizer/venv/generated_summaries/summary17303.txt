Military apparel migrated to civilian life centuries ago, when veterans realized uniforms invited attributions of reliability, discipline and heroism and when various civil institutions used them as a means of regulating groups of people. And unlike the Vietnam War, when military uniforms were appropriated in anti-war protests, today's military looks are part of a sartorial status quo that subtly affirms a pro-soldier, pro-military message. Fashion designers promote military styles as cutting edge, but usually refute the notion that the military aesthetic has anything to do with real war. Fashion critics long have charged that military fashions are a problem because they aestheticize war and divorce clothes from their true functions and origins. Men's clothing strongly has been influenced by military looks, and the fashion industry markets "military chic" to women as well.
