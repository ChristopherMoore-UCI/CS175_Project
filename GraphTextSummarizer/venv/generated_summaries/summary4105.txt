The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. -- Fighting flared in Yemen's volatile south Saturday, as security forces -- backed by armed tribesmen -- battled Islamic militants in the region, eyewitnesses said. " Government troops have been battling both anti-government tribal forces and Islamic militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Hundreds of tribesmen joined the fight in the town of Zinjibar, vowing to stand strong until Islamic militants leave Abyan province. Government spokesman Abdu Ganadi said Saturday that all Yemenis should put their differences aside and focus on one enemy, referring to the suspected al Qaeda militants.
