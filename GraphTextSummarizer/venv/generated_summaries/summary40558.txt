In the end, three homes were flattened and about 70 others were damaged, the Red Cross told CNN affiliate KIII. KIII news anchors, in the studio nearly two miles away from the blast site, were in the middle of their live morning newscast Friday when they -- and their viewers -- heard a loud boom. They were first taken to a local hospital and then flown to the burn unit at San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center, according to the Corpus Christi Fire Department. "I woke up and my ears were ringing," Phillips told KIII. An early morning explosion Friday shook the area, sparking a fire that rushed through the neighborhood.
