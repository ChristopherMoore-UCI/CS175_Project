The U.S. team, dubbed the "Fab Five," carries the pressure of bringing home America's first team gold medal since the "Magnificent Seven" did so at the 1996 games. There was a surprise for the U.S. gymnastics team when Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas finished ahead of world champion Jordyn Wieber in the all-around competition qualifying round. The U.S. held the lead for three of the four legs, but Yannick Agnel caught Ryan Lochte just after the turn and pulled away at the end. Meanwhile, the London organizing committee said Sunday that security workers who have completed their shifts will be able to sit in vacant seats. U.S. marathoner Desiree Davila also dropped out of the August 5 race with a leg injury.
