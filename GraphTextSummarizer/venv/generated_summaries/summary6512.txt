"Abu Dhabi, Masdar and Solar Impulse have in common a pioneering spirit, a long-term vision and a desire to explore new horizons," said Dr. Sultan Ahmad Al Jaber, Masdar's chairman, and the UAE minister of state, also in an official statement, adding: "We share a commitment to foster the development of technological advances in alternative energy sources in order to contribute to a cleaner, more sustainable future." "This well-matched partnership will show Abu Dhabi to be a center of expertise when it comes to renewable energy," said Piccard in an official statement. " Masdar, Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company, is also a partner in the project, and will help the Solar Impulse team train and test the aircraft before it takes to the skies. "At the same time, Solar Impulse will demonstrate the far-reaching applications of clean energy during the first solar-powered flight around the world. A single-seater plane fitted with 12,000 solar cells and four electrically-powered propellers, it was also the first aircraft powered by renewable energy that could fly non-stop for 24 hours.
