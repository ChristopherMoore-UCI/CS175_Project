"This is a very precisely drafted and narrowly drafted bill," said UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh. There are other potential holes, such as when images are distributed for bragging rights or money instead of revenge. "It does require intent to cause serious emotional distress," Volokh said of the bill. Advocate Holly Jacobs, a graduate student in Florida, began pushing for stronger laws after naked photos and videos of her were posted online that she had shared with an ex-boyfriend while they were together. In California, very few variations of revenge are already covered under state law.
