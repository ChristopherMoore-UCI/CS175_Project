Both as symbol and in substance, Guantanamo thus remains a gaping wound in U.S. credibility. Still, there is a degree of speculation as to whether the Taliban prisoners -- after long years in Guantanamo away from their comrades -- will necessarily return to their old ways. With U.S. forces in Afghanistan set to wind down to only 10,000 by the end of 2014, and to leave the country altogether by the end of 2016, U.S. leverage to secure his release was steadily diminishing. But the Taliban need no incentives to try to capture U.S. service members. The U.S. can make deals to secure the return of prisoners without relinquishing our general policy of not negotiating with terrorists.
