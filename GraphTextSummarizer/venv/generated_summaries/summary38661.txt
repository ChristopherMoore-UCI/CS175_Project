McNair, 36, and Sahel Kazemi, 20, were found fatally shot in a condominium in downtown Nashville on Saturday afternoon, authorities said. He said Kazemi had seen another person leave the condo a few days before and was concerned "whether or not her relationship was unraveling with Mr. McNair." The girlfriend of former NFL star Steve McNair first shot him in his right temple, then fired three more shots at close range, most likely as he slept, police said Wednesday. "McNair was seated on the sofa and likely was asleep, and we believe that Kazemi shot him in the right temple, then shot him twice in the chest, and then shot him a final time in the left temple," Serpas said. The coroner said he will not finalize the "manner of death" on Kazemi's death certificate until he has final lab test results, which are a few days away.
