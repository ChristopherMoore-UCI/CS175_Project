Fleet of foot, she makes light work of massive mountains such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn -- running with a permanent smile etched across her face -- because for Forsberg this truly is a labor of love. Forsberg is also aware that the majority of the competitors in Skyrunning mountain races are men and she likes to strike a feminine chord. She tries out her efforts on her boyfriend Kilian Jornet, who just happens to be the the dominant male competitor on the world Skyrunning circuit with a string of big race victories and records. And for Forsberg, her idea of a perfect day is most people's idea of purgatory: an eight-hour run on mountain trails at high altitude. "I have always been fascinated about mountains, the views and just the freedom you get there, and when I was finished high school I moved to the mountains and I just started to train there," Forsberg says.
