After letting her 7-year-old son walk from their home to a park to play, a Florida mother faces up to five years in jail for child neglect. " A number of child neglect arrests are gaining attention nationwide, with some onlookers arguing local authorities are overstepping bounds in arresting parents for childrearing decisions that wouldn't have merited notice a generation ago or which plunge families close to the poverty line into even more dire situations. "They asked me a couple questions, and I got scared, so I ran off to the park and they called the cops," Dominic Guerrisi told CNN affiliate WPTV. Do you think authorities are simply doing their job by arresting parents who let young children go places alone, or are they overreacting? In March, Shanesha Taylor was arrested in Scottsdale, Arizona, on two counts of felony child abuse after leaving her two children in her Dodge Durango for about an hour while she interviewed for a job.
