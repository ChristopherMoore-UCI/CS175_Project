Right off the bat, we need to remember that the Affordable Care Act makes significant cuts to future Medicare spending. The payment advisory board gets going in 2014, and in just its first five years, it's expected to reduce spending for all Medicare programs by more than $23 billion (PDF). He believes that the chances for passing anything that might reduce spending on health care in the future are near zero. Even so, many believe that this will eventually be one of the strongest levers the Affordable Care Act contains to rein in spending in the future. Running against Medicare cuts helped sweep the Republicans into power in the House of Representatives in 2010.
