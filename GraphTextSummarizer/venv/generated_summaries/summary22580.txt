-- Former world No. 1 Jelena Jankovic overcame current top-ranked player Serena Williams in an epic clash to reach the final of the Italian Open on Friday. She won minor clay tournaments in Colombia and Sweden last year, and lost in the final in Barcelona the year before. Martinez-Sanchez has played Jankovic only twice, winning on hardcourt in 2001 when the Serbian retired hurt and losing on clay last year in the Fed Cup teams event. Her 27-year-old opponent followed up her own upset win over world No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki on Wednesday by reaching her third WTA Tour final. Rome triumph in what was her first tournament since winning the Australian Open in late January, injuring her knee in doing so.
