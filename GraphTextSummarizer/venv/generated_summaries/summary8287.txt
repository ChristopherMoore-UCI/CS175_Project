"The Colbert Report" won outstanding variety series and for variety series writing, also beating a perennial winner, "The Daily Show. Bryan Cranston, who was tabbed for outstanding lead actor in a drama, lost to "The Newsroom's" Jeff Daniels. As host Neil Patrick Harris said at one point, "This just in: Nobody in America is winning their Emmy office pool."
