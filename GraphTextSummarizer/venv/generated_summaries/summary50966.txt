No word on where "23 Jump Street" will take place, but if "22 Jump Street's" closing credits are any indication, they have plenty of choices. At the end of "22 Jump Street" -- a sequel that made fun of the concept of sequels -- the film cheekily proposed humorous possibilities for yet another follow-up. The first film starred Hill and Tatum as cops who went undercover at a high school; the second placed them at a college. Neal Moritz and stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are also producing. Deadline also reports that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who directed "22," are overseeing the process but haven't decided whether they'll return to direct.
