"At first, he (my husband) thought it was a lunatic ninja," said Ettlin's wife, Verity Beman. Ettlin and his family were woken early Sunday when a 6-foot-tall kangaroo crashed through a window, landed on their bed and thrashed around their house in the suburb of Garran, south of the capital of Canberra, Australia. He knew that kangaroos carry their strength on their hind legs, Beman said. It's only a kangaroo," Beman recalled. The kangaroo jumped on top of the blanket that Beman and her 9-year-old daughter were hiding under.
