Referring to alleged voting manipulation by Mugabe supporters, Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, said it was encouraged by a large turnout. -- Vote-counting in Zimbabwe's hotly contested election began late Wednesday with President Robert Mugabe and main challenger Morgan Tsvangirai confident of victory. Five presidential candidates are in the race including Mugabe and Tsvangirai, the current prime minister. Makarau dismissed allegations from Tsvangirai's party that the election commission rigged the polls for Mugabe. The vote will end an uneasy coalition government formed after violence broke out when Mugabe claimed victory over Tsvangirai in the last election five years ago.
