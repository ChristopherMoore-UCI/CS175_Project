Forecasters expected the storm to bring up to a foot of snow to parts of eastern Kansas, Missouri and Illinois a day after plastering southern Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. That means areas hit with snow Tuesday won't see accumulations like portions of Texas, northwest Oklahoma and southern Kansas got Monday. In Shawnee, Kansas, the roof of a horse arena collapsed under the weight of snow Tuesday morning, CNN affiliate KSHB reported. But to the west, piling snow damaged buildings Tuesday in Kansas and Missouri. The bulk of the outages -- 45,000 -- were in the Kansas City region straddling the border between Kansas and Missouri.
