Paul Johnson said then that he expected prosecutors to seek death for Eric Williams, but "was not so sure" about what they would do regarding his client. That was partially answered Friday, in a brief hearing at the same Kaufman County courthouse where Eric Williams had been justice of the peace. County Sheriff David Byrnes has previously said the three killings stemmed from Eric Williams' "past legal problems with the criminal justice system of this county," including a 2012 conviction on burglary and theft charges that led to his removal from office. Special prosecutor Toby Shook told CNN that he and his fellow prosecutor, Bill Wirskye, announced in court that they will go for a death sentence against Eric Williams. -- Texas prosecutors said in court Friday they'll seek the death penalty against Eric Williams, a former justice of the peace accused of killing two prosecutors who served in the same county he did.
