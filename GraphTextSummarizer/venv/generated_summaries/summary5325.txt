The second typhoon -- Nalgae -- made landfall in Dinapigue, in Isabela province, on Saturday morning, the disaster council said. Vouchers are being distributed so people can buy needed items, some emergency supplies are being given out directly to citizens and 3,000 Manila children will receive school supplies. Another team is in Bulcan province, most of which is "still submerged" because of Nesat. Sherbien Dacalanio, a CNN iReporter in the Philippines, described one area of Manila as being devastated by Nesat. Typhoon Nalgae, known locally as Quiel, had lost some strength by Sunday morning.
