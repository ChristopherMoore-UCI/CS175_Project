For Hans Brower, the Thai-Dutch design consultant behind the project, The River is a potent symbol of modern Bangkok -- a vibrant metropolis that can offer spectacular accommodation at cheaper rate than other big Asian cities. "The regulations limit what you can do in various places so at the time this site came up it was an opportunity to do something big," said Gerry Healey, who oversees The River for developer Raimon Land. -- When Thai monarch, King Rama, founded Bangkok in the late 18th century, he bestowed upon the bustling waterway that ran through his new capital a title fit for royalty -- "Chao Phraya" (the River of Kings). "The prices that we are asking for here maybe in the higher end of the Bangkok market but by comparison with Singapore or Hong Kong we are very (affordable)," Healy said. "I could earn something already (by selling)," explained said Chaiyot Suriyanonlin, standing outside the humble shop-house that has been in his family's possession for generations.
