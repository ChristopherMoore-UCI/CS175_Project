They said the instigators were from insurgent groups such as al Qaeda, who were planning to escape after creating chaos in the facility. Attempts by CNN to contact police officials in Tikrit to comment on the inmates' allegations were unsuccessful Sunday night. However, two prisoners -- speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid retaliation -- told CNN that the inmates set the fires to protest against ill treatment, poor conditions inside the prison and also against corruption. The riot erupted about 3 p.m. Sunday (8 a.m. ET) at the central prison for Salaheddin province, police officials said. The families of many prisoners are forced to pay prison officers and guards each month so their relatives will receive better treatment, they alleged.
