The largest previous number of tornadoes on record in one event took place from April 3-4, 1974, with 148 tornadoes. SEVERITY --  An EF4 tornado that struck Pleasant Grove, Alabama, was produced by an astounding supercell thunderstorm that began in Newton County, Mississippi, and dissipated in Macon County, North Carolina. The outbreak is also on record as creating the most number of tornadoes in a single day. Meteorologists rely on what is called an "Enhanced Fujita Scale" to rate the severity of tornadoes.
