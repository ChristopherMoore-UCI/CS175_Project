-- Federal prosecutors in Washington are seeking to extradite singer Chris Brown from custody in Los Angeles to stand trial for assault, according to court documents obtained by CNN. D.C. prosecutors request that Brown be transferred to U.S. marshals by April 15, according to court documents. Brown, 24, and body guard Christopher Hollosy are facing assault charges stemming from an incident outside the W hotel in October. CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report. Brown is currently locked up in Los Angeles on a probation violation after he was kicked out of a court-ordered drug rehab program.
