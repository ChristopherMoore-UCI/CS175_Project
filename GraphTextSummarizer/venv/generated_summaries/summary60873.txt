" Deputy Fanning also works as a school resource officer at Lebanon's Sam Houston Elementary, reported CNN affiliate WSMV. In an unusual move, Deputy Fanning told his story in an e-mail he sent to CNN affiliate WKRN. " Wilson County Sheriff Robert Bryan said Fanning had been showing "another person that was there at the house some of his weapons he had locked in a secure gun safe," reported CNN affiliate WTVF. Deputy Fanning and a relative went into a bedroom to look at some of the lawman's guns, said Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm.
