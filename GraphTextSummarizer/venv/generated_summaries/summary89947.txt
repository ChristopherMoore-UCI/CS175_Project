He outlined a number of steps the government had taken this year to prop up the Chinese economy, including tax cuts, interest rate cuts, steady growth in the money supply and stepped up infrastructure investment. Tianjin, China (Financial Times) -- Wen Jiabao, China's premier, has promised Beijing will do more to boost flagging growth in the Chinese economy in the coming months as he delivered a spirited defence of his economic legacy and his decade in power. Mr Wen acknowledged the downturn that has gathered pace in China in recent months. His speech at the World Economic Forum in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin on Tuesday is likely to be his last high-profile appearance on the global stage before he is replaced as the third-most-senior cadre in the Chinese Communist party next month. He is scheduled to step down as premier in March next year.
