"People are personally invested," said Christine Reinolds Kozelle, director of news and editorial services at Berry College. They are unlikely Internet celebrities: two bald eagles tending their young on the campus of Berry College in North Georgia. Thousands of people tuned in last weekend to watch as two tiny eaglets emerged from their carefully-guarded eggs, thanks to a live streaming Eagle Cam installed by the school. Kozelle said there have been over 20 million views since the livestream was set up last year. The eagle pair first appeared on the main campus of Berry College in spring 2012, nesting in a 100-foot pine tree between the main entrance and the athletic center.
