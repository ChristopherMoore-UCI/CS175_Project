Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said. Nassif is a facial plastic surgeon and is not Sheen's medical doctor, Nassif told HLN. "Kind of weird, the phone call I received," Dr. Paul Nassif told the Los Angeles Fire Department dispatcher in the recorded call, which was released by the fire department Wednesday. Nassif, in an interview Tuesday with HLN's "Showbiz Tonight," said he couldn't tell if Sheen, who is his friend, was drunk. Nassif drove Sheen home from the hospital, but he declined to provide details of their conversation.
