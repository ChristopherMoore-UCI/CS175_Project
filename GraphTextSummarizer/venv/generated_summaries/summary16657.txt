Deadspin has the video and offers this background via one of the attendees: "At one point during dinner at a steakhouse, one guy goes to the bathroom downstairs and sees Bill Murray sitting with some people with a fishing vest on," said the partygoer, identified only as Stephen. "We talked to the waiter to see if we could send him some drinks, to which Bill declined. "One of my buddies then went down and asked if he'd come up and say a few words for (the groom) EJ and got a 'No thanks.' Two minutes later, Bill f***ing Murray walks into the room and gives this speech. And if when you come back to JFK, when you land in JFK, and you're still in love with that person, get married at the airport." Murray was most recently seen in Wes Anderson's film "The Grand Budapest Hotel." Sure, it doesn't happen to everybody, but when it does, expect good times from America's favorite guest -- just ask some karaoke fans or kickball players.
