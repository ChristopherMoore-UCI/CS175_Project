The lawmakers in the ACT, which has a population of about 380,000 people, would have been aware that their same-sex marriage law wouldn't be allowed to override federal law. On Wednesday, India's top court ruled that sex between consenting homosexual partners is illegal in the country, prompting dismay from human rights groups. But that fleeting window was slammed shut Thursday by the Australian High Court, which ruled that a recent local law legalizing same-sex marriage was invalid. Earlier this year, Australian neighbor New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalize same-sex marriage. The high court said Thursday that the federal Marriage Act, which doesn't permit same-sex marriage, takes precedence over the law passed by the legislative assembly in Canberra, also known as the Australian Capital Territory.
