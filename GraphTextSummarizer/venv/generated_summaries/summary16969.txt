My two-person group ate bag lunches, spent the one night in Aguas Calientes, the base city to Machu Picchu, and looked on enviously at Inca Trail trekkers sharing beer, some grilled alpaca and a game of cards at the final rest stop where the trails unite. Though I never intended to fly to Peru for a two-day trek, once I wiped away the fog on my optimism lenses, I realized that many of the alternate treks to Machu Picchu are just as worthy of fame as the legendary Inca Trail. Years of feet trampling Inca steps led the government to institute a 500 person per day limit in 2002 on the historic trail -- including trekkers, guides and porters -- to prevent over-saturation of the trail and to maintain the sanctity of the sites. This nine-day/eight-night trek passes the two largest Inca sites in the Cusco region: Machu Picchu and Choquequirao. Unlike Salkantay, however, this trek combines Inca history with little interference from tourist passersby.
