Porter Airlines: "We are experiencing systemwide network outages affecting our website, Call Centre, reservation system and flight planning," the company said on its website. Here is what some of the airlines that use Navitaire told CNN Tuesday evening: AirTran: "A power outage earlier today at our vendor's data facility that manages our airport computer systems is causing us to process customers manually at the airport for AirTran's operations," said Chris Mainz, spokesman for AirTran parent company Southwest Airlines. All flights are operating, and we have not had any cancellations as a result of this issue," said Misty Pinson, Spirit Airlines spokeswoman. CNN iReporter Joe Garcia was an AirTran passenger who was stranded in Memphis, Tennessee, on Tuesday night. It was not clear exactly how many airlines were affected or how many flights had been canceled because of reservations and ticketing issues, but the major North American airlines affected Tuesday night appeared to be AirTran, Spirit and Toronto, Canada-based Porter Airlines.
