The facts seem to go something like this: Members of the Palin family, including Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, attended a party Saturday night in Anchorage, where a large brawl broke out. More salacious details were reported by Alaska blogger Amanda Coyne, writing that Track Palin, Sarah Palin's 25-year-old son, "stumbles out of stretch Hummer" and sees an ex-boyfriend of his sister Willow's. Coyne says that Track and the former boyfriend began arguing, the owner of the house intervened, and with the Palin women screaming, Bristol took several swings and Sarah Palin yelled, "Don't you know who I am?! Palin spoke Friday evening at a Houston fundraiser for wounded veterans, giving her plenty of time to fly home and attend Saturday night's shindig. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party," police spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said in a statement to CNN.
