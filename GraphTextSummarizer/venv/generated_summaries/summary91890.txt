-- Pat Summitt, the all-time winningest major college basketball coach, said Friday that it was 100% her decision to step down as head coach of the Tennessee women's team after her diagnosis with early-onset Alzheimer's. We stand by Pat and her statements, both today and at her press conference in April, that it was her decision to step aside as head coach and become head coach emeritus of the Lady Vol basketball team," she said. " Summitt, who led the Lady Vols to eight national championships and whose 1,098 wins are the most in major college basketball history, remains involved in mentoring Tennessee players and recruiting as the team's head coach emeritus through April 2013. In her affidavit, Summitt described a meeting in March with athletics director Dave Hart, in which she said she was told she would no longer be coach after 38 seasons. Obama honors longtime Tennessee coach Margie Nichols, vice chancellor for communications for the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, also released a statement Friday, hailing Summitt as a legend.
