In addition to those cases, Amir cited Corby's illness during imprisonment and lighter sentences imposed by other nations on marijuana possession convictions as factors that the government weighed in granting Corby clemency.

"At no stage has the Government sat down with our Indonesian counterparts and said, 'We'll release minors from our jails, if you consider a clemency application by Ms. Corby.' "We'd be releasing them because it is plainly indecent to have in Australian adult jails kids from Indonesia who have been picked up on fishing boats being misused for people smuggling. -- Schapelle Corby, the Australian serving time in a Bali, Indonesia, prison on a conviction of drug smuggling, has had her jail term cut by five years.
