If no fighting erupts Friday, displaced Thais should be able to return home, said Col. Shinagard Rattanikitti. They have criticized the handling of the long-running border dispute with Cambodia that has led to deadly clashes recently. Thai yellow shirt protesters on Friday demanded the prime minister's resignation over what they say is his failure to protect the interests of the nation. Meanwhile, the border situation between Thailand and Cambodia remains calm, an army spokesman said. About 1,000 protesters took part, said Prawut Thavornsiri, a police spokesman.
