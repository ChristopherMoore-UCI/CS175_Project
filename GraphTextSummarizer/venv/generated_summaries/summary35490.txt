According to Hare, this proves dogs are complex social animals who understand they have different relationships with different people. And what we want to understand is: What is it that either makes dogs remarkable as a species or what is it that constrains the ability of dogs to solve problems?" To test the dogs' ability, Hare and a team of graduate students put dogs through a variety of games similar to those you might play with young children. That's about the same age that dogs start to recognize and rely on humans, too, Hare says. And I think that we're going to be able to have a much, even richer relationship with dogs than we already do if we figure all that out," says Hare. "Different dogs solve different problems differently.
