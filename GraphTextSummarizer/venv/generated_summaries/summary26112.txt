"Because rural drinking water is dependent on ground water, ground water levels are going down because of exploitation by irrigation, by farmers and by industries, we are forced to drill deeper and deeper for drinking water," he told CNN. T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, an official with India's department of drinking water and sanitation, said rural India has a whole range of issues depleting its water. The only way she gets water is by filling up heavy buckets from a neighborhood spigot and lugging them home. None of them has ever had water piped into their homes. This is how the vast majority of the neighborhood gets access to water.
