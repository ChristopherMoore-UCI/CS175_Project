-- German striking legend Miroslav Klose has signed a two-year contract with Italian side Lazio, following his failure to agree a new deal with Bayern Munich. " Liverpool close to Henderson deal Speaking about the transfer, Lazio sporting director Igli Tare told German channel Sport1: "We hope he brings his skills to us and scores the goals to put Lazio back up where we belong, to be one of Europe's biggest clubs." Meanwhile, Liverpool have completed the biggest signing of the close season so far with the $33m capture of England international midfielder Jordan Henderson from Premier League rivals Sunderland. He helped Bayern win the German league and cup double in his first year at the club and helped them reclaim the league title in 2010, as well as reaching the final of the Champions League, where they lost to Inter Milan. Klose, who has netted 61 goals in 109 appearances for Germany and is closing in on Mueller's all-time record of 68 goals, is keen to play in the finals of Euro 2012 and his move hias been welcomed by his national coach Joachim Loew.
