On the evening CNN interviewed Foster the People backstage at L.A.'s Wiltern Theater, the guest list was an inconceivable mix of Taylor Swift, a couple of kids from "Glee" and Jerry Cantrell from Alice in Chains. Foster, bassist Cubbie Fink and drummer Mark Pontius recently spoke with CNN about what this moment in time is like for Foster the People. Mark Foster: I think it's funny, because we've all worked towards a career in music for a long time. The Los Angeles-based group is now up for a pair of Grammys: Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for their smash single "Pumped Up Kicks" and Best Alternative Album for their debut CD, "Torches." Lurking beneath the shiny bubble-gum surface of Foster the People lies a dark theme or two -- particularly in "Pumped Up Kicks," in which a teen shooter tells potential victims they'd "better run, better run, faster than my bullet."
