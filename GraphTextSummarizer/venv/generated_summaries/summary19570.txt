-- North Korea held a huge military parade in Pyongyang on Thursday, using the 70th anniversary of the birth of its late leader Kim Jong Il as an opportunity to try to invoke deeper reverence for his son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un. With a giant portrait of a smiling Kim Jong Il, who died in December, looking down on proceedings, soldiers carried out a salute to him and his father, Kim Il Sung, who founded North Korea. The large helium balloons had writing on them, saying things like, "Kim Jong Il starved to death 3 million people," "Liberate the North Korean people" and "North Korean killer Kim Jong Il." They sent 200,000 leaflets, 500 DVDs and $1,000 in one dollar bills. North Korean newspapers on Thursday carried special reports on Kim Jong Il. Kim Yong Nam, the president of the North Korean parliament, made a speech at the event praising Kim Jong Il's "immortal feats" and also urging that "all the party members, service persons and people should protect Kim Jong Un politically and ideologically with their lives and get united around him."
