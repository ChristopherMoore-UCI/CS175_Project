Detectives also uncovered other Facebook postings, like one complaining about Muslims who condemned the 2013 murder of British soldier Lee Rigby near a barracks in southeast London. Her case is one of many related to terrorism that British authorities have pursued in recent years. A British court sentenced a 35-year-old woman Thursday to more than five years in prison for using Facebook to promote terrorism -- including urging other women to send their husbands off "to fight for the sake of Allah" and saying she looked forward to the day her young son could join them. Another gives details to another person online about how to go from Turkey to Syria -- a common route for would-be jihadists looking to join groups like ISIS, the Islamist extremist group that has used brutal tactics against nonbelievers while taking vast swaths of Syria and Iraq. Runa Khan was arrested in her hometown of Luton, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of London, last December, and she pleaded guilty to four counts of distributing terrorist publications more than seven months later.
