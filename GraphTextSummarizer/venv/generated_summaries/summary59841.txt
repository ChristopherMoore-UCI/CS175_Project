-- A federal immigration judge says President Obama's aunt, who has stayed in the United States illegally for years, will be allowed to remain in the country until at least next year. Onyango, who is the half sister of the president's late father, applied for political asylum in 2002 due to violence in her native Kenya, according to her spokesman, Mike Rogers. Onyango lives in public housing in South Boston and volunteers as a health advocate for people in her housing complex. Onyango was a legal resident of the United States at the time and had received a Social Security card a year earlier. Lawyers for the Department of Homeland Security are defending an order to deport Onyango.
