The space is located in Newtown's Reed Intermediate School, where students of Sandy Hook elementary go after graduating. For families from the Newtown area, and even beyond, a pressing problem will be how to help children cope with the aftermath of this tragedy -- and indeed how to give parents space to grieve, knowing their children are being looked after. In addition, the nonprofit mental health clinic Newtown Youth and Family Services is providing counseling for families, community members and school staff. The Red Cross stresses it has what it needs to support efforts in Newtown, and is asking that those wishing to donate to families and the community, direct their contributions to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund. The chilling sound of multiple gunshots shattered the relative quiet of the school day at Sandy Hook Elementary School at around 9:30 Friday morning -- children screaming, then silence, as teachers did their best to protect their students and keep them quiet, hoping desperately the shooter would not find them.
