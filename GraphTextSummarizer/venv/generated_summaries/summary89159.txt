"That's science fiction and that will always be science fiction," says Dietrich, explaining that vertical liftoffs require a lot of air to be blown down which is not practical and can cause damages to neighboring vehicles. Dietrich says Terrafugia is "heavily involved" with international committees to write new certification standards that account for some of the new technologies that are increasingly coming to the market for manned and unmanned aircraft, and which also apply to TF-X --- things like electric motors and batteries for general aviation aircraft. "They don't need to know those things because the computer is plugged in to a data network that automatically helps them plan the flight path, avoid other air traffic and air space restrictions, things of that nature," says Dietrich. Before you dash to the door and sprint to your nearest pilot school to sign up for flight lessons, take a moment to meet Carl Dietrich, the chief executive and co-founder of aerospace company Terrafugia. "It's hard to say exactly, but we estimate eight to12 years," says Dietrich, who admits that even if Terrafugia had all the capital required to develop TF-X -- which it doesn't -- the realization of the project depends on technological developments as well as regulators changing the way aircraft are currently certified.
