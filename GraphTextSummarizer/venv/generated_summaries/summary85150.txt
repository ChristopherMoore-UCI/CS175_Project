The episode was the debut of the new cast, which includes "Fresh Prince" star Ribeiro, comedian Tommy Chong, athlete Lolo Jones, "Duck Dynasty" star Sadie Robertson and more. And while "Dancing with the Stars" won't allow him to "show pot leaves or bongs," Chong continued, "they have Tommy Chong, who really is a pot leaf." On Tuesday night, the dancing duo with the lowest combined score of audience votes and judges' votes will be the first elimination of the season. On the lower side of the scoreboard were designer Betsey Johnson and Olympian Lolo Jones. On the greener side of things was Tommy Chong, who rolled onto the set with his comedy partner, Cheech Marin.
