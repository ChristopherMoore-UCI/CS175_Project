I've got a couple of Henry Paulsons, some Robert Kimmitts and a Stuart Levey. But now, the currency of the greatest nation on Earth will carry a scribble that has been variously described as curly fries, a phone cord, a bendy straw or simply the "Boing!" That's the signature of Jacob "Jack" Lew, President Obama's nominee for secretary of the Treasury, and it has lit up the blogosphere. So instead of going crazy because the Cabinet is in sore need of a binder full of women, what the "boing" is going to do to our money is the big deal. Or could his signature mean something else in Chinese, like "We will bury you" or "This is Monopoly money"?
