Scott Monument, Edinburgh, Scotland A spiky Gothic fantasy with more than a passing resemblance to a Thai temple, the monument to Sir Walter Scott is a beloved fixture of the Edinburgh skyline. Opened in 1862, the Carleton County Gaol was in operation for over a century, but it was hardly a hit with the prisoners who complained of cramped conditions and sanitation problems. Wat Rong Khun, Chang Rai, Thailand Still under construction, Chiang Rai's controversial modern temple is part traditional Buddhist temple, part white-frosted wedding cake, and part avant-garde art with a disturbing penchant for pointiness. The 'Life and Death Department' is a spiritual place to ponder your eventual demise, the 'Department for Wandering Ghosts' and the 'Department for Implementing 15 Kinds of Violent Death' have slightly less inviting names, while the ill might seek out the 'Deep-Rooted Disease Department'. Wat Rong Khun is open daily; the White Temple is a short drive from Chiang Rai.
