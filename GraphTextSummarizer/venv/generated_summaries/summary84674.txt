Besides her mother and father, several members of her family are performers: Her grandparents were Sir Michael Redgrave, a famed British actor, and actress Rachel Kempson; uncle Corin Redgrave, aunt Lynn Redgrave and sister Joely Richardson also are noted actors. Natasha Richardson comes from a family of well-known British actors, including mother Vanessa Redgrave. Richardson, the daughter of Oscar-winning actress Vanessa Redgrave and the late director Tony Richardson ("Look Back in Anger," "Tom Jones"), has said, more than once, that she found it difficult to live up to the family reputation. "The names Richardson or Redgrave didn't help," she told About.com's Rebecca Murray in 2007. Despite her mother's success, Richardson said that the family was sometimes in financial straits because the politically controversial Redgrave gave away money to various causes, according to the BBC.
