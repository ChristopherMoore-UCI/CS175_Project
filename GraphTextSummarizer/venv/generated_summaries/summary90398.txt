St. Louis Rams players who showed support for Michael Brown's family should be praised, an organization representing black police officers in St. Louis says. It describes itself as "the primary voice of African-American police officers in St. Louis city." On Monday, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar claimed he had received an apology. Alexander, who's also police chief in DeKalb County, Georgia, said he hopes the Rams and the St. Louis police associations "can all get together to promote a sense of community that will be a role model for what we need to do together going forward in St. Louis, across the country and around the world. "We think that their actions were commendable and that they should not be ridiculed, disciplined or punished for taking a stand on this very important issue which is of great concern around the world and especially in the community where these players work," the Ethical Society of Police of St. Louis said in a statement this week.
