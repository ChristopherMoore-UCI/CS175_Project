Four Corners region of U.S. (VBS.TV)  -- Earlier this fall, VBS.TV went to the Four Corners region of the United States to hang out with indigenous cowboys of the Navajo (Din√©) tribe. The Navajo riders have managed to get a degree of mainstream exposure over the years, mostly because bull and bronc riding are becoming a big-bucks industry elsewhere in the U.S. Triple B, like several other rodeo associations, provides young riders with an opportunity to sign up and compete against each other from March to November each year. Early this year, it was reported that more than 56 percent of Navajos live below the poverty line, one of the highest rates in the U.S., even among the traditionally marginalized indigenous communities. Many of these families throughout New Mexico, Arizona, Utah and Colorado also lack electricity, running water or telephones.
