The club missed out on Champions League football in 2010-11, finishing sixth in the table, and even failed to secure a Europa League place for next season despite an upturn in fortunes after former player Kenny Dalglish returned as manager. Liverpool are close to sealing the first big-money move of the English close season after agreeing a fee for Sunderland midfielder Jordan Henderson. A statement on the club's web site read: "Liverpool have agreed a deal to sign Sunderland midfielder Jordan Henderson. It shows that Liverpool's American owners, Fenway Sports Group -- who also own Major League baseball team the Boston Red Sox -- are prepared to spend big in the transfer market to try and haul Liverpool back into the English top four. " Sunderland also confirmed the news on their web site, a spokesman saying: "A fee has been agreed with Liverpool for Jordan Henderson and he travels to Anfield with the club's blessing."
