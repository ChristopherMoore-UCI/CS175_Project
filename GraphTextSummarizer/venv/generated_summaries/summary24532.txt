Nearby is the Museum of Comrade Mao, which displays exhibits and old Communist Party photos. The village consists of numerous Mao landmarks, and it's his house where the huge numbers of tour buses usually converge first. The path that winds back down to the main road is filled with touts, their stalls full of miniature Mao busts, caps, key rings, copies of his obligatory Little Red Book and other paraphernalia. Watch visitors express their thoughts about Mao Â» About 500 meters up from Mao's house, a large bronze statue of the former leader towers over a massive square, where admirers energetically bow and pay their respects. "Both young people and old people love Mao very much!"
