Yes, Westeros is roughly equivalent to medieval Europe. Look for him (man-at-arms Bronn and companion Shae in tow) to play a more central role in the power struggle, even as his love-hate (OK ... usually hate-hate) relationship with sister Cersei and father Tywin continues to simmer. Even more characters will emerge as players (or pawns) in the so-called War of the Five Kings, and the world will get bigger as key characters travel throughout the kingdom of Westeros and beyond. But the little-known fact that he's actually not late King Robert's son, instead the inbred offspring of Cersei and brother Jaime, has given hope to his challengers. With the counsel of his mother, Catelyn, he's had great success on the battlefield, taking renowned warrior Jaime Lannister hostage in the process.
