During the last glacial period, global temperatures fluttered up and down by as much as several degrees in as little as a decade. At 3,000 meters below sea level, the crew saw thousands of sea spiders. Because cold water releases more CO2 into the air than warm water, the rate at which bottom water rises to the surface has a profound effect on the atmosphere above. But early-'90s research on Greenland's ice core proved that, over the past 100,000 years, climate stability has been the exception, not the norm. CO2 levels in the atmosphere changed along with the temperature, though more slowly.
