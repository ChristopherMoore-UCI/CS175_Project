-- U.S. warplanes carried out airstrikes in northern Iraq near ISIS-controlled Mosul Dam early Saturday morning, the Kurdish news agency Rudaw reported, citing eyewitnesses. Yazidi men killed, women abducted ISIS fighters swept into a Yazidi village in northern Iraq on Friday, killing at least 80 men and taking more than 100 women captive, officials told CNN. CNN cannot independently confirm the killings and abductions, but the claims are similar to reports provided by survivors of ISIS attacks in Iraq. Who are the Yazidis? EU considers arming Kurds The plight of the Yazidis and the threat posed by ISIS to Iraq's Kurdish regional government prompted the United States to conduct targeted airstrikes and humanitarian airdrops. After an emergency meeting Friday of the European Union's foreign ministers, the group said it welcomed U.S. action and that its member nations were responding to a call from Iraq's Kurdish regional government for arms and ammunition.
