-- The arrest of drug kingpin Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman is a monumental moment in the world's war on drugs. Guzman captured after years on the run Here are three reasons why the arrest of Guzman -- now being held by Mexican authorities and sought for extradition by U.S. authorities -- matters so much. Guzman had been caught once before by Mexican authorities, in 2001, but he escaped from a high-security Mexican prison. That helped Mexican authorities and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents hunting Guzman gain confidence in recent weeks that they could arrest him. That he was hiding in plain sight -- in a beach resort hotel in the Mexican Riviera town of Mazatlan -- is as dramatic a twist in the manhunt for Guzman as is the narrative behind his life and his control of the international Sinaloa drug cartel.
