Video from the card showed the 29-year-old pilot with several passengers on flights the previous day, and one nighttime flight shortly before the fatal trip, taking photos of himself with his cell phone, according to investigators. His logbooks did not show that he had training in instruments to deal with a stall or that he was qualified to fly at night with passengers, the NTSB said. It's likely that the use of cell phones during that flight "distracted the pilot," the report said, causing him to develop spatial disorientation and lose control of the plane. The fatal flight, on May 31, was not captured on the GoPro footage but investigators said that the pilot, who is not identified in the report, was at the controls of the plane when it stalled and crashed in a wheat field, bounced once and came to rest upright. Distraction caused by taking selfies is likely to blame for a plane crash that killed a pilot and his passenger in Colorado in May, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.
