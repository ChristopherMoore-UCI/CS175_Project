It was a reminder, if any was needed, of Cavendish's incredible finishing speed as he claimed his 11th Giro stage victory and his first in a Grand Tour for new team Omega Pharma Quick Step. -- Bradley Wiggins is hot favorite for overall victory, but Mark Cavendish will be keeping the race leader's Maglia Rosa jersey warm for his fellow countryman after a blistering finish to win the opening stage of the Giro d'Italia Saturday. But with Sky placing the emphasis on riders like Wiggins and Chris Froome in winning the overall classification at races such as the Tour and Giro, he left to join Omega in the close season. Cavendish came with a late charge on the seafront in Naples to pip home rider Elia Viviani of the Cannondale team on the line. The reigning Tour de France champion finished safely in the bunch, which split after a late crash, leaving Cavendish and a clutch of other sprint specialists to fight out the finish.
