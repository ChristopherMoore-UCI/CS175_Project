SkyWest said passengers were being accommodated on other flights and through ground transportation. " Van Fleet said, "I don't think we're any more vulnerable than any other airport," but officials said they would review security. Cornejo was found at Hedglin's residence, but authorities don't know whether she went there voluntarily or was abducted, Colorado Springs Police spokeswoman Barbara A. Miller told CNN.
