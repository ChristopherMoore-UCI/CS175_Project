-- Yemeni President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi dismissed the government Tuesday and agreed to a 15% cut in fuel prices, in addition to other economic reforms, seeking to end weeks of tense protests led by tens of thousands of Houthi loyalists in the capital, Sanaa. Tens of thousands of Houthi supporters have been rallying for weeks to demand that a recently approved oil subsidy reform be revoked and that the government step down before they agree to lift their tents from Sanaa and the outskirts. Government committees that held talks with Houthi leaders over the previous two weeks didn't resolve the political tension. On Monday, hours after Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi announced escalating the protests, Hadi sent Sanaa Mayor Abdul-Qadir Hilal to Saada province to give dialogue a final chance. The President's initiative also calls on the Houthis to withdraw fighters from Amran province and an immediate end of clashes in the northern Jawf province.
