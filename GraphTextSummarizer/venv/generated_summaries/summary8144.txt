Messi's goals came in the 38th and 68th minutes at the Camp Nou, with Adriano, Pedro, Alexis Sanchez and the returning Neymar chipping in with the others. Barring a serious injury and change of leagues, Messi -- who did miss two months this season with a leg complaint -- is sure to take over top spot from Telmo Zarra. Barcelona's awesome display against Vallecano prompted the Catalan club's website to use the word 'caviar' in describing the affair and the free-flowing football on offer served as a warning for Manchester City, which collides with Barca next week in the Champions League. Barcelona and Atletico each have 60 points, and Real Madrid can join them by winning at Getafe on Sunday. "I'd like to think that Messi still has a bit to go before he's 100 percent fit," Barcelona manager Gerardo Martino told the club website.
