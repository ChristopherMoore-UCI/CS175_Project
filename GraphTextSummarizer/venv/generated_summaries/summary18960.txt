New low-power wireless technologies make it possible to implant monitoring devices in people's bodies, to help keep an eye on blood pressure, metabolism and other vital statistics. Combined with a custom integrated chip or a system on a chip, device makers can use the antenna in pacemakers, neurostimulation devices, and swallowable imaging and diagnostic systems. Mind Control Taking brain waves and translating them directly into computer commands is a hot new area in user interface design. In the past, communication between medical devices was based on ad-hoc and proprietary standards, which offered limited or no interoperability. Cube Radio As devices become more complex to use, designers are striving for simplicity in form.
