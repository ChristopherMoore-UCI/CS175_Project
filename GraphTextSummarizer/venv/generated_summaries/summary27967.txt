Barbra Streisand returns to late night with Jimmy Fallon "Partners," which was released on September 16, is Streisand's 10th No. 1. Her first No. 1 album, "People," arrived 50 years ago in October 1964. There's "New York State of Mind" with Billy Joel and "The Way We Were" with Lionel Richie. She even sings a virtual duet with Elvis Presley on "Love Me Tender."
