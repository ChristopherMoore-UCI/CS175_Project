"This appalling incident involving excessive force is the latest in an increasingly disturbing pattern of brutal police conduct in South Africa," said Noel Kututwa, Amnesty International's southern Africa director. Under apartheid rule in South Africa, white police officers subjected the nation's black majority to inhumane treatment. A harsh reminder "We are shocked by this incident," said Moses Dlamini, a spokesman for the Police Investigative Directorate, an independent government agency that looks into possible crimes by police. The video was captured by cell phone late last month, sparking outrage in a nation that has seen a series of police brutality incidents recently. Shaky but clear, it showed his son talking animatedly with police officers.
