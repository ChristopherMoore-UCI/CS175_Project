-- The emir of Kuwait has accepted the resignation of the Cabinet and the prime minister and asked them to stay as a caretaker government until a new government is formed, state-run news agency KUNA said Monday. In a letter to the emir announcing his resignation, the prime minister said "negative practices" of a minority of members of Parliament made progress impossible, according to KUNA. "Therefore, under these circumstances, it has become impossible for the government to pursue shouldering its responsibilities and fulfilling duties," he wrote, according to KUNA. The decision comes less than two weeks after anti-corruption protesters forced their way inside Parliament in Kuwait City, pushing for the prime minister's ouster. While Kuwait's leaders worked to quell the protests, opposition leaders vowed their efforts would escalate.
