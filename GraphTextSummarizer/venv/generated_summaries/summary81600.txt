-- French league leaders Paris St Germain have confirmed the appointment of Italian Carlo Ancelotti as their new coach on a two-and-a-half year contract as a replacement for Antoine Kombouare, who left the club earlier on Friday. The 52-year-old Ancelotti, who twice won the Champions League while in charge of AC Milan, is reported to be the highest-paid coach in French football history and his first match in charge will be a friendly against Milan in Dubai on January 4. He replaces former PSG player Kombouare who, despite leading the club to the top of the Ligue One table, has been sacrificed by PSG's mega-rich Qatari owners who were keen for a bigger name to take over as coach. However, Beckham's agents released a statement saying: "There is no agreement with PSG at this time, an offer does not make a contract, we continue to hold negotiations with a number of clubs." " Ancelotti's appointment has increased speculation that David Beckham, who played for both Ancelotti, and PSG's sporting director Leonardo, at AC Milan, could be the next big name arrival in the French capital.
