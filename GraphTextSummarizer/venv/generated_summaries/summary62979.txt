The 23-year-old stormed into the last four of the Californian desert event on Friday with a 6-2 6-4 dismissal of French 18th seed Richard Gasquet, his 16th successive victory this year and 18th including the Davis Cup final in December. " Nadal, 24, has only recently recovered from a hamstring injury sustained at January's Australian Open, where he lost in the quarterfinals. In the women's draw, Marion Bartoli became the first Frenchwoman to reach the final at Indian Wells when she beat Yanina Wickmayer 6-1 6-3 on Friday. The 29-year-old won the closing quarterfinal 6-3 6-4 to give himself a chance of a record fourth title at Indian Wells, which would take him one past Michael Chang and Jimmy Connors. Nadal's bid to join that trio with three titles will face a strong test against resurgent former U.S. Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro on Saturday.
