" Lopez is scheduled to make his initial court appearance in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on January 25. "It came to light after UNOS did a routine audit," said Consuelo S. Woodhead, assistant U.S. attorney, major frauds section, in a telephone interview. Dr. Richard R. Lopez Jr., 54, of the Cheviot Hills area of West Los Angeles, was named in the eight-count indictment, which accuses him of conspiracy, concealment of a material fact and six counts of falsification of records, the U.S. Attorney's office for the Central District of California said in the indictment. " Though it appears that, in making the switch, Lopez violated UNOS regulations, federal authorities did not address whether those violations rose to the level of a federal crime, she said. Instead of telling the organ procurement organization of the switch and letting the organ be offered to the backup patient, Lopez approved acceptance of the liver and its transplantation into A-B, a patient at St. Vincent, the indictment said.
