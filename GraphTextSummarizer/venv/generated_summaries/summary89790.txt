Rotunno set up a company called Metro News at Midway -- O'Hare International Airport was many years from being built -- to offer professional photo service to anyone passing through the airport who wanted a memento of the occasion. It tells the story of one Mike Rotunno, a photographer-for-hire in the first boom years of commercial air travel in the United States. The newspapers won because, by buying photos from Rotunno, they didn't have to send photographers to the airport themselves. Lynch told me: "People who saw pictures in the papers of stars getting off planes thought, 'Hey, if John Wayne can fly, I can fly. Written by a fellow named Christopher Lynch, who grew up around Midway, it is a thin, paperbound volume that appears to be a labor of love and respect.
