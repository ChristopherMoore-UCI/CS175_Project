In that context, repealing the "step-up in basis" rule and perhaps equalizing tax rates on capital gains and regular income would go a long way to simplifying tax planning and return preparation while allowing the market to allocate capital without the often nonsensical preferences embedded in the current tax code. Nevertheless, if one wants to address anomalies like Warren Buffett and Mitt Romney paying lower effective tax rates than their employees, then raising tax rates on capital gains is a necessity. In contrast, President Obama proposes to raise taxes on capital gains received by married couples with incomes exceeding $500,000 per year. Income inequality is like the weather: Everyone talks about it, but no one does much about it. Perhaps the sense among some citizens that the system is "rigged" will produce a different result this year, but income inequality is fundamentally not a problem that is exclusively or even primarily about taxation.
