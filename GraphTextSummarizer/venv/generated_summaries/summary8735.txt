As far as transport goes, cities like New York and London have experienced a cycling boom and despite the nay-sayers, Sydney has also seen a 113 percent increase in cycling since 2010. While Sydney is moving towards a more sustainable future, climate change demands we do more. To make that happen we'll need to make bold decisions and test new ideas and that's exactly what we're doing in Sydney. Gas-fired trigeneration - a technology that uses heat from energy production making it more than twice as efficient as coal power stations --is one of the tools we're using to end our reliance on coal-fired power and generate 30 percent of our energy needs from clean, renewable sources. Last week a study released by the Australian Energy Market Operator found the cost of moving Australia to 100 percent clean energy would be roughly equal to sticking with coal.
