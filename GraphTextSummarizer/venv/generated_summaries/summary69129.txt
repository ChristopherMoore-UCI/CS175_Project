It leads the world in insects for food production, averaging around 7,500 tons per year, according to a 2013 report by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). For that reason the company is developing products like insect seasoning and "croquettes" for a potential commercial release next year. " International enterprises have begun to set up processing and packaging operations in Thailand for export, and last week Dutch supermarket chain Jumbo announced it will sell insect products in its stores from next year. That's still tiny compared to the country's chicken production (around 1.6m tons per year), but insects hold a number of advantages over traditionally farmed animals. "Mini-livestock" could be key to combating future global food shortages, suggests the FAO, as insects are relatively easy to raise and have a minimal impact on the environment compared to conventional cattle.
