Akram starred in Iraq's Asian Cup-winning team last year and was set to play for Premier League Manchester City. LONDON, England  -- The British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has been asked to intervene after Iraqi international Nashat Akram was refused a work permit. Akram's supporters say this is because Iraq cannot play matches at home because of the security situation and are calling for the decision to be reversed. " Earlier this month, Watford midfielder Al Bangura, from Sierra Leone, was granted a work permit after a decision to deport him was overturned following a well-supported campaign by football fans and a local member of parliament, Claire Ward. Nashat Akram was hoping to become the first Iraqi footballer to play in England.
