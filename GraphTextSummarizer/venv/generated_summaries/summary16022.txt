British Prime Minister David Cameron set up an independent inquiry into press ethics and practices in response to the scandal, and police are carrying out three separate investigations into elements of it: phone hacking, e-mail hacking, and police bribery. The publisher apologized for intercepting phone messages of Alastair Campbell, the Blair aide, and agreed to pay costs and damages, Campbell said in a statement. -- The publisher of Rupert Murdoch's now defunct News of the World tabloid paid out hundreds of thousands of pounds Wednesday to settle lawsuits over phone hacking from celebrities and politicians, including a former Tony Blair spokesman. Comic actor Steve Coogan, who also settled Wednesday, echoed the words of many who have sued over phone hacking. The publisher of the shuttered tabloid is paying £40,000 ($63,000) and legal costs to Coogan, £45,000 ($71,000) plus costs to Liberal Democrat politician Simon Hughes, and £75,000 ($119,000) plus costs to sports agent Sky Andrew, lawyers and judges announced Wednesday.
