Residents of the city awakened to crumbling walls, crushed cars, fallen trees and scattered branches after heavy rain, wind and hail hit Wednesday night, the state-run Telam agency said. Wind gusts ranged from 100 kph to 120 kph (62 mph to 75 mph), said Luciano Timerman, a provincial emergency official, Telam reported. "The level of virulence of this storm is not normal," said Diego Santilli, the city's environment minister, according to Telam. -- At least 13 people were killed and 20 others were injured when a severe storm tore through the Buenos Aires area, state media reported Thursday. A wall in at least one historic building collapsed, Telam said.
