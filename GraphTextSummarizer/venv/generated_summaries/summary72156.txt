A man jumped a fence at the White House late Friday and made it through the North Portico doors into the building before he was captured, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary told CNN. CNN White House producer Becky Brittain said she has never been evacuated off White House grounds in her nine years of reporting there. More than an hour later, Secret Service agents and dogs were seen standing near where the disturbance occurred. Gonzalez was known to Secret Service, said an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A CNN crew saw Secret Service agents standing over what appeared to be a man on the North Portico.
