We went to Mass once a week, while in school, as well as on Sundays. We took music lessons, art appreciation lessons, and we even went to finishing school. I developed a very close relationship with the archbishop [Archbishop Gregory Aymond of the Archdiocese of New Orleans]. It was something I was going to do out of high school, and I put it off. We went to Catholic school.
