I was sent to Fort Hood along with CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr and videographer Phil Littleton. And there were lines, lines of soldiers everywhere. I was told that's where soldiers would be taken if a routine mental health exam indicated a more thorough one might be needed. The purpose of our visit was to learn how Fort Hood was helping soldiers cope with stress and mental health problems. Was he or she in that building, stuck in line when the shooting began?
