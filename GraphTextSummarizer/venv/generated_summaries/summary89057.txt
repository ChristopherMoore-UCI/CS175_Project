-- Five years after battling and beating breast cancer, "Good Morning America" co-anchor Robin Roberts faces another dangerous health foe. "In facing this new challenge, I ask humbly for more of your prayers and love -- as I will keep you in mine and update you regularly on my condition." Roberts began contributing to "Good Morning America" in 1995 and was promoted to co-anchor in 2005. "Then a few weeks ago, during a rather unpleasant procedure to extract bone marrow for testing, I received word that I would interview President Obama the next day," Roberts said. Robin Roberts said marrow donors "are scarce and particularly for African-American women," she said. " MDS is "a disease of the blood and bone marrow and was once known as preleukemia," Roberts said in her message on the ABC News website.
