Joe Rivera said over the past few days, they've heard from other parents of children with developmental disabilities, who say they were excluded from transplants. Mental disabilities should not factor into the decision making for transplants, so long as the patient has strong support from family and caregivers who would ensure that the required medications and care is given, said Dr. Raul de Velasco, the clinical ethics program director at the University of Miami. Martens wrote a 2006 report examining the outcome of patients with developmental delays who received kidney transplants. On the flip side, patients who have mental disabilities or neurological delays can qualify to be live organ donors after undergoing screening processes and consent from the family. She wrote that a doctor on the transplant team and a social worker said that Amelia could not be a candidate for kidney transplant "because of her mental delays."
