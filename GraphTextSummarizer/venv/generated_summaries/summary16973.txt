President Barack Obama hit his lowest point in the eyes of the public according to that poll, with just 40% of Americans approving of his job performance, the latest Washington Post/ABC News poll released Wednesday shows. Some Democratic Senate candidates have attempted to deflect Republican attacks throughout the campaign by distancing themselves from Obama policies on key issues. And Obama could be pulling down his party as just 39% of Americans hold a favorable view of the Democratic Party, the lowest in modern history according to the Washington Post/ABC News poll. -- As Democrats head into the last throes of the campaign season, the party and the president are facing some of their lowest favorability and approval ratings, respectively, according to two new surveys. Republicans continued to register lower favorability marks than Democrats with just 33% expressing a positive view of the GOP.
