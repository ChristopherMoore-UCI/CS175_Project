-- Recently it has seemed that every other tweet or Instagram posted by pop star Rihanna taunts the public with an uncomfortable thought: Singer Chris Brown, the man who beat her so badly in 2009 that was she was almost unrecognizable, may once again be her lover. When the world first saw the images of Rihanna's face after her fight with Brown, many rushed to blanket the songstress with support. Then earlier this year there was the remix to Rihanna's song "Birthday Cake," in which Brown was the featured guest vocalist offering such coy nuggets as: "Girl I wanna --- you right now Been a long time I've been missing your body". Oh, I can hear Brown fans now -- leave him alone. Entertainment: Chris Brown renews 'friendship' with Rihanna
