-- Seeking to make the world of autism a little smaller, members of the international diplomatic community gathered Friday at the United Nations World Focus on Autism. At the event, Torrijos discussed the need for more programs such as the Pan American Autism Awareness Initiative, an international collaboration between Autism Speaks and North, South and Central America, first announced in May 2008. They don't have any idea about it because we need more education on what autism is." In an interview with CNN, Vivian Fernandez de Torrijos, honorary co-chair and wife of Panamanian president Martin Torrijos, said lack of awareness and social stigma are part of the reason autism is diagnosed later in life in Latin America.
