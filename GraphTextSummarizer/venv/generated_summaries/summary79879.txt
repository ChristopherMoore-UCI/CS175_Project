"Television networks are playing a key role in promoting cultural understanding of LGBT lives around the world, and are now producing some of the best LGBT-inclusive programming we've yet seen," said GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis in a statement. -- For the first time, three networks have rated "excellent" in an annual survey of LGBT portrayals on television, the LGBT media advocacy organization GLAAD said Wednesday. The organization also put out its Where We Are on TV report chronicling the number of LGBT characters in the current television season. For 2014-15, 3.9% of prime-time broadcast scripted series regulars will be lesbian, gay or bisexual, an increase of 0.6% from last season. Broadcast scripted series have 33 recurring lesbian, gay or bisexual characters; cable scripted series have 64 regulars and 41 recurring lesbian, gay or bisexual characters.
