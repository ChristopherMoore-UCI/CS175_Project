Rubio was the first of the possible presidential candidates to endorse Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst. In a June CNN poll, Rubio pulled 8% among potential GOP presidential candidates. Rubio is doing what other potential presidential candidates have done. In a fractured Republican Party that consists of social conservatives, fiscal conservatives, tea party activists and pragmatists, Rubio will have to find his niche. He's traveling to early presidential nominating states, heading overseas to beef up his foreign policy credentials, appearing on national TV to boost his name recognition and formulating policy ideas to demonstrate substance.
