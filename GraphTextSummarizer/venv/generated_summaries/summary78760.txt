" Suspect: Boston bombing was payback for hits on Muslims Tsarnaev's younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is currently being held in federal prison and has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. Bella Tsarnaev entered the plea at her arraignment hearing Tuesday to the initial charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, Tsarnaev's attorney, Mario Blanch told CNN. Blanch says Tsarnaev, 24, has no prior criminal record, and he is hoping she will be accepted into New Jersey's pretrial intervention program, in which mostly first-time offenders are offered alternatives to the normal prosecution process. Police originally arrested Tsarnaev in December 2012 after responding to a domestic disturbance call and finding marijuana in her Fairview, New Jersey, apartment. -- The sister of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects has pleaded not guilty to possession of marijuana, according to her attorney.
