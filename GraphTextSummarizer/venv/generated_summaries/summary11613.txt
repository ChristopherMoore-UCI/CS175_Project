The lessons from Frank Carrillo, a convicted jewel thief with a reputation as an expert golfer, allegedly took place on a course on Catalina Island, where Carrillo was serving a sentence on charges of theft, including stealing during a golf match a World Series ring that belonged to former Dodgers catcher Jimmy Campanis and a Rolex watch. The claim says that the captain had "Carrillo's prison yellow jumpsuit and wristband removed ... then had Carrillo outfitted in civilian golf clothes including a polo shirt and Docker pants. Jeff Donahue "illegally transported (inmate Frank) Carrillo to a local golf course where he was given golf lessons by Carrillo." Documents show Carrillo was convicted in December of 2010 of three counts of grand theft, receiving stolen property and two counts of burglary. " Donahue, who is part of the sheriff's force at Avalon that polices California's Catalina Island, is on medical leave.
