The preventable disease has spread through the southern African country in the past 10 months because of faulty sewage systems, uncollected refuse and a lack of clean water, UNICEF said. "Municipal services were not providing clean water anymore and they were not collecting refuse anymore. "Last year, we had a near collapse of basic social services," said Tsitsi Singizi, a spokeswoman for the organization. "We might have another spike in the number of cases once we have our first rain, because cholera is waterborne and the contaminated water will be flowing towards open sources and people will be drinking from unprotected wells," she said. The possibility of a new wave of cholera cases looms, Singizi said.
