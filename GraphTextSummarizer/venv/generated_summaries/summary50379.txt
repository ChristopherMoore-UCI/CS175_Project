Many Democrats responded that the right to religious freedom applies to all Americans, though some -- including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- said they oppose having the Islamic center so close to ground zero. "The answer is no regrets," Obama said when asked about bringing up the issue Friday at a White House dinner commemorating the start of Islamic holy month of Ramadan. -- President Obama said Wednesday that he has "no regrets" about his comments last week supporting the rights of Muslims to build an Islamic center and mosque two blocks from the site of the September 11 terror attacks in New York. At the dinner, Obama said that those wanting to build the Islamic center and mosque have the constitutional right to religious freedom. The remarks sparked a national debate on the emotional issue, with many Republicans condemning the president as insensitive to families of victims and out of touch with the views of most Americans.
