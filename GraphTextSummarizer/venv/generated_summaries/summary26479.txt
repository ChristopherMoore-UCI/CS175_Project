The NCAA action followed an independent investigation led by former FBI Director Louis Freeh, whose report held Paterno and other top Penn State officials responsible for failing to stop the abuse beginning in 1998. Former senator to be integrity monitor for Penn State Wick Sollers, attorney for Paterno's family, said the sanctions caused "enormous damage" to Penn State, students, athletes and Paterno. Penn State President Rodney Erickson said the university had accepted the decision and would not appeal. Calling it "a stark wake-up call to everyone involved in college sports," the NCAA in late July announced a $60 million fine against Penn State University and stripped 14 seasons of football victories from the late Paterno.
