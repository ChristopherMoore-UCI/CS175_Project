The seized websites claimed to be selling familiar name-brand products, including Ergobaby Carriers, New Era hats, Nike sneakers, Tiffany jewelry, Oakley sunglasses, NFL jerseys and Adobe software. Morton said the websites are growing more sophisticated, mimicking or even duplicating legitimate websites. -- For the third straight year, federal customs officials marked the Cyber Monday online shopping extravaganza by seizing scores of websites that were allegedly selling counterfeit or falsely labeled products to unsuspecting customers. That's part of the challenge here," ICE Director John Morton said. Under the forfeiture process, individuals who have an interest in seized domain names can contest the action in federal court.
