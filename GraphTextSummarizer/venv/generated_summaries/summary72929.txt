-- Prince William and Catherine, the duchess of Cambridge, will file a criminal complaint against the photographer who took topless pictures of her, the palace said Sunday evening. The French magazine Closer ran photos last week of Catherine sunbathing topless in private. In a sign of how divisive the issue of royal privacy has become, a co-owner of the Irish Daily Star, media group Northern & Shell, said it in no way backed the newspaper's decision to run the pictures of Catherine. Chi, an Italian gossip magazine owned by the same company, has said it will put out a special edition on Monday with photos of William and Catherine on vacation. Northern & Shell also owns the Daily Express and the Daily Star, among other British publications, which have not run the pictures of Catherine, nor of Prince Harry.
