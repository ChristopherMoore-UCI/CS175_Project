With the Cyrus Cylinder tour coming to the U.S. during a pivotal time in the relations of U.S. and Iran, the wisdom of Cyrus could guide diplomats to build constructively upon shared values. "Exchange derives the history of values globally, and the social empathy that comes from cultural exchange is better than one thousand negotiations," Gopin said. Cultural exchanges are going on between the U.S. and Iran, even with the ongoing conflict over its nuclear ambitions. "Each time a leader brings out the best things in the people they are fighting, magical things happen," Gopin said. "In the Jewish tradition King Cyrus is known as the divinely anointed figure who enabled the Jews to restore their sacred institutions," said Rabbi Sarah Bassin, executive director of the foundation NewGround, a Muslim-Jewish Partnership for Change.
