-- Eleven members of Greenpeace pleaded not guilty to federal charges after they were arrested for hanging a banner on South Dakota's Mount Rushmore Wednesday to protest global warming as the G-8 summit in Italy begins. Greenpeace, a nonprofit organization that supports environmental causes, said the sign is part of a global day of action to urge world leaders at the G-8 summit to make global warming a priority and to take the actions necessary to stop climate change. "We're here at Mount Rushmore to inspire Americans to take action, and remind the world that heroism and leadership are part of our nation's history -- and must be a part of our future," Muffet said. Watch tourists react to the protest Â» Some of the demonstrators breached a controlled area and got to the top of the monument, Mount Rushmore spokeswoman Patty Rooney told CNN. "We are at a key moment in history when we must challenge our president to take real leadership," said Carroll Muffet, deputy campaign director for Greenpeace.
