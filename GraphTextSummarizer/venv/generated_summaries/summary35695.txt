"All eyes are on the Russian president -- President Putin," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday. The question now for Americans on Syria -- rather than whether the United States should launch military strikes after the regime of Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons on his own people -- is who they think is a better negotiating partner for Obama: Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who favored giving the president authority to launch military strikes, told CNN's Dana Bash that the president is making it hard for Congress to work with him on just about anything. Congress or Vladimir Putin? Obama will need senators like Corker to work with him now that Syria has been paused on Capitol Hill.
