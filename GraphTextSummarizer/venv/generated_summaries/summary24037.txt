One winning ticket was sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyrhills, Florida, according to David Bishop, deputy secretary of the Florida lottery. In Florida, winners must claim prizes at a state lottery retailer or lottery district office on or before the 180th day after the drawing. It marks the largest in Powerball history, surpassing a $587.6 million jackpot split by winners in Arizona and Missouri in November. About 100 people an hour were buying tickets at the store. Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
