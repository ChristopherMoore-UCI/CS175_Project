Holmes keeps track of the states they've seen in an Excel spreadsheet, using the list to plan what stops they'll make on future trips. Wendy Holmes says that she and her husband, Chris, have been taking their 13-year-old daughter Cate and 7-year-old son Tom on trips since they were infants. These road trips are "highlight trips." He and his wife, Dana, had been taking long road trips during their summers off from teaching since 2009. The bet lasted 15 years, until Carswell received a postcard from White declaring he had reached his 50th state.
