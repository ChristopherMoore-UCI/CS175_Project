Defending champion Radwanska, who reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon earlier this year, accepted that the better player had prevailed on the day. The final set was more evenly contested with Petrova claiming a decisive break in the eighth game to lead 5-3, before holding serve to seal her second title of the season. Russia's Nadia Petrova stunned Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland in the Pan Pacific Open final in Tokyo on Saturday winning in three sets 6-0 1-6 6-3. The 30-year-old stormed into a one-set lead, breaking the world No.3 three times in the opening set before Radwanska rallied in the second. The victory sees Petrova move up four places in the world rankings to No.14.
