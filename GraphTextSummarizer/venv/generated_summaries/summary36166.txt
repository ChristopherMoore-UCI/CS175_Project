For the past year, Eckel has been gathering evidence of Chinese involvement in ivory poaching, carving and trafficking right along the very same road. Those included a dealer with sculpted ivory and a Chinese national who was attempting to board a flight with ivory jewelry after bribing his way through. On the drive to jail, the English-speaking boss continued to deny he had any information about the ring or ivory moving through Moyoy camp. But without actually finding the ivory in the hands of Chinese nationals, Eckel has largely been unable to make any arrests and unable to convince authorities to follow any of his leads. "We got ivory, with the Chinese!"
