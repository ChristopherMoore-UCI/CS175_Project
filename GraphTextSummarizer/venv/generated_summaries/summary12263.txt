-- Russian leaders reacted angrily Thursday to President Barack Obama's decision to slap further sanctions on Russian banks, energy firms and defense companies over Russia's actions in Ukraine. Ukraine's government has accused Russia of allowing weapons and military equipment, including tanks, to cross the border illegally into the hands of pro-Russian separatists. " As deadly violence continues to roil eastern Ukraine, European Union leaders also said they intended to increase sanctions, signaling growing Western concern about Russia's continued support for the separatists battling the Ukrainian military. Ukrainian jet 'shot down' Tensions between Ukraine and its larger neighbor showed no sign of easing Thursday, as Ukrainian officials reportedly accused a Russian fighter of shooting down a Ukrainian jet the previous evening while it was flying in Ukrainian airspace. Also on the list: Four Russian government officials, including the minister of Crimean affairs; the self-styled Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic leading the separatist campaign in eastern Ukraine; and Aleksandr Borodai, the self-declared "Prime Minister" of the Donetsk group.
