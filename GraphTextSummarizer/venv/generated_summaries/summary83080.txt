Murray complained to chair umpire Pascal Maria about something Berdych said after the first set ended and Berdych didn't appear pleased at Murray's reaction when the 2010 Wimbledon finalist dropped his serve at 5-3 in the first. Murray reached a fourth final in Melbourne when he beat Berdych 6-7 (6) 6-0 6-3 7-5 in an ill-tempered affair, meaning he is on the verge of winning a third grand slam title and first since he ended Britain's nearly 80-year drought at Wimbledon in 2013. But after he was broken straight back, things swung in Murray's favor despite Berdych claiming the roughly 80-minute first set. " It wouldn't be the first time a player's partner taunted an opponent -- and Roger Federer's wife, Mirka, seemed to do it to defending Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka at the World Tour Finals in November. Television cameras also seemed to show Murray's fiancee, Kim Sears, mouthing an obscenity towards Berdych or his camp -- which included Dani Vallverdu, who used to coach Murray -- during the match.
