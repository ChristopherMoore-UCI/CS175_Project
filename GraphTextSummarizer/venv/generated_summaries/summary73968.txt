Common symptoms of eyestrain and/or CVS include: sore eyes, dry eyes, teary eyes, blurry vision, double vision, light sensitivity, difficulty focusing on images, neck pain, headache or a combination of all of the above. The verdict: Computer use can definitely strain your eyes -- but there are ways to combat the damage Studies have shown that between 50 and 90% of people who work in front of a computer screen have some symptoms of eye trouble. "We definitely see a lot of people who complain of eyestrain," says opthalmologist Dr. Brian Boxer Wachler. And because computer work often requires intense concentration, frequent breaks are a must. Wachler says that people usually blink around 18 times per minute, which refreshes the eyes naturally.
