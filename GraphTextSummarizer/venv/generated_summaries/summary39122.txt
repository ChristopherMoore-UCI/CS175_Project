Braydon Nichols' heartbreaking letter urging the world never to forget his father, Army Chief Warrant Officer Bryan Nichols, sparked thousands of comments and at least 230 iReports filled with love and support for the boy. Army veteran Shane Farlin told CNN that Braydon's story made him think about how close he came to losing his life and the chance to watch his son grow up. Little Shane is Farlin's "clone," just as Braydon Nichols was so much like his father. Braydon is getting good grades and doing as well as any kid could, Monte Nichols added. "We all deal with it differently," said Monte Nichols, Brian Nichols' brother.
