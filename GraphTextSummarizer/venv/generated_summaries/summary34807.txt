In separate actions brought by federal authorities in Miami and Denver, and announced along with the Los Angeles indictments by the Department of Justice, 14 additional defendants, some of whom are linked to Armenian Power, were charged Wednesday with extortion, money laundering and fraud offenses, among other crimes, authorities said. In the Orange County case, which names 20 defendants, Armenian Power members allegedly targeted elderly people in a bank fraud scheme, and members also worked with African-American street gangs and allegedly bribed bank insiders to gather information that allowed them to take over bank accounts, authorities said. Members of Armenian Power have a heritage going back to Armenia and other Eastern Bloc countries, and the crime group started as a street gang in East Hollywood, California, in the 1980s, authorities said. -- Authorities announced charges Wednesday against 99 members of a transnational organized crime group in southern California called the Armenian Power, whose enterprise allegedly collected $20 million through kidnapping, extortion, bank fraud and narcotics trafficking. Armenian Power, also known as AP-13, has close ties with the prison gang Mexican Mafia, which controls much of the narcotics distribution in California's prisons, and maintains connections with Russian and Armenian crime figures known as "Thieves-in-Law," authorities said.
