Opinion: The myth of energy independence When oil and gas are produced, they're accompanied by "flowback water", which contains a mix of toxic chemicals found underground. Meanwhile increased production of cleaner burning natural gas has helped cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions to their lowest level in more than a decade. These changes are driven by a technique known as "fracking," short for hydraulic fracturing, which is being used to produce oil and gas trapped in dense shale rock. Opinion: Don't let America get 'fracked' A lot of enthusiasts for oil and gas are hostile to new rules. It's no surprise that concerns about fracking began to really rise in 2009, when the practice migrated from states like Texas and Louisiana, where oil and gas development is commonplace, to Pennsylvania, where oil production peaked in 1891.
