Remember this was during the Bush Administration -- George W. Bush had called North Korea part of the Axis of Evil, and yet change was in the air. Maestro Maazel was thrilled; just as ping pong diplomacy had opened the door to normalizing relations between the United States and communist China, he told me he hoped musical diplomacy could do the same with one of the last bastions of entrenched communist dictatorship. In light of the U.S. government accusing North Korea of the massive hack-attack against Sony at the end of this year, it is extraordinary to look back and reflect on a different atmosphere that existed between the two countries for a brief moment in time. Lorin Maazel died without realizing this dream, but I am grateful to have been there for that brief moment in time when he brought hope and the sound of beautiful music to North Korea. While we weren't close friends, I think I can say we bonded through an extraordinary  shared experience: The 2008 visit by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra to Pyongyang, North Korea.
