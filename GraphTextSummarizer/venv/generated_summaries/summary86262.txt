"Our long experience in food distribution tells us that by delivering food into the hands of women, it is more likely to be redistributed equitably among the household -- including the men," Prior said. "This new system will allow us to provide food assistance to more people, more quickly through a robust network of fixed distribution sites." -- Massive food distribution coordinated by the World Food Programme, international aid agencies and the Haitian government will begin Sunday in the quake-ravaged capital. Women are receiving the food vouchers because they tend to be responsible for the household food supply, said WFP spokesman Marcus Prior. Multinational troops, including the U.S. military, will help secure food convoys and the distribution sites, Prior said.
