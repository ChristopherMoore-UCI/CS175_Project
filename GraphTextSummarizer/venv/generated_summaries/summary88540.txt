Campos-Martinez and Medellin shared a Hollywood apartment for about six months, Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Bobby Grace said. Gabriel Campos-Martinez, 38, was charged Monday in the death of 66-year-old Hervey Medellin, whose head and several other body parts were found by a woman walking her dog in Hollywood's Griffith Park on January 17, 2012, according to the Los Angeles district attorney. Cadaver dogs eventually found several hands and feet -- but no torso -- in the wooded area, which is near the home of actor Brad Pitt. The dog walker whose golden retriever, Ollie, discovered the head near a trail below the Hollywood sign said she at first thought the head was a movie prop. "Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop," Lauren Kornberg said in 2012.
