"Don McLean's manuscript of 'American Pie' achieved the 3rd highest auction price for an American literary manuscript, a fitting tribute to one the foremost singer-songwriters of his generation," Christie's Tom Lecky said in a statement. The draft that was auctioned is 16 pages: 237 lines of manuscript and 26 lines of typed text, according to Christie's. " Over the years, "American Pie" has become one of the most dissected and argued-about songs in the pop music canon. The lyrics to the famed Don McLean song sold for $1.2 million Tuesday morning at an auction held by Christie's. That's some rich "American Pie."
