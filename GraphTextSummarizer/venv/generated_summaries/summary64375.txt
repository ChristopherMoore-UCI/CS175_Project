-- Joel "Taz" DiGregorio, keyboardist and original member of The Charlie Daniels Band, died Wednesday night from injuries he suffered in a single car wreck in Cheatham County, Tennessee. Because of his death, the band canceled a Thursday night concert in Georgia and a show Saturday night in Connecticut. "I am in shock now, Taz was one of my best friends," Charlie Daniels said in a statement. We're going to miss you buddy," Daniels said. DiGregorio was on his way to meet the band's tour bus when his car crashed near Nashville.
