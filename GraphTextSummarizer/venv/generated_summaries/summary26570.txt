The space agency says its OSIRIS camera was able to capture detail down to just a few dozen meters. The next stop for the Rosetta spacecraft -- named for the stone that helped decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics -- is comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Holger Sierks with the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research described the asteroid as "a very old object" in a statement Saturday. Pictures of the asteroid Lutetia from the Rosetta probe's deep space fly-by Saturday are some of the most detailed ever taken, the European Space Agency said. -- A European space probe headed toward its next target Sunday after sending back detailed images of an asteroid that scientists hope will increase understanding of how the solar system evolved.
