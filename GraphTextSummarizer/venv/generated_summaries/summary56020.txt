-- Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini bracketed his striker Sergio Aguero with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as one of the "three best players in the world" after the Argentine led his side's 6-0 rout of Tottenham Hotspur Sunday. Tottenham were on the back foot from the moment goalkeeper Hugo Lloris blundered straight from the kick off to hand Navas the chance to score exquisitely from a tight angle. Negredo and Navas added further goals as a Tottenham defense which had conceded just six goals all season disintegrated. Aguero's strike partner Alvaro Negredo was on target and an own goal from Brazilian international Sandro made for an afternoon of sheer misery for Andre Villas-Boas' visitors. It was a stunning reaffirmation of City's title credentials and lifted them to fourth in the standings, while Tottenham on a poor recent run, dropped to ninth.
