What do the photos reveal that history often forgets? Farber: One of the great historical facts about the march was the difficulty in pulling off an event that was pioneered by a number of organizations and individuals with different definitions and investments of social change at the march. "Leonard Freed's moving photography offers still images of an America at once frozen in time and marching restlessly to its multicultural and multiracial future through the lens of a visionary artist," Michael Eric Dyson writes in the foreword to the book.

"This is the Day: The March on Washington," is a collection of 75 of Leonard Freed's photographs -- most published for the first time -- taken before, during and after the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
