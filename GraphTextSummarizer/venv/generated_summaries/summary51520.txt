Many presidential daughters have gone on to author books about their time in White House, in what Wead describes as an attempt to restore their fathers' reputations. Johnson was catapulted into the exclusive fraternity of White House families and embraced what she describes as a role she landed simply by chance. "She was an American celebrity," said presidential historian Doug Wead. "I describe it as the best of times and sometimes the worst of times, but whatever the times, it was a time of extraordinary privilege." While the interest in first daughters has stayed steady, the pressure on the children has intensified, said Wead, author of "All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families."
