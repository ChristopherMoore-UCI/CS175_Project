The family of ISIS hostage and U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig released a YouTube video Saturday asking his captors to show mercy and free him. Referring to him as Abdul-Rahman -- a first name his family says he took, having converted to Islam while being held hostage -- father Ed Kassig said: "We implore his captors to show mercy and use their power to let our son go. In a statement Friday, Kassig's parents, Ed and Paula Kassig of Indianapolis, confirmed that their son was being held hostage by ISIS but provided no other details on his abduction. Kassig's family said SERA was dedicated to providing first-response humanitarian aid for refugees fleeing the widening civil war in Syria. The family said they understand, "from speaking to former hostages, that Kassig's faith has provided him comfort during his long captivity."
