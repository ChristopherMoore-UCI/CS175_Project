TLC, the network that introduced the bickering couple and their eight kids to the nation, has not only put the kibosh on "Jon & Kate Plus 8" but also filed a breach of contract lawsuit Friday against Jon Gosselin. TLC would like to be able to replace "Jon & Kate" with the renamed series "Kate Plus 8," but the network will have to get past Jon Gosselin first. "In any event," the statement added, "when TLC and Discovery ended the program 'Jon & Kate Jon has also "entered a lucrative agreement with 'Entertainment Tonight' and its companion show, 'The Insider' to discuss his family and the problems he was having with Mrs. Gosselin," according to TLC's complaint. It's unclear when either of the Gosselins will return to television after "Jon & Kate" becomes part of reality TV history.
