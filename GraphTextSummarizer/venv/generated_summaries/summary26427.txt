The states of New York and New Jersey had loaned the city 35 ambulances to help reduce the backlog of emergency medical services requests during the storm. The National Weather Service has issued a winter storm watch for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut starting early Friday. In one instance, a newborn died in Brooklyn after the mother waited nine hours for emergency responders, said Fire Department spokesman Steve Rittea. He added that John Doherty, Sanitation Department chief, has made management and personnel shake-ups in Brooklyn following sharp criticism for the city's slow reaction to the holiday blizzard. That response has prompted an investigation into whether sanitation workers intentionally delayed clean-up efforts over frustrations of demotions and citywide budget cuts.
