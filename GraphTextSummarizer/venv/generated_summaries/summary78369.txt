Groups will be allowed into the Supreme Court starting on Tuesday ahead of 10 a.m. ET arguments on California's voter-approved ban on gay marriage known as Proposition 8. Some are spectators, while others are place-holders for big law firms or advocacy groups. People arrived on Thursday night when temperatures in the capital dipped into the 30s and had grown to about a half-dozen people by Friday afternoon. Last year, spectators also lined up the weekend before the Supreme Court heard arguments on the health care reform law. A separate challenge to the federal law known as the Defense of Marriage Act will be argued Wednesday.
