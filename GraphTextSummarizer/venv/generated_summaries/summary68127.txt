"The state government enlisted the help of the vigilantes and hunters to combat Boko Haram and it is paying off," Bobi said.â€Ž A resident of Mubi said Boko Haram militants fled the town in droves after the arrival of some 200 vigilantes and hunters, who were armed with homemade guns, spears, clubs, bows and arrows and machetes. Boko Haram fighters late Thursday took over at least three towns in northeast Nigeria, including Chibok, the scene of the April kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls by the militant group, residents and a lawmaker said Friday. The resident, who asked not to be named for personal safety, said hunters captured the ousted occupiers' leader "outside the military barracks, which the militants (had) converted into their base." Vigilantes reportedly reclaimed another town, Maiha, from Boko Haram on Wednesday after a fierce battle in which dozens of militants were killed. Local hunters and vigilantes had pushed them out of Mubi, which lies near Nigeria's border with Cameroon and is the commercial hub of the state. "Boko Haram are all over the town firing heavy guns as they patrol the streets," said Gombi resident Dahiru Sahabi.
