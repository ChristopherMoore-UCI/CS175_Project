Dr. Andrea Minyard testified Wednesday, the second day of Gonzalez's first-degree murder trial in Escambia County Circuit Court in Pensacola. After shooting Byrd Billings the first time, Gonzalez said "where's the money at, and he told him to get up," said Thornton, 20. There was no camera in the master bedroom, but prosecution witnesses Wednesday cited DNA tests as showing that Gonzalez likely handled the rifle used in the fatal shootings. Florence testified that he was told the plotters were trying to get laundered cash believed to be in a safe at the house, as the Billings family was "washing money from the Mexican mafia." Defense attorneys for Gonzalez questioned the credibility of the two witnesses, since they are related (Florence is the father of a child born to Thornton's sister) and had changed the stories they told their family and police, saying they had "practiced lying." Also Wednesday, the jury of 11 women and two men saw prosecutors try to establish the guns used in the crime, as well as see the safe taken from the Billings' home. Byrd Billings had even donated $5,000 to the Gonzalez's school.
