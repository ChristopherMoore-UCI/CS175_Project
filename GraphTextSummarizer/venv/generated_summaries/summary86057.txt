Second is that search results for individuals using European versions of Google (that is, google.co.uk rather than google.com) will now often include a message at the bottom that reads: "Some results may have been removed under data protection law in Europe." Both wrote pieces about the experience; Peston's had an understandably dramatic headline: "Why has Google cast me into oblivion?" In both Ball's and Peston's cases, many of the stories that they had been notified about did not seem to fall into categories covered by the Google Spain ruling: old, irrelevant stories about people who were not public figures. Peston says: "Google insists it is simply complying with the relevant articles in the European Court of Justice's ruling." If the request appears valid -- and how that is determined is one key issue -- there seem to be three parts to their response: First is the removal of the search result -- and it must be remembered that it is only search results when a particular name is searched for that are removed, not the source material nor search results for that material when searched for in any other way. They are already acting as censors -- and as they tailor search results to the individual anyway, they are already choosing what people see and read -- and what they don't see and read.
