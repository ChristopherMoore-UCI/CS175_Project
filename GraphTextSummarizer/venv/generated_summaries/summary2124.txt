Researchers at internet security firm Symantec say they have identified a new virus called Duqu that they believe is a successor to Stuxnet, although not all security experts agree. Iran's nuclear facilities are under siege from cyber attacks. So, Stuxnet infected a third party first, likely a trusted contractor to the Natanz facility. The Natanz computer network is a closed system, separated from any other network or internet access. And one, the Stuxnet virus, was able to penetrate Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, researchers say.
