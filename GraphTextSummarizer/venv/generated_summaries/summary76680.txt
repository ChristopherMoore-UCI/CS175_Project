Part of the reason for Scary Movie 5's sub-par performance may have to do with the fact that it arrived in theaters a full seven years after Scary Movie 4, which earned $40.2 million in its opening weekend in 2006. Scary Movie 5, which Weinstein/Dimension spent $20 million to produce, drew less interest than similar horror spoof A Haunted House, which scared up an $18.1 million opening in January â€” against a $1.5 million budget no less! Warner Bros. says it plans on expanding the film from its already-wide 3,002 theater count next weekend. The film opens stateside next weekend. According to Warner Bros., a surprisingly high 52 percent of the opening weekend crowd was female.
