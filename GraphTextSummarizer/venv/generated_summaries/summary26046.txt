Military club closes ranks to gay wife Collins was stationed at a New Mexico base before he was seen by a co-worker kissing his boyfriend in their car while stopped at an intersection off-base, the ACLU said. "There was absolutely no need to subject these service members to a double dose of discrimination by removing them from the armed forces in the first place, and then denying them this small benefit to ease the transition to civilian life," said Laura Schauer Ives, an ACLU lawyer. The total payment in the settlement is about $2.4 million or about $14,000 per former service member, according to the ACLU. The settlement covers service members who fit the criteria and were discharged after November 10, 2004, the ACLU said. The lead plaintiff in the case, according to court documents, was Richard Collins, a former staff sergeant in the Air Force who served for nine years until he was discharged.
