" At the moment, fewer than 1% of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy, but Jongen is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game changer. In Belgium, engineer and nuclear physicist Yves Jongen is pioneering a new therapy that targets cancers with proton radiation; a therapy that offers precision and minimal side effects. Encased in a two-metre thick concrete bunker that serves as a radiation shield, one of Jongen's cyclotron machines produces proton beams to treat cancer patients. "I started to designing equipment (for) proton therapy of cancer -- that was a radically new idea," Jongen told CNN. Health practitioners have been searching for a magic bullet that goes straight to the source of the cancer -- and everything from monoclonal antibodies, which carry cancer drugs direct to cancer cells, to straight surgery to cut out tumors have been used with varying degrees of success.
