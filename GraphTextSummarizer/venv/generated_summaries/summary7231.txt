These days reality shows have replaced talk shows as theaters of the outrageous, which was not the case when Springer's show debuted. The company that owned the affiliate also owned talk shows like Phil Donahue, Sally Jessy Raphael, etc." Springer, 66, said that as Donahue was getting close to retirement, Springer was asked to helm a talk show. "What you can say is that Jerry Springer was often accused of setting up guests, having actors pose as real people and that sort of thing in an attempt to convince the Springer audience that what they were seeing were real people acting in crazy and buffoonish ways and that is similar to reality TV." " Jake Halpern, author of "Fame Junkies: The Hidden Truths Behind America's Favorite Addiction," said shows like "Springer" and reality television feed viewers' "deep-rooted desire to see spectacle and the most tawdry things. " As "The Jerry Springer Show" celebrates its 20th anniversary on the air, it occupies a part of the realm of pop culture that has moved well beyond tossing of chairs and attacking cheating spouses.
