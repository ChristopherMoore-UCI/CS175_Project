But we do know that it takes place in Romania and tells the story of a young man (Charlie Countryman, played by Shia LaBeouf), who falls for a Romanian girl (played by Evan Rachel Wood). Sundance Film Festival LaBeouf, who has a reputation of going the distance for roles, like drinking moonshine to learn about his character in last year's "Lawless," reportedly took acid for a scene in which Charlie Countryman sees his dead mother while in a drug-induced state. " Wood, who recently announced that she and husband Jamie Bell are expecting their first child, is known for her daring roles, starting with 2003â€²s controversial film "Thirteen" and running throughout her career, including last year's HBO film "Mildred Pierce." Wood compares the film to 1993 Quentin Tarantino-penned romantic crime thriller "True Romance." While LaBeouf's character is an American who travels to Romania, Wood had to adopt the accent, with the help of a dialect coach.
