In the meantime, until he can post bail with legitimate bills, he will be held at Burlington County Jail. On Thursday, at White's first appearance in Superior Court, his bail was set at $7,500, because of outstanding charges from Camden County added on to the Burlington County charges. According to Cinnaminson Police Chief Steven Fowler, the department issued a warrant for White's arrest after his counterfeit bail posting of $400, but because he was a Camden resident, it was out of jurisdiction. Burlington County prosecutor's office representative Joel Bewley said that because White did not produce the counterfeit bills but merely attempted to purchase goods with them, the official charge was theft by unlawful taking. White had posted bail using at least two bills bearing identical serial numbers, police say, and the serial numbers also matched those on one of the bills found on him when he returned to the Cinnaminson jail to reclaim his extra $200.
