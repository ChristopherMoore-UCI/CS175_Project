The reason micro-financing has taken off like wildfire is that small loans to individuals to help them buy their own land or start their own businesses turn out to pay off handsomely. I participate in Start Fund, started by philanthropist Fred Matser of the Netherlands. But there are now many online resources for directing your gift into micro-financing. Know exactly where your money is going, and demand progress reports. Invest in the future, which means directing your gift to young people.
