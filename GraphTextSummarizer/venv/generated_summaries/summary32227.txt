"The NTSB remains focused on the important investigative work being done to determine what caused Asiana Airlines Flight 214 to crash so that we can make safety recommendations to prevent it from happening again," spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in a statement late on Sunday. Did Asiana pilot have enough 777 experience? "Regarding the KTVU-TV's demeaning report of the pilots on July 12, Asiana Airlines is reviewing possible legal action against KTVU-TV and the NTSB," the airline said in a statement. Asiana Airlines is considering legal action against an Oakland television station and the National Transportation Safety Board after an intern at the agency mistakenly confirmed "inaccurate and offensive" names as those of the pilots of ill-fated Flight 214. The safety board, which is investigating last week's runway crash in San Francisco that killed three people and injured more than 180 others, did not address Asiana's potential legal concerns directly.
