If the next round of tests also yields negative results, then the government can deem the outbreak to be over -- it is only then that South Africa can apply to the European Union, their biggest importer of ostrich meat, to lift their ban and farmers can start restocking. "Tremendously frustrated -- it has been a battle of unanswered questions, it has been sleepless nights, it has been staff concerns, it has been financial concerns. South Africa is the global leader in ostrich farming. "I will not get out of this industry, I will keep fighting until we get birds back on this property and do what we have been doing for more than 100 years," adds Hooper. Hooper is just one of the hundreds of Oudtshoorn farmers facing tough times after the H5N2 virus was first detected in the region in April -- the strain, officials say, does not pose a threat to humans but could mutate and affect poultry.
