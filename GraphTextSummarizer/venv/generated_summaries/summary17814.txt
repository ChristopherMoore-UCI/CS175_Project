On Friday, the Canadian Coast Guard ship Tanu rendezvoused with the sailboat and was transporting the three fishermen northbound back to Prince Rupert, according to the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria. -- Three shipwrecked fishermen lived on clams and seaweed for 10 days while stranded on an island off Canada's Pacific Coast until a passing sailboat rescued them, the Royal Canadian Navy said Friday. The three fishermen were scheduled to arrive Friday night, and no injuries have been reported, authorities said. Mackenzie Moseley, maritime coordinator for Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Victoria, described Banks Island as "real remote piece of coast with no real population." The sailor radioed the Prince Rupert Coast Guard and then he anchored and launched a dinghy to approach the island shore, Moseley said.
