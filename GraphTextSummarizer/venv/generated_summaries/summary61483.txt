This idyllic community, home to just 50 people comes complete with grand Edwardian manor house, cricket pavilion and grounds, blacksmith's forge, rectory, shooting grounds, 22 houses and grade 2 listed cottages. "That," joked local estate agent Tim Sherston, "is owned by God." Watch as village goes on sale Â» He says: "I'd like to see an Englishman live in the manor, run the farm and the shoot like it used to be." Indeed, Linkenholt is idyllic; within the beautiful surroundings classified as an area of outstanding beauty, this is a village full of characters and local tales. Sherston maintains that Linkenholt is not only a rare opportunity; it is a sound buy.
