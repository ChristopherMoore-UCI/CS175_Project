Clinton, a New York resident, also touched on a New York Times report that Obama administration officials have urged New York Gov. David A. Paterson to withdraw from the 2010 race. While some criticism targeting President Obama is racially motivated, the fight over health care isn't, former President Clinton told CNN. " "I believe that some of the right-wing extremists which oppose President Obama are also racially prejudiced and would prefer not to have an African-American president," Clinton told CNN's Larry King in a wide-ranging interview that aired Monday evening. "First, it's more up to them than it is to President Obama," Clinton said. " Clinton also discussed the conflict in Afghanistan, addressing top U.S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal's report warning Obama that more troops are needed within the coming year or the nearly 8-year-old war "will likely result in failure," according to a copy of a 66-page document obtained by The Washington Post. Obama has promised to ask "tough questions" before deciding whether to send additional troops to Afghanistan, saying it was necessary to have a clear strategy in place before deploying resources.
