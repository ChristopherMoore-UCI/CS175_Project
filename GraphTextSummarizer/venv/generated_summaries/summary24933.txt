While many Egyptians feel George W. Bush had a clear position on democracy and freedom of speech in Egypt, Obama came to Cairo in 2009 and made promises to the Egyptian people that were not necessarily kept. In neighborhoods across Cairo, men and women in smoke-filled cafes tune in to daily political talk shows discussing Egypt's own crisis and fears for the future -- a new phenomenon in post-Mubarak days -- on televisions blaring so loud that entire neighborhoods can hear them. Even though Bush is generally regarded negatively for his "War on Terror," it is interesting to hear some engaged political activists say that they miss the Bush days, preferring his support of freedom of speech in Egypt when compared to the Obama administration. One long-time activist said that during the days of Bush, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice made several visits to Egypt, underlining the importance of democracy and freedom of speech. At the Greek Club, or inside the historic Cafe Riche, with its warm amber-tinted windows and walls lined with photos of Egypt's great intellectuals, Cairo's political activists and academics gather over beers to talk about the great issues of the day.
