The heart problem was probably not related to Michaels' brain hemorrhage, said Dr. Joseph Zabramski, the neurosurgeon who treated his brain hemorrhage. "Without treatment for the PFO, Michaels could be at risk for developing blood clots and additional stroke," hospital spokeswoman Carmelle Malkovich said. Michaels, 47, delayed the surgery until this month to allow him to complete a concert tour and appear on the season finale of the reality show "Celebrity Apprentice," which he won last summer. The hole, medically known as a patent foramen ovale, was discovered last April while Michaels was being treated for a brain hemorrhage at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix. He became a reality TV star by headlining the VH1 show "Rock of Love With Bret Michaels" as well as appearing on "Celebrity Apprentice."
