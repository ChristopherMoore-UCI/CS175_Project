This initiative purchases food from area farmers, which is distributed to food bank partners in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota. Finnegans' CEO Jacquie Berglund sums it up this way: "At Finnegan's we turn beer into food. We have 1500 volunteers that come not for beer, but to help pack food at the food banks. These opportunities to give beer buffs an opportunity to do good is already proving to be a benefit for the industry, nonprofits and the communities they serve. And as more bars and breweries join this trend, the idea of giving back can be introduced and embraced with each round, as it was with me and that glass of Second Helping.
