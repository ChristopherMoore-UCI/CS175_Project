Punctured with the gravity of the unspeakable cruelty women have endured in Liberia and Yemen and with the humor that can come only from women who have led the battle to end it, the conversation reflected the indomitable spirit for which the Nobel was awarded. For most of the 1990s, Liberia meant bloodshed, a maelstrom of violence that bled across its borders and where, child soldiers became killers and warlords became presidents. Gbowee supposes that many others are deserving of a Nobel Peace Prize for their roles in securing peace in Liberia. Saturday, she was asked if Yemen was perhaps the worst place on earth for women. "Beyond fighting for our individual countries, we are fighting for the emancipation of women and girls," said Leymah Gbowee.
