-- You couldn't really call him a "Bond villain" in the grander context of Dr. No, Auric Goldfinger, Hugo Drax or that annoyingly resilient cat-fancier Ernst Stavros Blofeld. He embraced his Jaws-inspired notoriety with abiding grace and generosity. He continued to act, became a born-again Christian after a bout with alcoholism and even co-wrote a biography of the Kentucky abolitionist Cassius Clay for whom the Louisville-born Muhammad Ali was originally named. In any case, we had so much fun watching him chase Roger Moore's plummy-voiced version of Bond in 1977's "The Spy Who Loved Me" that we cheered upon first seeing him return in 1979's "Moonraker." The man who played the role, Richard Kiel, died Wednesday in Los Angeles at 74.
