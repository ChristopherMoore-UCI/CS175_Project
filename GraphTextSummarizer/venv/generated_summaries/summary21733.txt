" In his first television interview since taking office, the new justice minister said last week that Egyptian courts would not shy away from sentencing Mubarak to death if he is found guilty. -- Former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak could be executed if he is convicted of ordering the killing of protesters But Justice Minister al-Juindy said Mubarak's health was "good," according to reports he had received. Prosecutors last month shelved plans to move him to a military hospital in Cairo, saying Mubarak's doctors said the transfer could be life-threatening. Adel Saeed, the prosecutor's spokesman, said April 26 that the Interior Ministry made the decision after Mubarak's medical team submitted a report that determined he would be at risk if he were moved.
