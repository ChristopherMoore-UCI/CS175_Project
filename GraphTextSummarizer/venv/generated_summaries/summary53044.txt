I have a hard time identifying with people who do have children and have felt the brunt of many of their judgments. I want people to know that I like children. I realize that by publishing it, I run the risk of being ostracized and alienated by many people. In the wake of the Supreme Court decision that struck down key portions the Defense of Marriage Act, I celebrated this historic milestone like many Americans as a step toward acceptance of all people. I was never the kind of person who thought I'd champion for individual rights or equality.
