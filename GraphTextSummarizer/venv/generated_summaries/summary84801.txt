Erik Johnson of Lindenhurst says his iPhone 5C spontaneously erupted in extreme heat while it was in his pants pocket, giving him second- and third-degree burnson his leg the size of a football. Mike Della, a personal injury lawyer on Long Island who is representing Johnson, says despite two phone calls and a letter, Apple had not yet responded to his queries about why his client's phone suddenly exploded in heat. Johnson purchased the phone last year and had not been using a battery case or third-party charger, Della said. "I heard a sizzling, and I ended up ripping my pants off to stop it from burning me." Johnson said he didn't know what was causing the pain at first and there was no warning -- just an extreme burn and a lot of pain. After being evaluated in the emergency room, Johnson was taken by ambulance to the Burn Center at Staten Island University Hospital.
