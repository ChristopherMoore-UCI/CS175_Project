"I assume, like many Americans, he has seen that Cuba is a place where they have a beautiful climate and a lot of fun things to do," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. " The Obama administration on Wednesday said it was easing restrictions on certain types of travel to Cuba, including visits to family members, trips by journalists and religious activities. A visit by the President to Cuba would be historic; even a phone call between Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro on Tuesday marked the first presidential engagement between the two nations since the Cuban Revolution. Commerce Secretary Penny Pritzker will travel there in the near future, and Secretary of State John Kerry said he looked "forward to being the first secretary of state in 60 years to visit Cuba." -- President Barack Obama could be among the Americans traveling to Cuba now that restrictions on passage to the island are being loosened.
