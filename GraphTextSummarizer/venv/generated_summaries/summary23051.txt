Katherine Jackson and her grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson are the chief beneficiaries of the Michael Jackson estate. "I know of no other item that has ever been made available to the public that has been signed by both the parents and children of Michael Jackson." Blanket, whose real name is Prince Michael II, Paris and Prince Jackson each signed the artist proof belt at the Encino, California, home where they live with their grandmother. Another company, Bravado, has a contract with the estate to market Michael Jackson merchandise, Bates said. "This is a truly one-of-a-kind opportunity," said Jerry Olivarez, the Jackson family friend who helped bring the deal together. The first belt produced -- known as the "artist's proof" -- was autographed by Michael Jackson's three children and his parents for a special auction set to start Thursday.
