India are the current world champions in 50 overs cricket, helped to victory on home soil in 2011 by national hero Tendulkar. Each of their top five batsmen scored a half century, with captain George Bailey top scoring on 92 not out. Tendulkar will play his final Test match on his home ground in Mumbai next month against the West Indies, completing 200 appearances at this level. It was the second highest score to win a 50 overs international, only beaten by the astonishing 436 runs by a South African side in Johannesburg in 2006, with Australia again the unfortunate opposition. -- With their nation still absorbing the shock of Sachin Tendulkar's retirement, the next generation of Indian stars showed their ability with a stunning run chase to beat Australia in a one-day international Wednesday.
