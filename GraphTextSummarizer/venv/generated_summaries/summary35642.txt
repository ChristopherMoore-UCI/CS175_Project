For now, iPhone users of Google Maps can still use the "alternate routes" feature, with the live traffic layer enabled, to find their own ways around traffic. According to the Google Blog, Google Maps navigation previously "would choose whichever route was fastest, without taking current traffic conditions into account. That means that navigation will automatically guide you along the best route given the current traffic conditions." It will be interesting to see, as this feature develops, how well it adjusts for recurring or special events that not only cause congestion but also block traffic. -- Recently, Google announced that the Android version of its Google Maps app now automatically routes users around traffic when providing directions. Or you can try the HD Traffic feature on the TomTom iPhone app, which, according to Pocket-lint, has offered traffic-dodging functionality for some time.
