Severe storms are likely Saturday and Sunday in the Mississippi River, Ohio River and Tennessee River valleys, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. -- Early signs of recovery mixed with stormy forecasts Friday, as residents struggled to dig out of the most significant flood to hit the lower Mississippi River valley in more than 70 years. The flood is the most significant to hit the lower Mississippi River valley since at least 1937. But farther south, Vicksburg residents face a long and slow goodbye to the historic flood that submerged much of their city, forecasters said. It is designed to keep water from backing into parts of the Yazoo River delta.
