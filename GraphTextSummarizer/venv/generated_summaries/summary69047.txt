"CAS has registered the appeals filed by Mohammad Asif, Mohammad Amir and Salman Butt against the ICC Anti-Corruption Tribunal's decision of 5 February 2011," a CAS statement read. The trio were also told last month they will face criminal charges in Britain, along with their agent Mazhar Majeed, for conspiracy to obtain and accept corrupt payments, and conspiracy to cheat. Mohammad Amir, Salman Butt and Mohammad Asif have launched their challenges after the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), found them guilty of "spot-fixing. " Amir, 18, and Asif, 28, were found to have deliberately bowled no-balls during a Test match with England in August 2010 -- a match Pakistan lost -- while Butt was said to have been aware of the arrangement. -- Three Pakistan cricketers who were banned from the sport for five years announced on Monday they will appeal their suspensions in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).
