Pope: Don't let sea "become a vast cemetery" For 15 months cash-strapped Italy ran a program called Mare Nostrum, which rescued thousands of would-be refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean. Albahari says officials at smaller ports in Turkey, Egypt and Albania sometimes turn a blind eye to the human trafficking, which can be disguised by bringing migrants on board in small batches. But Mare Nostrum cost some $12 million a month and critics said it encouraged migrants to try to reach Europe. The Tyr also helped bring more than 400 migrants to a port in Sicily last month after rescuing them from ships that had set sail from Turkey. There is little sympathy for an expensive Europe-wide version of Mare Nostrum to pluck thousands of people from the Mediterranean.
