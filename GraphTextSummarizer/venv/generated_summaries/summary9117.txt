Investigation continues in another case Friday's arraignment came as authorities continue to investigate Hernandez in connection with an unsolved 2012 double homicide case in Boston. Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter said authorities have more than circumstantial evidence against Hernandez. Boston police had been looking for the vehicle for almost a year, law enforcement sources added. Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in the June 17 death of Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player. Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated the shooting of Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.
