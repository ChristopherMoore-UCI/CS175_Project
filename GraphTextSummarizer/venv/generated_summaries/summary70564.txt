The research indicates that cancer deaths can be prevented and lives saved among Hispanics if we increase use of proven cancer screening tests; make the hepatitis B and human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine more widely available; and reduce tobacco use, alcohol consumption and obesity rates. Hispanics do have higher diagnosis and death rates from cancers of the stomach, liver, cervix and gallbladder. Cancer death rates for all Americans have been decreasing since 1991. A weakness in the study of Hispanic cancer rates is the fact that much of the available U.S. data is an aggregate, masking important differences between Hispanic subpopulations according to country of origin. On the other hand, Cubans in America tend to have higher cancer rates than Puerto Ricans.
