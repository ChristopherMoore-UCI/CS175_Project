Republicans have been furious over Obama's use of executive power in other areas, from adjustments he made to Affordable Care Act requirements to his moves on immigration in November. The dynamic opens Republicans up to questions about whether they can have it both ways, expressing alarm and distrust about how Obama uses his powers on health care and immigration while backing him on trade and -- perhaps his biggest responsibility -- waging war. While the public often has strong opinions on domestic matters like immigration or health care, the same is not true for issues like TPA. Democrats, wary of another long war, are seeking strict limits on the use of U.S. ground forces. "There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws," House Speaker John Boehner said last February.
