For more on Fifty Shades of Grey, including exclusive interviews with author E L James, director Sam Taylor-Johnson, and the full story behind the casting of Christian and Anastasia — plus which scenes from the book have made it into the script, and which have already hit the cutting-room floor — pick up this week's issue of Entertainment Weekly, on stands Friday. The news, reported exclusively in this week's EW cover story, comes on the heels of the studio's announcement that it has pushed the start of production in Vancouver back a month to allow for the production to prep with its new leading man, Northern Irish actor Jamie Dornan, who plays kinky billionaire Christian Grey. Langley, who was instrumental in bringing the Fifty Shades franchise to the studio, adds that Universal would likely have made the change even if Charlie Hunnam, the original actor cast as Christian Grey, had not dropped out in mid-October.
