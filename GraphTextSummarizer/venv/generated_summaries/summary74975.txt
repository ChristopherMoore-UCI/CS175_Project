Ed Winter, assistant chief coroner at the Los Angeles County coroner's office, has said that while prescription medication was found in Houston's room, the amount was less than that usually present in overdose deaths. Cissy Houston and Bobbi Christina Brown were joined at the funeral home by music producer Clive Davis, credited with discovering a young Whitney Houston in the early 1980s. Houston's close friend, reality TV star and singer Ray J, released his first statement about her death, saying he feels an "emptiness" at her loss. Houston's death certificate is only fueling speculation about her death. They are trying to determine whether it played a role in Houston's death.
