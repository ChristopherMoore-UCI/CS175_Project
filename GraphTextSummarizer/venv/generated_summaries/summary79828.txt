On Wednesday, Former President Bill Clinton came to his wife's defense, joking during a public appearance that if Hillary had brain damage, "then I must be in really tough shape because she's still quicker than I am." In comments at a May 8 conference reported by the New York Post's Page Six gossip column, Rove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and wore "glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury" when she returned to public life. Tracy Sefl, a senior adviser for Ready for Hillary, one of the super PACs formed to back a Clinton candidacy, said Rove's tactic would backfire on Republicans because it boosted support for Clinton. Condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans came quickly, but Rove achieved his goal of inserting the question of Clinton's health into the national discussion before she has declared if she will run in an election more than two years away. Echo chamber Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, said Rove lied about Clinton's health but "he doesn't care, because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, and he's succeeding.
