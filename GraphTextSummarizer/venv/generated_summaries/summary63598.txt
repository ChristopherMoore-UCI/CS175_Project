Electoral College voters, called Electors, will meet on December 17 in their respective states and vote for president and vice president on separate ballots. With the likelihood of a Republican-controlled House and a Democratic-led Senate, an Electoral College tie between Obama and Romney would make possible a split administration, with Romney as president and incumbent Joe Biden as vice president. That would be especially true this time if Obama, the incumbent, claims victory without getting more overall votes, she said. Under the Electoral College system, each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population. The dynamic sets up a possible outcome that has happened rarely in American politics and could undermine the credibility of the victor -- Romney beats Obama in the overall vote, but the president gets reelected by winning the decisive Electoral College.
