Morten Storm, a Danish double agent who says he worked with the CIA and Danish intelligence to track down American-born al Qaeda cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, says the Danish intelligence agency PET tried to buy his silence after he stopped working for them earlier this year. The third and successful attempt, in September 2011, according to Storm, involved him arranging the handoff of a USB thumb drive with a secret tracking device to an al Qaeda courier taking messages onto al-Awlaki. The second attempt, Storm told Jyllands-Posten, was the planting of a tracking device in the luggage of "Aminah" a Croatian convert to Islam, when she traveled to Yemen to marry al-Awlaki in June 2010. Storm, who befriended al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2006, claims he approached Danish intelligence later that year after becoming disillusioned with radical Islam, and subsequently worked with them and the CIA to locate and target the cleric. Though Storm said he was paid $250,000 by the CIA for arranging the match, the operation failed after the AQAP operatives told Aminah to repack her luggage before traveling from Sanaa to Yemen's southern tribal areas to marry al-Awlaki.
