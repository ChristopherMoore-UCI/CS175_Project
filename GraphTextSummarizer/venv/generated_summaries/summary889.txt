Authorities have issued arrest warrants for former Iguala Mayor José Luis Abarca; his wife, Maria de los Ángeles Pineda Villa; and the city's former police chief, Felipe Flores Velásquez. Investigators turned up human remains at hidden grave sites and arrested dozens of suspects after 43 students disappeared in Iguala, Mexico. On Sunday lawmakers in Mexico's Guerrero state tapped an interim leader after Gov. Angel Aguirre stepped aside amid protests over how he responded to the case of the missing students. Federal forces arrested four more people connected with the students' disappearance, he said -- and two of them, both suspected gang members, described dealing with "a large group of people" the night the students went missing. The town's former mayor and police chief appear to be on the lam.
