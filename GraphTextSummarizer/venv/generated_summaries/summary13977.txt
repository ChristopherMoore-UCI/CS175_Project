Future Truck is also envisioned to communicate with other vehicles and connect to growing sources of online information as Big Data balloons on the road. Many of the component parts to put a vehicle like this into production are already available in trucks on the market: Systems that help drivers keep their distance from other drivers, active braking assistance, guidance and mapping systems, and fine-tuned cruise control and tons of other hi-tech tchotchke. Special cameras and multiple radar systems watch the road, the sides of the road, and cars and trucks behind the vehicle. The German vehicle maker sent an 18-wheeler barreling down the Autobahn recently, while the driver surfed the Internet for food recipes on tablet computer -- at least that's how media photos told the story. Once the truck merges into traffic, it won't accelerate to clichÃ©d Autobahn breakneck speeds.
