The nightmare scenario for Western governments is that without the rapid re-establishment of civilian rule, parts of northern Mali, southern Algeria and Mauritania could become a safe haven for al Qaeda in the same way the group has exploited power vacuums in Yemen and Somalia. -- A return to democracy hung in the balance in impoverished Mali on Wednesday as supporters of the West African nation's military coup leader clamored for him to head the interim government. Traore, 70, left Mali on Wednesday for medical treatment in Paris, said a presidential aide who did not want to be named for security reasons. " In the north, Islamist rebels destroyed a monument to those who died in the struggle against dictator Moussa Traore in 1991. However, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), which has tried to broker a return to civilian rule after the March 22 coup, decided to let Traore remain in charge for a year to oversee a transition back to democracy.
