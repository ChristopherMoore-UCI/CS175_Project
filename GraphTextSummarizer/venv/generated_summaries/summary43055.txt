According to Amnesty International's annual review of death sentences and executions, the number of countries using capital punishment in 2011 was 20, a decrease of more than a third compared to 10 years ago. The rights group says it has stopped publishing figures it collects from public sources in China, as "these are likely to grossly underestimate the true number. " Countries in the Middle East recorded a steep rise in executions last year -- 50% up compared to the previous year -- with Saudi Arabia (estimated to be 82), Iran (at least 360), Yemen (at least 41) and Iraq (at least 68) responsible for 99% of all recorded cases in the region. "The vast majority of countries have moved away from using the death penalty," said Salil Shetty, Secretary General of Amnesty International. Only 10% of countries carried out executions last year, but those employing the death penalty are doing so at an alarming rate, a new report says.
