Next January, as Williams bids for a third consecutive grand slam triumph, Keys will be hoping to make an impact at just her third major tournament after qualifying for the Australian Open. Rhyne Williams won the men's competition to book his place at the Australian Open, which begins on January 14. " Keys' triumph over Williams, the 15-time grand slam winner who also clinched double Olympic gold at London 2012, came in the World TeamTennis competition. Keys, who became the youngest player in the competition's history, beat Williams while playing for the Philadelphia Freedoms against the Washington Kastles. The Boca Raton native has won just one match at her two previous grand slams, beating Jill Craybas in the first round of the 2011 U.S. Open.
