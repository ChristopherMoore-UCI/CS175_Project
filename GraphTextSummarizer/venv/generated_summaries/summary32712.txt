Military pallbearers gently removed the South African flag that draped the coffin and handed it to President Jacob Zuma, who gave it to Mandela's family. Mandela's body arrived Saturday in the tiny village in the Eastern Cape province, where he grew up surrounded by lush, tranquil hills and velvety green grass. "Nelson Mandela was our leader, our hero, our icon and our father as much as he was yours," Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete said, regaling mourners with tales of a secret visit Mandela made in 1962 to Dar es Salaam to gather support for his party, the African National Congress. About 4,500 people gathered in the tent, including Machel, who sat next to Mandela's ex-wife, Winnie Mandela. Mandela was imprisoned for 27 years for defying the racist apartheid government that led South Africa for decades.
