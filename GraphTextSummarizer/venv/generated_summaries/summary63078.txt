"We've arranged for Ms. Hilton to be in an outpatient program," defense lawyer David Chesnoff told the judge. -- Paris Hilton entered guilty pleas on two misdemeanor counts in a Las Vegas court and was placed on probation for a year Monday morning under a plea deal to settle a cocaine possession charge. Hilton does have a criminal record, including a Los Angeles drunken driving arrest in 2006. A felony cocaine possession charge was dropped in exchange for Hilton's guilty pleas on misdemeanor charges of drug possession and obstruction of an officer. "I know that Ms. Hilton is contrite and accepts responsibility for her actions," Chesnoff said.
