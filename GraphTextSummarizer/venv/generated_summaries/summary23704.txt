Former Lt. Michael Lohman was convicted of "conspiring with a group of New Orleans police officers to obstruct justice by engaging in a cover-up of the true circumstances surrounding the shooting, by NOPD officers, of a number of individuals," U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana said at a news conference. The federal indictment unsealed Wednesday signaled that other indictments are likely. In August 2008, a judge quashed indictments against Sgts. Legal scholars said they expected more indictments in the cover-up of the shooting but that it's unclear whether any officers will be charged for the shooting itself. "It was probably negligence, ratcheted up to a federal offense by the cover-up." Lohman, the officer who pleaded guilty Wednesday, conspired with other police officers to cover up the shootings even though he believed them to be "legally unjustified," according to the federal indictment.
