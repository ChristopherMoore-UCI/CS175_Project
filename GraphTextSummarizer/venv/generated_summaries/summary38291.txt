A Provo, Utah, lawyer was named temporary special administrator to control the estate while a Utah judge decides a will dispute between ex-wife Shannon Price and former business associate Anna Gray. Willie Coleman said his son told him then that "I just feel that you were holding me in prison." "He wanted to be his own man, do things his own way, so we tried to encourage him the best we could, we tried to guide him as much as we could, but it was his life," Sue Coleman said. Price, whom they never met, did not call Coleman's parents after he suffered a brain hemorrhage from a fall in his home May 26 or before he was removed from life support two days later, the Colemans said. Shannon Price, 24, ordered doctors to end Coleman's life support just a day after he fell into a coma, despite his living will's direction that he be kept alive at least 15 days. Willie Coleman said he has a handful of letters from his son that offer him comfort.
