This follows the discovery of new lines of inquiry after an internal review of the original Portuguese investigation, London's Metropolitan Police said. The Portuguese and UK police "have a shared determination to do everything possible to discover what happened to Madeleine," said Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley of the Metropolitan Police. The two police forces' investigations will run in parallel and at the moment are following separate new leads, the Metropolitan Police said Thursday. -- Police in Portugal are reopening the case of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who was 3 years old when she disappeared while on vacation there with her family in 2007, prosecutors in Portugal said Thursday. About 10 cases of missing children around the world are "being taken very seriously" in connection with the Greek girl's case, including children from the United States, Canada, Poland and France, a spokesman for a Greek children's charity said.
