U.S. teenager Mikaela Shiffrin was crowned slalom skiing's "Snow Queen" Sunday as she won her second World Cup race of the season in Zagreb, Croatia. Shiffrin is currently second in the slalom standings after five races and second in the overall World Cup standings after 15 races. The Zagreb slalom is dubbed the Snow Queen Trophy in honor of Croatian skier Janica Kostelic who was dubbed the "Snow Queen" throughout a successful career that was cut short in 2007 due to persistent health and injury problems. Slovenian star Tina Maize, one of the pre-race favorites alongside Shiffrin, finished back in fifth but did enough to stay atop the overall World Cup. " Norway's Nina Loseth earned her first career podium by finishing 2.79 seconds behind Shiffrin in third place while overall slalom discipline leader Frida Hansdotter finished in fourth.
