"But we now have a great opportunity to see if a massive volcano can cause enhanced phytoplankton growth and sink more carbon dioxide into the oceans. An international team of scientists is in the far North Atlantic Ocean testing whether volcanic eruptions have a side effect of increasing the absorption of carbon dioxide into the deep sea. Growth of phytoplankton in certain areas is usually limited by lack of iron in the water, and the sub polar Atlantic is believed to be one of these areas. However, scientists are testing the theory that the volcanic eruption has increased iron in the water and will prolong the spring blooms into summer. The far North Atlantic is globally significant because it acts as a sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide.
