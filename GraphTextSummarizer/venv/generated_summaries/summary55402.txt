The proposed San Jose Accord aims to resolve nearly two months of political turmoil that Honduras has faced following the June 28 coup that ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Originally, Zelaya's negotiators had walked away from the proposal, offered by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, citing the intransigence of Micheletti's team. "Although the commission concludes that progress was made during its visit, it must recognize that there still no disposition toward full acceptance of the San Jose Accord on the part of Mr. Micheletti or his supporters," Stagno said. The delegation also spoke with Zelaya supporters, including his wife, who said that the ousted president was willing to accept the San Jose Accord and abide by it immediately. -- The government of de facto Honduran President Roberto Micheletti is not ready to sign a proposed agreement to end the country's ongoing political crisis, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno said in Honduras.
