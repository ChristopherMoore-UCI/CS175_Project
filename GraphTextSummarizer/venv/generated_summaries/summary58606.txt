A rising generation of affluent students While Chinese students traditionally went abroad when they failed to secure a place at a top-tier local university, the best students are now forgoing elite Chinese universities to study in the United States, according to Lin, now academic director of Ivy Labs Education, an admissions consultancy in Beijing. Students at these "Chinese versions of international schools" are typically Chinese nationals, who are restricted by government policy from attending full-fledged international schools, which cater to expatriates. Driving international enrollment at U.S. universities By virtue of their size, U.S. universities can accept a much higher number of Chinese students than boarding schools. While U.S. boarding schools desire Chinese students both for their dollars and diversity, they walk a "very fine line...when it comes to recruiting Chinese students," said Lin, who assisted with admissions during his tenure teaching at Connecticut's Cheshire Academy. Limits to international enrollment at U.S. universities But while mainland Chinese students dominate international enrollment, they comprise a small fraction of the overall student body.
