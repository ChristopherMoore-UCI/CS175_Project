The clip -- a DVD extra spotted by filmmaker George Clarke -- shows a woman holding what some say appears to be a mobile phone to her ear and talking. In the late 1920s, Chaplin was nominated for an Academy Award for acting, writing, directing and producing "The Circus," but he was taken out of the running and presented with a "Special Award" instead. Charlie Chaplin's "The Circus" is getting internet buzz with a clip from the black-and-white comedy spreading at viral speed. Perhaps the Academy didn't think it was fair to include him in the race -- what with the use of technology from the future and all. -- It's not shocking to see a woman talking on her cell phone while walking down the street.
