The fighting force known as the Victory Unit was back from its patrol of the desert landscape separating the Gadhafi stronghold of Bani Walid and rebel city of Misrata. Al Shibly has another concern for when Bani Walid is taken, either peacefully or by force. Abdallah Kenshil, chief negotiator for the NTC, said he could confirm that two of Gadhafi's sons, Saif al-Islam and Mutassim, had been seen in Bani Walid. Kenshil told CNN on Wednesday that the rebel fighters had started advancing on Bani Walid, one of the last Gadhafi loyalist strongholds, Wednesday night but did not give further information. He believes Bani Walid will eventually do the same but says those who agree to a settlement in the city face retaliation by hard-core Gadhafi loyalists.
