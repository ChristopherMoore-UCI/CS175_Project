At last year's Geneva Motor Show, Porsche unveiled the 911 GT3 R, its first hybrid track car. Last year, Porsche delivered 21,680 units of the 911 worldwide, which accounted for about a quarter of the total vehicles it delivered during the 2009-2010 fiscal year. The two-door luxury coupe initially was called the Porsche 901, until a patent issue with Peugeot forced a change in name. -- With a top speed of 205 mph and a silhouette known and loved the world over, the Porsche 911 is an icon of German design and engineering. Roehrl recently took CNN's Diana Magnay for a spin around a Porsche test circuit in Zuffenhausen.
