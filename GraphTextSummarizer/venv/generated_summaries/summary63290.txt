Walters said on her television talkshow, "The View," that Beatie had revealed his second pregnancy to her during an interview for a documentary to air on U.S. television Friday night. Thomas Beatie, a married man who used to be a woman, has told America's ABC News that after giving birth to Susan on June 29 he did not go back on the male hormone testosterone so he could have another baby. The "pregnant man" who gave birth to a daughter earlier this year says he is expecting a second child. "I feel good," he told ABC News' Barbara Walters. Beatie, who lives with his wife Nancy in Bend, Oregon, said the baby is due on June 12.
