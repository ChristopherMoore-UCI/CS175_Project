-- Authorities shot and killed a grizzly bear that mauled a 70-year-old man near Yellowstone National Park, a Wyoming Game and Fish Department spokesman said Saturday. The 2.4-million-acre Shoshone National Forest is just east of Yellowstone National Park. The Park County Sheriff's Office had closed part of the Shoshone National Forest while they searched for the large adult male bear, which apparently attacked Erwin Frank Evert after being captured and tranquilized there by researchers Thursday. He was in the forest with his wife, a member of a federal team of researchers studying grizzly bears, authorities said. Agents tracked the bear via a radio collar and killed it near the site of the attack, said the spokesman, Eric Kezsler.
