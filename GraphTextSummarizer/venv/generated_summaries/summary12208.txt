"Most coaches make fitness training too important in pre-season," said Verheijen. Arsenal are one of a number of English Premier League clubs touring Asia and Australia -- others include Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea -- as part of their pre-season preparations. " Dutch coach Raymond Verheijen agrees with Duncan that managers struggle to get the balance right in pre-season training. "As far as countering fatigue, we tried to get the players into the Asian time zone as soon as possible and we adjusted training loads to avoid the injury risks associated with long-haul flying and pre-season training. "Clubs sometimes expose their players to a pre-season that has too great a training load.
