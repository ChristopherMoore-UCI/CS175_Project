On a beautiful, crisp late fall afternoon, rock icon Neil Young took his 1959 Lincoln Continental for one last spin before a team of mechanics ripped out its gas-guzzling engine to make way for an electric motor. "If we're going to make a difference, truly make cars more environmentally friendly," Young said, "we have to make that emotional connection." Young said everyone has a connection with an old car like the Lincoln. "It's the transformation of what I call old technology to new technology," Goodwin says. Car buffs may think it's sacrilege to tear apart an automotive classic, but Young wants it to have a new life as a fuel-efficient hybrid. Goodwin is making a name for himself -- and his company, H-Line Conversions -- by turning gas-guzzling behemoths like Hummers, Cadillac Escalades, Jeeps and other big American cars into clean-power machines.
