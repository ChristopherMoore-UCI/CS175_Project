Tucker is also quoted as making a crack about being so bad with money that he bought two houses next to each other and then had to ask neighbors to borrow a cup of sugar. For some people, owing $11 million in back taxes to the IRS and facing foreclosure may be no laughing matter, but Chris Tucker is not one of them. Tucker even used his interactions with bill collectors as fodder for his act. "That's the last time I let Wesley Snipes help me out with my taxes," Tucker quipped, according to the Miami New Times, referring to the actor whose failure to file returns landed him a three-year prison sentence. In a stand-up performance in Miami recently, the "Rush Hour" star, 39, cracked a few jokes about his financial struggles.
