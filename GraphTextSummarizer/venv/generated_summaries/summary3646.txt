Legia were trailing 2-0 away to Lithuanian team Vetra Vilnius in Sunday's second round, first leg match when Polish fans embarked on a halftime rampage, attacking police with metal bars and stones and causing damage to the stadium. "With Legia's considerable disciplinary record for away matches, the duty of playing matches against Legia becomes a tall order that UEFA cannot afford to support any longer." LONDON, England  -- UEFA banned Poland's Legia Warsaw from European competition for two seasons on Wednesday in response to "ugly and shocking" crowd scenes during an Intertoto Cup match. Legia have also been ordered by to arrange compensation with Vetra in regard to the stadium damage.
