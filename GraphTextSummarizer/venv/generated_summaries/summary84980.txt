"To decrease the risk of eating fresh produce it is important to thoroughly rinse your fruits and vegetables several times," said Dr. Christopher Perkins, the Texas department's medical director said in a statement. In the past, imported fresh produce led to outbreaks of cyclospora infection in the United States. The infection is not highly contagious because it must pass in bowel movements before it can spread to others, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. -- Forty-eight new cases of an intestinal infection caused by ingesting food or water contaminated with feces have been reported in Texas this past week alone, officials said Thursday. Most reports come from the Dallas/Fort Worth area.
