First half goals from midfielder Valter Birsa and striker Zlatan Ljubijankic looked to be enough to guarantee Slovenia would reach the last 16, but it proved only the signal for a courageous fight back by the U.S. LA Galaxy star Landon Donovan pulled the first goal back in the 48th minute as he smashed his shot into the roof of the net with ferocious power. The U.S. looked to have scored the winner when Maurice Edu prodded home a Donovan free kick from the right, but referee Koman Coulibaly had already blown for a foul to the dismay of the Americans. The equalizer came with nine minutes remaining as Jozy Altidore headed down for Michael Bradley -- son of coach Bob Bradley -- to convert with an equally emphatic strike. -- Fabio Capello's England were held to a disappointing goalless draw by Algeria in their World Cup Group C clash in Cape Town on Friday night. England will play group leaders Slovenia and the U.S. take on Algeria, whose confidence will be boosted after keeping Capello's men at bay.
