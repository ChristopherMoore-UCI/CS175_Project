-- Flames and thick black smoke filled the skies above Sanaa International Airport on Sunday after an explosion struck a nearby air base, senior officials said. Two senior security officials at the airport said a mortar shell landed at Dailami air force base, two miles west of the airport, provoking a massive blast. And separately, a Yemeni government official said both the air base and airport were shelled. If it was a mortar, it would cause an explosion and not massive flames," said the Interior Ministry official, who was also not authorized to speak to the media. Flights to Sanaa are being rerouted to Aden, according to an airport official.
