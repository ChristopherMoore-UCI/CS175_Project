When Kreshnik Berisha, the first suspected member of ISIS to stand trial in Germany, was arrested upon his arrival back in Frankfurt in December after spending six months in Syria, youth team football coach Meyer was left shell-shocked. It has opened its doors to everyone in the past decade, with Meyer insisting Makkabi Frankfurt "does not talk about integration, it lives integration."

" Makkabi Frankfurt has 1,300 members and gives opportunities to the wider community to take part in an array of activities.
