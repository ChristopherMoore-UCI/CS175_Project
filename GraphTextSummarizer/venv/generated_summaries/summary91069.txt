In Nepal, 11 people were arrested Thursday for displaying "Free Tibet" banners and shouting anti-Chinese slogans, police said. Some of the arrests took place near the Buddhist monastery of Boudhanath in the capital, Kathmandu, on the anniversary of a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. The exile group is headquartered in Dharamsala in northern India. " The Dalai Lama remains the head of state for now, according to Tempa Tshering, his representative in India, and will remain the group's spiritual leader. What the Dalai Lama's 'retirement' means "On March 14, (the) parliament will meet in Dharamsala (India) and decide whether to approve his request," Tshering said.
