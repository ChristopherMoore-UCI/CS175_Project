Perhaps even more so because I have been listening to the dialogue about how to make America more post-racial -- mostly as it pertains to black and white culture -- for so long that it never occurred to me that an Asian immigrant family might cry foul when their son fell in love with an all-American girl like me. But only because we worked so hard to make sure the inconsistencies we were both taught in our parents' homes about what kinds of people were worthy to love would never be a part of our home or life together. but I couldn't fathom that my race could make me the "wrong kind of girl" for anyone. I had come around to a slight Americanization of his real name by the first time we exchanged "I love yous," but it seemed of little consequence when Seung then added that I would never be welcome in his family's home. I knew their prejudices came from the ignorance of confusing economics, education and opportunity with culture.
