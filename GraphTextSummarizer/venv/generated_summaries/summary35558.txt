Writing in the History of Photography (reprinted online on evesmag.com), Koyen relates how that appearance almost cost Capa his freedom when Koyen escorted Capa into a U.S. Army intelligence headquarters where an intelligence officer, Lt. Col. Harry Brown, was working on a wall-mounted map of battle positions. Despite Capa's  Allied status, he cast anything but a military appearance, according to Kenneth Koyen, a U.S. Army public relations officer who assisted Capa during the Battle of the Bulge. Koyen was able to convince the colonel of Capa's allegiance, but the photographer's appearance almost cost him again later in the battle, when U.S. soldiers began shooting at Capa, Koyen wrote. Young said that Capa would only photograph German soldiers if they were prisoners. Brown shouted as he tried to conceal the map from Capa, who was wearing a pilfered German fur coat, according to Koyen's account.
