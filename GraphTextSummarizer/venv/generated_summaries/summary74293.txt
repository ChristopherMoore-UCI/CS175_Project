"I suspect that an electrical circuit malfunction may have caused the fire because it started at the top floors of the police communication building inside the ministry," said Alla Mahmoud, Interior Ministry spokesman. In a similar protest a few weeks ago, demonstrators set other buildings in the Interior Ministry complex ablaze, as well as cars. The ministry was the site of a peaceful protest Tuesday morning and afternoon, with thousands of ministry employees  -- many of them police officers -- making demands, mainly for higher wages. Before the fire broke out, a procession of thousands of demonstrators made its way from the Interior Ministry through Cairo's Tahrir Square -- ground zero for protests that toppled longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak last month -- and in the direction of the state television and radio offices. -- A fire broke out in the Egyptian Interior Ministry on Tuesday in downtown Cairo following a protest earlier in the day.
