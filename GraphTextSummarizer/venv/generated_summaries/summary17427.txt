Last month, Turkish residents watched as Syrian shells crashed into Syrian territory, barely a stone's throw away from the Turkish border fence. -- Turkey fired on Syrian government targets in response to the shelling of a Turkish border town in which five civilians were killed Wednesday, according to Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office. The Syrian government, meanwhile, has accused Turkey of arming and funding Syrian rebels. CNN journalists have witnessed light weapons in the form of assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns coming from Turkey to Syrian rebels. Before launching its military strike against Syrian targets Wednesday, Turkey reached out to NATO and U.N. chiefs.
