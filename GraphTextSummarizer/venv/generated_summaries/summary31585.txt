So why can't Casey do it?" HLN's Nancy Grace, who has covered the Anthony case extensively since Caylee was reported missing, did not mince words about Anthony's possible plans. Anthony's defense attorneys maintained that Caylee was not murdered at all. Anthony's lawyer, Jose Baez, also alleged that Anthony's father sexually abused her from the age of 8 and she had been taught to conceal her pain. A jury on Tuesday found Anthony not guilty of first degree murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter  in the 2008 death of her daughter  Caylee. The proceedings featured  allegations of sexual abuse, questions regarding Anthony's  competence and various theories on what happened to Caylee.
