-- Leveled buildings, fallen trees and massive piles of rubble stretched across wide swaths of the South Thursday after destructive tornadoes and severe storms tore through the region. "It looks like an atomic bomb went off in a straight line," said Dr. Brian Wilhite, an internist at Druid City Hospital in Tuscaloosa who tended to the wounded. " A video shot from the third floor of the University of Alabama's basketball coliseum shows a large mass sucking everything into forbidding dark clouds above. In all, the death toll from the wave of powerful storms that struck Wednesday and early Thursday was more than 280 people in six states. Employees huddled in a windowless break room at a CVS drug store in Tuscaloosa as a tornado approached and a deafening roar filled the air, store manager Michael Zutell said.
