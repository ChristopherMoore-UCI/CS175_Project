Real Simple: How to negotiate anything In the eight years since the group came together, the women, who call themselves the Wonder Weeders, have created pathways and sculptures, moved trees, and carved out acres of gardens from hillsides and overgrown bramble. Gayle Jamison's garden in Woodstock, New York, is a well-ordered oasis filled with gentle lines of peonies and hydrangeas, artfully placed azaleas, and weeping cherry trees. As the two women walked through Terry's garden and got acquainted, Cathera suggested that they might help each other out from time to time. Reaping the rewards On a hot, clear morning last September, the women were hard at work in Cathera's garden. Instead, on Friday mornings from April through September, you will find a cheerful band of six women -- some graying, some not, most of them attired in old T-shirts or overalls and work boots.
