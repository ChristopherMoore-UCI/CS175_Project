But Letarnec's photo series "Walking Upside Down," which features people doing handstands with their clothes on upside down, is a far departure from hip-hop sensation Kriss Kross' dated fashion trend. "In the U.S. people might see this just as a series of silly photos, but it's a social commentary," he said. While attempting to do a handstand against a wall in his Nantes studio, he realized he needed skilled people who were capable of standing on their hands for this type of photo shoot. "We do silly things, humans do silly things." He was drawn to his "Walking Upside Down" project because he wanted take a surreal idea, and shoot it in a realistic way, without using any lighting effects or photo editing software in his work.
