Why 'American Sniper' is a smash hit Brian Sain, the co-founder of AmericanSnipers.org, says it was important for him and the organization to show their support for Kyle's family. Friday, Taya was left searching for words after the nonprofit organization AmericanSnipers.org awarded her family $62,000 from its successful rifle raffle. For another weekend, moviegoers will be glued to their seats, watching the grit and turmoil of Chris Kyle, the real-life character portrayed in "American Sniper." Coming from a law enforcement background himself, Sain says supporting Kyle's family is only natural. But for Kyle's widow, Taya, the blockbuster hit is all too real.
