But then Obama told Congress that while their so-called super committee meets to hash out an agreement on cutting $1.5 trillion from future spending as part of the deficit-ceiling agreement last month, they could make more cuts to cover the cost of his new bill -- again, without telling them exactly what those costs would be. In the film "Groundhog Day," Bill Murray has to live through the exact same day thousands of times. The "plan" -- which still has not been released -- consists of getting money to states to supposedly save the jobs of teachers and first responders, accelerating public-works projects, extending the payroll tax cut put into place in the December tax deal, and extending jobless benefits for at least another year. Even worse, Obama ended up reneging on a claim made by the White House earlier this week that the bill would be entirely funded from current dollars. In this administration, most Americans can be forgiven for feeling as though they've lived through the same economic speech from President Obama nearly as many times.
