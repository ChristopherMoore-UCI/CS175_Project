The first day of China's autumn holiday came to a snarling halt for motorists. Fueled by an increase of cars, motorists encountered long delays, as well as traffic accidents, including a collision of a tour bus on the Beijing-Tianjin highway that killed five Germans and one Chinese person Monday morning, as reported by Xinhua. Li Daokui, the director of the Center for China in the World Economy at the Tsinghua University School of Economics and Management, questioned the wisdom of no tolls on holidays. Many drivers were trying to take advantage of a new policy that waives the toll on expressways during holidays, according to Xinhua. But holiday traveling may not be easier on public transportation, reported Xinhua.
