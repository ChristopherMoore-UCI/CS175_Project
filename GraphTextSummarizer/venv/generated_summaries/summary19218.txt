The site of Wednesday's discovery also is about a quarter-mile from where a hiker reported finding aviation identification cards with Fossett's name and $1,000 in cash in late September, Anderson said. But Anderson said he believes "our coroner's investigation is over and the Fossett family will finally have closure. Before this week's discovery, Anderson said, officials could not be certain that Fossett was dead. " "We talked to the family and advised them that we possibly, most likely, found the remains of J. Stephen Fossett," Anderson said. Fossett was last seen on the morning of September 3, 2007, when he took off from the Flying-M Ranch outside Minden, Nevada.
