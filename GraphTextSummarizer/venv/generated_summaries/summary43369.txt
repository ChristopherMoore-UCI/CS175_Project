Lowndes County investigators questioned Chauncey about inconsistencies in his statement July 23, according to investigative records. According to incident reports released to CNN after an Open Records Act request, Dalton Ray Chauncey told neighbors he'd overheard two students at Lowndes High School in Valdosta discussing their involvement in the 17-year-old's death. However, Johnson's parents believe their son was beaten to death. Last month, an attorney for Johnson's parents filed a wide-ranging, $100 million lawsuit that claims several former classmates beat their son to death. In a written statement, an attorney for the sheriff's office wrote in August that CNN had been provided pertinent records in Chauncey's case and it would not be appropriate to comment further.
