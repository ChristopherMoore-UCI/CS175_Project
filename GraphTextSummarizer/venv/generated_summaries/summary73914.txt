"With Oculus ... if you're putting on this pair of glasses and you're going to be face-to-face communicating with people and you're going to be jumping in and out of this new set of virtual worlds, this was going to be the largest MMO (massively multiuser online community) ever made," Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe said Monday at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in New York. -- When Oculus, makers of a virtual-reality headset many view as the future of video gaming, agreed in March to a $2 billion buyout by Facebook, they weren't tempted by the success of "FarmVille" or "Candy Crush." "I think Game Boy was an awesome platform, but I think you'll see handheld game devices largely disrupted by the mobile market and mobile devices." Since developer kits began shipping in spring 2013, Oculus has continued to add to the roster of companies hoping to create content for its system. "You now just have one of the biggest networks in the world behind you." He also teased a mind-blowing new generation of virtual reality coming in the future from Oculus that will challenge our perception of what's real and what's not. Gaming legend John Carmack, the lead programmer of pioneering games such as "Doom" and "Quake," has since come on board, and the headset has been hailed by many, including CNN and Time, as one of the top inventions in recent years.
