Attorney General Eric Holder is spending his remaining time in office as an activist for civil rights and social justice issues, ranging from gay rights to changing sentencing laws for non-violent crimes. The Human Rights Campaign, which held the event, praised him, by saying the decision "cements his place in history alongside Robert F. Kennedy, another attorney general who crusaded for civil rights." Rand Paul fights for felon voting rights Following Holder's plea, Alabama's Republican governor said he could support such an idea, and a modified proposal in Paul's home state of Kentucky has begun moving through the legislature. But Holder's moves to use administrative memos to make effective changes before Congress passes new laws have also generated criticism. Earlier this month, Holder basked in applause in a New York City hotel ballroom where he announced the department's latest decision on same-same marriage legal rights.
