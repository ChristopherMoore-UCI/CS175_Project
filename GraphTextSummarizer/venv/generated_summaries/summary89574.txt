" Separate from sexual identity is gender identity. "These numbers might reflect a generational change in social acceptance for LGBT identities," said psychotherapist Jean Malpas, director of the Gender and Family Project at the New York-based Ackerman Institute for the Family. "While we're creating space for a variety of sexual identities, we also need to create space for non-sexual identities," said college sex educator Emily Nagoski. "This new generation of young people understands that love is love, that people are people and that the freedom to experience joy and mutually consensual pleasure is a birthright." "Gender nonconforming expression and identity are different from sexual orientation," Malpas explained.
