"Most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky, like Earth," lead author Guillermo Torres of the CfA said in a release. At a panel held last summer at NASA headquarters in Washington, astronomers said they were "very close in terms of technology and science to actually finding the other Earth." The couple most like Earth, Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars, which are cooler and smaller than the Earth's sun. " Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b are the most similar to Earth of any known exoplanets to date. Still it's very exciting just to discover them and to be closer to identifying a "second" Earth.
