As detailed in The Hollywood Reporter's 2013 Philantrophy Issue, Simon's charitable contributions include founding the Malibu-based Sam Simon Foundation (worth nearly $23 million as of 2011) that rescues the hungry and feeds stray dogs. A couple of years after he left, Simon knew he would have enough money to retire from show business. Most recently, Simon was a consultant on the Charlie Sheen series "Anger Management" and hosted a show on Radioio.com. Simon also went on to direct episodes of the Carlin show, "The Drew Carey Show," "Friends," "Norm" and "Anger Management." Simon also is credited with assembling the show's elite writing team that included Al Jean, George Meyer, John Swartzwelder, Mike Reiss, Jon Vitti and Conan O'Brien.
