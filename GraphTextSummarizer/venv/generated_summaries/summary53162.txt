Pepe defended Schettino's decision to delay the call to abandon ship by nearly an hour. The nightmare will never end for the families of those 32 people who died after the cruise ship, captained by Schettino, crashed into rocks off the Tuscan island of Giglio. Pepe suggested it was De Falco's stern manner, rather than Schettino's alleged ineptitude, that damaged Italy's reputation. " Schettino's lead lawyer, Domenico Pepe, began closing arguments Monday, saying the Champagne bottle used to christen the ship when it was put into service in 2006 did not break. Schettino admitted to the court that his reason for sailing close to Giglio -- leading the ship to hit rocks -- was to "impress the passengers."
