Moses Dlamini, a spokesman for the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID), an independent government agency that looks into possible crimes by police, said officers who carry out crimes do not reflect the police service as a whole. The reason for the increase in cases of police brutality in South Africa is not hard to find. "In fact, the number of deaths in custody as well as deaths as a result of police action have been declining significantly over the last four years. Civilians were encouraged to be more active in police structures, with community policing becoming the norm. Not all of the 720 deaths reported in 2011/2012 were caused by police action, he said.
