Poor scientific literacy among college students is one reason students pursuing science and math are less likely to graduate from those programs. Among students who majored in liberal arts, business or other fields, 73% of white students and about 63% of black and Latino students finished their degrees in five years. The study, conducted by UCLA's Higher Education Research Institute, found students in science, math and engineering take longer to complete their degrees than students who start out majoring in other fields. "Many students want to be in science, but very talented people are choosing other fields. Changing the culture Schools admit more science majors than they expect to graduate, and don't teach students to support each other, Hrabowski said, instead fostering an atmosphere of cutthroat competition.
