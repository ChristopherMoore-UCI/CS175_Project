Cook's case is now one of more than 200 allegations of abuse by Savile that UK police are investigating, stretching back as far as 1958 and as recently as 2006 - some of the incidents are alleged to have happened on BBC property. According to Cook, Savile lead him backstage at BBC studios into a small, cluttered dressing room and sat him down in a chair. But he does want an investigation into what BBC executives knew - and when -- about Savile's alleged predatory behavior, and whether they could have stopped it. Jimmy Savile died in 2011, and Cook has no hope of bringing him to justice. The BBC says it is launching an investigation into whether the culture and practices there at the time allowed Savile to carry out the sexual abuse of children.
