"People like him because there's a touching story behind him," football commentator Park Moon Sung at SBS, one of Korea's major broadcasters, said. His hometown, Suwon, near to Seoul, built a park and named a road after Park to commemorate him becoming the first Premier League-r in South Korean history. Kim said he admires Park for never giving up and admits to watching at least 70 percent of all Manchester United games even if it means staying up until three in the morning on weekdays. "I would like Park Ji-Sung to become a symbol of challenge for all Koreans," 30-year-old Kim Young Woo, who is a great fan of Park, said. Park, once rejected from his country's own K-League, is now considered the ambassador of Korean football.
