Maybe it's because feel-good stories are hard to come by that the tale of Preston's carpentry outfit, Lamon Luther, has struck a nerve, earning a standing ovation last week from the audience at TEDxAtlanta, a series of independently organized talks modeled after the original TED conference. In return, they're helping keep alive a tradition of American craftsmanship that seems to be disappearing with each generation through Lamon Luther, which is named for Preston's grandfather, a farmer and carpenter from Georgia. Today, some of those men have jobs and homes thanks to Preston, in a business collaboration that's not only producing expertly crafted furniture but restoring hope. Preston is also seeing bottom line results with orders from clients including Chik-fil-A and smaller custom orders. It might not have happened if Preston hadn't overheard a conversation in 2009 in a restaurant in his hometown of Douglasville, Georgia, about "the village in the woods."
