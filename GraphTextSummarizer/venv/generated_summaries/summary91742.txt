-- President Obama told West Point graduates that the United States faces "difficult days ahead" in its fight against insurgents in Afghanistan and said that the threat posed by al Qaeda operatives across the globe "will not go away soon." While he said there has been "more success in eliminating al Qaeda leaders in recent months than in recent years," the group will continue its recruitment efforts. "This time of war began in Afghanistan, a place that may seem as far from this peaceful bend in the Hudson River as anywhere on Earth," Obama said, referring to a conflict that started after the al Qaeda terror network attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. "We see it in al Qaeda's gross distortion of Islam, their disrespect for human life, and their attempts to prey upon fear and hatred and prejudice." As for al Qaeda's activities, Obama defended the "campaign to disrupt, dismantle and to defeat al Qaeda," saying it's an "international effort that is necessary and just."
