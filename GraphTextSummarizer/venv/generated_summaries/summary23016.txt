Yes, some will scoff at Colbert running ahead of Huntsman -- a candidate running below the margin of error in some polls, meaning he may have zero support or may actually owe votes -- but keep in mind that in the recent Iowa caucus, Huntsman received 745 votes. And let's not forget that Colbert admitted that he makes up facts to support his own political arguments, as he gleefully boasted once: "I can't prove it, but I can say it." America cannot afford a man with the views of Stephen Colbert running our nation. Colbert is clearly in the pocket of big business -- I bet his super PAC is funded by big businesses like hedge funds and casino owners. -- Stephen Colbert -- host of "The Colbert Report" and unabashed right wing radical -- is now considering running for President of the United States of America. He is now at 5%, placing him ahead of former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman.
