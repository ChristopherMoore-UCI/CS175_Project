But as a former director of NSA, I would also suggest that the base 50% to 60% of American intelligence day in and day out is provided by signals intelligence, the kinds of intercepted communications that Snowden has so blithely put at risk. Snowden fled to China with several computers' worth of data from NSANET, one of the most highly classified and sensitive networks in American intelligence. But there is other damage, such as the undeniable economic punishment that will be inflicted on American businesses for simply complying with American law. Edward Snowden will likely prove to be the most costly leaker of American secrets in the history of the Republic. As former director of CIA, I would claim that the top 20% of American intelligence -- that exquisite insight into an enemy's intentions -- is generally provided by human sources.
