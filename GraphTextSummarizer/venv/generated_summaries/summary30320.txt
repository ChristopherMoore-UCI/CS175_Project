The United States will not return North Korea to its list of state sponsors of terrorism despite its alleged role in the sinking of a South Korea naval ship in contested waters off the peninsula's coast. North Korea last year cut off the talks involving the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests. Crowley's remarks came ahead of Tuesday's scheduled meetings between Wi Sung-lac, South Korea's representative to six-party nuclear talks with North Korea, and State Department officials. North Korea has vehemently denied charges it fired a torpedo that sank the navy ship Cheonan and has accused the United States of "persistently antagonizing" it. "In our view, it was a provocative action but one taken by the military or the state against the military of another state," U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Philip Crowley said Monday in his explanation of why the sinking didn't constitute an act of international terrorism.
