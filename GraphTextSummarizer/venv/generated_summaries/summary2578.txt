Police said the assault was reported Sunday night in the Chanton entertainment district on Okinawa, a major hub for U.S. forces in the Pacific. Under U.S.-Japanese military agreements, the U.S. government has custody over service members suspected of crimes while on duty. Previous criminal cases against American troops have triggered widespread protests by Okinawans since 1995, when three American servicemen were found guilty of raping an Okinawan schoolgirl. -- A U.S. Marine based on Okinawa has been arrested in connection with the reported rape of a 14-year-old Japanese girl, the island's police force said Monday. In addition, the U.S. military is not required to turn over those accused of crimes until an indictment is issued.
