Bayern Munich dropped points for only the third time this season on Saturday as Borussia Dortmund held the Bundesliga's runaway leaders to a 1-1 draw at the Allianz Arena. The draw keeps Jurgen Klopp's team in third place with 27 points and remain 11 points behind Bayern. Reigning champions Dortmund have beaten Bayern in their previous four league meetings but had to come from behind to steal a point on this occasion. Footballers remember Christmas truce Dortmund keeper Roman Weidenfeller kept Bayern at bay during the closing stages to earn his team a point. The lead only lasted seven minutes as Mario Goetze put away a chance from a Marco Reus corner to put Dortmund back on level terms.
