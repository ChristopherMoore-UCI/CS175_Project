The commander of U.S. Forces Korea, Gen. James D. Thurman, said the curfew would be in place from midnight to 5 a.m. Monday to Friday and from 3.a.m. One of the cases involves 21-year-old soldier who allegedly broke into a girl's home on September 17, U.S. Forces Korea, said in a statement. " Another soldier, identified only as "I" is accused of raping a 18-year-old on September 24, U.S. Forces Korea said. The U.S. military has handed that soldier over to local South Korea authorities. We fully expect our soldiers to maintain the highest standards of professionalism and conduct in the community," said Maj. Gen. Edward C. Cardon.
