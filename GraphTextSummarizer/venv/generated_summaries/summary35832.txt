Hriz, in his early 30s, was arrested in Morocco last January on a Spanish warrant for participation in the attacks that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 on Madrid commuter trains. A Moroccan court sentenced a Moroccan man to 20 years in prison for his role in the Madrid train bombings of 2004, in a case built on evidence from Spanish police, a Spanish court spokeswoman said Friday. Spanish news reports said Hriz admitted that he had been in Spain from October 2003 to March 2004 but that he denied the charges against him in court in Sale, Morocco, near the capital, Rabat. But Spanish authorities have long said that a few suspects remained at large, and Hriz was one of them. The Moroccan prosecution sought life in prison against Hriz, Spanish media reported, but the court decided on a sentence of 20 years.
