"We need President Obama to help restore the leadership the Congo needs," said George Alula, president of the Movement of the Congolese Unity. -- Protesters rallied in Washington on Saturday to raise awareness of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo following contested elections there in November. Congo's highest court struck down a lawsuit challenging the election results in December, declaring incumbent Joseph Kabila the winner. They said they traveled from 25 states to deliver an urgent message to U.S. President Barack Obama. The 2006 election, which brought Kabila to power, was declared largely free and fair by international observers.
