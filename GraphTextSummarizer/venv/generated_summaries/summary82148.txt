Suranga Lakmal, who shared the new ball with debutant Thissara Perera, claimed stand-in-captain Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar in successive overs. Gambhir, with Karthik for company, got India across the line, finishing off the chase with boundary off the first ball of the penultimate over. India still needed a further 69 from little more than 10 overs at that stage, but Gambhir narrowed the gap by hitting Perera and then Lakmal for successive boundaries. -- Centuries from Gautam Gambhir and Virat Kohli helped India defeat Sri Lanka by seven wickets in the fourth one-day international in Kolkata to take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. Kohli injected momentum by hammering Lasith Malinga for four consecutive blows in the paceman's first over and in a period when boundaries were easily available.
