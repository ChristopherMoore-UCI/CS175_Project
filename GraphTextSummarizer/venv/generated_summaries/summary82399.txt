The United Nations Millennium Goal set the target for all countries to reduce child mortality by 4.3 percent per year in the period 1990 to 2015. The "Rest," known as the developing world, consisted of 3 billion people who lived shorter lives, had three times as many children per woman, and tried to survive on a tenth of the income of people in the West. This obviously represents a switch to a converging world, as the average annual rate of reduction of child mortality in Sweden was only 3.6 percent over the last century. Today women in all these countries give birth to three, two or even fewer children, on average. The fertility decline was combined with a fall in child mortality.
