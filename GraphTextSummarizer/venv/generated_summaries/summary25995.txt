In the restive city of Daraa, where the arrests in March of 15 teenagers for scrawling anti-government graffiti on walls ignited the country's expressions of discontent, security forces fired randomly in an attempt to disperse two groups of demonstrators who were chanting, "God is great!" And in Deir Ezzor, at least one demonstrator was wounded when Syrian security forces opened fire there, the group said. -- Security forces surrounding the Rifaie Mosque in the Damascus suburb of Kafr Sousa fired tear gas early Saturday on thousands of worshipers as they ended their prayers and tried to leave the building, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCC) reported. The violence occurred on one of the most holy days of Ramadan and on the same day that a U.N. team, having completed a five-day humanitarian mission to Syria, concluded that there is "an urgent need to protect civilians from the excessive use of force. Though the Syrian government allowed participants to visit any location they requested, "it is doubtful that Syria has fully complied with its assurances of providing free and unimpeded access," the statement concluded.
