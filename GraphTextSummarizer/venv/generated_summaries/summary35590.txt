-- A Lonely Planet author says he plagiarized or made up portions of the popular travel guidebooks and dealt drugs to supplement poor pay, an Australian newspaper reported Sunday. A Swashbuckling Tale of High Adventures, Questionable Ethics and Professional Hedonism," is set for release next week. Kohnstamm has worked on more than a dozen books for Lonely Planet, including its titles on Brazil, Colombia, the Caribbean, Venezuela, Chile and South America. An e-mail from Lonely Planet said Kohnstamm's book were being reviewed, the newspaper reported. The 32-year-old Seattle, Washington, native also claims he accepted free travel, which is a violation of the company's policy.
