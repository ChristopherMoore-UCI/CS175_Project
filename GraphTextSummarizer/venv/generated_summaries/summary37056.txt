Browne said last year that "steroid use is going to be an issue in this case, especially where Sgt. Attorney John Henry Browne said the special operations troops "pumped" Staff Sgt. Bales to Afghanistan for his fourth deployment, knowing that he had (post-traumatic stress disorder) and a concussive head injury," Browne said last year. Browne said he will bring experts in combat stress to the penalty phase hearing, despite the fact that the military has historically not accepted combat stress as the sole explanation for crimes committed by service members. Witnesses testified last year that Bales had consumed alcohol with other soldiers before the attack.
