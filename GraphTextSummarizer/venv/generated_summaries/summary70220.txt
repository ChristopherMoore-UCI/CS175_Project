"Mr. Ben Ali, deposed members of the former Tunisian regime and their immediate families are not welcome in Canada. -- Family members of the deposed Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali are reportedly in Canada, a development now being denounced by some in the Tunisian community there. Canadian Immigration Minister Jason Kenney seemed to confirm their arrival by pointing out that some members of the Ben Ali family have permanent residency status in Canada and therefore have the legal right to enter and stay without a visa. French-language media in Canada first reported that as many as 10 members of the Ben Ali family arrived in Montreal by private jet on Thursday. But Canadian officials also stressed to CNN that Canada would not become a refuge for Ben Ali or his family.
