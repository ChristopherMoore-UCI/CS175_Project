New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg slammed Burress on Monday, saying it would be an "outrage" if the Giants receiver isn't prosecuted "to the fullest extent of the law" after the shooting with a gun that authorities say he owned illegally. New York Giants receiver Plaxico Burress arrives at the 17th police precinct in Manhattan on Monday. -- A New York hospital worker was suspended for failing to report the gunshot wound of NFL star Plaxico Burress, a hospital spokeswoman told CNN Monday. Turning his ire to New York Presbyterian Hospital, which treated Burress, Bloomberg said officials "didn't do what they're legally required to do" -- inform the authorities of the incident. "We can confirm that the individual at New York Presbyterian Hospital, who was responsible for failing to report the incident, has been suspended," hospital spokeswoman Robinson said.
