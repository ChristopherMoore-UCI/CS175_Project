If we stifle political comedy, we will cause a chilling effect on the free exchange of ideas on political issues. While I absolutely support freedom of speech, comedians deserve to suffer consequences if they make hateful jokes about race, ethnicity, gender, religion or sexual orientation. We will not only have lost the war on comedy, but also effectively silenced comedians from telling jokes about any controversial political topics or figures. Political jokes will always offend someone since they are inherently divisive. Political comedians must be afforded the unfettered right to satirize our politicians -- even if their jokes include crude words such as the ones that Maher and C.K. used about Sarah Palin, who is still considered a leader in the Republican Party even if she is no longer the governor of Alaska.
