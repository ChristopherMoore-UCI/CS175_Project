Joy Monroe, a tourist from Montana, has come to Paris's Pont des Arts bridge on a mission of love. American Lisa Anselmo and French-American Lisa Taylor Huff say they co-founded No Love Locks because the padlocks are endangering historic landmarks and have become a threat to safety. 'Vandalism' "I understand that this is a modern expression of love and it's cool, but history should not be compromised," says Anselmo. There are concerns that the keys thrown in the Seine will add to the river's existing pollution. But the practice quickly got out of hand, with padlocks spreading to other bridges and reappearing as quickly as authorities removed them.
