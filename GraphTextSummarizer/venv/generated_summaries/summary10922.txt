The debate in movies, TV and viral clips is a reflection of real life: According to a recent CNN/ORC International survey of Americans, 27% of respondents said abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 13% said it should be legal in most circumstances, 38% said it should be legal in a few circumstances, and 20% said it should always be illegal. Holm says as a born-and-raised New Yorker, both she and director Robespierre came from a world where conversations about abortion happened "in a shame-free, regret-free, clear way" with mothers, friends and sisters -- and that was the experience that they wanted to show on-screen. Though the movie successfully mines the traditional rom-com tropes for laughs, groans and "awwwws," abortion is emerging as its unlikely claim to fame. In "Obvious Child," several characters along the way reveal they had abortions (some legal, some not) in their teens and 20s. In this case, it includes one night stands and abortions."
