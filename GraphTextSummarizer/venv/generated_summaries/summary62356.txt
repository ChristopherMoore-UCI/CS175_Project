"It's to prevent dogs from being surrendered to shelters or euthanized when their owners cannot afford care," said Marlo Manning, who founded Fairy DogParents. Since it started in 2009, Fairy DogParents has provided aid for nearly 400 dogs in Massachusetts: $150,000 worth of dog food and medical care. That's when the vet told them about Fairy DogParents, a nonprofit that helps dog owners pay for their pets' needs during times of economic hardship. "(On) the cover of the local paper was a story about dogs being tied to the front of shelters because people couldn't afford to keep them anymore. For dogs who have needs exceeding those limits, the group has also hosted online fundraisers.
