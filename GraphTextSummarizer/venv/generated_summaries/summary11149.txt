Wuterich stands vindicated by the very same system that has held him captive for over six years," said Wuterich attorney Neal Puckett in a statement. The trial of Wuterich, who pleaded guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty, ends a six-year investigation into one of the Iraq war's worst attacks on civilians by U.S. troops. In the sentencing, the military judge, Lt. Col. David Jones, cited how Wuterich ordered his troops to "shoot first, ask questions later." Wuterich, a divorced father of three young daughters, was the last of eight Marines charged. The truth is, I don't believe anyone in my squad, nor any member of of Kilo Co, 3/1/ behaved in any way that was dishonorable or contrary to the highest ideals that we all live by as Marines," Wuterich said. Meanwhile, Iraqi officials condemned the plea deal for Wuterich, who was facing several manslaughter and other charges.
