In eastern Afghanistan, a suicide bomb attack killed at least one ISAF service member, according to officials. The explosion occurred at about 7 p.m. local time near Camp Eggers, Maj. A grenade exploded Saturday during a routine vehicle inspection near a base in Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul, a spokesman for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force said. ISAF did not release the service member's nationality or details about the attack. "The base is secured at this time and has resumed operations," Woods said.
