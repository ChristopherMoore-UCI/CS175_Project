Us Weekly magazine has retracted a story about model and reality star Kendall Jenner and her father, former Olympian Bruce Jenner. Us Weekly said on its website: "The interview was allegedly conducted by an independent freelance journalist at the Saturday, March 14, taping of Comedy Central's roast of Justin Bieber in Los Angeles. Us Weekly had quoted the sister, a member of the Kardashian family, as saying she supported her father, who has made entertainment headlines over rumors that he is becoming a woman. When Ms. Jenner denied, via Twitter, that the interview took place, Us Weekly immediately reached out to the freelance reporter. We sincerely apologize to Ms. Jenner and her family," the magazine said Thursday on its website.
