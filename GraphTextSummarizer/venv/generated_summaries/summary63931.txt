China has long pushed to be recognized as a market economy by the EU, but many European businesses still complain of unfair trade barriers such as restricted access to Chinese government tenders, investment limitations and intellectual property violations. Regling's visit comes a day after European countries reached a deal to tackle the debt crisis with a proposal that would give Greece additional bailout support and other measures aimed to boost market confidence. China has expressed its support for Europe amid the crisis, but has only promised to help by resuming trade and investments in safe European bonds. Commenting on the newly-reached deal Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said Thursday: "We hope the bailout deal will be conducive to bolstering market confidence, promoting the sustainable economic development of the Eurozone and the process of European integration." China's economy has also experienced a slump as a result of economic turmoil in the West.
