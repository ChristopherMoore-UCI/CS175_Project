It managed to make the four-day journey in a convoy of vessels from Giglio to Genoa without major incident, despite one night of storms. Refloated by salvage crews earlier this month, the rusting hulk docked at Voltri port in the Italian city of Genoa early Sunday. Since the wreck in early 2012, 24 metric tons of debris -- including furniture, dishes, food, personal effects and ship parts -- have been recovered from the seabed. The crippled Costa Concordia cruise ship reached the end of its final voyage. The cruise ship, which ran aground in January 2012 off Giglio Island with more than 4,200 passengers aboard, was eased into a dry dock at the port for salvage.
