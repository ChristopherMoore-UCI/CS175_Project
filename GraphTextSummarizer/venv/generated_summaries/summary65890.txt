But he said other bands and ensembles that do not have marching band members on their rosters will be allowed to continue to perform. Other hazing incidents that resulted in injuries to band members also have been reported. It was not immediately clear what impact the decision would have on band members attending the school on a band scholarship. The Florida A&M University marching band will remain on suspension through the 2012-2013 academic year while the school works to set new rules following the fatal hazing of a band member, university President James Ammons said in a conference call Monday with trustees. Ammons noted that band scholarships require students to perform publicly in addition to classwork, and all bands featuring Marching 100 members have been suspended.
