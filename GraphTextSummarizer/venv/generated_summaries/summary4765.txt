You can get anthrax by handling products from infected animals, breathing in anthrax spores, and by eating undercooked meat from infected animals. Five of the 11 people infected with inhalation anthrax in the U.S. in 2001 died of the disease, in spite of antibiotics and other therapy, the CDC said. Treatment takes about 60 days, since that is how long it may take anthrax spores to grow, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. Seven survivors had confirmed cutaneous anthrax disease, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health. Bioterrorism experts say anthrax is difficult to use effectively as a weapon on a large scale, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health.
