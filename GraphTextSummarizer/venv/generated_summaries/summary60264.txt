Police and prosecutors are being tight-lipped about the case against Harris, who is charged with felony murder and second-degree child cruelty in the death of 22-month-old Cooper Harris. He held jobs at the University of Alabama from August 2001 until May 2006 as a parking monitor and later as a mail delivery clerk, said Cathy Andreen, university director of media relations. The boy's mother, Leanna Harris, is listed as having the same home address as the father, but she told CNN last week that she's been advised not to discuss the case with the media. In May 2012, Harris graduated from the University of Alabama with a bachelor's degree in commerce and business administration, having majored in management information systems, Andreen said. " CNN couldn't immediately confirm the authenticity of the petition comments, many of which speak glowingly of Harris as a man and a father.
