Also, if you're sending a box from one destination to another that's reasonably close -- say, from Long Island, New York, to Scotch Plains, New Jersey -- during the final week before Christmas, you may not have to send it next-day delivery to have it arrive quickly. If you're feeling crafty, head to a nursery that sells Christmas trees. If you have your heart set on white flowers, gardenias make attractive holiday decorations. An independent caterer will often be more wallet-friendly than a large company, which can have high minimum requirements (as much as $2,500 per event) and more operating costs, like paying full-time staffers. Also consider buying bottles from somewhat less prestigious wine-growing regions, such as Oregon; Santa Barbara, California; and France's Loire Valley.
