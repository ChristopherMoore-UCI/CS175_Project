On a tour of Tuttle's Red Barn store, youngest sister Becky Tuttle, 58,  points to a heap of fresh radishes, proudly noting "everything that says 'our own' on the sign was grown here. Tuttle says the farm needs a "fresh approach, fresh ideas and fresh legs and backs to do that." Since 1635, the Tuttle farm has been passed from father to son and after years of thought, Will Tuttle has put what's known as the country's longest family-run farm up for sale. As the 11th generation Tuttle man to farm this now 134-acre plot of land in New Hampshire, Will Tuttle says he has no regrets. " Tuttle says his health has been compromised by decades of farm work; he ruptured his Achilles tendon a couple of years ago and he says he suffers from neck and back problems.
