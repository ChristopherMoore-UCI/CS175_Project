Another short video clip, called "Just Testing My Gun," showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is "a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors. As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news.
