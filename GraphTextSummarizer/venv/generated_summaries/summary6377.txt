"This pause -- and it is only a pause in a multi-year drilling program that will ultimately provide great benefits both to the state of Alaska and the nation as a whole -- is necessary for Shell to repair its ships and make the necessary updates to its exploration plans that will ensure a safe return to exploration soon." The incidents sharpened concerns about Shell's plans to drill in the Arctic, both among environmentalists and in native Alaskan communities. Royal Dutch Shell says it will "pause" its closely watched project to drill for oil off the Alaskan coast this year, instead spending 2013 preparing for future exploration. And Chuck Clusen, the Natural Resources Defense Council's director of Alaska projects, said the Obama administration should "learn from this experience, step into the ring and end this folly once and for all -- before the next accident happens." Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the ranking member of the Senate's energy and natural resources committee, said that she continues to support Shell's plans and that the suspension was evidence of the company's commitment to safety. Shrinking of the region's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region.
