Consumers both love and fear disruptive companies like Uber. In contrast, Uber has embraced a take-it-or-leave-it approach that may be tough for consumers to swallow over the long haul. This adds up to Uber being a welcome disruption, blowing competition and free market pricing into the regulated taxi industries that don't always serve the interests of consumers. This requires Uber to develop a true brand to manage its disruption and take control of the conversation with consumers. For Uber to get the value of its disruption, in the form of consumer goodwill, people will need to know why Uber-instigated changes in the taxi industry are good, not bad.
