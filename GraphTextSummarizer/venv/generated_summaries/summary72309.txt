"Unlike with prescription drugs, heroin purity and dosage amounts vary, and heroin is often cut with other substances, all of which could cause inexperienced abusers to accidentally overdose," the DEA says in its drug threat assessment report for 2013. But unlike pills, there's no way to regulate the dosage of heroin, given the undetermined purity. "When someone knows that there are heroin bags that are killing people or making them overdose, then we know that those are the good bags. In the first two weeks of 2014, police in Delray Beach, Florida, say, they seized more heroin than they did in the past 10 years combined. " But the low cost, the readily availability and the prescription pill-like high makes heroin a draw that's hard to resist.
