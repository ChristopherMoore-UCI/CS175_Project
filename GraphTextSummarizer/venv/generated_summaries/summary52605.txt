Amtrak police are searching for a retired San Francisco firefighter who went missing while traveling to visit family in Montreal. An Amtrak conductor may have spoken with Dowd early Friday near Omaha, Nebraska, one of the stops along the route, the family said. "He has medical needs and does need his medication for high blood pressure and heart disease," Jennifer Dowd told CNN affiliate KGO. Jennifer Dowd flew to Omaha on Sunday to look for her father. The train stopped overnight in Fort Morgan, Colorado, and in the Nebraska cities of McCook, Holdrege, Hasting, Lincoln and Omaha.
