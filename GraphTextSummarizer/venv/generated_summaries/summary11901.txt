A storied former U.S. Navy aircraft carrier is on its final voyage Friday, a slow journey from Rhode Island to a scrapyard in Texas. The ship carried all kinds of aircraft during its 38 years, but its final voyage had to wait for the departure of some other "fliers," according to the War College report: While it was docked in Rhode Island, a pair of peregrine falcons had chicks in a nest aboard the carrier. The Navy in May announced it was paying ESCO Marine of Brownsville, Texas, one cent to take the carrier off its hands for dismantling and recycling. The carrier was also part of Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and air operations over the Balkans in 1992, 1993 and 1994, according to Navy records. That ship was towed to All Star Metals of Brownsville earlier this year, with the Navy paying a penny to the ship recycler under a contract awarded last October.
