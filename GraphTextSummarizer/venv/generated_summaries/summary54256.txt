So my friend recently posted about something really big in the news -- OK, how much he likes Carly Rae Jepsen's "Call Me Maybe," but, hey, that's big in MY world -- on Facebook. Out of politeness, I've accepted Facebook friend requests from any family members who have sent them. Still, a recent study showed that those who use Facebook as an outlet to get out all their gripes are basically the bane of their "friends' " existence, so maybe you better save the rants about the Bieb's protÃ©gÃ© for next time you consume an entire bottle of wine at your buddy's birthday party -- you know, before the tears start. Admit it.) on your Timeline, click on "Friends," right next to "Post." Scroll down to "Custom," and from there you can block specific people from seeing your Timeline post, and consequently littering it with inane comments. Via Facebook message?
