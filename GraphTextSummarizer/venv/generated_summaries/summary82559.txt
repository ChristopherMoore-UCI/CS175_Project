" When Alwan spoke to CNN in 2008, he said, "I never told anyone Saddam Hussein was producing weapons of mass destruction." -- Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said Wednesday that U.S. intelligence officials should be questioned over their handling of "Curveball," an Iraqi defector whose now discredited claims on weapons of mass destruction helped fuel the Bush administration's drive to war in 2003. But in his interview with the Guardian, Alwan said he had already won asylum before he spoke to German intelligence about weapons programs in Iraq, and that telling them his story did not win him a life of ease. At the time, intelligence sources told CNN that Alwan had claimed that Iraq had a secret bioweapons program. Not all observers are accepting Alwan's claim that his goal in spinning his WMD tale was to free the people of Iraq from Hussein.
