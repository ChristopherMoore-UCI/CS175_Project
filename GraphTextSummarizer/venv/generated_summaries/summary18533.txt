Jason West, co-author of the study published in the journal of Environmental Research Letters said: "Outdoor air pollution is an important problem and among the most important environmental risk factors for health." East Asia is the worst affected area with researchers estimating more than a million people dying prematurely every year from PM2.5 pollution and 203,000 from ozone pollution. The study also investigated the effects of climate change on worsening air pollution, comparing climate models from the year 2000 with pre-industrial times (1850). We found that the effects of past climate change are likely to be a very small component of the overall effect of air pollution," said West, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences and Engineering at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. "Going forward into the future, climate change will get more severe and that could have greater effects on air pollution." The research adds to a growing body of evidence revealing both the human and economic impacts of air pollution around the world.
