A pair of German artists claimed responsibility for the July stunt on top of the bridge, saying it was nothing more than an "art project" meant to deal with "questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere." Security at the bridge was recently heightened after American flags atop the two towers of the bridge were stolen in July and replaced by white flags. The latest security breach occurred Sunday afternoon when a 24-year-old self-described thrill seeker visiting from Russia scaled the bridge and reached the top of one of the towers, where he snapped several photos with his iPhone, a senior law enforcement official said. Yaroslav Kolchin, who was visiting from Moscow, had been staying at a Manhattan hotel when sometime Sunday he decided he wanted to scale the bridge for thrills and take photos, the official said. He faces charges of reckless endangerment, obstructing governmental administration, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct.
