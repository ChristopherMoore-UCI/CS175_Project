(EW.com ) -- 300: Rise of an Empire speared its competition and kept on raking in the dollars on its opening weekend. The 342 IMAX screens brought in $6.8 million (or 15 percent) of the film's weekend earnings, while 3-D showings accounted for 63 percent of the grosses. The brilliant dog and his eager young companion will likely enjoy at least one more good weekend at the box office before Muppets Most Wanted screams into theaters on March 21. Finally, in fifth place, Mark Burnett and Roma Downey's biblical epic Son of God fell 60 percent and took in an estimated $10 million in its second weekend in theaters, bringing its domestic total to $41.5 million. Budapest's debut also pushes Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom (opened to $130k per theater average) to the No. 3 spot.
