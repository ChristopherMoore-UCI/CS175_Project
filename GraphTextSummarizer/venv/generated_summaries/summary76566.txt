Republican attorneys general in several states say they are weighing legal challenges to President Barack Obama's overhaul of immigration rules. But, he said, because Obama's immigration move was an executive order rather than a bill that worked its way through Congress, attorneys general have less time to prepare their moves than he did in 2010. Cuccinelli's lawsuit was eventually rejected, but other states had some success with the Supreme Court, which rejected a challenge to the law's individual mandate but allowed states to opt out of its expansion of the Medicaid program. Opinion: Obama's immigration move is a win Cuccinelli said there is strength in numbers for attorneys general who, while elected in most states, are usually lower-key lawyers unaccustomed to the spotlight that comes with taking on the White House. Even Joe Arpaio, the colorful sheriff in Arizona's Maricopa County, said he's suing Obama over immigration.
