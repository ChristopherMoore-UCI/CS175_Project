"For a big man, he's as gentle as they come," Jesse Matthew Sr. told CNN affiliate WTVR. Matthew's father, Jesse Matthew Sr., has said that his son would not have harmed Graham. Human remains discovered last weekend in Albemarle County, Virginia, belong to University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, authorities said Friday. The downtown Charlottesville camera footage showed Graham leaving the Tempo Bar at around 2 a.m. on September 13, as well as a man -- later identified by authorities as Jesse Matthew, 32 -- following her. Graham, 18, went missing before dawn on September 13 after being last spotted on several surveillance cameras in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area.
