"Despite warnings of planned protests, Vick had hoped to continue with the appearances as planned, bringing his story of redemption and second chance to major markets," said Worthy Publishing, a Tennessee-based Christian publishing company. "Michael Vick has millions of fans and has countless letters from teachers thanking him for inspiring students to make positive change." Vick, who spent about 18 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to dogfighting charges in 2007, has been trying to turn his life and his image around in recent years. "However, once the reported protests escalated into threats of violence against the retailers, Worthy Publishing, Vick and his family, decided to cancel the events." Last year, Vick announced he had gotten a dog for his family in an effort to show his children how to have a healthy relationship with animals.
