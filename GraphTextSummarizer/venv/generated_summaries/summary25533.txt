British forces officially handed over responsibility of Basra to Iraqi forces in December. The suspect, who is unshaven and appears to be in his 20s or 30s, was arrested by Iraq security forces after they retook most of Basra in April. For four years after the invasion, Basra was under the control of British forces, but they were unable to contain the violence and withdrew in September last year. Basra's streets teemed with Shiite militias armed with weapons, mostly from Iran, according to the Iraqi forces and the U.S. military. Basra turned into a battleground between warring Shiite factions vying for control of the country's oil-rich south after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.
