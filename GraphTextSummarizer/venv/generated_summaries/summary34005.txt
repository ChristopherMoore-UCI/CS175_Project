Lindsey Lowe's father discovered one of the bodies Wednesday morning and called police, Hendersonville Police Lt. Scott Ryan said. The woman told police she placed the bodies in a laundry basket and covered them with towels to hide them. And Ron Blanton, an assistant district attorney in Sumner County, told HLN's Velez-Mitchell that the case "wears on" those seeking justice in the case. She was at work at a dental clinic for children when her father found the bodies, police said. Pellegrin said Lowe was "on suicide watch," receiving sedatives from medical personnel at the corrections facility.
