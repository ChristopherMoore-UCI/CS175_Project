A Cairo court granted bail to Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed pending a retrial on charges that they supported the banned Muslim Brotherhood. At the time of their arrest, Egypt was mired in political turmoil after the ouster of President Mohamed Morsy and his Muslim Brotherhood-backed government. Last year, all three were convicted on charges that included conspiring with the Brotherhood, spreading false news and endangering national security. Mohamed, an Egyptian citizen, was not required to pay but is barred from leaving the country before the retrial on February 23. Egypt is the sixth-leading jailer of journalists in the world, according to a tally conducted in December by the nonpartisan Committee to Protect Journalists.
