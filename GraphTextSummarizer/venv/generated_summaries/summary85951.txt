-- A leading figure in French President Nicolas Sarkozy's party, the UMP, has dismissed any suggestion that ex-International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was set up when he was arrested on charges of sexual assault in New York in May. "To imagine that what would have happened to Mr. Strauss-Kahn would be the object of some sort of complicity from the UMP, it seems too hard to believe," said Jean-Francois Cope, secretary-general of the UMP party. Strauss-Kahn still faces a civil suit from Diallo in New York, but he has asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing his job gave him immunity from civil cases. A female friend of Strauss-Kahn allegedly warned him that an email he had sent had been read at UMP offices in Paris. The New York hotel where the alleged incident was reported also dismissed the story as "inaccurate and speculative." If this was the case it meant, according to the New York Review of Books, "he had reason to suspect he might be under electronic surveillance in New York.
