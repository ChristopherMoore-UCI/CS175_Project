As an actress, Theron is famous for roles in films as diverse as serial killer biopic "Monster" and Will Smith superhero movie "Hancock," switching with apparent ease between small independent movies and big-budget blockbusters. Despite Theron's success in bringing Arriaga's vision to the big screen, Theron says she is not ready to move into producing bigger films yet. When it comes to bagging the best jobs behind the camera, Hollywood A-lister Charlize Theron says that women have to make their own luck. However, Theron feels positive about not only her own position in Hollywood, but also that of her female peers in the industry, such as fellow Oscar winner Kate Winslet. Theron also represents a small minority of women who work behind the camera in Hollywood.
