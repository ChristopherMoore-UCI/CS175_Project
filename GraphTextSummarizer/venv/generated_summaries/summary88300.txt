Erad3, according to site co-owner Mark Allin, was almost certainly Jared Lee Loughner, the 22-year-old man accused of killing six people and injuring 14 others last weekend, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona. Allin noted that all 130 messages from Erad3 were posted from Loughner's hometown of Tucson, and many of them bear a striking resemblance to postings made by Loughner on the popular social media site YouTube. They do, however, appear to reflect a strong urge to break free of any constraints -- real or imagined -- imposed by government officials. None of Erad3's postings mentions Giffords or a desire for violence, unlike language used in documents found in Loughner's residence. " The investigation into the postings is part of a pledge from law enforcement authorities to pursue every lead relating to Saturday's shooting.
