" It has prompted some to ask, "what exactly is it that the Duke of York does and what is the point of him?" Since his association with convicted sex offender financier Epstein forced the Duke to accept a downgrading of his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011, he has been busy trying to carve out a new role for himself. New role Essentially, his new role is all about assisting the economic success of, and the creation of skilled jobs in, the UK. This combined with the fact the ongoing civil court case in the U.S. against Epstein and three women could just keep turning up new embarrassing allegations about the Duke.
