The case centers on an attempt by groups including the Cyprus-based Free Gaza Movement and a pro-Palestinian Turkish charity to deliver goods to the Palestinian territory despite an Israeli blockade in May 2010. Last year, U.S. President Barack Obama helped broker a telephone apology for the raid from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to his Turkish counterpart. But Israeli commandos raided one of the ships, the Mavi Marmara, because it violated the Israeli-imposed blockade on the Palestinian territory. Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza in 2007 after the militant group Hamas seized control of the Palestinian territory. While conceding that war crimes may have been committed in the botched raid, the potential cases "would not be of 'sufficient gravity' to justify further action by the ICC," prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said.
