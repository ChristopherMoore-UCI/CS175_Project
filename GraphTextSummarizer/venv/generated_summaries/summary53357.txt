Police found the bodies of William Burtron, 69, Sheila Burtron, 68, Christie Lee, 33, Bailey Burtron, 16, and Iiaonna Green, 18, late Saturday night at a home in the Water's Edge subdivision of LaGrange,  about 70 miles southwest of Atlanta near the Alabama border, CNN affiliate WSB reported. The pastor called local authorities, and Tupelo police found Lee still at the bus stop. According to authorities, Lee got along with members of the congregation and they chipped in to purchase him a bus ticket to Opelika, Alabama. Lee had been on the run since Saturday from LaGrange, Georgia, where he is accused of killing his wife, her parents, a family member and a friend. Authorities said Lee attended a church service at Crossroads Baptist Church in a small town near Tupelo on Sunday.
