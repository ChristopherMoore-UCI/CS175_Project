The U.S. Marshals Service provides protection for members of the high court when they are traveling domestically, and agency spokesman Jeff Carter said last week the agency was "aware of the incident involving Justice Breyer on the Caribbean island of Nevis and is assisting the Supreme Court Police and local law enforcement authorities with the investigation as needed." said Monday a local man has been arrested and charged in the recent armed robbery of vacationing Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said after the robbery, "We are assisting the local police with their investigation." Commissioner C.G. Walwyn of the Royal St. Christopher and Nevis Police Force had said, "Our American-trained crime scene investigators and the members of our Criminal Investigators (unit) are working closely with the FBI on this case." During the court's break, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg traveled to Egypt and Tunisia last month as part of an outreach program sponsored by the State Department, which provided her security in the volatile region. The male assailant fled the scene, according to court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg.
