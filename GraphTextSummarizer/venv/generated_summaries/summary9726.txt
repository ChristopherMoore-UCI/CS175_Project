In addition, pregnant women infected with H1N1 were four times as likely as sick people in the general population to be hospitalized for it, she said. Some doctors are reluctant to prescribe the drugs to pregnant women because they are concerned about their possible effect on the fetus, but Jamieson urged them to put aside those concerns. Still, Jamieson said she is not recommending that pregnant women avoid crowds or take any other precautions that would affect their daily routines. Still, the apparent disproportionate impact of H1N1 on pregnant women is not surprising, given the body changes that occur during pregnancy, she said. The authors of the study suggest that pregnant women infected with the virus, commonly known as swine flu, take antiviral drugs to protect themselves and their fetuses.
