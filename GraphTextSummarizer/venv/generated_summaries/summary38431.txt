The Manila Standard newspaper reported that the Dallas Cowboys Stadium, where Pacquiao had his last fight against Joshua Clottey and the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, where Mayweather was last in action, had both been booked for November 13. -- Filipino boxing star Manny Pacquiao says he wants one final bout as a professional and it looks set to be an eagerly-awaited match-up against Floyd Mayweather Jr. later this year. The two were due to fight earlier this year, but negotiations ended acrimoniously with Pacquiao angered by the insistence of the Mayweather camp for Olympic style pre-fight drugs tests. "Many fans really want me to fight Floyd Mayweather so I asked my Mama if we can give them one more fight, she said okay," AFP quoted Pacquiao in an interview with broadcaster ABS-CBN. But with leading American promoter Bob Arum pulling the strings, visiting the Philippines to watch Pacquiao campaign for the election, the fight all boxing fans want to see could now be on.
