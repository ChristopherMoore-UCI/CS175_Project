But despite his early success, Nelson was still unknown outside his country -- that changed, however, in June 1982 when he was given the chance to fight world Featherweight champion Salvador Sanchez at New York's Madison Square Garden. Nowadays, Nelson is trying to preserve the legacy of boxing in Ghana, working with young talent to help create the country's next crop of champions. Four years later he cemented his reputation as boxing royalty when he won the world Super Featherweight/Junior Lightweight title. Today, Nelson's nickname has taken on new meaning as the former champion now spends his time teaching the secrets of boxing to a new generation of athletes. A former three-time world champion, Nelson is often described as the best boxer to come out of the African continent.
