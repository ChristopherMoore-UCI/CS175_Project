-- Invisible Children, which produced a hugely popular half-hour documentary about notorious African warlord Joseph Kony, released a new video Monday to try to address criticisms about its nonprofit organization, its approach and its goals. Invisible Children, which is based in San Diego, said it hopes the film and other efforts will make Kony a household name and drum up international support to halt killings, rapes, abuses and abductions committed by his group the Lord's Resistance Army, or LRA, in central Africa. " Russell, the video's director, on Sunday told CNN that Invisible Children had chosen Kony as a focal point to get its larger message out about ending violence and promoting peace in the region. Actress Mia Farrow, a good will ambassador for UNICEF who has visited areas attacked by the LRA, commended Invisible Children for bringing "unprecedented focus" to a horrific situation but urged people to donate money to agencies like the Red Cross and UNICEF that work to help victims. "They should open their eyes more on the people affected by the war," she said of Invisible Children.
