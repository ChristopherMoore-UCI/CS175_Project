But for other close watchers, there were doubts there which have now greatly increased and led 25 UK Lockerbie relatives, together with members of the family of the one Libyan found guilty, recently to lodge a request for a third appeal against the Zeist verdict with Scotland's Criminal Case Review Commission. Lust for revenge is natural, but self-defeating, for the consequence of revenge is so often further revenge. The first question for many relatives of the victims of MH17, as for us after Lockerbie, will be whether their loved ones suffered. Nowadays we have a better route, through the International Criminal Court, and what those of us who are not MH17 relatives should do is to monitor and encourage all efforts to pass the whole known truth to the MH17 relatives and to discover and detain those responsible. MH17 relatives may also find help from the small UK charity Disaster Action.
