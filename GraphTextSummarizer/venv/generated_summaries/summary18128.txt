American Admirals Club and US Airways Club members now have access to both airline clubs, and American AAdvantage Citi Executive cardholders have access to US Airways Clubs. -- Frequent fliers on American Airlines and US Airways can now enjoy some benefits of both airlines' mileage programs, American announced Tuesday. US Airways will exit the Star Alliance on March 30 and enter into the oneworld alliance on March 31. "We're kicking off the new year by bringing our customers the first phase of enhanced benefits, including the ability to earn and redeem miles when traveling across our stronger combined network," said Scott Kirby, president of the new American Airlines and former president of US Airways. While members of American's AAdvantage and US Airways' Dividend Miles will eventually belong to one program, that won't happen right away.
