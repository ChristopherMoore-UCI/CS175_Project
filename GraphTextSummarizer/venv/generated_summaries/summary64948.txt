-- A major online sports betting operation known as Legendz Sports, which allegedly took in more than $1 billion in illegal sports bets, has been busted, and dozens of individuals and related businesses have been indicted, the Justice Department announced Wednesday. The operation was first run out of Costa Rica, and then from Panama City, Panama, according to the indictment. Government prosecutors said that a federal grand jury seated in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, returned indictments against 34 individuals associated with Legendz and 23 business entities that helped facilitate the operation. "Today's charges demonstrate that we are as determined as ever to hold accountable those involved in facilitating illegal online gambling by U.S. citizens, regardless of where the business operates, or where the defendants reside," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Mythili Raman. U.S. Attorney Sanford Coats in Oklahoma City said the FBI and IRS had been working on the case for several years.
