Government tallies list more than 34,600 deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. But many stories behind the statistics are never told, Mexican journalist Marcela Turati Munoz told CNN en Espa√±ol. Turati said she hopes the stories in the book will not only "make victims visible" but encourage others to act. Other stories are told in Turati's voice, like that of 10 children killed by an explosion in Durango state while on their way to receive "Opportunities" scholarships from the government. Turati conducted interviews in 10 Mexican states while researching the book, which hits shelves Tuesday.
