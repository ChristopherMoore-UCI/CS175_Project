Even though Foster's day job entails designing master-plans for cities and big resorts in China, he managed to devote enough time to his hobby to create a classic car museum, housed in former sheds of his parents' farmhouse in Northern Ireland. For the past three years, this architect with a serious penchant for automotive history has been the chairman of Classic Car Club Hong Kong, and has also been researching a book on the first 100 years of motoring in the city. "When I buy or when I'm looking at new cars, there's got to be something that I'm passionate about -- maybe the age of the car, maybe I remember a movie or when my father had it when I was a youngster. For the 50-year-old Hong Kong based architect, this sparked a lifelong motoring passion, and today he owns a collection of 40 classic cars and 130 motorcycles. Growing up on a farm in Northern Ireland, he would help his father herd cattle on a motorcycle, going up and down a mountain close to his parents' home.
