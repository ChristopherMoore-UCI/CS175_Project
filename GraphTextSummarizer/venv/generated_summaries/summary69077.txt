" On October 9, Taliban assassins attacked a van that carried Malala and other schoolchildren. About that time, the Taliban issued a formal edict, which covered her home in Pakistan's Swat Valley, banning all girls from schools. Malala has already started talking about furthering the cause that enraged the Taliban. "We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us," a Taliban spokesman later said, as Malala, in a Pakistani hospital, breathed with the help of a ventilator. The Taliban vowed that if Malala survived, they would come after her again.
