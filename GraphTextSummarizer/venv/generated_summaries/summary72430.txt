Emma Peel in "The Avengers"  British agent John Steed had several different partners over the course of the original 1960s series, but Emma Peel, played by Diana Rigg, was the best: A certified genius equally adept at fencing and martial arts, she fought mad scientists in mod black-and-white ensembles (many of which were designed by Pierre Cardin). Nikita in "La Femme Nikita"  Anne Parillaud played the titular cocktail-dress-clad assassin in Luc Besson's original 1990 film: She went from teenage drug addict to literal femme fatale at the behest of her French intelligence agency handlers. Vesper Lynd in "Casino Royale"  Eva Green played Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent brought in to bankroll James Bond during a game of high stakes poker in this 2006 "reboot" of the series. Agent 99 in "Get Smart"  Eminently capable and devastatingly gorgeous, Anne Hathaway's Agent 99 was the only CONTROL agent, aside from Maxwell Smart, whose identity hadn't been compromised at the start of the 2008 film. But we'll admit: The recent arrest of 11 members of a so-called Russian espionage ring -- coupled with coverage of their assumed identities, their old-school tactics (invisible ink!), and even, in the case of "red-hot beauty" Anna Chapman, their coquettish Facebook pictures -- got us thinking about some of our favorite stylish spies from film and television.
