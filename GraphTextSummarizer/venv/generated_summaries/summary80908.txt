Widespread damage in southwestern California led Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich to issue a state of emergency "to ensure that state and federal financial resources are available to serve county residents impacted by the windstorms. -- Southern California residents and recovery crews continued their cleanup efforts Saturday, two days after powerful winds downed power lines, damaged structures and caused other devastation. The weather service reported gusts stronger than 140 mph along the Sierra Crest mountain ridge, while there were roughly 100 mph-hour winds in the San Gabriel Mountain Foothills of southern California, said Southern California Edison spokesman Gil Alexander. It was an extreme manifestation of a regional reality: Santa Ana winds, a condition in which strong winds descend to the Pacific Coast around Los Angeles from inland desert regions, according to the National Weather Service. Southern California Edison, for example, had 77,400 customers still without power as of 5 p.m. PT (8 p.m. ET) on Saturday, said Alexander.
