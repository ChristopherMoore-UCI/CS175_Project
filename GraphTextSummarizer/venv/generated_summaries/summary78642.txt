-- An investigation into the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean will also include a probe into Air France-KLM, the airline's attorney said Friday. Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster.
