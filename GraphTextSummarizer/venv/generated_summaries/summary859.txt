Zabaleta said an officer agreed to "take care of it." "It wasn't hard to spot LeBron," Zabaleta said, "and what the officer did was he told the officers working the traffic detail to stop traffic, hold the traffic and then he chose to go northbound on the southbound lanes. "The stadium got a phone call that LeBron James was stuck in traffic, so the stadium personnel got hold of one of our police supervisors working the event," Zabaleta said. "That's all the officer did, but LeBron went ahead and recorded it and said he was getting a police escort and going against traffic." But he wasn't playing Frogger the whole way," referring to a video game in which a frog tries to make it across a road amid busy traffic. That's the question some are asking after the basketball superstar was given a police escort Sunday night to the Jay Z and Justin Timberlake concert at Miami's Sun Life Stadium.
