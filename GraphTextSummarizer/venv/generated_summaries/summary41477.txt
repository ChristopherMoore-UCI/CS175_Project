Political science can move students beyond the horse race that is often overcovered in journalism and into understanding the larger structural patterns and institutional dilemmas that continually shape politics. In 2010, only 45% of high school students were able to demonstrate a basic understanding of U.S. history. Another student, an undergraduate economics major, decided to take one of my seminars on political history primarily for his intellectual curiosity. It also is great instruction in the art of writing and communication, another skill that seems to be falling by the wayside in modern politics. He had returned to complete his undergraduate degree after years in the workforce and found that studying the history of American politics opened up many insights into the origins of the problems he had confronted.
