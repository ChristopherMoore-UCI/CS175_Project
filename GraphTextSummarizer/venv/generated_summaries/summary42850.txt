Bank of America Employees: 248,074 Women: 60% Headquarters: Charlotte, NC What We Love Family health insurance is worth its weight in gold these days, but parents at this leading bank only need to work 20 hours per week to earn it. Since 2004, the clinics have doled out some $7 million in medical care to employee families, which has put money back in parents' wallets. Women who work 20 hours per week can take nine partially paid weeks off after the birth of a child. While ten on and near-site child-care centers offer subsidies, parents can also call a resource and referral service to locate nannies, day cares, backup assistance and special-needs caregivers. TriHealth Employees: 10,114 Women: 83% Headquarters: Cincinnati, OH What We Love Employee kids are everywhere at this health-care system -- working as candy stripers, roaming the halls during holiday parties, running through the on-site gymnasium and taking swimming, babysitting and yoga classes.
