A man was charged Saturday in Wales with the murder and abduction of a 5-year-old girl, April Jones, who has been missing since Monday. Meanwhile, the police search for April continues in and around the town of Machynlleth, in a remote corner of rural mid-Wales. He will appear before magistrates in Aberystwyth on Monday morning, Jenkins said. Mark Bridger has also been charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, prosecutor Iwan Jenkins said. "I realize that this is an incredibly difficult time for April's family, friends and the community," he added.
