"I don't care who or what these criminals claim to be, but I can never recognize these criminals as part of my city or my faith community," said Yusufi Vali, executive director of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, the largest mosque in the Boston area. -- The body of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev lies unclaimed in a state morgue. But the Islamic Society of Boston said Wednesday that the family had not contacted local mosque officials with any funeral requests. That would be done by an organization that does body-washings and funerals for several mosques in the community, she said. The leadership of mosques in Cambridge and Roxbury have discussed the issue and decided that they will hold a funeral for Tsarnaev if they are asked by the family, said Nichole Mossalam, a spokeswoman for the executive director of the Islamic Society of Boston.
