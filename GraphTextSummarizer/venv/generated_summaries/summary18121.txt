As MTV points out, "Cruel Summer" is similar to West's 2010 short film "Runaway" in that it's an extended music video with little dialogue and plenty of striking imagery. Kanye West premiered his much-discussed short film/art installation "Cruel Summer" at the Cannes Film Festival last night. The film's cast also includes Razane Jammal, Pusha T, Big Sean, Palestinian actor Ali Suliman, Aziz Ansari and West himself. The Los Angeles Times film blog 24 Frames wrote, "The story is secondary to the pyrotechnics, with new music from West and a thumping surround-sound quality that makes a 3D Michael Bay effort feel like an iPad short. " Vulture, meanwhile, praised West's "great visual sense" and noted the effectiveness of the special camera rig invented for the film to incorporate all seven screens, whether it was stretching a single shot across multiple screens or having each display a different image/angle during a single scene.
