Earlier this year it rolled out tools that give the managers of Pinterest pages insights into how people are interacting with pins that link to their websites. "They work just like regular pins, only they have a special 'promoted' label, along with a link to learn more about what that means," Ben Silbermann, CEO and Co-Founder of Pinterest, wrote in a blog post in September. Social media site Pinterest just received another $225 million in funding. Bottom line: People come to Pinterest with more of an intenticon to buy than when visiting other networks like Facebook and Twitter. Rick Heitzman is the Managing Director at FirstMark Capital -- a venture capital firm that has invested in Pinterest -- and he says the strengths are the visual nature of the platform, as well as the size and growth of the social network's user base.
