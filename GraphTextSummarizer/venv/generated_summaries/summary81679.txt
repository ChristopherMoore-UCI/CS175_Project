"We're excited that Harry Potter fans worldwide are now able to read J.K. Rowling's fantastic books on their Kindles and free Kindle reading apps." "By offering the NOOK editions of this popular series, long-time fans and first-time readers can experience the magic of Harry Potter in a new, exciting way and read what they love, anywhere they like," offered Jim Hilt, Vice President of e-books for Barnes & Noble. "For years our customers have loved reading Harry Potter books in print, and have made them the best-selling print book series on Amazon.com," said Russ Grandinetti, Amazon's vice president of Kindle content. The entire "Harry Potter" series is now available in digital form at Pottermore, author J.K. Rowling's website for all things Potter, ending what was easily the biggest e-book holdout in the literary world. Rowling didn't agree to make the books available digitally at all until last year, a full 14 years after the first, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," was published. Readers seeking the e-books on Amazon or Barnes & Noble's site will be directed to Pottermore to buy them.
