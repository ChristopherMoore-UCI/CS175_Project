For most of the last three decades, nuclear generating costs have been lower than those for natural gas or coal. In the U.S., concern over high natural gas prices, global natural gas shortages and potential carbon taxes gave rise to the so-called "nuclear renaissance" of just a few short years ago. Existing nuclear plants improved safety and were uprated, adding the equivalent of many new reactors without actually building a new one. But the financial crisis and economic downturn that followed reduced the number of planned new nuclear plants from 25 to just five that actually started construction. While the building of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S. was slowed, the world increased its nuclear fleet to more than 430 reactors.
