Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words Â» Part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. The Spike Lee film "Do the Right Thing," critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. Lee has said he wrote the film quickly, upset by racial incidents roiling New York City in the 1980s. Though Lee is quick to credit Universal and its then head Tom Pollock for championing the film, he said things haven't changed much in the movie business. Lee makes the point that race issues haven't vanished simply because America has a black president.
