-- Lawyers for Mel Gibson and his ex-girlfriend attended a closed hearing with a Los Angeles family court judge for two hours Thursday morning, but neither Gibson nor Oksana Grigorieva were there. A source close to the investigation told CNN that Gibson's lawyer met with Los Angeles County Sheriff's investigators Tuesday to present evidence that Grigorieva, 40, attempted to extort money from Gibson to keep audio recordings secret. Several explosive audio recordings, purportedly between Grigorieva and Gibson, have been released online in recent days. Grigorieva has accused Gibson of striking her in the face, while he alleges that she attempted to extort him to keep controversial recordings of their arguments a secret. "To specifically address the allegations, my client, Ms. Grigorieva, has repeatedly stated that there is no credible evidence whatsoever of extortion by her, and she stands steadfastly by that statement," Jaffe said.
