Carol and Beth had finally been reunited with their people when Dawn demanded that Rick return her former ward, Noah. One year after we saw the death of patriarch Hershel, the Greene family had lost someone else. But all of that action paled in comparison to the big, heartbreaking exchange at Grady Memorial Hospital (and if you went to the show's official Facebook or Instagram right afterward, you know what happened). And then it happened: One of Dawn's comments set Beth off, leading to an altercation that ended with Dawn shooting Beth in the head. Beth pushed yet another cop, the threatening O'Donnell, down an elevator, and Morgan found his way back to the church just as our group of survivors left it.
