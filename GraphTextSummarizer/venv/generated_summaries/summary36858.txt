Shafik narrowly lost a June presidential runoff to Mohamed Morsy in what was Egypt's first election since Mubarak was ousted from office during a popular uprising in 2011. -- The last prime minister to serve under ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was referred to trial on corruption charges by an investigative judge, officials said. Egyptian prosecutors have already ordered the arrest and extradition of Shafik in a separate corruption case involving the alleged illegal sale of real estate to Mubarak's sons. The charges against Ahmed Shafik, the runner-up in Egypt's presidential election, arise from allegations made against him while he served as the nation's civil aviation minister under Mubarak.
