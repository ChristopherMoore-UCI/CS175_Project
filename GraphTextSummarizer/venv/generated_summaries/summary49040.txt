The SIM card ejector tool in some North American first-generation iPads was made of Liquidmetal, and since then, Keller said, it's been used in a number of other internal parts and small mechanical components. Liquidmetal has been used in Apple products (as well as those of other manufacturers) for several years. "Liquidmetal allows precision parts to be fabricated similar to plastic injection molding, but with similar properties to metal," IHS senior principal analyst Kevin Keller said. "We expect Apple and other manufacturers to start using this not only for larger and more visible portions of devices, but also entire enclosures," Keller said. It's a class of patented amorphous metal alloys (basically metallic glass) with unique properties including high strength, high wear resistance against scratching and denting, and a good strength-to-weight ratio.
