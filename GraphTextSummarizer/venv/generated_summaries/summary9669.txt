The following week, Clinton will headline two New York events tied to her 1995 speech to the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- a speech Clinton regularly references in pitches to women. Most of Clinton's events are focused on one thing: women. At the D.C. speech on March 3, Clinton is expected to give a nod to the group's importance to Democrats and highlight the reason more women are needed in politics. Clinton will use the speech to outline the findings in the Clinton Foundation report and "reflect on progress made in implementing the agenda set in Beijing two decades ago," the organizers said in a release about the event. In 1998, Clinton put together the Vital Voices Conference of women in Belfast, a body that pressed for a piece agreement.
