Indonesia said Friday that Schapelle Corby, an Australian woman convicted almost nine years ago of drug smuggling, has been granted parole. The punishment fueled anger in Australia, where many people said they felt Corby had been set up. Australian media have reported that she will have to remain in Bali on parole until 2017. Corby, 36, was convicted in May 2005 for smuggling nine pounds (4.1 kilograms) of marijuana in a bag, while arriving at Bali's Denpasar International Airport the previous October. Indonesian Justice Minister Amir Syamsuddin announced the decision at a news conference in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, saying Corby's parole review was one of more than 1,000 that had been completed.
