Cherif Kouachi's widow, Izzana Kouachi, has requested that both he and his brother Said Kouachi be buried in Gennevilliers, on the outskirts of Paris. Two days before Coulibaly was killed, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi had attacked the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people and injuring 11. Standing alongside Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Kerry added that he "wanted to express to you personally the sheer horror and revulsion" over what he called a "living nightmare. The plan was to kill police officers on public roads or in police offices, he said. Coulibaly was killed last Friday in a police siege to end a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in Paris.
