As protesters marched, Human Rights Watch issued a report Friday entitled "Syria: Rampant Torture of Protesters," a document detailing arbitrary detention, as well as mistreatment in prison. "There can be no real reforms in Syria while security forces abuse people with impunity," said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. He said the unrest could "easily escalate into widespread violence," citing reports that people are now arming themselves to retaliate against security. The Syrian Arab News Agency reported brief and limited street gatherings in different cities and towns, largely without any conflict with security forces or reports of vandalism. As forces tried to disperse the crowd with tear gas and warning shots, demonstrators and security forces threw rocks, a half-hour confrontation that left 10 demonstrators lightly injured, one of the witnesses said.
