The shaven-headed Page, whose tattoos included the Celtic cross adopted by white supremacist groups, had been the front man for a white-power rock band called "End Apathy" for several years. Page moved back to Denver after his discharge, where he had a tough time in civilian life "and was basically living on the street," Robillard said. In a 2010 interview posted online, Page said his lyrics "vary from sociological issues, religion, and how the value of human life has been degraded by being submissive to tyranny and hypocrisy that we are subjugated to." End Apathy played gigs in North Carolina and in the Midwest, he said. It was a trip Page recounted in 2010, in an online interview about his band End Apathy. Investigators spent Monday trying to figure out what led 40-year-old Wade Michael Page from repairing missiles for the Army to a Sikh temple in suburban Milwaukee, where he was killed by police at the end of a Sunday morning rampage.
