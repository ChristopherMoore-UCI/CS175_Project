Second half goals from Andy Carroll, Morgan Amalfitano and Stewart Downing kept up their outside shot at Champions League qualification. A first half penalty from Santi Cazorla and a second half Olivier Giroud header secured all three points for the North London club, reigniting their Champions League ambitions whilst leaving second place Manchester City five points adrift of Chelsea. "The penalty changed the game," Manchester City coach Manuel Pellegrini told Sky Sports after the game, hinting that he believed Monreal deceived the referee. Santi Cazorla, by far the best player on the pitch, dispatched the penalty despite Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart guessing the right way. Meanwhile, in Sunday's other English Premier League game, West Ham United continued their brilliant start to the season by swatting aside relegation threatened Hull City.
