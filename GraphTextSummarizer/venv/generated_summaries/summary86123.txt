Packing winds as strong as 200 kilometers per hour (124 mph), Typhoon Utor made landfall early Monday on the east coast of the Philippine island of Luzon, damaging hundreds of houses. Situated near an area of the Pacific Ocean where typhoons form, the Philippines regularly suffers severe storm damage. It weakened as it moved over land, and by Monday afternoon, it had begun to head out into the South China Sea. The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported one death in the province of Benguet on Monday afternoon. The storm tore apart rickety houses and ripped the roof off a local hospital, the local broadcaster said, showing images of flattened homes buried under fallen trees.
