Judge Saunter will check on her progress in meeting the community service and psychological counseling requirements she imposed last summer when she sentenced Lohan to probation for stealing a necklace from a Venice, California, jewelry store. She is due back in court Wednesday morning for a status hearing before Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Saunter. As with Lohan's smile, there are online reports that her record of probation compliance is stained and that Lohan again faces jail time. Not to mention the many paparazzi that hound Lohan through the streets of Los Angeles. Steve Honig was responding to online buzz about a close up photo of Lohan's teeth that appear to show stains that bloggers blame on her love of red wine and cigarettes.
