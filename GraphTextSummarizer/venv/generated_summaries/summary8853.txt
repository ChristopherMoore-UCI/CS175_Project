" Sheila Byron has been interested in the Titanic since she was a child. The cruise, organized by a British travel agency and sailing on the liner MS Balmoral, will feature history lectures; a stop at Cobh, Ireland, the Titanic's last port of call; and a stop in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where many of the victims were buried. The Titanic Memorial Cruise will follow the route the Titanic took, and is scheduled to be in the exact spot at the exact time the Titanic struck an iceberg close to midnight on April 14, 1912, sending it to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean a little less than three hours later. And on the night of the 14th a lot of people will be in period costumes," Sheila Byron says. "But you don't have to win the lottery to be happy, and you don't escape terrible things in life just because you are wealthy, and that's characterized in the fascination of the Titanic."
