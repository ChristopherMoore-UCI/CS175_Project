"The way communities manage the forest really allows it to be sustainable for many years." He adds: "Where you find protected areas you always find indigenous peoples -- if their way of living was harmful to the environment it would not be possible to have such biodiversity there and be able to create protected areas there. "Our challenge is to support those people to be able challenge those laws." Handja says that because forest people have no legal rights to the land where they live, their governments can simply give the land to logging and mining companies, who often prevent indigenous people from accessing the land. "When nothing is done ... you see a situation where communities start dying and the number of people in the communities diminishes throughout the years. Following the Boumba Bek mapping project, the WWF concluded that, far from threatening the survival of the rainforest, the Baka people were "excellent nature conservators." "When land is removed from communities and given to, say, a mining company, it is very few years before it is completely cut down," says Handja.
