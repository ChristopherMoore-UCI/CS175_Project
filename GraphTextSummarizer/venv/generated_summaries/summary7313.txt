New smuggling routes across the Red Sea have also led to increased numbers of refugees in Yemen, according to the UNHCR. Yemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline this year in an attempt to deter smugglers, according to the UNHCR, which operates shelters and reception centers for refugees in Yemen. Intensifying violence, food shortages and widespread drought are driving an increasing number of Somalis to seek asylum in Yemen, the United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday. Yemen is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. Because of its proximity to the war-torn country, Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship, famine and war.
