-- For 106 years, cowboys and cattlemen have been coming from around the West to Denver for the annual National Western Stock Show. They mingle with the fleece-clad Denverites and chat amongst themselves about grain prices, drought and yes, Tim Tebow and the Broncos. The sprawling backstage area in the bowels of the building echoes with the din of commercial-strength blow dryers as cow after cow is shuttled though the makeshift bovine beauty parlor before being led into the ring. But for now it's warm and dry at the stock show, where cows and cowboys alike are the stars of the show. The show kicked off last weekend and runs through January 22.
