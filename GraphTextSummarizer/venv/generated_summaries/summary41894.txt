He was wingman to Ensign Jesse Brown, the first African-American aviator in the U.S. Navy. The timing of the invitation to the U.S. veterans is likely intentional, but for Hudner, the focus is bringing closure to his Korean War experiences and to Brown's family. The last thing Thomas Hudner said to mortally wounded pilot Jesse Brown was that he would come back for him. In a rare show of cooperation with a country it often calls the imperialistic enemy, North Korea has given permission for Hudner to return to Chosin Reservoir. Brown's F4U Corsair was damaged while flying near the Jangjin Reservoir, known as the Chosin Reservoir by Americans, in the northeast of North Korea.
