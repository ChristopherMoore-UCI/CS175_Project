New hearings in Chandra Levy case add to mystery Armando Morales, a convicted felon and former gang member, testified at Guandique's trial that Guandique confessed to him that he killed Levy. Ingmar Guandique, 31, was sentenced in 2011 to two concurrent 60-year sentences for murder with kidnapping and murder with attempted robbery in Levy's death. -- A judge on Monday ordered the release of sealed documents and transcripts from court proceedings related to the murder case of Chandra Levy, a Washington intern whose disappearance in 2001 drew national headlines and damaged a U.S. congressman's political career. Guandique repeatedly said at his trial he had nothing to do with Levy's death. In February 2009, police arrested Guandique, who was already in prison for attacking two other women in the park where Levy's body was found and who had reportedly spoken about killing her.
