Hirst, 48, rose to fame in the 1990s as one of the Young British Artists (or YBAs), along with Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume and Jake and Dinos Chapman. The group, many of whose members met while studying at London's Goldsmiths university, was championed by art collector Charles Saatchi. -- Two works by British artist Damien Hirst worth $54,000 have been stolen from a London gallery. The pieces -- prints of colored spots, signed by Hirst -- were taken from the Exhibitionist Gallery in Notting Hill in the early hours of Monday morning. Detective Sergeant Jon Lightfoot, of London's Metropolitan Police, said the thief appeared to have "specifically targeted" the stolen works.
