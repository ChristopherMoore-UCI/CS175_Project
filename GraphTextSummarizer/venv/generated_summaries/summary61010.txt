Working with police in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Beijing police captured the suspects, a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau said. " Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Center for China Studies, said the incident would be considered a loss of face for Beijing's leaders, especially if it turns out to be related to Uyghur separatism. -- Five suspects have been detained in Monday's deadly crash in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which has been identified as a terrorist attack, Beijing police said Wednesday. Chinese media outlets that reported Monday's incident stuck to the bare-bones details published by China's state run Xinhua news agency. Earlier this month, Chinese police said they had arrested 139 people in Xinjiang for spreading religious extremism online.
