More than 40% of states faced abnormal dryness or drought, a report released by the center said. The report tracks and ranks weather conditions from "abnormal dryness" to "exceptional drought." -- Exceptional drought conditions spread across nearly 12% of the United States last month, a record number that shows the widespread impact of the dry weather conditions, according to a report released Monday. Texas is suffering from the third-worst drought in the state's history, according to state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples. Officials at the National Drought Mitigation Center said the July percentage is the highest recorded level of drought since the monitor began documenting conditions 12 years ago.
