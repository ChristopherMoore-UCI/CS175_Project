The field of quantum computing is still in its infancy but it was given a sizable boost when Google announced in September that it is partnering with experts from the University of California Santa Barbara to develop quantum computing technology as part of its Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab team. "Ultimately, quantum computing will do that better," said Brownell, who served as chief technology officer for Goldman Sachs from 1989-2000. "It's not going to replace classical computing, but certain problem types fit quantum computing very well," said Brownell. -- It depends on mind-bending physics and ultra-cold temperatures but quantum computing could bring about a new era in processing power that promises to revolutionize everything from artificial intelligence to high finance. D-Wave said it is also interested in expanding the cloud capabilities of quantum computing.
