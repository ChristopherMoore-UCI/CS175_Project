Meanwhile, authorities in Mumbai have recorded the statements of Rafiq Qureshi; his "Slumdog" daughter, Rubina Ali; and his former wife, Khurshida Begum, senior police inspector Prakash Salunke told CNN. -- India's child-rights watchdog has sought a report from police investigating allegations by a tabloid that the father of a "Slumdog Millionaire" child star tried to sell her to an undercover reporter, the watchdog's leader told CNN. "We have sought a report from them and will take a decision after seeing it," said Shantha Sinha, who heads the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. Rubina Ali has backed her father over newspaper allegations he offered her to an undercover reporter. Qureshi has denied allegations made in Britain's News of the World that he tried to sell 9-year-old Rubina for Â£200,000 ($290,000), Salunke said.
