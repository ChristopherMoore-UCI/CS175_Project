Martinez said Faull, who lived alone near McAfee, was found Saturday morning. McAfee left his namesake Internet security firm in 1994 and has not been affiliated with the firm since then, said company spokeswoman Kimberly Eichorn. -- Authorities in Belize are trying to find and talk to Internet antivirus pioneer John McAfee about a fatal shooting in the Central American nation, a police spokesman said Monday. He went on to found several tech companies and launch groundbreaking products, including a voice recognition system Interpath in 1981, McAfee in 1988, and the instant messaging pioneer Tribal Voice in 1996. According to a story on Wired magazine's website, McAfee said regarding Faull's death that he knew "nothing, other than I heard he had been shot." McAfee told Wired that he's been at odds with Belizean authorities for months, adding that he's hiding from them somewhere in the country.
