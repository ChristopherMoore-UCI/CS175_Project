The youngest victim was 12-year-old Uriel Escobar, who was electrocuted Friday after touching a downed power line, said Juan Carlos Orantes, the director of emergencies with the country's civil protection agency. In the same state, Damien Islas died while trying to save a group of people from a collapsing house, Orantes said. The death toll was expected to rise as investigators worked to confirm other incidents in the state of Oaxaca, Orantes said. He was accompanied by his grandfather when he died," Orantes said. "We are expecting still more intense storms; however, we've had a brief stoppage for now," Orantes said.
