But to Shipanga football is more than a game -- it's a way to help society and improve the lives of girls around her country. Although football has always been part of life in Namibia, for years it was culturally unacceptable for girls to participate in the sport. " Initiatives like "Galz & Goals," sponsored by UNICEF, aim to use football as a platform to raise awareness of health and social responsibility in Namibia. Women's football might be contributing to society now, but 35-year-old Shipanga remembers that things were very different when she was growing up in the southern African country "A girl couldn't play football, not even participate in sports," she recalls. "Girls were not encouraged to participate in sport because there were all these different type of myths: you're not going to be fertile, you're not going to get married one day, you're not going to have the so-called happy ending that would make any mother proud," Shapinga says.
