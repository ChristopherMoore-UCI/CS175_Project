"In hospital a thorough and complete analysis of his condition was performed, involving CT scans and MRI scans, all of which were completely normal. "From the scene of the incident he was driven to the circuit's medical center, where he was given first aid and, as per normal procedures, was sedated in preparation for an air-lift to hospital," read the statement. "In order to provide the privacy and tranquility required to facilitate a peaceful recuperation, he is being kept in hospital for further observation, and to recover from the effects of the medication that successfully managed his routine sedation yesterday. The 2014 season saw safety in F1 come into sharp focus after Marussia driver Jules Bianchi suffered severe head injuries in Japan last October. The crash was caused by "the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time, and which had affected other drivers similarly," said McLaren.
