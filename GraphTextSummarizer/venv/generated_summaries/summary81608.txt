The report said that "scores of Libyan civilians who did not directly participate in hostilities were killed and many more injured as a result of NATO strikes," adding that the 28-member nation alliance has yet to address the incidents in the months since it ended the air campaign. NATO began bombing military targets in Libya in March 2011 following the approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force by whatever means necessary -- with the exception of a ground invasion -- to protect civilians after Gadhafi's forces. Amnesty International's criticisms of NATO and Libya's government parallel concerns raised by Russia, which approved the Security Council resolution that authorized enforcement of a no-fly zone to protect civilians and then criticized it when it led to widespread bombing of Libyan military forces. " "NATO has looked into each credible allegation of harm to civilians which has been brought to our attention and will continue to do so," NATO spokeswoman Oana Lungescu said. In a 20-page report titled "Libya: The Forgotten Victims of NATO Strikes," Amnesty International laid out allegations that NATO and the new Libyan government failed not only to document the deaths but also has not paid reparations to the victims and their families.
