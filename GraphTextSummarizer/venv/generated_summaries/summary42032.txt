-- Egyptian security forces stormed two sit-ins orchestrated by supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy early Wednesday, bulldozing tents and escorting away hundreds of protesters, CNN correspondents say. CNN correspondents described bloody scenes as security forces clash with Morsy supporters. At a glance Arriving earlier at one of the entrances to the Rabaa al-Adawiya Square encampment, Sayah said the scene resembled "a war zone." Thick plumes of black smoke were rising through the air from where it was understood security forces had entered the area and pro-Morsy supporters were facing off against those forces, he said. On the other side of the square, Damon said riot police had been firing tear gas "as groups of pro-Morsy demonstrators tried to break through police lines to join the encampment. Not like (the Nahda camp) that was cleared out earlier today by security forces -- this is a much larger sit-in."
