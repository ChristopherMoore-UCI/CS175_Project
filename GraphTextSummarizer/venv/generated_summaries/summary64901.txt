European football's reputation has been tarnished by the scourge of racism this season but on Thursday matters came to head when AC Milan star Boateng kicked the ball into the stand and walked off after a group of fans had directed monkey chants at the Ghanian international and three of his teammates during a friendly match in northern Italy. The 25-year-old ripped off his shirt in disgust during the first half of Thursday's friendly against lower league Italian side Pro Patria, before being joined by his teammates and opposition players in walking off the pitch. During the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, Boateng featured for Ghana in group game against Germany, with his brother Jerome playing for the European side in their 1-0 win. "I don't care what game it is -- a friendly, Italian league or Champions League match -- I would walk off again," the German-born Boateng told CNN in an exclusive interview on Friday. Ahead of the European Championship finals in Poland and Ukraine last summer, UEFA president Michel Platini had urged players to allow the referee to deal with the problem of racist abuse, and stressed that officials could stop games if necessary.
