During your stay, enjoy chauffeured town car service, a helicopter tour of the city and a private four-hour skippered sailing excursion on Puget Sound with gourmet picnic and a bottle of Bollinger Grande AnnÃ©e RosÃ© 1999 Champagne, a favorite of Mr. Grey himself.

Guests stay in a "Premium Waterside" suite, go on a sailing excursion around Puget Sound, knock back a bottle of Bollinger and are even given a map of Seattle sites that appear in the book, which they can check out when they test drive an Audi sports car, just like the one Grey bought Steele in the book.
