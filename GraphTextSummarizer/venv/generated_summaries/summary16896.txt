-- More than 15 million surge protectors are being recalled for posing a potential fire hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the manufacturer announced Thursday. The recall includes corded surge protectors manufactured before 2003 by Schneider Electric IT Corporation. "The affected products may present a fire hazard under infrequent, abnormal building wiring and electrical conditions," the company said. "This hazard has been reported in a small percentage (less than 0.01%) of the units sold and included reports of property damage, mostly involving damaged nylon carpeting. Thirteen people were hurt and 55 claims were made for damage caused by smoke and fire.
