" Giggs, the most decorated player in the history of British football, has won 13 league titles with United, two Champions League crowns and a host of cups since making his debut as a teenager against Everton in March 1991. A regular for the England under-19 side, Wilson showed his class to net twice before Robin van Persie secured victory. A one-club man, the Welshman has become synonymous with the Alex Ferguson era where United dominated English football. Wilson, who has progressed through the ranks at Old Trafford, scored twice on his debut -- not bad for a player who wasn't even born when Giggs won his first title with United. The Serbia defender was given a great send-off by the home crowd following his final appearance in an United shirt at Old Trafford.
