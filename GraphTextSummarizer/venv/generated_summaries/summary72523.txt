"Currently we have about 20 to 25 women trained who are working in the factory but as we expand we hope to bring more on board," she said, adding that the initiative was launched as a way of using local renewable materials and satisfied local needs and created employment opportunities. "They're made by women and these women are teaching other women to make these bamboo bikes and to sell them so that they have another income stream," Figueres said. She said the prize the initiative won last year in Warsaw, the UNFCCC Momentum for Change Women for Results Award, was bringing with it more attention, more orders and greater ambitions for the company. Using a method developed by American engineer Craig Calfee -- a renowned bicycle designer who first experimented with bamboo bicycles in 1995 -- the frames are lashed together with fiber and then coated with epoxy. With just two sticks of bamboo enough to make one bicycle, and six regions in Ghana where bamboo grows abundantly, the Ghana Bike Initiative is unlikely to run out of raw materials.
