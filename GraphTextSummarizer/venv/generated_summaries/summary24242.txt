The general rule about falling oil prices has been simple: Producing countries like Russia and Venezuela will suffer, while consuming countries like China, India and Indonesia will benefit. Morgan Stanley's Ruchir Sharma has pointed out that over the last decade, China's demand for oil has grown 7%, year on year. Economic sanctions have hurt Russia, but the greatest blow has been the sudden drop in oil prices, which will shape the next chapter of this tale. Foremost among those was oil, since China's energy needs have grown by leaps and bounds. In 2014 China's growth in demand for oil was zero -- nada.
