"Cockfighting is a cruel blood sport that is illegal in Kentucky and every other state," said John Goodwin, manager of animal fighting issues for the group. "Kentucky police officers should not treat this criminal activity with a wink and a nod, and it's another sign that state lawmakers must act to strengthen the penalties for cockfighting." "However, Kentucky State Police are fully committed to enforcing all criminal laws, including those against animal cruelty." At least four law enforcement officers can be seen in the crowd, including a Kentucky state trooper who was talking to a young boy. The video released Tuesday shows fights at a cockfighting pit in Manchester, Kentucky, the Humane Society said.
