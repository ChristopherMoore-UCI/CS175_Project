"The flight was being made strictly in compliance with international air space rules, not violating borders of other countries and at a safe distance from traffic routes of civilian aircraft," he said. "No prerequisites existed for an air accident related with a flight of a Russian warplane in the international air space over the Baltic Sea on Friday," Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said Sunday, according to Russia's state-run TASS news agency. NATO jets scrambled more than 400 times this year for Russian intercepts Byden said Swedish fighter jets were immediately deployed to identify the aircraft and later determined it was a Russian intelligence plane. He said the Russian military aircraft's transponders were turned off to avoid commercial radar.
