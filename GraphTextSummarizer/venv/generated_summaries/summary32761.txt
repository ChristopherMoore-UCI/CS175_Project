Malala's activism started after the Taliban banned girls from schools in Pakistan's Swat Valley in 2009. Since then, Malala has recovered and continued advocating for girls' education, despite ongoing death threats from the Taliban. A year later, she was riding the bus home from school when a Taliban gunman climbed aboard and shot her in the head. Parliament President Martin Schulz called the 16-year-old a "brave advocate for education" who "reminds us of our duty toward children and especially girls. She's also a favorite to win this year's Nobel Peace Prize, which will be awarded Friday.
