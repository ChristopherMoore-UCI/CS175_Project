The U.S. could agree with China to settle in an international court or through negotiations differences about claims over the South China Sea; and stop calling on China's neighboring countries to get together to oppose China's legitimate interests. American hawks hold that the U.S. must build up its military, given China's rapid military buildup. The same doves point out that China's military modernization began from a low baseline. However, American doves point out that China's defense spending is rather small. Without a major public debate of the kind we have about raising taxes, or a congressional vote, the U.S. government is moving slowly but surely toward characterizing China as an aggressive superpower and is preparing for war, should it become necessary.
