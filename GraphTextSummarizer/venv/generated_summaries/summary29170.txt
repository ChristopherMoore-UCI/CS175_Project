"It is a desperate act by a desperate regime that is seeking to veil the current social and political reality in Venezuela," said ex-Venezuelan ambassador to the United Nations, Diego Arria, of Ledezma's arrest. The last time Antonieta Ledezma, 23, saw her father was in early January when she left Venezuela bound for New York. " Maduro maintains that Lopez, Ledezma and other opposition leaders were arrested by order of the attorney general's office and must be tried for "crimes against the peace, security and constitution of the country." " Venezuelan government officials in New York did not respond to CNN's request for comment. " "He was unjustly imprisoned and has effectively been kidnapped by this government," said Ledezma, who was joined by a few dozen protesters Monday night in New York's Times Square.
