The teen told Judge James Callahan that after seeing Utash hit a child, he "got emotional" and his anger took over, according to CNN affiliate WDIV. Wimbush admitted in court Monday that he punched the driver, Steven Utash, in the jaw and was among a "large group of people" that attacked the man in April. Three other adult suspects are charged with attempted murder in the attack while a fourth, a juvenile, is charged with assault and ethnic intimidation. The charge was reduced by prosecutors from assault with intent to murder with the agreement that Wimbush will testify in future proceedings related to the assault, the release said.
