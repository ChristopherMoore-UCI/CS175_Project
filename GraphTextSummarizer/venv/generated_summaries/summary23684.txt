Hill has previous cases involving violent and verbal altercations and is currently charged with disorderly conduct from an incident this summer, Lawson said. "Justice was served," District Attorney Tracy Graham Lawson told CNN on Saturday, acknowledging that her case became unraveled when jurors learned the accuser faces charges of her own. Felony charges of aggravated assault and false imprisonment were dropped and he pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors: battery, two counts of disorderly conduct and cruelty to children in the third degree, Lawson said. West replied, "it depends." Lawson believes West needed to be punished for hitting Hill and using racial epithets. West, then 47, was arrested on misdemeanor charges after the incident, but Lawson took the case to a grand jury asking for more serious charges.
