Across Iowa, the state where then-U.S. Sen. Obama surprised the nation and swept the 2008 Democratic caucuses, igniting early momentum and propelling him to win his party's nomination over U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton, other Democrats are standing tall with the president, ready to fight to give him another term. "We've seen the median income for Americans drop by 10%," said presumed Republican front-runner and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, blaming the economy's woes on Obama. This year, it could be former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, who has been surging since the recent CNN/Time/ORC International poll put him in a strong third place behind Romney and U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, but moving up. "I remember, after he got inaugurated ... and he said, 'Look, if I can't get this economy turned around in three years, I'll be looking at a one-term proposition,' " reminded Mitt Romney during a stump speech Monday in Marion, Iowa. According to two senior Obama campaign aides, the president's 2012 re-election efforts began in Iowa as early as April.
