Kansas City and St. Louis, for instance, are among those cities facing winter storm warnings thanks to snow that could fall through late Sunday. While they're expire soon in the Centennial State, winter storm warnings will be in effect for four other states through, in some spots, Sunday night. The fun has already started in parts of Kansas and Nebraska, with the snowstorm expected to roll over the Great Plains between interstate highways 70 and 80, according to CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. The same cannot be said for points east, from Kansas and far beyond. The system will continue to barrel east from there, dumping snow on Louisville, Kentucky, and, by Monday, possibly on Washington, D.C., Maginnis said.
