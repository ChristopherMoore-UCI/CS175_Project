As we compared notes on our jobs, kids and sex lives (like I said, close friends), I found myself looking wistfully at the table next to hours, where four women made up a "Sex and the City" quartet huddled in an intimate conversation. A normal human being might have solved the problem by spending less time on Twitter and more time on the phone. Overnight, Twitter stopped being a way to keep up with colleagues and became a way of keeping in touch with friends. Focusing my phone time on my oldest and dearest friend means that when we talk, we can actually have a meaningful conversation about the latest chapter in our lives, rather than using an hour to catch up on news highlights. Don't confuse "friends" with friends "You know S., don't you?"
