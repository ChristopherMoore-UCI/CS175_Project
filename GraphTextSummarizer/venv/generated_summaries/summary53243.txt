How much do cities contribute to climate change? Mike Hodson (MH): Cities are increasingly being characterized as significant producers of climate change. In what ways can cities help to address the issue of climate change? Why is it in cities interest to act in a way that negates the impact of climate change? MH: I think the flipside of this sort of argument about cities being producers of climate change is that they're also increasingly being seen as victims of climate change.
