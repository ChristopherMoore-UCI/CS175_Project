-- GOP tempers flared during a routine conference call when House and Senate leadership aides confronted Republican National Committee staffers over recent comments by party chairman Michael Steele. "They have confronted him about speaking about things he shouldn't be speaking about, whether it's Senate policy or House policy." "He has been confronted numerous times by Senate leaders and House leaders over the last year," the aide said. "He's got to stop and put an end to this thing." RNC Research Director Jeff Berkowitz jumped in and "offered a hard defense of Steele," according to the senior House aide. " The senior House aide later told CNN that congressional Republicans have "confronted" Steele over the past year about some of his comments.
