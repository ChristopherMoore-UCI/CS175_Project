On September 5 of that year, Palestinian terrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes who were taken hostage. From the Olympic Village, the Palestinian terrorists issued ultimatums, demanding the release of 200 Arab inmates from Israeli prisons or they would start killing the athletes in Munich, one every hour. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas sent his condolences to Daoud's family, WAFA reported. In the early hours of the attack in Munich, eight Palestinian terrorists entered the Olympic Village in the German city. Daoud also published an autobiography, giving a first-hand look at the rise of the Palestinian resistance leading up to the attack at Munich.
