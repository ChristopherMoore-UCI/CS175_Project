While Los Angeles Times, film critic Patrick Goldstein accused the pair of "becoming parodies of themselves, making payday movies that are hollow echoes of the electrically charged work they did on such films as 'Serpico,' 'Dog Day Afternoon,' 'Mean Streets' and 'Taxi Driver.'

He says: "They're playing New York City detectives; they are as New York as it gets. Reviews for De Niro in films like "Analyze That," "Hide and Seek" and "Godsend" have been similarly scathing. " Between them Pacino and De Niro have starred in some of best films ever made, and as they approach their 70s, it would be fair to say they have earned the right to slum it a little.
