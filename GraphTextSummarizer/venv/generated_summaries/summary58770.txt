Erdogan's government was praised for its ability to attract foreign investors from Europe and emerging markets such as Russia and China. As the crisis hit developed economies, investors turned to emerging markets which promised higher returns than depressed Western markets. Higher interest rates are likely to slow down Turkey's economic growth. The country's currency, the Lira, slumped further in January, which forced Turkey's central bank to adopt a radical approach and almost double interest rates from 7.7% to 12% -- a clear indication of the bank's determination to prevent foreign capital outflows. Foreign investors have been watching Erdogan's steps closely and to them, the result of this weekend's local election could be an indication of where the country's economy moves next.
