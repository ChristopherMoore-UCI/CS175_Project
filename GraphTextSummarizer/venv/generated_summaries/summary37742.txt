Donohoe and other postal officials have told CNN the downsizing will try to preserve local town identities by maintaining their names and zip codes, and continuing to deliver that mail through other nearby facilities. Donohoe is also expected to provide details of a plan to increase joint marketing with other retailers as a way to improve customer access to postal services. The list was developed based on low workload among post office employees, a small number of customers, and whether that location could be combined with other postal facilities nearby. In May, Donohoe told CNN, "You've got a post office, a gas station, and a store; they're in a small town, the gas station and the store are struggling, we think we can provide service through contracts in many cases," that could cut operating costs for the Postal Service. Postmaster General Patrick Donohoe planned a news conference Tuesday to release a long-awaited "post office study list" of potential closings nationwide, typically targeting rural post offices where only a few hundred customers are served.
