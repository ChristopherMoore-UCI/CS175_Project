Allow me to give you a taste of some of this year's events: one company has invited me to a "thought provoking breakfast discussion on the future of human capital" (dress code: Business casual; funny - I was going to wear my ski gear); another is offering a session on "re-defining success in a digital age." Davos is probably the world's most elite society, but it dresses itself up as a non-elite event. For the past few weeks my email box has been slowly, inexorably, filling up with Davos invites. It alone is worth the trip to Davos. But there is one meeting place for everyone at Davos, where status goes out of the window, and who you are matters less than if you can pay for the ridiculously priced drinks: the Piano Bar.
