While in Iowa in 2008, Obama was criticized for being out of touch after he asked a group of farmers whether they had checked out the price of arugula at Whole Foods. First lady Michelle Obama wore one at 10 Downing Street to meet British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, and on "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno. The campaign responded with thanks to the more than 706,000 donors who got the campaign to that point but also appealed for more money. The compound, which includes two full-sized homes, a par-3 golf hole and equestrian facilities, was listed in August for $23.7 million. 8 million pounds of arugula.
