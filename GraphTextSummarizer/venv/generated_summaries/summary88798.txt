"Seeing the piano in real life you end up with a couple of things," said David Redden, vice chairman at Sotheby's. A buyer has purchased the piano used in one of the most beloved scenes in all of film: the playing of "As Time Goes By" in "Casablanca" -- the 1942 classic movie starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. "The music is so emotive, so moving and the piano really becomes a symbol of the love story between Bogart and Bergman." Wilson, the actor who portrayed Sam, was a trumpeter, not a pianist, according to Redden. The 58-key piano is a memorable part of the romantic flashback sequence in Paris at La Belle Aurore, where Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) listen to Sam (Dooley Wilson) sing and play "As Time Goes By." And you don't realize how small it is, so small in fact Bogart and Bergman sort of tower over it."
