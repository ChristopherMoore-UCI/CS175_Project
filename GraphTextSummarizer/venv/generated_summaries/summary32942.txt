Had England been successful, it would have been the biggest successful run chase in World Cup history, but while Strauss and Ian Bell (69) combined for a third wicket stand of 170, England were in command. Earlier, Sachin Tendulkar set yet another record in his glittering career as  became the first man to make five centuries in World Cup competition, moving ahead of compatriot Sourav Ganguly and Australian pair Mark Waugh and Ricky Ponting. -- India and England tied one of the most extraordinary matches in World Cup cricket history in Bangalore Sunday. Patel, who took two wickets 70, found himself at the heart of the action, having earlier dismissed England opener Kevin Pietersen in unusual fashion. James Anderson eventually dismissed Tendulkar with Yardy taking the catch, but England's premier paceman had an afternoon to forget as he finished with one wicket for 91 in his 10 overs, the worst World Cup performance by an England bowler.
