-- Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu has canceled his travel for the remainder of the year as he battles cancer, one of his foundations said Tuesday. His daughter and that foundation's executive director, Mpho Tutu, said the changed plans don't mean there is a crisis, adding that her father is simply at home while his body adjusts to new medication. Tutu, 83, has battled prostate cancer for years. " "You may know I canceled my trip to Rome for the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates due to a reaction to a new treatment for my prostate and strengthening my bones," Tutu said in a statement posted to his Facebook page. An Anglican priest ordained in 1961, Tutu earned the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his efforts to end apartheid in his native South Africa.
