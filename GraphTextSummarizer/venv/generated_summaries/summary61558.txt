The Evergreen Park League team, which Jackie Robinson trounced 43-2 on its way to a U.S. championship, made a couple of calls to Little League International accusing the All-Stars of violating residency boundaries for players. Just ask the Ugandan Little League Team that has been blocked from competing in the United States and Europe twice in the last few years on technicalities that other teams have openly flouted for years. Little League International, acting with a swiftness and severity that should embarrass the NBA, NFL and NCAA  managed to conduct an investigation, determine who was at fault and strip a bunch of kids of their championship because grown-ups cheated. To paraphrase the ESPN "30 for 30" sports documentary opening: "What if I told you that a sport based on lying, cheating and rule bending worked perfectly fine as long as brown kids and fans paid the price?" That title would never get past the editing room, and yet, stripping the Jackie Robinson West All-Stars team of its Little League World Series title for cheating can't be described any other way. Is Little League USA going to investigate every team that played in this year's tournament?
