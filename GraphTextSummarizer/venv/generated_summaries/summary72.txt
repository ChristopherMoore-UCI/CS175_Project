After a self-examination following huge losses among women, minorities and young voters in the 2012 presidential election, the party ramped up its outreach efforts and has spent millions on such initiatives as Project GROW, which seeks to beef up the number of female candidates, and "14 in 14", a program aimed at winning more women voters to the Republican cause. Over the past two decades, Republican women have been less likely to enter or win primaries when compared to their Democratic peers, according to a study by Rutgers University's Center for American Women and Politics. The number of Republican women entering primaries has also decreased, the study found. And because state and local parties tend to support sitting members of Congress in primaries, Republican women are especially challenged when they seek those seats. The GOP knows it has a problem recruiting and supporting female candidates and attracting women voters.
