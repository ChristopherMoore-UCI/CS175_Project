Pew's earlier study also acknowledged the difficulty in distinguishing between smartphones and feature phones in a user survey since this technological line is blurring and since users often incorrectly identify which type of phone they have. Sharing images is less popular -- 80% of smartphone users and 36% of feature phone users have used their phones to send photos or videos to others. Also, 84% of smartphone users report using their phone to access the Internet, compared with just 15% of feature phone users. At the same time, the report found that cell phones can frustrate users. Meanwhile, 4% of feature phone users have downloaded apps.
