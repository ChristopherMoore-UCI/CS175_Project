The statement is noteworthy since Masters' attorneys allege Fort Collins police and prosecutors withheld evidence favorable to their client during his 1999 trial. Watch police question 15-year-old Masters Police mounted an investigation that ultimately saw Masters jailed in 1998 and sentenced to life in prison for murder in 1999.
