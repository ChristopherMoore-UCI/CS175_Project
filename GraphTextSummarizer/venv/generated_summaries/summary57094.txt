-- Award-winning newsman Richard Threlkeld, whose wide-ranging career took him from war zones to presidential campaigns, was killed Friday in a car accident on New York's Long Island, authorities said. Threlkeld's career took him from the jungles of Vietnam to the desert of Iraq during the Gulf War, from courtroom trial of Patty Hearst to the execution of Gary Gilmore. We admired him because of what he could do with words," CBS Evening News' anchor Scott Pelley said during Friday's broadcast. Threlkeld, who worked for CBS and later ABC, died after his 2008 Mini Cooper collided with a tanker truck in Amagansett, East Hampton police said in a statement. The driver of the tanker, 57-year-old Earl Fryberger Jr. of Coatesville, Pennsylvania, was uninjured, it said.
