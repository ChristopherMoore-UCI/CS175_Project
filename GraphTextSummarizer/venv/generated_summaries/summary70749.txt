-- Some of the families camped outside the San Jose mine, waiting for rescuers to reach 33 workers trapped underground, fear Chilean President Sebastian Pinera may be playing politics with the rescue operation in an effort to boost his popularity. The Chilean research company said the increase was "directly related with the rescue operations of the trapped miners in the San Jose mine." When the workers first sent word that they were alive, Pinera triumphantly waved their written note before television cameras. Watch how miners' families marked independence day "Hopefully this spirit of unity, faith, confidence and pride to be Chilean that is in the air at the San Jose mine and in every corner of Chile is a spirit that will illuminate this third century of independence," Pinera said, referring to Chile's recent bicentennial celebration. Pinera visited the mine Sunday and spoke with the trapped workers. The sister of another trapped miner accused rescuers of delaying the switch-on of a recently-assembled oil rig -- the so-called Plan C drill -- until Pinera arrived Sunday.
