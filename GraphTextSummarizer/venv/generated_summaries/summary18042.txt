"It's every bit Facebook and YouTube for spies, but it's much, much more," said Michael Wertheimer, assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analysis. -- When you see people at the office using such Internet sites as Facebook and MySpace, you might suspect those workers are slacking off. The goal of A-Space, like intelligence analysis in general, is to protect the United States by assessing all the information available to the spy agencies. Instead of posting thoughts about the new Avenged Sevenfold album or Jessica Alba movie, CIA analysts could use A-Space to share information and opinion about al Qaeda movements in the Middle East or Russian naval maneuvers in the Black Sea. " Wertheimer demonstrated the program to CNN to show how analysts will use it to collaborate.
