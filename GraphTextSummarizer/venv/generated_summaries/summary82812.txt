But criticism quickly mounted, and Penn State trustees dismissed Paterno and school President Graham Spanier -- who initially backed Curley and Schultz -- days after Sandusky's arrest. An investigative grand jury's summary of testimony claimed that Sandusky engaged in fondling, oral sex and anal sex with young boys. Paterno lost his job as the Nittany Lions coach last month amid criticism that he hadn't done more when a sexual assault allegation surfaced regarding his longtime defensive coordinator, Jerry Sandusky. According to a biography on a Penn State website, Paterno was born December 21, 1926, in Brooklyn, New York, and attended Brown University. A week later, Sandusky -- who coached at Penn State for 23 years and remained a presence on campus after his retirement in 1999 -- was arrested and charged with 40 counts tied to allegations over a 14-year period.
