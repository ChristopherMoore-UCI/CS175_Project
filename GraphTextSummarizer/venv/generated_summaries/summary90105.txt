The Greek parliament has approved controversial reforms of the civil service and tax administration, opening the way for mass dismissals of state employees in return for a €6.8bn aid disbursement by international lenders. The centre-right New Democracy party and Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) together control 155 seats out of 300, but won support from independents in several of the votes. Among the protesters were teachers at vocational training institutes, school guards and municipal police officers who will be transferred to a special "mobility reserve" on reduced pay and given eight months to find another job in the public sector or face dismissal. Yannis Stournaras, the finance minister, agreed to suspend payment of €80m in compensation for 2,600 workers who were sacked at the state broadcaster ERT last month, following complaints by a rightwing faction in New Democracy. The vote came after the governing coalition made last-minute changes to the 108-clause bill to prevent defections by dissident lawmakers.
