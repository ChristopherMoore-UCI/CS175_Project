Unfettered by the ready expectations of traditional gender roles, same-sex couples "are more likely than members of heterosexual couples to negotiate a balance between achieving a fair distribution of household labor and accommodating the different interests, skills, and work schedules of particular partners," wrote social scientist Lawrence K. Kurdek. Men need to shift from expecting or enforcing traditional gender roles to becoming role models for more equitable relationships. Our same-sex family has not so much created new gender role arrangements, but deconstructed such arrangements altogether. We have to value household work as work, which means everything from paying domestic workers livable wages to more men cleaning and cooking and teaching their sons that doing so is honorable and equitable, not demeaning. After all, whether you want to blame biology or early economic incentives or the cultural indoctrination of "Leave It to Beaver," men have consistently failed to do their fair share of household labor in America.
