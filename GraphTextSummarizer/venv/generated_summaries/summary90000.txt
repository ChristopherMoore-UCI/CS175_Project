Attracting 75 million visitors a year, The Dubai Mall gets more foot traffic than the Eiffel Tower, Niagara Falls and Disney World combined. Though the mall closes at 10pm (midnight on the weekends), in some ways it is busiest after hours, when a cleaning crew of 100 sweep, vacuum and polish over 1.5m square feet of space every night. The Burj Khalifa Lake -- an 150m liter artificial body of water that also houses The Dubai Fountain -- requires daily maintenance, partly because the desert climate itches to contaminate it with sand. "It's a huge mall," notes Ahmen Hussein, the night shift supervisor for cleaning. "To make it work, you need to have a tremendous amount of people that are on the job 24 hours a day," says David Macadam, CEO of the Middle East Council of Shopping Centers.
