A strut down memory lane As the fashion world looks to spring, designers will be looking back -- particularly to the 1970s -- for inspiration, according to WGSN's head of catwalk, Lizzy Bowring. Keeping it cool Spring and pastels go together like April showers and May flowers. Jones also expects a sampling of tent dresses, sometimes referred to as trapeze dresses, to hit the catwalks. Pants will take up a slight flare, and just as Diane Keaton notably catapulted menswear into the spotlight in 1977's "Annie Hall," so will the fashion-forward in spring 2015. While hemlines are lower, Bowring says there certainly will be no shortage of shorts, particularly of the Bermuda variety.
