He displays a maturity well beyond his 13 years and doesn't seem fazed by spectators or the intrusive nature of the media," China Open operations director Alistair Polson said. "My goal now is to be the youngest player ever to make the cut in a European Tour event, and I think if I can shoot level par or better I'll have a good chance to do that," Guan said. The Chinese prodigy is set to make history this week when he smashes the record for the youngest player in a European Tour event. He is now tipped to also become the youngest player to ever compete in the Australian Masters in November and Australian Open in December. I'm so excited right now," Guan said on the European Tour website.
