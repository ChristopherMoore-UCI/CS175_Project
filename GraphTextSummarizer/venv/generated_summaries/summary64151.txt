As the Holocaust Museum attack demonstrates, hate crimes threaten pluralistic democracies in a way that other crimes do not. However, much of the act's potency lies not in what it punishes, but rather in its recognition of the primary role local authorities now play in combating hate crime. A 2005 Bureau of Justice Statistics victimization study found that only a small fraction of hate crimes nationally are actually reported. The act also provides greater access to local communities for federal training programs and mediation services that can prevent hate crimes before they boil over into violence. Our research has established that hate crimes are a qualitatively unique category of offenses.
