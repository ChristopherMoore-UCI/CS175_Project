Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata, whose company owns the Taj Hotel, discusses this week's attacks in Mumbai. Watch Tata discuss need for better preparedness Â» A. Vaidyanathan, an economist who was a guest in the hotel when the attacks occurred, told The Hindu newspaper on Friday that he had noticed tight security at the Taj Mahal when he stayed there last month -- a measure he indicated was unusual. The hotel heightened security as a result, the chairman of the Tata Group and Taj Hotels, Ratan Tata, said in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria. Bullet holes and scars of grenade blasts marred the restaurant walls in the Taj Mahal Hotel, Tata said. "It's ironic that we did have such a warning and we did have some measures," Tata said.
