The move is aimed at bringing India's online market on a par with its booming cell-phone business through Internet penetration with technology allowing quick access, data transfer and entertainment on mobile handsets. Authorities say technical institutions involved in designing the new device are now setting up research to address price and quality issues in developing budget gadgets for students. "The aim is to reach such devices to the students of colleges and universities, and to provide these institutions a host of choices of low-cost access devices around Rs 1,500 [$35] or less in near future," the human resources ministry said at the launch of the computer. -- India has unveiled a $35 computer prototype as part of its program to provide connectivity to its students and teachers at affordable prices. Ministry spokeswoman Mamata Varma said the government aimed to introduce the new touch-screen computing tool at higher educational institutions in 2011.
