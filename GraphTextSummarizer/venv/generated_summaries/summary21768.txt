One man who believes this is his best chance of winning at Augusta is Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter. " England's Ryder Cup hero Ian Poulter believes Europe's top players simply haven't been good enough while the likes of Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have won five titles between them. Nothing surprises me in golf anymore," former World No.1 Luke Donald told reporters. In fact, Europe's record in the tournament has been abject in recent years with Lee Westwood the only man to have secured a runner-up finish since the turn of the century. When the late, great, Seve Ballesteros became the first European to win the tournament back in 1980, it paved the way for the likes of Olazabal, three-time champion Nick Faldo, Sandy Lyle, Ian Woosnam and double winner Bernhard Langer to go on and dominate.
