The friends and family of parents or parents-to-be suffering from stress or mental illness would best serve their loved ones by helping them get the attention of mental health providers. Is it possible to prevent the killing of children by their parents? Fathers are more likely to kill more than one victim, including other children and spouses. But parents who kill their children are a varied population, and this, unfortunately, leaves few means to identify those at risk in the first place. Filicide is the broad term used to refer to a parent (or a person acting in a parental role, such as a stepparent or guardian) who kills his or her child under the age of 18; infanticide is the term used to define the murder of a child in the first year of life, and -- more specifically -- neonaticide refers to a parent who kills a child within the first 24 hours of life.
