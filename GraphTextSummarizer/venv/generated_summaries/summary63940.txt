Because whites are by far the nation's largest racial group, marriage between whites and minorities were the most common type of intermarriage, even though the intermarriage rate for whites is relatively low compared to other races or ethnicities, the study said. Several studies using government data have found overall divorce rates are higher for couples who "married out," the Pew Center said, "but here, too, the patterns vary by the racial and gender characteristics of the couples. " About 15% of new marriages in the United States in 2010 were between spouses of different races or ethnicities, more than doubling the 1980 level of 6.7%, according to the study. And "when it comes to educational characteristics, more than half of white newlyweds who marry Asians have a college degree, compared with roughly a third of white newlyweds who married whites," the study said.
