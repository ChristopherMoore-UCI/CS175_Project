The Bradys and the organization they have helped lead have been successful in: --Expanding disqualifiers for firearm possession to include perpetrators of domestic violence --Advancing laws to prevent gun violence at the state level --Litigating legal cases to protect the public from unsafe business practices in the gun industry --Educating the public about how to protect children from being shot It required licensed gun dealers to submit information on the identity of prospective gun buyers to the FBI, which could then determine through searches of databases of criminal records whether the purchaser was prohibited. While James Brady started his long road to recovery from his brain injuries, he and his wife, Sarah, began what has been a three-decade endeavor to strengthen America's gun laws and prevent others from becoming victims of gun violence. But I believe the Brady Law is the foundation upon which we should build a complete system for vetting all firearms transactions to keep guns away from people identified by laws as being too dangerous to possess them. Some consider background checks for all gun sales a pipe dream, based on the flawed logic that gun laws won't work when criminals don't obey them.
