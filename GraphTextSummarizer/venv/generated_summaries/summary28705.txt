What if instead you told your child that it is vegetables, not candy or soda, that will make him big and strong like his dad or older brother? The organization has more than 400 active members and has helped close to 450 individuals find a better road in life. It would start with running, and through dedication, hard work and commitment, we would connect our members to job training and educational programs, employment partners and housing opportunities, but only when our members were ready for those steps. Today, Back on My Feet has operations in five cities (Philadelphia;  Baltimore, Maryland;  Washington; Chicago, Illinois; and Boston, Massachusetts) and works with 29 homeless shelters. Wanting to start a running club at this homeless shelter came from passing this facility on my morning run and seeing a group of men congregating outside on the corner.
