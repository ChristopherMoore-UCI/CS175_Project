I find boxes upon boxes of Fly London shoes, ready for delivery to Croatia, Denmark, Italy, UK, U.S., Russia and Angola, among many other countries. It requires investment in new and advanced technologies, better quality products, spending on international promotion and updated workforce skills. Portuguese shoes are now the second most expensive in the world, behind Italian shoes, according to industry group APPICAPS. And some are discovering new ways to gain traction overseas. This is the company's logo, and its brand name is Fly London.
