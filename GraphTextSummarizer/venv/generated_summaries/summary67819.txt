The incident comes as the army has been sent in to replace the secret police and establish order, a move welcomed by many Baniyas residents. Activist Rami Nakhle said a doctor in Baniyas claimed that police shot the soldier. Opposition activists say security forces have fired on and beaten peaceful protesters, but the government claims that armed groups are firing at security forces and citizens. "An armed group of snipers opened fire today on a number of elements in the army while they were patrolling in the city of Baniyas," the Syrian Arab News Agency said. -- A Syrian soldier was killed in the restive city of Baniyas on Thursday
