The man suspected in the recent rash of telephoned bomb threats to businesses across the United States has been tied to other crimes, including a Miami Beach, Florida, bank robbery and a wire fraud case in New York, law enforcement sources said Wednesday. Sharif is not a stranger to federal law enforcement officials. Authorities have tied telephoned threats to at least 24 banks and stores in at least 15 states to Sharif and have confirmed that in some cases businesses paid ransoms in the face of the bomb threats, the sources told CNN. The FBI said the recent flurry of threatening calls from Portugal appears to have started in Portland, Oregon, in mid-August. The Secret Service sought him on wire fraud charges for which he was indicted in New York in 2005, authorities said.
