Commenting on the difficulty of coming to his decision, Gerrard said he realized it was time to move on when Liverpool manager Brendan Rogers began to discuss how best to make the most of his abilities in the veteran stage of his career and the possibility that he may no longer be an automatic choice. Rumors quickly surfaced linking the Liverpool captain with a move to Los Angeles Galaxy, formerly home of ex England star David Beckham. However, his long-cherished desire to win the Premier League never materialized -- Liverpool came close in 2009 finishing second to Manchester United and last season Brendan Rodgers' side were pipped to the post by Manchester City. Steven Gerrard has revealed he will move to the U.S. when he leaves Liverpool at the end of the current EPL season. He also represented England 114 times -- before retiring after the 2014 World Cup -- and has won eight trophies with Liverpool including two FA Cups, three League Cups and the UEFA Cup in 2001.
