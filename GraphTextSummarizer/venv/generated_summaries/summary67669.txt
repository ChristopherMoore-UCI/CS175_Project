-- Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s fans and critics will find out Saturday night if he's still "Money" -- his nickname -- and still undefeated, when he takes on WBA super-welterweight champion Miguel Cotto in Las Vegas. The 31-year-old Cotto is more inconspicuous and workmanlike, while the 35-year-old Mayweather has a more flamboyant, brash reputation and a sizable cohort of celebrity supporters. Win or lose, Mayweather is set to pocket $32 million, while Cotto would get $8 million. Physically, Mayweather entered the bout as the taller of the two by an inch, while Cotto weighed in at 154 pounds, three pounds more than his foe. Those wishing him luck on Twitter shortly before the fight included teen pop star Justin Bieber, skateboarder and MTV personality Rob Drydek, musician Akon, and Rob Kardashian of the E! reality show clan.
