The commitment McConnell expressed in that speech to a committee-centered, collegial Senate offers President Obama and Senate Democrats the opportunity to work together in a productive way that Sen. Harry Reid denied to Senate Republicans for the last eight years. -- Friday's White House meeting with congressional leaders is a timid first step by President Obama toward learning to work effectively with a Congress that will now be controlled by Republicans. If, however, President Obama takes the other path before him--pursuing the vision of an unrestrained executive he sketched in his press conference--he is likely to have a very difficult time collaborating with Congress on anything. If President Obama wants to have the effective working relationship with Congress that he says he does, he will have to take the path that can lead to such a relationship.
