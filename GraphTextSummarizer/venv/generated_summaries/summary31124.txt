"Before the Umbrella Movement, Hong Kong people didn't really pay attention to politics. The Chinese government has steadfastly rejected the protesters' demands, calling the movement illegal and letting Hong Kong authorities deal with the situation on the ground. Wong, a leader of the student group Scholarism, abandoned a hunger strike at the weekend that was aimed at getting the Hong Kong government to hold talks with protesters. Protest leaders say they don't intend to put up a fight, but it remains unclear if other factions in the decentralized movement will resist the police action. Public support for the student-led protests swelled in late September after police used tear gas and other tough tactics in a botched attempt to disperse demonstrators.
