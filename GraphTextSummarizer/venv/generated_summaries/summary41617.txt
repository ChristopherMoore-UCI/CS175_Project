Civil unions between same-sex couples have been recognized in Brazil since 2011, after the Supreme Court ruled that the same rights and rules that apply to "stable unions" of heterosexual couples would apply to same-sex couples, including the right to joint declaration of income tax, pension, inheritance and property sharing. In Brazil, notaries officiate marriages and civil unions. People in same-sex unions are also allowed to extend health benefits to their partners, following the same rules applied to heterosexual couples. Recently, 12 Brazilian states began allowing same-sex couples to marry or convert their civil unions into marriages. Brazilian neighbors Uruguay and Argentina are the only other two countries in Latin America that have laws allowing same-sex couples to marry.
