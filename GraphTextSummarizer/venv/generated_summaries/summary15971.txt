New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed legislation Tuesday raising the tobacco-purchasing age from 18 to 21. In addition to the "Tobacco 21" bill, which also covers electronic cigarettes, Bloomberg signed a second bill, dubbed Sensible Tobacco Enforcement, which prohibits discounts on tobacco products and increases enforcement on vendors who attempt to evade taxes. "By increasing the smoking age to 21, we will help prevent another generation from the ill health and shorter life expectancy that comes with smoking," Bloomberg said in a written statement when the legislation was approved by the city council in October. This is the latest step in the outgoing mayor's mission for healthier New York City lifestyles. Neighboring states and counties have raised the tobacco sale age to 19, including New Jersey in 2005, the Department of Health said.
