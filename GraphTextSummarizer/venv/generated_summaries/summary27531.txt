The incident occurred about 2 p.m. on American Airlines Flight 41, which was flying in from Paris, FAA spokesman Tony Molinaro said. -- An American Airlines flight arriving at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport deployed its emergency slides for passengers Friday afternoon after the landing gear and some tires caught fire, an FAA spokesman said. American Airlines spokesman Ed Martelle said the plane's crew reported a fire on brake No. 7 of the aircraft, a Boeing 767-300, and the smell of a hot brake entered the ventilation system. The pilot reported that some tires caught fire upon landing, Molinaro said. The plane was carrying 220 passengers and 12 crew members, Martelle said.
