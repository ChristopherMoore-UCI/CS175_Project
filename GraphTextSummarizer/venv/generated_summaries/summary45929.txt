Peter Renton, a peer-to-peer blogger who recently made a foray into investing raising $28 million this year for Lend Academy Investments LLC, regularly writes for an audience of 20,000 on his website that provides news and advice on peer-to-peer lending. "You can get actually a better deal by looking at people around you, looking at your community," says Soul Htite, the founder and CEO at Dianrong, a peer-to-peer lending company based in Shanghai. Acting as a broker between lenders and borrowers, peer-to-peer lenders say they can offer a better rate to both sides without the weight of regulation and the expensive branches that typically make high street banks so cautious. In the United States, peer-to-peer groups such as LendingClub and Prosper allow borrowers to apply for loans of as much as US$35,000 payable over three or five years. Welcome to peer-to-peer lending, a platform where people lend money to each other over the internet.
