The attack came amid growing speculation that the Pakistani military is considering a U.S. demand to launch a major offensive targeting militants in the North Waziristan, a district in Pakistan's tribal region regarded as a haven for militants fueling the insurgency in Afghanistan. Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told CNN that the Pakistani Taliban carried out Thursday morning's attack at the base, about 37 miles northwest of the nation's capital of Islamabad. Pakistani Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf condemned what he called an "act of terrorism" and praised airmen for their "bravery" as they "successfully" cleared the base of militants. Militants dressed as airmen shot their way through a security post as personnel at Minhas Air Base in Kamra were eating a predawn meal in observance of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month, said Capt. -- At least 10 people died in a two-hour gunbattle at an air base in northern Pakistan on Thursday, a spokesman for the nation's air force said.
