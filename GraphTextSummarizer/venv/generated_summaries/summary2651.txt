The Grameen Bank model was replicated in many parts of the world as its work drew increasing attention to microcredit, a then-novel idea of making small loans to poor people who would not qualify for standard bank loans. The Bangladeshi Cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, ordered the Internal Resources Division to ascertain whether Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, enjoyed tax exemption while he was managing director of the bank, said Cabinet secretary Mohammad Musharraf Hossain Bhuiyan. During a visit to Dhaka earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton angered the government when she said she hoped the work of Grameen Bank and Yunus would not be undermined by government actions. He was forced out as managing director last year after Bangladesh's central bank, the financial regulatory authority in the South Asian nation, said Yunus had to end his service at age 60 and that holding his position at 70 was illegal. It also directed the Bangladesh central bank and the Financial Institutions Division to report on how much money Yunus made in salaries and allowances while head of the bank after he turned 60, Bhuiyan said.
