" In the four years since Gordon joined Ingredion -- which makes food additives such as starches and corn syrup - its share price has gone from $25 to $60. When Gordon joined the company -- then called Corn Products -- in 2009, she quickly diversified into other products, acquired National Starch and changed its name to Ingredion to reflect its new focus. "Over a 35 year career, I got there," said Gordon, chief executive, chairman and president of Ingredion. "We really diversified and actually only 14% of our sales globally are focused on high fructose for the soft drink industry," said Gordon. "It is a perception problem and high fructose and sugar are really the same dynamics," said Gordon.
