"My belief is strongly ... that we need to change that." In the August 24 letter to Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster and founder Craig Newmark, the attorneys general wrote: "The increasingly sharp public criticism of Craigslist's Adult Services section reflects a growing recognition that ads for prostitution -- including ads trafficking children -- are rampant on it." Blumenthal said on Sunday that attorneys general from three more states have joined his campaign against Craigslist's adult services ads. -- Online classified service Craigslist's decision to censor its adult services section is a "good step but a continuing battle has to be fought," a leader in the fight against prostitution ads said on Sunday. In a later blog post, Buckmaster said Craigslist implemented manual screening of adult services ads in May 2009. A CNN investigation of Craigslist's adult services section, which replaced "erotic services ads" two years ago, counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day. Blumenthal said he wants to broaden his fight against online prostitution ads but that "right now our focus is really on Craigslist." "We're taking it one step at a time," he said.
