The 28-year-old, who sealed Chelsea's famous 3-2 aggregate win in midweek against Barcelona, added his second five minutes later driving home after a mix up between Kenny and defender Nedum Onuoha. Torres' return to form also adds spice to next weekend's English FA Cup final where Chelsea take on his old club Liverpool at Wembley Stadium. Torres entered the fray in the 19th minute, receiving a inch-perfect pass from Saloman Kalou before rounding QPR keeper Paddy Kenny to score. Chelsea were 2-0 up before Torres was on the score sheet with Daniel Sturridge blasting home inside the first minute and John Terry heading a second 12 minutes later. Tottenham moved back into fourth place on Sunday with a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers at White Hart Lane.
