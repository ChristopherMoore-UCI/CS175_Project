-- After a hole-in-one at the KLM Open in Amsterdam, golfer Andy Sullivan has won a prize that is truly out of this world. The Englishman, who found the cup with his tee shot on the 15th hole, bagged himself a flight into space courtesy of a Dutch aerospace company. Before boldly going where no professional golfer has gone before, Sullivan needs to run the idea by his wife. I didn't play great through the round and then I hit a shot like that," Sullivan told the European Tour's official website. XCOR Aerospace pledged a 62-minute space flight to any player who could card a hole-in-one at the 15th at the Kennemer Golf and Country Club.
