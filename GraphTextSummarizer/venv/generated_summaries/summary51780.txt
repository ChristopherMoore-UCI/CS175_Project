The big unveiling of the iPhone 4S on Tuesday was the first time most people learned about Siri, but the voice-assistant software is rooted in many years of extensive technical research. Siri's engineers were excited for the opportunity to bake their software deeply into the new iPhone and build features that a third-party developer would not be able to do because of Apple-imposed restrictions, Winarsky said. Before joining Apple, Siri provided a free app for iOS mobile devices. Apple dedicated a significant chunk of the presentation to showing the extent of Siri's ability to interpret requests and respond. Apple's new phone, which was announced on Tuesday to be sold in stores on October 14, will have a new function called Siri.
