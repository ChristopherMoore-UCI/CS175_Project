Anthony, 22, is charged with killing her daughter, Caylee Anthony, in a case that has received national attention. Last month, Florida 9th Circuit Judge Stan Strickland denied prosecutors' request to impose a gag order in Anthony's case, saying he could not state that continued publicity would pose a threat to her trial, or even that a gag order would stem the flood of media attention. Casey Anthony has been charged in an indictment with the premediated murder of daughter Caylee. When questioned, Anthony gave conflicting statements to police, including some that were later disproved, according to hundreds of documents and investigative reports released in the case. Anthony waited about a month before telling her family that Caylee was gone.
