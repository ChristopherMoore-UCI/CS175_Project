The high court also said evidence could support prosecutors' initial argument -- that Meredith Kercher was killed in a twisted sex misadventure game at Kercher and Knox's home in Italy, the high court said, according to Italian news agency ANSA. The appeals court jury that acquitted Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, in 2011 "neglected significant evidence" and theories, the high court said in a 74-page explanation. When asked Tuesday if Knox would return to Italy to face the new trial, Della Vedova replied: "Would you send your kid back?" Kercher, a 21-year-old British exchange student, was found stabbed to death in November 2007 in the villa she rented with Knox, then 20, in the central Italian university town of Perugia. -- Italy's supreme court on Tuesday explained its earlier ruling that American Amanda Knox be retried in the 2007 death of her roommate, saying the jury that acquitted her didn't consider all the evidence, and that discrepancies in testimony need to be answered.
