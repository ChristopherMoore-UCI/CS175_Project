The initial offer price of $38 was too high, too many shares were issued, its opening day was marred by Nasdaq's technical glitches and underwriter Morgan Stanley was fined for improperly influencing share sales. The IPO price, however, is really meant for institutional investors such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which can purchase shares directly from the Twitter IPO's underwriters. Regular investors will get their first chance to buy Twitter the following day, when shares will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "TWTR." Twitter's choice to go with NYSE was considered a snub to the tech-heavy Nasdaq exchange, which caught major heat for the massive fumbling of Facebook's IPO last year. In a regulatory filing earlier this month, Twitter set a preliminary price range of $17 to $20 per share for its IPO, though that price could change. We are being very methodical in our planning for Twitter's IPO, and are working together with the industry to ensure a world class experience for Twitter, retail investors and all market participants."
