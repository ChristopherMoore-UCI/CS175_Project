Instead, let's assume Europe had not only contemplated austerity but also actually imposed it: cutting spending, raising taxes and shrinking its public sector. Klein tells us this is what austerity looks like "and it can be expected to reduce economic growth." The mere thought of austerity is enough to choke the eurozone to death. Apparently, it is not austerity itself that constricts economies. In the Washington Post, Ezra Klein notes unemployment is "skyrocketing" across Europe and he contends the fault lies in shrinking budget deficits brought by spending cuts and tax increases.
