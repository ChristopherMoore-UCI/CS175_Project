-- An American held by Colombian rebels for more than three months will be released "imminently," U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson said Saturday after meeting in Cuba with rebel leaders. FARC guerrillas captured U.S Army veteran Kevin Scott Sutay on June 20 while he was traveling in Colombia. Jackson said he hopes the Red Cross in Colombia will provide a helicopter to remove Sutay from the remote area of the country where he is being held and that the Colombian government will designate the area a cease-fire zone during his release. He is from Willow Spring, North Carolina, and won a number of awards, including an Army Commendation Medal and a National Defense Service Medal. Despite Sutay's military background, Jackson said the Army veteran had peaceful motives for visiting Colombia.
