He must have been too proud to call my mother, because she only learned what had happened when Grandmother phoned her to make plans to meet at Aunt Cleo's. On the train ride to New York, Grandmother Edith tried to keep our spirits up, but I could see how distraught she was. When we got to Penn Station, she bought us two tickets, and half an hour later Paul and I got off at Princeton Junction and started looking around the little station for my father. -- With spring break nearing, my mother contacted my father and arranged for Paul and me to visit him again in Princeton. "I wanted to get well to spend time with you boys, but I'm sick again and have to go back."
