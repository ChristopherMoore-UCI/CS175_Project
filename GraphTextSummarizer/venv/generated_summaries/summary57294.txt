Selma Blair says she works with hairstylists and makeup artists who "have a vision." "I have no fears when it comes to my hair or clothes," proclaims the 36-year-old star of NBC's upcoming mom-and-daughter sitcom "Kath and Kim" and July's action flick "Hellboy II: The Golden Army." Makeup, however, is an entirely different matter for the self-declared "poor applier," who sticks with basics like nude lipstick and pink blush, and ducks whenever she sees a liquid liner. I'm really excited about having a perma-tan and wearing long highlighted hair extensions for my role on "Kath and Kim." I think I'm more approachable with long hair. I go to a spa in L.A. called Kinara for its Skin Care BootCamp. In high school I would mess with my hair and makeup all the time.
