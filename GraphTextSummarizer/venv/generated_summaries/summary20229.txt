"This a big win for Kindle owners and we look forward to being allowed to lower prices on more Kindle books," an Amazon spokesman said via e-mail. At the time, Amazon's Kindle was far and away the dominant device for e-books and Amazon forced publishers to sell most books on the devices for $9.99. Wednesday's lawsuit centers around the 2010 release of the iPad, when the government alleges Apple colluded with six major publishing houses to raise prices on digital books. Publishers argued that price was too low and, according to the Justice Department, went to Apple in 2009 looking for a way to force Amazon's hand. For consumers, the news that the Department of Justice is suing Apple and several publishers, accusing them of price-fixing, boils down to one kitchen-table question: Will this mean my e-books will get cheaper?
