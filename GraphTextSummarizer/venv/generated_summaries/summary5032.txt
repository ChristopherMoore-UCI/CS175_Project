Last weekend, the Ministry of Interior temporarily banned demonstrations and the courts have summoned opposition leaders Sam Rainsy, president of the Cambodia National Rescue Party, and his deputy, Kem Sokha. A common refrain in recent weeks has been that the rallies represented the most serious threat to Hun Sen's government in years. Hundreds of garment workers threw rocks at security forces and created burning roadblocks. On Thursday morning, when an opposition-affiliated youth group tried to sing a song inside the park, military police and security guards stopped them from getting into the main area, sending a clear message that the government will enforce its ban on demonstrations. The crowd "protested in an attempt to topple the government, and burned down garment factories," said Mok Chito, head of the department of central justice in Cambodia's Ministry of Interior.
