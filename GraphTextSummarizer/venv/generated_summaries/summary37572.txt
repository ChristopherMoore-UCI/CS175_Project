For the last two-months, Webb has been tweeting about criminal justice reform, mental health issues and efforts to increase middle class incomes. Webb plans to continue this Twitter-first strategy when he live tweets President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday, adding his observations and disagreements with the president in real time. While most of this has gone largely unscrutinized -- and Webb and his advisers are aware Twitter can't be the only way a presidential candidate outlines a message -- advisers said Webb's Twitter account is a fair representation of the platform Webb would run on if he chooses to jump into the race. Crawford said Webb enjoys Twitter more than giving speeches. " "It is not a bunch of propeller heads around him saying you should do that or this," said Craig Crawford, Webb's new communication's director whose hiring was announced on Twitter.
