The president of the tourism board of Usuaia, Marcelo Lieti, said Monday's incident "had nothing to do with the Malvinas subject," according to Telam. The government was applying a provincial law barring ships traveling under British colony flags from docking at the port, said the state-run Telam news agency. "We all defend Malvinas, but the tourist ships have nothing to do with the request for sovereignty," he told Radio Provincia of Ushuaia. The P&O cruise liner Adonia, which is on a South American tour from Southampton, England, with an almost entirely British contingent of passengers, got a similar reception on Monday. Both P&O Cruises and Princess Cruises are Carnival Corporation cruise brands.
