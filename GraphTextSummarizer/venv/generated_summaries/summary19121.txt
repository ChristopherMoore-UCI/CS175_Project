Airports, roads and railways have been slated for privatization, hundreds of new airports are planned to link the vast interior, the country's development bank has pledged an immediate $10 billion in related spending, private banks are planning greater lending in the infrastructure space, a Sao Paulo to Rio bullet train has been announced for completion by 2020, and $26 billion has been allocated to modernize the country's 34 ports which are responsible for more than 90% of the country's annual $482 billion in trade. Sao Paulo very much feels like the second-largest city in the world, but unlike even larger Tokyo, its airport feels third world and public transportation can scarcely cope with demand. Yet lower interest rate policy has failed to drive stronger investment, and business confidence is down due to government intrusions large and small in banks, car companies, and other sectors. Taken together, the government promises $100 billion in infrastructure spending over the next decade, while raising $65 billion in privatization and auctions. Since taking office just over two years ago, President Dilma Rousseff has regularly announced massive infrastructure investment schemes.
