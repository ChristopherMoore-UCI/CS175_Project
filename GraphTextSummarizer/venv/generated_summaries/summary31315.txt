Republicans led by presidential challenger Mitt Romney served up a heaping helping of political red meat on Friday, launching a salvo of attacks on President Barack Obama that called him a liar and a failed leader. Referring to the anti-American protests in the Arab world, Ryan complained that Obama has failed to assert U.S. influence and values that could have brought a different result. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also sought to project American strength and determination, labeling as "senseless" and totally unacceptable" the anti-American unrest she blamed on an "awful" anti-Islam video on the Internet. In particular, Republican politicians and conservative commentators have cited the killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans amid anti-American protests in Libya this week as an example of the nation's weakened stature around the world. "It is my belief and my opinion that Barack Obama has been the most dangerous president we have ever had on American foreign policy," said GOP Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a tea party favorite who ran unsuccessfully for the party's presidential nomination.
