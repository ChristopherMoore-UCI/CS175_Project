Cave said when his family first arrived at Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo gorilla exhibit, he noticed one of the gorillas had a cut below his eye that was "bleeding a little bit." The group of male gorillas is known to have occasional skirmishes. Even with the crack, the public was never in danger, he said, because the window has multiple layers of both glass and acrylic. Kevin Cave caught the incident on video that he posted on his Reddit page. " Dan Cassidy with the Henry Doorly Zoo said he's been surprised by the attention since he considered the whole thing a "nonevent."
