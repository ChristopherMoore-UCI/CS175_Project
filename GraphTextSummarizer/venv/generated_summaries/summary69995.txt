-- Some 20,000 text messages, 25 photographs including nudes, and alleged secret meetings have prompted prosecutors to rescind a plea offer and request that bond be revoked for Florida teen Kaitlyn Hunt, charged with felonies in a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl, according to court papers. Prosecutors now say in court papers that also in February, Hunt gave the girl an iPod. Hunt also is accused of sending photographs and videos to the girl, with the court papers saying "These photographs are explicit and depict the defendant nude ..." Prosecutors included examples of texts they say Hunt sent to the girl, including: "(N)o matter what if they find out we talked I'm going to jail until trial starts. Prosecutors also say that the younger girl told a detective that Hunt would drive her to "a remote location where they would have intimate physical contact." But Florida Assistant State Attorney Christopher Taylor told CNN Monday that since learning about Hunt's alleged contact with the victim in this case, the state has taken the deal off the table.
