I chose my son over him," McKinley said to CNN Oklahoma City affiliate KWTV. Police said Stewart told them Martin knew McKinley's husband had died, according to CNN affiliate KOCO. CNN's calls to police in Blanchard, about 25 miles south of downtown Oklahoma City, were not immediately returned. Martin suspected prescription drugs would be inside the home, the station reported, citing court documents. McKinley, who had been widowed less than a week before, placed a couch in front of one door and went to the bedroom and put a bottle in her baby's mouth before calling 911, she said on HLN's "Dr. Drew" on Wednesday.
