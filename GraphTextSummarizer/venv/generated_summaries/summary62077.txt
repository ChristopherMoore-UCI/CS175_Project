The court held the state law conflicted with federal law, called PASPA, which prohibits engaging in a sports gambling scheme "pursuant to state law." So, the New Jersey law allowing sports wagering was struck down, except that the court observed that the federal law banned a state from "licensing" or "sponsoring" sports gambling. The federal government and an association of sports leagues are opposing this move to legalize sports betting. The sooner the leagues figure out an infrastructure that siphons revenue from Grandpa Vito's nasty penchant for blowing his pension check on the ponies, sports betting will magically become OK with pro sports. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has conceded what the rest of us have known for a long time: Legal sports gambling is inevitable.
