Rajadhani Express trains can be found on three routes that run on two major Sri Lanka rail lines. Home to a gorgeous coastline, ancient cities and lush countryside, Sri Lanka is also slowly healing from the wounds of war. Both are first-class carriages run by private operators attached to regular trains run by Sri Lanka Railways. One of the best properties in town is Galle Fort Hotel (28 Church St., Galle Fort, Southern Province; +94 91 223 2870). Sri Lanka has two competing high-end rail services, Expo Rail and the Rajadhani Express.
