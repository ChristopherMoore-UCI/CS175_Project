According to Graddy, first ladies have popularized colors, as Nancy Reagan did with red; they have been praised for their modest and simple attire, like Lucy Hayes; and they have been trendsetting icons, like Jacqueline Kennedy. In addition to the gowns, "The First Ladies" exhibit includes White House china and other personal possessions of first ladies. "They've also coped with the public interest in their fashion sense, which is a somewhat unexpected part of the job for many first ladies," Graddy said. From bustles to silk chiffon with organza flowers and Swarovski crystals, the newly updated first ladies exhibition at the National Museum of American History is an extravaganza of frills and fashion. They also wanted to focus on first ladies who had a strong fashion presence, she added.
