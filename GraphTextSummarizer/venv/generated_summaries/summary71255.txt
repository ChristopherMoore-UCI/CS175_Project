Few would doubt the importance of international agreements to regulate war, particularly those that safeguard the rights of citizens, such as bans on chemical weapons and torture. A significant amount of research, including my own, demonstrates that military interventions from outside states lengthen and make bloodier civil wars. The United States will be intervening in the Syrian civil war on behalf of the rebels. It's hard to predict exactly what will happen, of course, but once the United States bombs Syrian forces, it is possible that the rebels will take that moment to launch their own offensive, forcing the Syrian government to respond even more resolutely, greatly worsening the bloodshed. If al-Assad is responsible for the use of chemical weapons, he had full knowledge of the norms he was violating.
