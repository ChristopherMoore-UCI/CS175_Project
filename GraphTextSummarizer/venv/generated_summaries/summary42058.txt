Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hit back at Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, Monday for his comments that Cruz doesn't know what he is talking about when it comes to net neutrality. Obama puts foot down: No Internet fast lanes Cruz said last week on Facebook that net neutrality is "the biggest regulatory threat to the Internet. It was circulated in response to Franken's suggestion on Sunday that Cruz doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to net neutrality. Franken, who chairs the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, said Cruz's previously stated analogy that net neutrality is like "Obamacare for the Internet" makes no sense. " "It's radical and extreme to put the future of the Internet in the hands of a five-member FCC panel influenced by lobbyists and politicians and unaccountable to regular, working Americans," Amanda Carpenter said, while also pointing to a recent speech by Cruz about net neutrality.
