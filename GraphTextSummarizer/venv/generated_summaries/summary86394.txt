Over the past six years, there's been a sharp structural decline of elected Democrats everywhere below the presidential level. And so when Hillary Clinton runs into some trouble, the Democrats ought to worry. But while the anxious Democrats shake their heads about the state of affairs — and the lack of serious alternatives in the presidential lineup — they might do well to look at themselves. Or that GOP governors now outnumber the Democrats by almost two-to-one, 31 to 18. (Unless you think Vice President Joe Biden is running or Secretary of State John Kerry is running, which they likely are not. Same for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.)
