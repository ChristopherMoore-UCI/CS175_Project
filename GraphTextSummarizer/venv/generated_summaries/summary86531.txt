Since then, Lew Frankfort has expanded the brand from trendy hand bags to gloves, and other accessories, bringing his by-the-numbers management style to the fickle world of fashion. Lake: Some people said that you have democratized luxury, made it accessible to more people. We like it that way, and we like to have a broad array of price points that can appeal to an aspirational consumer who can just enter the world of Coach with a small accessory for as little as $28, or to the aficionado we offer $10,000 exotic handbags. Frankfort: What I joined was really just a manufacturer of leather products.
