-- French President Francois Hollande and the first lady parted ways Saturday, with the leader declaring it's over and his partner of several years bidding farewell to the staff of the presidential residence. An arts columnist for weekly magazine Paris Match, she is not married to Hollande but assumed the role of first lady at official functions following his election in May 2012. The breakup occurred in the wake of a media account earlier this month about Hollande allegedly having an affair with actress Julie Gayet. Hollande told a French news outlet Saturday he is ending his relationship with his partner, Valerie Trierweiler. "I wish to make it known that I have ended my shared life (partnership) with Valerie Trierweiler," Hollande is quoted as saying to Agence France-Presse.
