Mugabe: Accept my re-election or 'commit suicide' The nation's electoral commission declared Mugabe the winner with 61% against the former prime minister's 34%. Last week, Mugabe told his critics to "commit suicide" if they cannot accept his re-election. Opposition party supporters were beaten, tortured and killed, rights groups said, and Tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff in protest. Zimbabwean President  Robert Mugabe was sworn in for another  term Thursday following disputed elections. Opinion: Why nobody is dancing after Mugabe's win Five years ago, his party lost to Tsvangirai, who did not get enough votes to avoid a runoff.
