After giving it some thought, Reid used baking flour and liquid feritlizer to stick seeds, in calculated intervals, onto newspaper strips. Launched in 2010, Reid's Johannesburg-based startup produces a paper strip that that comes pre-packaged with seeds and organic fertilizers. Reid says her biodegradable strips use 80% less water than traditional gardening methods, because they require water only at the exact location of each seed. "It tells you exactly where to water, all the nutrition is already in there," says Reid, who sells her planting strips throughout South Africa. "So we enable anyone to be able to grow vegetables -- with little space, little education and little water."
