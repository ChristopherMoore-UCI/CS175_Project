To beat Roy Emerson at Wimbledon with my parents there, beating Patrick Rafter, a great Australian, it was great way to do it. I just want them to be good kids, respectful kids, be nice to people. The American media and fans expect Wimbledon winners, guys being number one -- it's pretty hard to do. It wasn't really my plan, and from being as low as I could be -- losing second round at Wimbledon against (world No. 145) I'm a fan of all these guys, but serve and volley tennis, unfortunately, has pretty much gone.
