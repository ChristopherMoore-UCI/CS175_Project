-- British boxer Amir Khan has retained his WBA light-welterweight title after winning the much-hyped "battle of the faiths" by stopping challenger Dmitriy Salita in the first round on Saturday night. The 22-year-old Khan was successful in his first defense of the belt that he won in defeating Andreas Kotelnik in July. Roach has helped the Olympic silver medal winner to rebuild his career after a humiliating defeat by unknown Colombian Breidis Prescott last year. "It was a blessing in disguise what happened against Prescott, I got beat and came back stronger," Khan said. He is trained by American Freddie Roach, who also guides Filipino star Manny Pacquiao, considered by many to be the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.
