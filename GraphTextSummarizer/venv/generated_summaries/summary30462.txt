But then processing of the rape kit was delayed, according to Jerome Warfield, a member of Detroit's civilian commission that oversees police. On August 5 -- more than two weeks after the alleged rape was reported -- some residents of the Hubbard Farms neighborhood in southwestern Detroit decided they weren't going to wait for police and prosecutors to act. The man named on the neighborhood flier was taken into custody and questioned, but police could not formally charge him because the prosecutor's office didn't sign off on the warrant, according to Warfield. According to a case record in the Wayne County Probate Court, the man is 43 years old and described as "an individual with a developmental disability." "Because the victim and suspect, being significantly handicapped, there are rules and guidelines that we have to follow that we cannot treat the situation as a normal assault," said Police Commissioner Warfield.
