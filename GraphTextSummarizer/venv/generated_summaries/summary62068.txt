Motorola's news follows similar announcements by Chinese computer maker Lenovo, which is building a manufacturing plant in North Carolina, and Apple, which has said it will begin manufacturing a Mac computer in the U.S. this year. It's the first new phone to be designed entirely under the ownership of Google, which bought Motorola Mobility last year. Woodside hinted that the Moto X would go on sale this fall and be priced below competing phones such as the IPhone 5. He said that 70% of the phone will be assembled at a Texas facility that once made Nokia phones, although some of its components will be built overseas. Called Moto X, the phone will be assembled at a 500,000-square-foot plant near Fort Worth, Texas, that will employ about 2,000 people.
