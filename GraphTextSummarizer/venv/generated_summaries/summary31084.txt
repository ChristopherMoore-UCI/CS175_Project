While fathers are contributing more labor at home these days, more women are becoming the chief or sole financial provider of the household in a recovering economy. Harrington noticed a difference in the evolution of fathers at home and mothers at work. In the last 50 years, fathers have taken on more child care and housework, though women still do the majority, according to a Pew Research study released in March. By 2011, fathers were spending seven hours a week caring for kids, while mothers spent 14. Experts say more value has been placed on mothers, sometimes to the detriment of the critical role fathers play.
