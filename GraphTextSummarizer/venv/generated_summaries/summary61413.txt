Pirates hijack Greek-operated tanker off Togo coast Attacks there were often violent and targeted tankers carrying refined oil products that can be easily sold, it added. How to fight piracy Pottengal Mukundan, director of the IMB, said the decline was a reflection of the pre-emptive and disruptive counter-piracy tactics used by international navies, as well as deployment of on-board security measures like armed guards. The number of attacks by Somali pirates has fallen dramatically, with 70 attacks by the end of September, down from 199 in the same time frame in 2011 and the lowest number since 2009, according to the report, which was released on Monday. "There continues to be a serious problem with under-reporting of attacks in this area," Mukundan said. Sea piracy has fallen to its lowest level worldwide since 2008, as policing by international naval forces has deterred pirates operating in the waters off Somalia, new figures from the piracy watchdog show.
