Demonstrators marching outside the British Embassy in Buenos Aires last month burned British flags and urged Argentina to sever ties with London. While British officials have said the ship's deployment is routine, according to Britain's ITN news network, some Argentinians see it as a provocation. British Prime Minister David Cameron has criticized Argentinian officials for their renewed claims to the island. "We support the Falklands' right to self-determination, and what the Argentinians have been saying recently, I would argue, is actually far more than colonialism, because these people want to remain British, and the Argentinians want them to do something else," he told lawmakers last month. In December, members of the Mercosur trade bloc -- which includes Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay -- said they would stop ships bearing the Falkland Islands flag from entering their ports.
