During Sunday's season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne, millions of hardcore Hamilton fans will bite their fingernails and hold their breath when their hero returns to the track in his Mercedes racing car. Hamilton has also contributed to Unicef's campaigns and during a break last season he traveled to Haiti to see first hand the charity's work there with malnourished children. "And so why should that be different on the international stage in a sporting context?" Christopher Thomas, a Hamilton super-fan from New York, says: "Hanging out with top celebrities isn't a problem as long as it doesn't interfere with his ability to race. But then there have been the meltdowns, which reached their nadir in a tumultuous 2011 season when Hamilton had an ongoing spat with Ferrari driver Felipe Massa -- at one point calling his driving skills "frickin' ridiculous" -- and controversially criticized the race stewards in Monaco. Mixing with celebrity friends has raised Hamilton's profile, and for some of his fans that is part of his appeal, but there is also a danger of alienating his petrolhead devotees.
