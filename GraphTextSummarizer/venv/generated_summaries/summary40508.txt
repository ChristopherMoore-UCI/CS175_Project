As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, China and Russia have veto powers and are important players in the Syrian conflict, having vetoed draft resolutions that called for sanctions against the Syrian regime. But on Wednesday, Russian president Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Hu Jintao had stronger words about Syria, once more presenting a united front on the crisis that stands in opposition to tough measures discussed by Western powers. The heads of state of Russia, China and four Central Asian partner nations signed a statement Thursday opposing outside intervention in Syria and Iran. Pressure has been mounting on China and Russia to use their influence on Syria and join efforts led by the United States to impose more sanctions on the al-Assad government and force it to step down. Last Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hilary Clinton urged China and Russia to be "part of the solution in Syria" by backing a political transition from the al-Assad regime.
