Last week, when Bale was roughed-up on camera while attempting to visit Chen Guangcheng, a blind activist who had been under house arrest in China for documenting his country's population-control measures, the Dark Knight actor reminded western audiences of China's less-than-stellar human rights record. The Zhang Yimou film wasn't the race's favorite to begin with -- "Iran's A Separation" looks to be the frontrunner -- but this public-relations controversy and China's belligerent response could have a severe impact on the war film's Oscar prospects. But make no mistake: China covets an Oscar that would legitimize its booming movie industry -- "Flowers of War," with a budget of nearly $100 million, is its biggest project ever -- and despite two previous nominations in the category, the country has never won the trophy. Lastly, it's the official category submission from China, which just so happens to be the most promising unrealized market for blockbuster Hollywood films. Hollywood's interest in access to China's restrictive market is now counterbalanced by a temptation to stick up for Batman.
