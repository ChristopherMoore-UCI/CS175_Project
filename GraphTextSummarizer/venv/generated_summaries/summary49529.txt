The only way Woods can retain his five-year long stint as world number one is to play another tournament in October, but he is not due to return to action until the HSBC Champions event in China on November 4 -- where Westwood was also scheduled to appear. The German rose to fourth in the world on Monday after winning his third successive tournament on the European Tour at St Andrews, and now has the chance to overtake Woods, Westwood and American Phil Mickelson at the top of the game. Kaymer is the first player since Woods in 2006 to win three tournaments back-to-back, and the first golfer from Europe to do so since Englishman Nick Faldo in 1998. Westwood failed to achieve the second-place finish which would have seen him end Woods' 279-week reign on Sunday, but the Englishman could still top the rankings on October 31 providing the American does not change his plans and play before then. -- Newly-crowned Dunhill Links champion Martin Kaymer could prevent Lee Westwood from replacing Tiger Woods as the world's number one golfer.
