"This is essentially the next step that was required for 3-D display technology without glasses," said physicist John Koshel, who studies optical science at the University of Arizona and was not associated with the new work. Special glasses handle this task for most modern 3-D blockbuster movies, with each lens only letting in one polarization of light. A filter covering the screen then obscures different vertical regions of the screen, like the slats of venetian blinds. The trick then is to have the light visible to your left eye contain the left-eye pixels and vice versa for the right eye. The new method would allow movie theaters to keep their projectors where they've always been, behind the audience, and uses fairly simple optical technology.
