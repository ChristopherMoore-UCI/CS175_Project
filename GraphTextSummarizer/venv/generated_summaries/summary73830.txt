After victories over Gail Monfils and Roger Federer, it was ideal preparation for the World No.1 in the build-up to his defense of the Australian Open title next month. -- Novak Djokovic swept past Spain's David Ferrer in straight sets to win the Abu Dhabi exhibition tournament Saturday and demonstrate he is in fine fettle for the start of the 2012 season. Earlier, Rafael Nadal beat old rival Roger Federer to claim third place with a 6-1 7-5 victory. "It's about getting ready and feeling fine out there and enjoying a great atmosphere here and having the chance to play world class players," Federer told gathered reporters. Djokovic ended the regular 2011 campaign nursing an injury and by losing to Ferrer at the end of season ATP World Tour Finals, but there was to be no repeat as the Serbian won 6-2 6-1.
