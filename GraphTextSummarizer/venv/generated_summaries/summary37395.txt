On Friday, Newman will attempt to break the blind water speed record in a powerboat just off the English coast and secure his place in history. But it was not until some years later that he began his love affair with speed -- breaking blind land records on land and in the air. A five times Guinness World record holder, there isn't much Newman can't do. Former soldier Mark Treadgold currently holds the record of 91mph but Newman is confident he can surpass that achievement when he hits the water at Torque Harbor, Devon, on England's south west coast. He twice broke blind land speed records in 2003 and 2005, improving from 144mph to 175mph in the space of two years.
