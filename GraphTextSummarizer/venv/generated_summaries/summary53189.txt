-- Prosecutors say Gary Schultz, a former Penn State vice president who oversaw campus police, held a file that detailed alleged incidents pertinent to the investigation of former football coach Jerry Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994. Days after the grand jury presentment against Sandusky came to light, Penn State ousted President Graham Spanier and head football coach Joe Paterno amid criticism they could and should have done more. Tom Farrell, Schultz's attorney, said, "To be clear, Mr. Schultz did not possess any secret files. The file, which prosecutors say was initially withheld during the investigation, shows inconsistencies with what Schultz and Curley told a grand jury, according to court documents filed by prosecutors and obtained by CNN on Tuesday. " "These e-mails were then provided to the State Attorney General, consistent with the investigation's prior commitment to share certain information," the firm said.
