-- A large group of youths from an ethnic militia loyal to former South Sudanese Vice President Riek Machar is marching for the city of Bor, just days after it was retaken by the government amid heavy fighting, officials said. It quickly spread across the country, with reports of mass killings lent credence by mass graves. James Gajaak, the de facto community leader at the Juba U.N. camp, told CNN's Arwa Damon that when he first arrived with his family, he went three days without food and water. Those on the U.N. base in Juba are scared to venture outside, even though many have homes within walking distance. Information Minister Michael Makuei said Saturday that rebel leader Machar had gone to ethnic Nuer neighborhoods in Uror to mobilize the youths.
