Protests against the Yemeni government Thursday were bigger than some expected given Saleh's agreement to transfer power, with youth saying their demands have not yet been met. Government forces also attacked protesters in Taiz province Thursday, eyewitnesses said, injuring three as they were marching calling for Saleh to face justice in the International Criminal Court. "We will not stay quiet..." He said the opposition does not represent all Yemenis and should not have agreed to give Saleh immunity. The violence came a day after President Ali Abdullah Saleh agreed to step down from power after months of protests against his 33-year rule. Heavy gunfire continued for more than 30 minutes on Zubairy Street, when youth marched to condemn the immunity given to Saleh.
