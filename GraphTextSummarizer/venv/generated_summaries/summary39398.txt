The new storefront, called Verizon Apps, will be presented for free to Verizon customers with Droid phones. In an interview during the opening, Kyle Malady, a Verizon technology executive, acknowledged shortcomings with its V Cast market but said there is still room for alternative storefronts. Verizon opened an office here last month where software developers are welcome to come code mobile apps and test them on the carrier's hardware. Verizon already offers apps that are exclusively available to its subscribers, such as one with live video of National Football League games. (Verizon began offering the iPhone in February, but Apple does not allow third-party companies to operate competing app stores.)
