"There are multiple challenges," USA Today's NFL writer Tom Pelissero, who was at the game in London, explained to CNN. Organizers of the NFL's London foray stirred the fever further Saturday as they held a block party for an estimated half a million fans on the streets of central London Tailgate yearning "It is a sign that the game is growing globally," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell told NFLUK.com earlier this year. Profit not a priority "This is an investment and we are trying to grow something," Alistair Kirkwood, managing director of NFL UK, told CNN. Developing the NFL in London, or any European franchise for that matter, does not come without its problems. For now, Peterson -- who had never been outside the U.S. before his trip to London -- and his fellow Viking raiders can feel satisfied with winning the game, as well as perhaps inching the NFL a little closer to a permanent place on sport's European map.
