-- All eyes were on triple world champion Sebastian Vettel during practice ahead of the Chinese Grand Prix, with the German back behind the wheel for the first time since ignoring team orders to clinch victory in Malaysia. It looks like the soft tyre is the one for qualifying, but it seems that we won't see that many stints on the soft tyre during the race." Webber, who was upset by Vettel's decision to overtake him last month despite being instructed by Red Bull to hold position, performed better than his colleague, clocking the fifth fastest time of the day. "Today, I immediately had a good feeling in the car," explained Brazil's Massa, who is four points ahead of Alonso in fifth position in the drivers' standings. For Massa it continues a bright start to 2013 which has seen him outperform his double world champion teammate Fernando Alonso. The Red Bull driver was left frustrated at the Shanghai International Circuit, struggling for pace as he registered the 10th quickest lap time.
