Decent and fair-minded Americans should focus not only on drones that target Americans, but also on drone strikes that shock our conscience. The idea of using military drones inside U.S. borders should trigger concern and scrutiny from all points on the political spectrum. If a GOP president refused to rule out killing U.S. citizens on U.S. soil without due process, we progressives would be marching down the street. Yes, I said it, and I will say it again: On Wednesday night, Sen. Rand Paul was a hero for civil liberties. Fortunately, Attorney General Eric Holder sent Paul a commendable letter ruling out strikes on noncombatant Americans on U.S. soil.
