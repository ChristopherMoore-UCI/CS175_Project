In 2012, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer -- who had already used the immigration issue and her support for a tough state law that required local police to enforce federal immigration statutes to scare up enough votes to win re-election in 2010 -- went so far as to sign an executive order that barred DREAMers from obtaining driver's licenses. How can state officials deny these people the right to drive on roads they helped build? Recently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals began the process of making such a correction when it ruled that Brewer's prohibition of driver's licenses for DREAMers was likely unconstitutional and told a lower court to issue a temporary injunction preventing state officials from enforcing the executive order. Regulating driving privileges is the job of states. Within days of the high court's ruling, DREAMers (for the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act) started lining up at Arizona Department of Transportation offices around the state to apply for driver's licenses.
