-- An Alitalia aircraft was forced to make an emergency landing at Rome's Fiumicino airport on Sunday night after landing gear failed to function, Italy's state-run ANSA news agency reported. ANSA said that passengers clapped and congratulated the pilot, who had more than 15,000 hours of flying experience and had previously worked in the military. A picture taken by Instagram user Andrea Ugolini showed the aircraft tilted to one side while passengers were evacuated using the emergency exit above the wing. The pilots made several attempts to land the aircraft, an Airbus A320, which was flying to the Italian capital from Madrid. Journalists Sophie Brown and Katie Hunt in Hong Kong contributed reporting
