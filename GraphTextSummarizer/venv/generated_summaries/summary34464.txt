On the bright side, people traveling by car will probably pay less for gas than in recent years, AAA says. Drivers should check weather forecasts before setting out on the road, and travelers should also check tire pressure, car batteries and windshield wipers. "This is not a huge number of cancellations, but due to the holiday, flights will be more full, and there will be fewer available seats to accommodate displaced passengers from canceled flights," FlightAware.com's Daniel Baker said. It was a hellish holiday travel night Wednesday, with hundreds of flights canceled and thousands delayed by a punishing nor'easter. The current average price of gasoline in the United States is $2.85 per gallon, 43 cents per gallon lower than the average price at the same time last year.
