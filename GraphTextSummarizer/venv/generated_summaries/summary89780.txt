"From the beginning of this unfortunate situation, the national representatives of Sigma Phi Epsilon have been thorough, respectful and very serious in investigating this matter," UVM Interim President John Bramley and Provost Jane E. Knodell said in a statement. -- The University of Vermont's chapter of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity has been closed after a survey surfaced online asking fraternity brothers whom they would rape. The national fraternity said it will collaborate with the university "to consider the potential return to UVM at the appropriate time, which would occur only by mutual agreement." " "SigEp will strengthen its efforts to provide college men with education focused on respect for women and the development of healthy inter-personal relationships," Warren said. " "Without suggesting that every member had knowledge of this questionnaire, the questions asked in the document are deplorable and absolutely inconsistent with our values," Brian Warren, the fraternity's executive director, said in a statement.
