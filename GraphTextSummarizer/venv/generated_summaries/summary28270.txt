His remains were found not far from where Miller's truck was located in Petrolia, California, last year, said Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko. When police arrived at the home, they found the bodies of Miller's wife, Sandy Miller, and the couple's two daughters -- Shelby, 8, and Shasta, 5 -- with multiple gunshot wounds. Shane Miller, the prime suspect in the deaths of his wife and two young daughters, was recently featured on CNN's "The Hunt With John Walsh." "It's been quite a week, and I think lots of people are relieved that both of these guys are off the streets," Walsh said Sunday. Miller was featured in Episode 1 of "The Hunt."
