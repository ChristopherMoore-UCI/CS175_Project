On the Vatican Radio website, Pope Francis said that "Et Incarnatus Est" is "unbeatable and brings you to God." Manfred Honeck, music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, conducted the orchestra of the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome. Despite his high position, Francis hasn't always been successful: Bishops ended a tense, two-week summit in Rome in October without agreeing, for instance, on how to minister to gays and lesbians. -- After an eventful 12-plus months that began with him being named Time's Person of the Year and ended with his blistering critique of the Vatican bureaucracy, Pope Francis got a chance to celebrate on Wednesday -- by presiding over Christmas Eve Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. But he has also garnered critics, including among Catholic conservatives, for his positions -- such as a push to make the church more welcoming for gays and lesbians and his proposed solution for divorced and remarried Catholics who want to receive Communion. This year, a drone outside and various 3-D cameras inside recorded the Mass. Pope Francis personally requested a performance of Mozart's Mass in C minor for the service, according to a Vatican spokesman.
