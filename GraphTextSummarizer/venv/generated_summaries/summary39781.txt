Bulgarian public prosecutor Darina Slavova told Agence France-Presse that the 29-year-old Joachin "was in contact several times" with Charlie Hebdo attacker Cherif Kouachi. At a ceremony 2,000 miles away in Paris, French President Fran√ßois Hollande posthumously gave the Legion d'Honneur to Merabet, Jean-Philippe and Franck Brinsolaro, laying medals on the coffins of all three slain police officers. Muslims worldwide have condemned last week's attacks on Charlie Hebdo and elsewhere in France.
