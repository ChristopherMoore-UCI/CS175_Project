In a rare statement on its site on Wednesday, Facebook responded, noting that its "systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as effectively" as they would like and they pledging to evaluate and update policies, guidelines and practices relating to hate speech. This defied reason and Facebook's own terms, which prohibit posts that "attack others based on their race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, disability or medical condition." In a widely reported move this week, Facebook, to its credit, changed its response and is improving its efforts to crack down on such content. We wrote an open letter to Facebook, co-signed by more than 100 organizations, asking the company to take concrete steps to better understand gender-based hate speech on its site and to train people to recognize violence against women as hateful. We are only demanding that Facebook apply its existing content policy rules to women fairly. It's important because Facebook's action represents an open acknowledgment that violence against women is a serious issue -- not openly stated in the past in the context of this content --  and that it deserves serious attention.
