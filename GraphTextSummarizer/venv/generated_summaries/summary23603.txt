The rap star paid a 12,000 kroner fine, nearly $2,000, after he was found with eight grams of pot while going through the customs checkpoint at the Kristiansand Airport in Kjevik, police spokeswoman Vanja Bruvoll said. Snoop Dogg, who has a license to use medical marijuana in his home state of California, was charged with pot possession after border agents searched his tour bus on a West Texas highway in January. Snoop Dogg quickly settled with Norwegian customs officials who found that he was carrying marijuana as he entered Norway on Thursday, a police spokeswoman said. He is in Norway to perform Thursday night at the Hove Festival, according to his website. He later paid a fine to settle that case, the county prosecutor said Thursday.
