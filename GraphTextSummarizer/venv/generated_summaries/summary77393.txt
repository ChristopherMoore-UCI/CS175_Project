Read remarks made Friday by president, Arizona governor Is federal immigration legislation coming? State laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Democrats tell CNN that if they don't get Republican commitments soon, they likely will push to move a bill without GOP support. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is the only GOP senator on board, but he has told Democrats they will lose his support unless they find another Republican.
