U.S. President Barack Obama meets with Chinese President Hu Jintao in London on April 1. "This is a summit of symbolism, where the meeting itself is the message," said China analyst Victor Gao. Gao said: "It shows that the defects in using the U.S. dollar as the main reserve currency in the world are becoming more and more obvious, and more countries in the world are becoming more and more unhappy with the United States in its irresponsible way of handling its financial and budgetary matters, often at the expense of other countries." For years, China has exported far more than it has imported, racking up a huge trade surplus and accumulating nearly US$2 trillion in foreign currency reserves. The global economic crisis has shown just how codependent the U.S. has become with China.
