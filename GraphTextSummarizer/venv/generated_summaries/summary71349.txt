"I have since learned from friends and investigators that Tricianne Taylor has attempted to borrow money as Ms. John Witherspoon," her affidavit said. Witherspoon, who said she speaks to her husband of 42 years "many times per week," learned through a Nashville newspaper announcement last month that John Witherspoon married "a woman named Tricianne Taylor" on January 14, the annulment petition said. The court filing claims that Tricianne Taylor, also known as Patricia Taylor, is aware that he is still married because the first wife told her on April 30. The first Mrs. Witherspoon has a harsh assessment of Taylor. CNN has been unable to contact John Witherspoon or Taylor for comment.
