Following a January congressional hearing about airport employee screening, the Atlanta airport's general manager, Miguel Southwell, said he wanted to move toward full screening. "There's a phased-in approach to get to full employee screening," airport spokesman Reese McCranie said. A CNN investigation found that only two major airports in the United States -- Miami and Orlando -- conduct full employee screening, requiring all employees with secure access to pass through metal detectors. The world's busiest airport has started screening employee bags before allowing workers into secure areas and shutting down access doors to the airfield in the wake of a gun-smuggling operation, CNN has confirmed. In addition, after a CNN inquiry, airport officials closed one access point to the ramp used by Delta Air Lines employees arriving for work on the lower level of the airport.
