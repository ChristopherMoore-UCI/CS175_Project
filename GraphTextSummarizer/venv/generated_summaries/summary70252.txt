The appropriation of Paul Walker The memorial, loosely organized through Facebook pages and Southern California car clubs, was not sanctioned by the families of Walker or Rodas. Fans were already waiting with flowers that piled up and candles that burned on the roadside where Walker and Rodas died. Many of them drove by in souped-up cars fit to be used in Walker's "Fast & Furious" street race scenes, but others parked blocks away and walked to the business park about 30 miles north of Hollywood where eight days earlier Walker and Roger Rodas died in a fiery car crash. -- Paul Walker fans came by the thousands Sunday to mourn for the actor at the site where he and a friend died last weekend. On the day of the crash, Walker was attending a holiday toy donation event for his charity, Reach Out WorldWide, when he hopped into the car with Rodas for a ride, witnesses said.
