If you didn't know that Perry Farrell, Dave Navarro and Stephen Perkins were members of Jane's Addiction, you might think they belonged to three different bands -- and Farrell is the first to admit it. The band members discussed their reunion and new album and how they've avoid fistfights for nearly two decades: CNN: How does it feel to have Jane's Addiction back together again? Perry Farrell: I love performing with Jane's Addiction. Navarro: When Jane's Addiction got started, it was the '80s, and there weren't cell phones, and there weren't people chasing people down the street with cameras, and there wasn't the Internet, and there wasn't cable news the way it is now. "I'm not really sure how many times we've parted ways," said Navarro, the group's guitarist.
