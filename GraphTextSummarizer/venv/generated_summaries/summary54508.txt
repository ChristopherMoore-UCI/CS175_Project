Los Angeles authorities said Friday that they had arrested three people for an attack this spring outside Dodgers Stadium, adding that the man they'd arrested exactly two months ago and described as the "primary aggressor" was not responsible. Los Angeles authorities announced then that they had arrested Giovanni Ramirez, 31, because they believed he was the "primary aggressor" in the attack. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told reporters Friday that charges against the woman -- whom he called 31-year-old Dorene Sanchez -- are pending. He struggles to recover as investigators continued to wrestle with a case that's drawn intense public attention. Bryan Stow, the man they allegedly attacked, meanwhile remains hospitalized in a San Francisco hospital, recovering from extensive brain and other trauma.
