As if creating that piece of Arctic history wasn't a thrilling enough prospect, the encounters the journey threw up -- from rescuing a fellow explorer (and his dog) from an ice choke, to stumbling across the possible remains of legendary Arctic explorer Captain Franklin -- made the expedition truly unforgettable. Whilst raising awareness about the effects of global warming and fundraising for charity, we hoped we were also able to promote the role of businesses in reversing -- or at least slowing down -- the global warming process. During a grueling 14-day expedition through the ice-strewn Arctic, our seven-man team faced challenges that not even the intense training we went through beforehand could prepare us for. Perhaps the most frequent emotion I felt, however, was amazement at seeing up close the reason that brought me to the Arctic in the first place. It is now almost unanimously acknowledged that industrial development and rapid population growth has modified the environment in which we live, and some of the changes in global climatic conditions are already obvious.
