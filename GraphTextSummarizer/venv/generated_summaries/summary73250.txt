Reading to reporters from a statement, Jeremy Jarvis -- whose older brother has been charged in the incident -- said that victim Michael Brewer is in his prayers. The extent of Jeremy Jarvis' involvement remains under investigation, Melnick said, adding that police took a statement from Brewer on Monday. He said Brewer is a close friend of Jeremy Jarvis, and the boy is troubled by Brewer's injury as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted. Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, also 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.
