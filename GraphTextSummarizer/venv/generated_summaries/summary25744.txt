-- A former New York Police Department officer is in custody and faces hate crime charges in connection to a string of anti-Semitic vandalism in Brooklyn, according to authorities. Michael Setiawan, who resigned from the department in 2007, was arrested Sunday after anti-Semitic graffiti was discovered Saturday evening in the Borough Park area of Brooklyn. New York City Councilman David Greenfield, D-Brooklyn, said the phrases were obscene and some swastikas were drawn. Setiawan, 36, is charged with 19 counts each of criminal mischief as a hate crime, aggravated harassment as a hate crime and criminal mischief. Police would not detail the specific wording of the messages, but said that the graffiti was anti-Semitic.
