Among the bigger controversies were allegations that PRI campaigners passed out hundreds of supermarket gift cards in exchange for votes. The electoral tribunal said that the coalition could prove only that PRI officials gave the cards to supporters, and not to the general public in exchange for votes. Leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has not conceded the July 1 election, citing allegations of electoral fraud by the victorious Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI. As such, I will not recognize the illegitimate power that came from vote-buying and other grave violations of the constitution and the laws," Lopez Obrador said. When the allegations surfaced immediately after the vote, election officials recounted the votes in more than half of the ballot boxes individually.
