The chief monitor for the OSCE mission in Ukraine, Ambassador Ertugrul Apakan, condemned the shelling of densely populated civilian areas in eastern Ukraine. The talks in Belarus' capital, Minsk, ended "with no signature" on any proposals "after a couple of hours (of) discussions" relating to the bitter conflict that has killed thousands of people in eastern Ukraine, the diplomat said on condition of anonymity. The talks, which came on a week when fighting escalated in eastern Ukraine, had been expected to start Friday but were delayed. Debaltseve, northeast of Donetsk city, has been the scene of fierce fighting in recent days as separatist forces seek to surround Ukrainian troops. At the meeting were representatives of the Ukrainian government, Russian government and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, as well as representatives of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, Denis Pushilin and Vladislav Deinego, according to Ukraine's national news agency, Ukrinform.
