-- U.S. officials are downplaying any imminent threat of a North Korean missile strike or confrontation between the two countries at sea. The U.S. intelligence community does not believe North Korea intends to launch a long-range missile in the near future, a U.S. intelligence official told CNN, despite reports in Japanese media citing intelligence that the North Korean regime intends to fire a missile toward Hawaii on July 4. The ship departed North Korea last week and is currently headed south toward Myanmar, U.S. officials believe. A U.S. official says North Korean leader Kim Jong Il seems to be "testing the new administration." The North Korean government issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a "military firing exercise," according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN.
