His attorney, David Kenner, said Knight felt remorseful about the death of former rap record label owner Terry Carter and injuries to Cle "Bone" Sloan, both of whom he considers longtime friends. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac Shakur. And in August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006.
