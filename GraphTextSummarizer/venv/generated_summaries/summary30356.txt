Croatia was fined 80,000 Euros on Monday after Italy striker Mario Balotelli was racially abused by fans during a previous match. UEFA cited the "improper conduct of supporters (display of racist banners and symbols)" by Croatia fans during the game in Gdansk on Monday. Wednesday's Uefa statement read: "Uefa has today opened disciplinary proceedings against the Croatian Football Federation (HNS) for the setting-off and throwing of fireworks, and the improper conduct of supporters (display of racist banners and symbols) at the EURO 2012 Group C match against Spain in Gdansk on Monday. The issue of racism has threatened to mar Euro 2012, which is being co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine. The fine related to an attempted pitch invasion by English supporters after England won the match in Kiev, Ukraine.
