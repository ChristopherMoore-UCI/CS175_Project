-- A Web site that encourages girls as young as seven to give virtual dolls breast implants and put them on crash diets has caused concern among parents and children's activists. Parents' groups are horrified that the game is taking off in Britain, fearing it could send the wrong message about eating disorders and plastic surgery to young girls Bill Hibberd, of parents' rights group Parentkind, told the Times the game sends a dangerous message to young girls. The provocatively named "Miss Bimbo" Web site launched in the UK last month and is described as a "virtual fashion game for girls." Girls are encouraged to compete against each other to become the "hottest, coolest, most famous bimbo in the whole world. He added: "The breast operations are just one part of the game and we are not encouraging young girls to have them, just reflecting real life." The site says: "Bimbo dollars is 'the cabbage,' 'bread,' the 'mula' you'll need to buy nice things and to get by in bimbo world.
