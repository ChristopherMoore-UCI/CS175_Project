At a news conference in New York, Coast Guard investigators said that in both cases the callers reported their boats were sinking and used similar key words and phrases, leading authorities to believe the calls could have come from the same individual. There were 60 reported hoax calls in the New York region in 2011, but since 2004 only four people have been convicted for making false distress claims. More than 100 calls have come in to a tip line, Coast Guard Investigative Service Special Agent Michael Donnelly told reporters Wednesday. -- A hoax mayday call that launched a massive search off the coast of New Jersey last week may be linked to a similar call made last month nearly 1,500 miles away off Texas, authorities said Wednesday. But a Houston television reporter alerted the Coast Guard's New York office to similarities in the two cases, and that led authorities to take a closer look.
