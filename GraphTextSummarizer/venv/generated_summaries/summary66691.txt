Its decision to lay off the 500-person "Guitar Hero" division was, Activision said in a press release today, "due to continued declines in the music genre." There are just too many games competing in the genre ("Band Hero" and "DJ Hero," anyone?), with too many pricey controllers. Considering many of the controllers do not play nice with similar games, that's a lot of dough to drop on pretend jamming. Activision, beset by falling sales, has decided to shutter the division that created "Guitar Hero" and its sequels. The dynamics of the game changed little from one title to the next, despite the introduction of innovations such as a touch-sensitive slide bar on later guitar controllers.
