Contador leads Liquigas star Nibali by three minutes 20 seconds with Euskatel's Anton rewarded for his bold ride by moving into third place, just a second behind. Nibali, who went on to claim victory in Spain for his first win in a major tour, bravely battled to stay with the all-conquering Contador, but in the closing kilometre lost valuable time. But Anton, who started the day seventh on overall classification, took advantage to ride clear for his first grand tour win since crashing out while leading the Tour of Spain last year. The stage from Lienz in Austria had originally been scheduled for 210km but was shortened on Friday when race organizers bowed to pressure from the teams to remove Monte Crostis, with its steep and narrow 15km descent, from the route. -- Spaniard Igor Anton claimed the most prestigious win of his cycling career as he took the 14th stage of the Giro d'Italia Saturday which finished on the feared Monte Zoncolan climb.
