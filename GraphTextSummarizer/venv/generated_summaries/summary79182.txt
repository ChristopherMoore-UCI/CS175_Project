I think if he catches Nani then he's got a problem." Scholes in shock return as Man Utd beat FA Cup holders Man City City's appeal will be heard ahead of Wednesday's first leg of the English League Cup semifinal against Liverpool. His absence would be a blow to City's hopes of winning a first league title since 1968, with the league leaders already lacking central defensive cover as Kolo Toure is away at the African Cup of Nations along with his brother, key midfielder Yaya. That could mean a recall for 21-year-old Dedryck Boyata, who is on loan at Premier League strugglers Bolton, or Nedum Onuoha -- who had been expected to leave in the January transfer window as Mancini seeks to free up funds to make new signings. If it fails, Kompany will miss that home match, the second leg and Premier League games against Wigan and third-placed Tottenham due to it being his second red card this season. City manager Mancini has officially appealed against Chris Foy's decision to dismiss Kompany in the 12th minute of the 3-2 home defeat that ended his side's English FA Cup title defense at the first hurdle, and blamed Rooney for influencing the referee.
