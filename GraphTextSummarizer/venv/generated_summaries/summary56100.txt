-- Brazil's image as host of next year's FIFA World Cup took a hit Sunday when police fired tear gas at fans of rival football teams during a deciding league match in Santa Catarina state. "Because of the high risk of fights and confrontations on the road and in regards to the high number of fans from rival teams coming to the last round of games," the website said, "we will not be selling tickets to women or children." "One was taken by the helicopter, and two others were taken on an ambulance," he told SporTV, a sister network of CNN affiliate TV Globo. Photos from the stadium show emergency workers carrying bloodied fans on stretchers. Security forces fired tear gas into the crowd.
