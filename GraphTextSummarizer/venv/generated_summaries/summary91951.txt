"Breaking: one click to see Instagram photo now requires two clicks," wrote TechCrunch columnist MG Siegler on Twitter. Images from Instagram, the photo-sharing app that lets user spruce up their work with a slate of arty and retro filters, no longer show up on Twitter, a popular place to share them.
