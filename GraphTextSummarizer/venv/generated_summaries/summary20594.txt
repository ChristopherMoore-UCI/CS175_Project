The radio show comments were not the first time Imam Rauf has said troubling things or been associated with troubling activities. Now Imam Rauf wants to build and lead a $100 million, 13-story community center and mosque. Yet Imam Rauf, after being asked this simple, straightforward question, refused to state whether or not he believed Hamas to be a terrorist organization. In June, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the man behind the proposed ground zero mosque, was asked on live radio if he believed Hamas is a terrorist organization. Governments all over the world, including the United States and the European Union, rightfully consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization that willfully and indiscriminately targets innocent civilians.
