"Quite honestly, you know, look, I'm sorry, having been on both sides of this where people allege that you do something, it doesn't matter now," Goldberg said after the "View" panel discussed the allegations of Cosby accuser Barbara Bowman. "you sorry porch monkey deserve everything you get...you gonna stand up for this b*tch and and not a man like Mr. Cosby," he wrote on November 22 in response to a person criticizing Cosby. The stories of Cosby's purported crimes have been around for about a decade, but in the past two months, they've received new life, stoked particularly by a routine by comedian Hannibal Buress that went viral and a social media stunt that went awry. "The public impression made by Cosby's continuous PR blunders, compounded by the parade of accusers giving detailed accounts, it's certainly created an image that I believe is beyond character endorsements by celebrity personalities," he said. Cosby also received support from comedian Faizon Love, though Love's tweets have been more inflammatory.
