Along with other projects from fellow engineers, Boiles and De Beule dubbed their creative corner of Yelp headquarters Darwin Aerospace -- named after CEO Jeremy Stoppelman's dog, Darwin, who is frequently found wandering Yelp's offices. Yelp provides resources such as 3-D printers, tons of tools and lots of space -- a commodity in dense San Francisco -- to keep their workers inspired. "The plane can totally fly itself," says former Yelp engineer John Boiles, "But these are nice to have as a backup." The bomber's engineers used a 3-D printer to create their own custom-made parts to allow for burrito storage and deployment, and added a fully remote controlled camera and transmitter to stream live video back down to the ground during flight. Step one for takeoff includes Boiles and De Beule running through a checklist to ensure everything is operating properly.
