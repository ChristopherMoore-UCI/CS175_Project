The way Kozerski presented her journey is "revealing in every way," said body image expert Robyn Silverman. The words Kozerski uses to describe her body -- like "ruins" -- still serve as "a reminder of the feeling of worthlessness, not being good enough" and how she and others who are overweight or obese struggle with these character labels, said Silverman, author of "Good Girls Don't Get Fat." She came from a family with a history of weight problems and grew up on fast food. As she shed weight, Kozerski chose her project for her photography class. Kozerski had the classic grass-is-greener mentality that everything would be fine after she lost weight.
