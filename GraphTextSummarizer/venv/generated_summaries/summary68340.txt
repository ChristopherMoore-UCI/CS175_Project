, retired Gen. Michael Hayden Speaking to CNN's Jim Sciutto on "Fareed Zakaria GPS," Hayden said he expects ISIS to attempt an attack on targets in the United States or Europe. An ISIS attack against the West is a question of timing -- "not of inevitably, not of intent," according to the former head of the CIA Hayden said that American airstrikes inside Syria, in addition to those being conducted in Iraq, would make a difference in the fight against ISIS. The majority of the strikes have been in support of Iraqi forces near the dam, which briefly fell under ISIS control. That mission has appeared to have been broadened -- strikes continued to hit ISIS targets near Irbil and the Mosul Dam on Sunday, U.S. Central Command said in a news release.
