Federal authorities will investigate allegations of deputies working alongside city officials, Perez said. Deputies from sheriff stations in those two communities also allegedly conducted warrantless searches of African-American families' homes under the auspices of a housing authority compliance inspection, and housing authority investigators based at the two stations allegedly accompanied deputies during the compliance checks, federal officials said. Justice Department officials will also look at whether leaders in the two communities "adopted a policy or practice designed to drive certain residents out of the community," Perez said. " Sheriff Leroy D. Baca appeared at the news conference Friday with Perez in downtown Los Angeles and said his department is cooperating with the investigation. Sometimes, the deputies allegedly approached the home of a recipient of what is known as Section 8 subsidies "with guns drawn and in full SWAT armor," conducted searches and asked questions unrelated to housing programs, Justice Department officials said.
