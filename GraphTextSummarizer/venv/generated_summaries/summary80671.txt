-- "Saturday Night Live" writer-performer Seth Meyers will take over NBC's "Late Night" show next year when current host Jimmy Fallon moves to "The Tonight Show," NBC announced Sunday. How Twitter helped Fallon get Leno's job Meyers, 39, would be the fourth comedian to host "Late Night" since it went on the air in 1982, starting with David Letterman and followed by Conan O'Brien and Fallon. No premiere date has been announced, but NBC has said Leno's exit and Fallon's debut will coincide with the Winter Olympics coverage in 2014. He was also named executive producer of "The Tonight Show" earlier this year when the network announced Fallon would replace Jay Leno. SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels will also be the executive producer of "Late Night with Seth Meyers."
