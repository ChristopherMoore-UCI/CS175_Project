The cover of the latest edition features a cartoon of a tearful Prophet Mohammed holding a banner that says "Je Suis Charlie" -- a message of support for those killed that spread from social media to the streets of Europe last week -- and a headline that declared "All is forgiven." As shops ran out of copies, Charlie Hebdo columnist Patrick Pelloux wrote on Twitter, "Thank you, and rest assured we will reprint and redistribute." The Charlie Hebdo app features the so-called "survivors' issue" of the satirical magazine, which sold out within minutes in France and across Europe this week. Twelve people, including several of France's most famous cartoonists, were massacred at Charlie Hebdo's Paris office last week by gunmen who claimed the attack was retribution for the magazine's notorious cartoon caricatures of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger -- who survived last week's deadly attack -- defended the magazine at the time, saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence.
