-- Visitors shuttle in and out of a state-of-the-art hospital in an Indonesian town once devastated by towering tsunami waves five years ago, while in nearby Thailand backpackers dance to music in bars and tourists lodge in a hotel that had been demolished in the Boxing Day disaster. Many people across the region will mark the anniversary with prayers, a moment of silence, sprinkling water on mass graves in Indonesia and offering food to monks in Thailand, among other memorials as people in the region try to move forward. Back in Indonesia, some of the housing built for survivors remains empty due to poor construction that in some cases does not include drinking water or protect against the torrential rains. " Warqa Helmi, of the BKRA, acknowledged that in some cases standards were not met but said the overall quality of new homes was good and corruption has been kept to a minimum. This is the essence of this 'build back better' concept, to have people involved in the reconstruction," said Hakan Bjorkman, Indonesia country director for the United Nations Development Programme.
