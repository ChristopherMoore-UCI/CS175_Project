That was among the first things amateur pilot Brian Thomas wondered after he awoke from surgery in 2009. The same day he passed his test, Thomas was soaring high above Nebraska after dark. A blog post by amateur pilot and journalist Miles O'Brien revealed this week that the former CNN anchor was also the victim of a medical condition that required amputation. When he awoke, doctors told Thomas he would probably face amputations. "It'll take some time for him to adapt, but he'll be back in it in no time," Thomas said Wednesday from his workplace in Lincoln, Nebraska.
