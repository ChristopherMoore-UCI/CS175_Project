Later this year, an Arkansas Supreme Court judge will determine if Echols and the rest of the West Memphis Three should have their convictions thrown out. Echols is also married to a woman who left her job and life behind to fight for him in Arkansas. Echols' attorneys plan to present DNA evidence not available at the time of the trial, as well as testimony that they say supports arguments that Echols and the two others are innocent. They became known as the "West Memphis Three," probably the most feared and hated kids to ever walk into an Arkansas courtroom. The investigation, arrests and trials fueled the outrage, producing nightly reports of grisly details and shocking headlines.
