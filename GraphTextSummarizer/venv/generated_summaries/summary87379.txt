After pondering how essential fashion journalism is, against the wishes of my family I flew out to Islamabad in January with the director William Fairman to document an event so incongruous with the Pakistan we see on the news, people thought we'd made it up. When people talk about fashion week, they are usually referring to London, Paris, New York and Milan. One woman told me she thought that fashion, not drones, was the answer to Pakistan's problems. More than serving as a platform for the textile industry and an attempt at improving Pakistan's world image, the Fashion Week was predominantly just something for people to do, a distraction from the adversity of daily life there. Social events such as these are few and far between in Pakistan.
