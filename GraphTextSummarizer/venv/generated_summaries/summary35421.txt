Despite the concerns, only one-third of those polled favor increasing the tax on gas to pay for bridge inspections and repairs. Congressman James Oberstar, D-Minnesota, on Wednesday said he would introduce legislation for bridge repair funding and increased inspections. In an effect called BIMBY -- "Better In My Back Yard" -- that is common in polling, CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said people often feel that situations locally are better than the national averages. "With the price of gasoline hovering around $3, it may not be surprising that Americans don't want to pay any more at the pump, even though they worry about bridge safety." The federal program to inspect and repair bridges is funded mostly by the federal tax on gasoline.
