Meanwhile, Ouattara is willing to add Gbagbo supporters to his Cabinet, provided the incumbent steps down, Ivory Coast's ambassador to the United Nations said this week. But in a telephone interview Tuesday, Gbagbo spokesman Ahoua Don Melo rejected the idea, saying Ouattara "should first go to the Constitutional Council to get recognized as the president before making any proposal." U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq could not confirm any such offer from the Ouattara government and said that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon still calls for Gbagbo to step down in an orderly transition. U.N. Security Council members have also "strongly condemned and demanded an immediate halt" to media efforts to "propagate false information to incite hatred and violence," and condemned the ongoing blockade around the Golf Hotel. Ouattara remains in the Golf Hotel under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers.
