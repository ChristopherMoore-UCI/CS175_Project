"Earthquakes are going to be a normal part of everyday life in Oklahoma," CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. There were no reports of damage or major injury on Saturday, Oklahoma City news station News9 reported. Wastewater injection could be behind the increase in the number of quakes recorded in Oklahoma, USGS geophysicist Rob Williams told CNN. As of last month, Oklahoma had surpassed California in the number of earthquakes. The Oklahoma quakes were strong enough to knock dishes off shelves and cause cracks in foundations but not enough to knock down buildings, Myers said.
