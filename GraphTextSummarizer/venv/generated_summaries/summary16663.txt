Unlike horror depicted on television and the big screen, in horror literature for young adults, subtlety is key, rather than shock value, author and horror expert Jonathan Maberry said. The new "Fear Street" arrives at a time many consider to be a renaissance of young adult horror. Horror is defined by what scares you, "and that's very personal and different for each person," said Scully, who reviews young adult horror in HWA's 'Scary Out There' blog. Popular shows such as "The Walking Dead" and "American Horror Story" helped revive interest in horror literature, said Catherine Scully, young adult editor for the Horror Writers Association. Along with Stine, a new class of authors is attempting to redefine young adult horror for the "Saw" generation, which can easily find graphic depictions of violence on TV and in movies and video games.
