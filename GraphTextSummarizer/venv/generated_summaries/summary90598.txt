-- Three men have come forward to say they were sexually abused by convicted former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky as early as the 1970s, sources close to the case told a Pennsylvania newspaper. Penn State review recasts story of football hero Paterno CNN's Julia Greenberg contributed to this report. The grand jury investigation that led to Sandusky's November arrest is still meeting and could be hearing from more potential victims, but the Pennsylvania attorney general's office has not said if more charges will be filed. The woman who stood up to Joe Paterno Lt. Mark Argiro of the State College Police Department said that he is "unaware of any investigations" of new allegations towards Sandusky, while Sandusky's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment from CNN. Their allegations are the first to accuse Sandusky of molesting boys before the 1990s, when the cases prosecutors brought against him took place.
