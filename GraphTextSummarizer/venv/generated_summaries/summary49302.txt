Dying patients denied drugs Traditionally, drug companies have not been allowed to treat so-called "compassionate use" patients such as Josh as study subjects, so helping them out has been pure charity work on behalf of the drug company. " Josh was in critical condition and near death in March when the drug company Chimerix denied him the use of its drug brincidofovir. A few days later, following reports by CNN and intense pressure from social media, Chimerix reversed course and allowed Josh and other patients like him to become part of its clinical trials. -- Josh Hardy, the 7-year-old boy whose parents fought to get him an experimental antiviral drug, is recovering well -- sitting up on his own and even taking a few steps with the help of a walker and his parents' supportive arms. Before receiving brincidofovir, an adenovirus was ravaging Josh's immune system, left vulnerable by treatment for cancer, and the only available antiviral drug to treat it wasn't working.
