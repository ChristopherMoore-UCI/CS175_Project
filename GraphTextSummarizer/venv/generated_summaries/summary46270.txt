"It's really a big present for the Sumatran rhino breeding efforts as we know that this is a very rare species which have some difficulties in their reproduction," Masyhud, a forestry ministry spokesman, told reporters, in quotes carried by Agence France Presse. Indonesia celebrated a unique birth this weekend in the form of a baby Sumatran rhino -- only the fifth known to have been born in captivity ever. The rare arrival took place at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra province, making Indonesia the third country to have successfully bred the species in captivity. Aside from a dozen or so in Malaysia's Sabah province, the Sumatran rhinos reside in three national parks in Indonesia. The father of Indonesia's newborn calf is actually one of three Sumatran Rhinos bred in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in the United States.
