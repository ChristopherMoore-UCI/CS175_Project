-- You'll have to be doggedly clever to unlock Mike Linden's new iPhone 5S. Linden, 23, was fooling around with the fingerprint sensor on the iPhone he purchased Friday morning. But though he's been tickled by the finger (paw?) print sensor, Linden's not too pleased with the particular phone he bought. Linden, a musician in Burnsville, Minnesota, is an Apple fan: He was in line at Minnesota's Mall of America at 4:45 a.m. to be among the first to get the new iPhone. The phone has a fingerprint sensor in its Home button for added security. Linden told CNN iReport.
