-- Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka has joined the growing list of injury casualties at the WTA Rogers Cup tournament in Toronto. Azarenka's withdrawal has meant she will be replaced in the draw by former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki, with the Dane given a first round bye. "I'm so disappointed that I can't make it to Toronto as I added it to my schedule knowing what an important event it is," Azarenka said in a statement. It will leave both of them short of match practice on hard courts ahead of the final grand slam of the season at Flushing Meadows for the U.S. Open. First day action saw Germany's Florian Meyer beat Australia's Bernard Tomic 5-7 6-3 6-3 in a match between up and coming stars of the circuit.
