ICE officials did not identify the six other countries where victims were identified or where some of the arrests were made, citing the need to work discreetly with international law enforcement partners. The agency said that during the course of Operation Sunflower, law enforcement officers identified 123 victims of child exploitation and removed 44 of those children from their alleged abusers with whom they were living. Although the girl may now be an adult, ICE officials want to identify and prosecute the suspects and prevent them from harming new victims. The other cases involved victims who were exploited by people outside their homes or children who were harmed years ago and are now adults. An international operation led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement aimed at child pornography and sexual abuse has resulted in the arrest of 245 suspects, officials announced Thursday.
