The fact that investors pulled out is "a sign of health rather than a sign of worry," said Jesper Koll, Director of Japan Equity Research at JPMorgan in Tokyo. "Such conduct of monetary policy will support the positive movements in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a rise in inflation expectations, and lead Japan's economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years," the bank said in its policy statement. "We think they (corporate profits) are going to rise by about 50% over the next twelve months," said Koll, who also forecasts Japan's Topix -- considered more representative of Japan's stock markets -- will climb to 1,400 by the end of 2013 -- a rise of nearly 17%. During those years of deflation and up through Abe's election to the premiership in December 2012, Japan had a fiscal policy of "musaku" or "no policy" -- "all talk but no action," explained JPMorgan's Koll. "This looks like the selloff that so many on the sidelines have been waiting for," said Nicholas Smith, CLSA's Japan Strategist in Tokyo.
