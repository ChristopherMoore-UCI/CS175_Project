The co-founder of Twitter and chief executive officer of Square met with CNN's Maggie Lake to share his vision on how mobile payments will change the world of commerce. Dorsey is criss-crossing North America to promote Square and talk to small business owners, whom he sees as key to reinvigorating economic growth. However, Dorsey said Square is an "entirely new canvas," dealing as it does with commerce rather than communication. " Square is competing in a jammed arena -- mobile payments already exist via Paypal and others -- but Dorsey told CNN its pitch is different. Square, which enables the virtual exchange of cash and goods, is designed to "give time back to our sellers, give time back to our merchants, so they can really focus on building their business up," Dorsey told CNN.
