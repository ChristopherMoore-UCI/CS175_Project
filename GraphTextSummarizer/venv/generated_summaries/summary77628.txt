President Bush needs to stop the back and forth taking place and order New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco, certain members of Congress, Powell, and other leaders to come to Camp David, sit down, come up with a workable plan, and get it going. In fact, Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Mississippi, says he is having to use persuasive powers -- as opposed to having the statutory power -- to make it a reality. Bush said he was going to appoint a czar over the Gulf Coast, and he often refers to Don Powell as being that guy, but he doesn't have the power. The only thing that is going to move this ball along is forceful leadership.
