A married couple from Brooklyn Heights has adopted the four-month-old kittens, Arthur and August, who were previously being cared for at an animal foster home, according to Richard Gentles, spokesman for Animal Care & Control of NYC. According to the Animal Care & Control of NYC, Arthur, a tabby, and August, who has a solid black coat, are arguably the most famous kittens in New York City history, although not much is known about their origins. " Animal Care & Control of NYC received a lot of inquiries and applications from people to adopt the cats, Gentles told CNN. The famous frisky felines who fouled up traffic on the New York City subway this summer have found a forever family. According to Gentles, the kitties were sheltered for about two months before they were eligible for adoption.
