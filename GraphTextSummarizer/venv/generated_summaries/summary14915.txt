In courtroom packed with the victims' relatives and friends -- many with eyes swollen from crying -- a New York judge broke down in tears Monday as she sentenced the already-imprisoned "Dating Game Killer" to 25 years to life for the murders of two 23-year-old women in the 1970s. Alcala, 69, pleaded guilty last December to the murder of Cornelia Crilley, who was killed in New York in June 1971, and the murder of Ellen Hover, whose body was found in Westchester County in 1977. "It is my hope that the swift conclusion of these cases brings closure to the Crilley and Hover families, who have spent decades awaiting justice and now have been spared the pain of trial," Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said at a news conference following the sentencing Monday. In June 1979, Alcala beat, raped and strangled Charlotte Lamb, a 33-year-old legal secretary, in the laundry room of her El Segundo apartment complex, authorities said. "To think that smile of hers, that you were the last to see it," Stigell said directly to Alcala, who was present in court for the sentencing Monday.
