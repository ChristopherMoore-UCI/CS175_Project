The cases highlighted by Emmerson demonstrate the devastating impact of drone strikes on innocent people from all walks of life in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen; and his call for states to publicly respond to the allegations set forth only underlines the total lack of accountability which currently exists for the covert drone campaign. -- "There's a danger that something that feels easy to do and without risk to yourself, almost antiseptic to the person shooting, doesn't feel that way at the point of impact," General Stanley McChrystal, the former U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told the BBC when asked about drone strikes earlier this year. Both Yemen's Parliament and its National Dialogue -- which is mapping out the country's post-Arab Spring future -- have voted overwhelmingly against the U.S. carrying out drone strikes in the country, yet both have been ignored. But perhaps more than anything, these cases give force to the concerns voiced by General McChrystal: that the danger of the drone campaign to the U.S. and its allies is that, far from being the easy, "antiseptic" fix it may appear, it is in fact creating resentment on a massive scale, and making all of us -- whether we live in Waziristan, Wyoming or Warwickshire -- less safe. Yemen vote ignored How can the West credibly encourage Yemen down the path towards democracy and the rule of law when it ignores both in pursuing its policies inside the country?
