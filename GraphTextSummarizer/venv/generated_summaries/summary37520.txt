Croslin and Ronald Cummings were both arrested in January along with three others after allegedly selling about $3,900 worth of drugs to undercover officers, authorities said. -- Misty Croslin, the last person known to see a 5-year-old Florida girl before she was reported missing on February 9, 2009, faces a sentence of up to 210 years in prison after pleading no contest Monday to unrelated drug charges. Croslin entered no contest pleas to seven counts of trafficking prescription drugs before a Putnam County, Florida, judge, said Chris Kelly, a spokesman for the state attorney's office. At the time Haleigh Cummings went missing, Croslin was 17 and lived in the family's mobile home with her then-husband, Ronald Cummings, and the girl and her 4-year-old brother. All the counts stem from a series of incidents between around January of this year, during which Croslin allegedly sold hydrocodone to undercover officers.
