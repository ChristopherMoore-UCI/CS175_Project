-- Heavy fighting between Islamist militants and government forces in Somalia's capital has left 18 people dead and dozens wounded, medical officials said Sunday. But the government has little influence beyond Mogadishu, and Al-Shabaab controls much of southern Somalia. The African Union peacekeeping mission in Somalia said the fighting centered around attempts to destroy a network of tunnels and trenches that the jihadist movement Al-Shabaab used to move weapons and fighters around the capital. AMISOM, which supports Somalia's transitional government, said the combined forces now control about 60 percent of the city. "The discovery and closure of this tunnel is a major step forward in the stabilization effort in the city," the Ugandan-led AMISOM mission said in a statement issued Sunday.
