He will be working in a home run by the Sacred Family Foundation, Fondazione Sacra Famiglia, in Cesano Boscone outside Milan. This means he will not -- except with specific authorization -- be able to leave the northern Lombardy region, where he has his principal home, but is allowed to go to Rome from Tuesday to Thursday. He will start the sentence "in coming days," a member of his legal team told CNN.
