This year's ceremony will be led by late night host and comedian Conan O'Brien. Following their performance at the MTV Movie Awards, Eminem and Rihanna will gear up for a brief joint tour this August, when they'll co-headline tour stops in Los Angeles, New York and Detroit. Stone and her "Amazing Spider-Man" co-star Andrew Garfield are scheduled to reveal a never-before-seen clip from their May release, "The Amazing Spider-Man 2." The MTV Movie Awards will kick off Sunday at 9 p.m. ET/8 p.m. CT, and fans can still cast their vote for who should win. Prior recipients include Emma Watson and Emma Stone, the latter of whom will make an appearance by video during the ceremony.
