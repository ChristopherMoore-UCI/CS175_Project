The polls have favored a runoff for weeks now, with the No. 3 candidate Maness pulling enough votes from the right to keep Cassidy neck-and-neck with Landrieu and below the 50% threshold. Landrieu's rough fight for re-election came amid sagging approval for President Barack Obama in the state, where only 40% of Louisiana voters approved of Obama according to a CNN/ORC poll. The system gave candidates from both parties a chance to slug it out together instead of settling on a nominee in the summer like most states. The three-term incumbent even tied Obama's unpopularity in the state to racism in the South last week. The South has not always been the friendliest place for African-Americans," Landrieu told NBC News' Chuck Todd, while also citing Obama's moratorium on off-shore drilling and energy issues as the "number one" issue for why Louisianans do not like the president.
