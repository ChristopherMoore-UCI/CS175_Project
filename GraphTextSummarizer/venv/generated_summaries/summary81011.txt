Although the current government is "having successes here and there" in its fight against Boko Haram, it's not winning the war against  the terror group, says Ayo Johnson, a documentary filmmaker and analyst on African affairs. The stakes are high in this election as the nation faces intensified attacks by extremist group Boko Haram. The government has made tremendous gains on the economy, Johnson says, but those gains have  been buried under the constant threat of Boko Haram. During campaigns, he talked about growing up without shoes,  a message that resonated with average Nigerians. "Many Nigerians will not forget he was a military leader, during a dictatorship," Johnson says.
