Napoli are a point behind in third following a fine 3-0 win at 10-man Inter Saturday. Mohammed Abdellaoue scored a hat-trick for Hanover, who held on despite a late Claudio Pizarro goal for Bremen. In the other match played, Werder Bremen failed in their bid to join Bayern Munich at the top of the table as they were beaten 3-2 by Hanover. The game in Turin looked set to end in a draw until Marchisio scored three minutes from time then added a late second to seal three points which put Juve ahead of Udinese on goal scored. In injury time, Marchisio beat Christian Abbiati with a long range strike which the goalkeeper should have saved.
