If you're like most people, me included, you may have trouble running an Olympics hurdle race without pulling a muscle. The brief animation is the latest in an occasional series of interactive Google doodles commemorating special events. Google's online hurdle race coincides, of course, with track and field events this week at the London Olympics. Past doodles have let users observe a lunar eclipse, play notes on a virtual synthesizer to observe the 78th birthday of Robert Moog and elude ghosts in a playable online version of Pac-Man, the classic arcade game. No word on whether U.S. Olympians Dawn Harper or Lolo Jones had given it a try.
