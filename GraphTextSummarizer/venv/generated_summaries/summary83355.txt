Almost all of the academy's faculty and staff are civilians who are subject to shutdown furloughs, while the majority of the staffs at the other military academies are active-duty military and are not subject to furlough, according to the academy's website. -- Concerned parents of students at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York say their children were told to go on fall break several weeks early and no one knows when they'll be going back to school, thanks to the federal shutdown. The Merchant Marine transports cargo and passengers in domestic waters during peace time, and during war is an auxiliary of the U.S. Navy and can be called to transport military cargo and supplies. The Merchant Marine Academy is operated under the U.S. Department of Transportation, while those for the Air Force, Navy, Army and Coast Guard operate under the Department of Defense. Meanwhile, it's business as usual at the other four U.S. federal academies.
