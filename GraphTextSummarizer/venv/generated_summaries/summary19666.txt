Three people, including a young girl, were killed Wednesday when government forces shelled a camp for displaced residents, opposition activists said. Syria, on state-run news agency SANA, said 11 "army, law enforcement and civilian martyrs" were buried Wednesday. The Tuesday attack on the U.N. convoy took place around the same time government forces fired on a nearby funeral procession, according to opposition activists. " SANA also reported that three terrorists -- one from Libya and two from Tunisia -- "confessed that they infiltrated into Syria through the Turkish borders in order to carry out terrorist attacks in coordination with al Qaeda and militias of the so-called free army." Syria has met their call for a new government and political reforms with a brutal, violent crackdown, opposition activists say.
