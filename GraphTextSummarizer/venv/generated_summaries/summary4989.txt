The shocking video of James Foley being beheaded in Syria has set off multiple investigations into the mystery of who killed the American journalist. A day after the British ambassador to the United States said that experts in his country are close to identifying the killer, two U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN that counterterrorism experts are still unable to ID Foley's executioner. He believes the clues show the video was recorded south of the town of Raqqa in north central Syria. Martin Barry, an audio expert, told CNN it sounded like the way someone in a certain area of London would talk.
