Oil leaks have been discovered in engines on three planes, and investigations continue, Joyce added. On November 4, a Qantas flight was forced to return to Singapore's Changi Airport after one of its engines shut down and the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off above the western Indonesian island of Batam. On Monday, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce told reporters the planes will not return to service until the airline is "100 percent sure" about their safety. "The failure was confined to a specific component in the turbine area of the engine," the engine maker said. -- Rolls-Royce said Friday that the failure of a specific component of its Trent 900 engine caused an oil fire that then forced a Qantas A380 to make an emergency landing.
