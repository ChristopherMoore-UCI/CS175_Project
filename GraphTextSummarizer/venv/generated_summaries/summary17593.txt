Authorities haven't publicly discussed such an idea, but CNN affiliate WOIO -- citing multiple law enforcement sources -- said authorities are investigating the possibility of murder charges against Castro. Authorities have searched Castro's home and found no evidence of human remains. "Ariel kept everybody at a distance," said Cleveland Deputy Police Chief Ed Tomba. And when Castro and Grimilda Figueroa moved to the house on Seymour Avenue -- where the women were later discovered -- Castro wouldn't even let family members through the front door. -- A flood of details has emerged in the past 24 hours about the case of Ariel Castro and the three women police say he held for close to a decade inside his modest Cleveland home.
