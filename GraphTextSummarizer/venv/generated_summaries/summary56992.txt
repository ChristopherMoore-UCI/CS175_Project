-- Jorelys Rivera, the 7-year-old girl who was abducted and killed early this month near her north Georgia home, was buried Tuesday in a service in this town on the southern coast of Puerto Rico. Authorities have accused 20-year-old Ryan Brunn -- a maintenance worker at the complex -- of killing her. Jorelys died of blunt force trauma to the head and was stabbed and sexually assaulted, according to authorities. On Sunday, Rivera told WAPA that if authorities have evidence showing Brunn killed her daughter, he should face the death penalty. As a four-person group played traditional Puerto Rican and Christmas music, Jorelys' mother Joseline appeared calm and solemn.
