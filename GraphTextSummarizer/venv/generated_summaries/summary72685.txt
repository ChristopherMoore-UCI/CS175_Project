-- Sri Lanka's coconut development minister has banned the felling of coconut trees in an effort to increase coconut production in the face of a severe shortage. In an effort to curb a coconut black market, the Sri Lankan government last week set a ceiling retail price of 30 rupees (27 US cents) per coconut in state-owned stores, but stocks quickly sold out and then reappeared at more than double the price on the black market. Minister Jagath Pushpakumara said that over the past few years, coconut production has decreased because coconut palms are being cut down. The island counts coconuts as a dietary staple and one of its biggest exports, along with trademarked Ceylon tea and rubber. The ban requires that approval for cutting coconut trees be obtained from the provincial managers of the Coconut Development Board.
