The total count for those hurt climbed in the days after the meteor's arrival on February 15 to more than 1,500, according to RIA Novosti. The Chelyabinsk region, the hardest-hit area, asked federal authorities Monday for $16.6 million in aid, RIA Novosti said. A couple of purported pieces of Chelyabinsk meteorite were advertised for sale on the eBay online auction site Friday. Eleven children were among the patients who went home Friday morning, the state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported. Meanwhile, the first fragment of meteorite arrived in Moscow on Friday for analysis, RIA Novosti reported.
