The arrest of a suspect in that case has prompted authorities to take another look at Morton's death and several other unsolved cases of women who were murdered, raped or went missing. And it was always overshadowed by news about Harrington, who went missing six days after Morton vanished. In fact, when Morton's body was discovered, some headlines wondered if it might be that of Harrington, whose parents had been vocal from the first day about their daughter's strange disappearance from a Metallica concert at the University of Virginia campus in Charlottesville. Catherine Morton decided she had had enough of journalists after Graham's case made the news. Cassandra Morton's family has no idea whether she, Hannah Graham and Morgan Harrington are linked in some chilling way.
