One, a full-frontal nude black-and-white photograph of the singer, was taken in 1979 by celebrated American photographer Lee Friedlander for a series of nudes he was working on, said Milena Sales, a spokeswoman for the auction house. In the Newton photograph, which is in color, Madonna is wearing a short dress and black stockings with garters. -- Two photographs of Madonna set to appear in a Christie's auction next month will probably sell for at least $10,000 each, according to estimates posted on the company's Web site. Christie's will auction a nude photo of Madonna (partially shown above) taken by Lee Friedlander. The auction will take place in New York on February 12.
