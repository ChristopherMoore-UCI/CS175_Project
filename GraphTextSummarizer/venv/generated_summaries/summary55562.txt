"Many urban areas with industrial concentrations find that symbiotic activities arise spontaneously as they are economically efficient for firms even before counting environmental benefits," Chertow said. "There is good potential that we will be able to take some of the heat from the anaerobic digester and composting facility to heat our wash water," said Nick Cliffe, marketing manager for Closed Loop Recycling. So far only one tenant -- plastics recycler Closed Loop Recycling -- is on site but others are set to move in next year. This sharing of material by-products, water and energy by local industries rather than importing resources from outside is an idea which has gained momentum over the past two decades, says Marian Chertow, associate professor of industrial environmental management at Yale University. The goal, says Bradbury, is industrial symbiosis.
