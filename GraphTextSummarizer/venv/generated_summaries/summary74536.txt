His remarks came a day after his government announced it was expediting construction of 2,000 housing units in East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and suspending the transfer of Palestinian tax revenue in wake of the Palestinian Authority's successful membership bid at UNESCO, the U.N. cultural, science, and education agency. Palestinians claim the land Israel occupied in East Jerusalem and the West Bank after the 1967 war as part of a future Palestinian state. The United States said Monday that it would cut funding to UNESCO after the agency voted in support of Palestinian membership. After Monday's vote, Palestinian officials told CNN they are considering the pursuit of membership in other international groups, such as the World Health Organization. The Israeli government has also put a temporary hold on the transfer of Palestinian tax revenue collected by the Israeli government, the official said.
