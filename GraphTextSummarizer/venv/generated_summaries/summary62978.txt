Staff and tourists at Kapani Safari Lodge in Zambia were caught by surprise when a mother and baby elephant became trapped in mud. The rest of the herd initially tried to help the screaming mother and baby escape, but they were stuck too deep. -- Most conservationists would agree that you should not interfere with mother nature. Team managers from the conservation society slipped a rope around the baby and after a few attempts managed to pull her out of the muddy pit. Getting the adult elephant out of the mud was a far more challenging task -- by the time the baby had been rescued, its mother was dehydrated and exhausted.
