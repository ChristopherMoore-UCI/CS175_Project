U.S. officials have extradited and prosecuted suspects accused of killing U.S. federal agents in the past. Special Agent James "Terry" Watson, assigned to the DEA unit in Cartagena, was on temporary duty in Bogota when he died after being stabbed in a taxi cab last Thursday night, officials said. Two additional suspects who were allegedly involved in the crime remain on the loose, CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported. "We will never forget Special Agent Watson and his sacrifice, as well as all those who have given their lives for the rule of law. " Watson, 42, had been watching the last game of the NBA finals at a Bogota restaurant Thursday night and left in a taxi, a State Department spokesman said last week.
