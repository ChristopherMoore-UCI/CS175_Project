As with "Mass Effect 2," players who have saved characters will be able to import them into "Mass Effect 3," changing some dialogue (the game will have a hefty 40,000 lines) and missions to reflect actions taken in previous games. For existing players, it's mind-blowing that they've gotten to know people and characters from a given species that they can choose to wipe out in 'Mass Effect 3.' Hudson said the way the "Mass Effect" series is built allows experienced players to continue with the stories they've already worked on but also provides entry points for new players to get quickly acclimated to the tale and begin their own adventure. "At the same time, we were able to be pretty flexible in developing it mechanically so that as we started to really like certain story arcs and characters, we could build those in more and let players get more enjoyment out of playing." New players are quickly brought up to speed through some introductory missions and different dialogue from experienced characters.
