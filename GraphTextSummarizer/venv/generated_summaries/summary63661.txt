Mr. Anderson continues to believe that Mr. Morton's conviction resulted directly from a medical examiner's assessment of Christine Morton's time of death at 1:30 a.m. -- a time when Mr. Morton was indisputably at home with his wife. Regardless of the cause of the wrong result reached in the Morton trial, in light of the DNA results obtained in 2011, Mr. Anderson has consistently expressed -- and continues to express to Mr. Morton and his family -- his regret for Mr. Morton's prosecution and incorrect incarceration." In prepared remarks outside the courthouse, Anderson repeated that he wanted to "formally apologize for the system's failure to Mr. Morton and every other person who was affected by the verdict." The former prosecutor also commented that he "hopes, for the sake of all persons involved, that this resolution brings an end to the tragic situation that began with the brutal murder of Christine Morton in 1986 and that was followed by the incorrect conviction and incarceration of Michael Morton. Last month, Anderson -- Morton's prosecutor who in 2001 became a judge -- pleaded no contest to a court order to show cause for withholding exculpatory evidence.
