Skin responds beautifully to mindful touch," says Rachel Lang, an esthetician (skin care therapist), who co-founded the Face Love skin gym with massage therapist Heidi Frederick and personal trainer Kate Gyllenhaal. "Just as massage and exercise contributes to health in general, it would also be expected to contribute to skin health." Face Love Fitness, a pop-up boutique in downtown Manhattan, offers face workouts and massages to keep the skin and muscles of the face and neck healthy, looking young and feeling good. But proponents of massage say healthy, youthful skin is well-worked skin. The loss of this area contributes to decreased firmness, giving facial skin an older, tired look.
