McGuinness has admitted that he was a leader of the Provisional IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. In the late 1960s the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and largely Roman Catholic nationalists who want the North to be reunited with the rest of Ireland exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. IRA members have also killed police officers and soldiers in Northern Ireland, who serve in the queen's name. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict, but six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II arrived in Northern Ireland Tuesday for a two-day diamond jubilee visit during which she will shake hands with a former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, in a highly symbolic gesture.
