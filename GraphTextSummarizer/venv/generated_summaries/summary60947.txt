The songs are: Mama Do (Pixie Lott Cover) and Use Somebody (Kings Of Leon Cover). Radio New Zealand posted it with a note that said "In August 2009, long before she became 'Lorde', twelve-year-old Aucklander Ella Yelich-O'Connor and her band-mate Louis McDonald joined Jim Mora for a chat and to play a couple of songs live in the Radio NZ studio. -- Before she was a platinum-selling artist and Grammy winner, Lorde was a Kings of Leon fan. But five years ago, she was little Ella Yelich-O'Connor, an aspiring artist who got the opportunity to sing on her local radio station in Auckland, New Zealand. Audio has emerged of the now-17-year-old star covering the band's hit "Use Somebody."
