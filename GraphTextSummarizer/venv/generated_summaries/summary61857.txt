-- More than 30 years after six-year-old Etan Patz disappeared in New York City on his way to the bus stop, police and federal authorities were tearing apart a Lower Manhattan basement Thursday in search of clues as to what happened to the boy who became the face of missing children in America. The boy's disappearance was thought to raise awareness of child abductions and led to new ways to search for missing children. "We're looking for human remains, clothing or other personal effects of Etan Patz," New York Police Department spokesman Paul Browne said of the current investigation. Etan was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a civil lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter, Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. Sweeney said he remembers the initial investigation into Etan's disappearance when police first knocked on his door in search of clues.
