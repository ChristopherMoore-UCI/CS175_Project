But Rae, who let some profanity slip while on stage during the reunion, reminded the crowd that she's not Mrs. Garrett. The sitcom still has plenty of fans (and the theme song can still get stuck in your head after one listen), but the stars of the series don't think "Facts of Life" would work on the air today. And the religious Whelchel, who says she wouldn't let her character lose her virginity on the show, is pretty sure "Facts of Life" could happen today ... In fact, there was just one cast member who affected life on set with an addiction problem: Rae. Nancy McKeon, who played Jo, joined Lisa Whelchel (Blair), Mindy Cohn (Natalie) and Charlotte Rae (Mrs. Garrett) at the reunion event.
