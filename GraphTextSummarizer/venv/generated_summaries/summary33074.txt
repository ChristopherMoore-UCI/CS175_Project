Legendary rider Rossi will return to former team Yamaha Factory Racing on a two-year deal at the start of the 2013 season, a move which will see him reunited with fellow title winner and rival Jorge Lorenzo. " Dovizioso finished the 2011 championship in third position and will hope for better results at Ducati than Rossi achieved -- the 33-year-old has recorded just two podium finishes in 28 races. -- The task of replacing seven-time MotoGP world champion Valentino Rossi at Ducati has been handed to his fellow Italian Andrea Dovizioso. "It is with great pleasure that I welcome Andrea, as we marshal our best efforts in confronting the MotoGP World Championship," Ducati president Gabriele Del Torchio said of the 26-year-old on MotoGP's official website. Reigning world champion Casey Stoner, third in the 2012 riders' standings, will not race this weekend after a crash in the U.S. left the Australian with a fractured bone in his right ankle and torn ligaments.
