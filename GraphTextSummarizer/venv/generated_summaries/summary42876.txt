-- Basketball Hall of Famer and former Los Angeles Clippers general manager Elgin Baylor told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" that he had arguments with Donald Sterling about his views on race. "Occasionally it might come up about players." Baylor, who lost a lawsuit alleging he was fired by the team because of his age, said Sterling never directed racist language at him. "Now they know what Donald is like, and the things I said before about Donald are absolutely true." One of those things Baylor had related was how Sterling on "many occasions" would bring women into the locker room and look at the players in the showers. The former GM, who spent 22 years directing player acquisitions, also told CNN how Sterling asked him to go out early in his career and scout playgrounds in the inner cities to see if he could find any talented players. "He would say, 'Well, that's the way I feel," Baylor said in his first national television remarks about Sterling since the scandal unfolded.
