Africa Umoja is a celebration of the evolution of South African culture through its history of music and dance. " Africa Umoja was originally conceived in 1983 as an outreach program that took displaced and impoverished South African children off the streets. With the beat of his drum, he and the cast take audiences through the evolution of their culture, highlighting multiple milestones in South African history. He says that his career with Umoja "saved" him from the potential danger that comes with street life, making him a role model for children to make something of themselves, and be grateful for their rich African history. Twala says music kept people in South Africa motivated during difficult times.
