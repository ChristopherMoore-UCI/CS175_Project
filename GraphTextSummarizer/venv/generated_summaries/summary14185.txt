Since 2008, an independent panel of experts that advises the federal government on preventive care has discouraged the use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests -- a type of blood test -- to screen for cancer in men ages 75 and up. The ongoing discussion surrounding the appropriate amount of cancer screening extends beyond prostate cancer. In 2011, the task force released draft guidelines that extended its recommendation against PSA testing to men of all ages. According to a research letter published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association, PSA testing rates in men over age 75 have remained steady since the panel released its guidelines in 2008.
