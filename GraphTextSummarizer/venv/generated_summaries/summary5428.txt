-- Rescue efforts were starting Tuesday night at a mine in northern Mexico where 14 workers were trapped after an explosion, authorities said. An explosion occurred Tuesday morning at the mine, located just outside Sabinas, Mexico, Mayor Jesus Montemayor Garza said. By Tuesday night, authorities had not determined whether the miners inside were alive. Rescuers will work all night at the mine, and Chilean experts will visit the site Wednesday to help, Mexican Labor Secretary Javier Lozano Alarcon said in a post on his Twitter account. Mexican President Felipe Calderon said federal authorities were working with state officials to coordinate the rescue effort.
