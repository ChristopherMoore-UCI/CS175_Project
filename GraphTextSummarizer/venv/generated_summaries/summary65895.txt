Campbell also faces charges of recklessly endangering another person, causing catastrophe, risking catastrophe and criminal conspiracy. According to a statement released by District Attorney Seth Williams, Campbell decided on the method of demolition. The prosecutor also announced Monday that crane operator Kary R. Roberts -- also known as Sean Benschop -- is facing an additional charge of criminal conspiracy in the case. Authorities say Griffin Campbell, 49, was overseeing a building demolition in June when a four-story wall collapsed onto an adjacent Salvation Army thrift store, killing six people and injuring 13. Campbell promised to build scaffolding to support the wall and said he would reduce its height to the roofline of the Salvation Army building, the District Attorney's Office said.
