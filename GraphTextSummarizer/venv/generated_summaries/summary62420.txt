How Germany's 'Carnival Club' is finding success Mainz, who beat Bayern Munich 2-1 last week, face Hamburg in their next Bundesliga fixture and will be hoping to create Bundesliga history by claiming their eighth straight win. Hoffenheim hit back before half time with a strike from Demba Ba, but Hungarian striker Adam Szalai restored the home side's lead two minutes into the second half. The win equals the record -- held by Kaisterslautern and Bayern Munich -- for most wins at the start of a Bundesliga season. Sunday's fixtures see Bayern Munich travel to second-placed Dortmund, bottom-placed Stuttgart host Frankfurt and fifth-placed Bayer Leverkusen take on Werder Bremen. Danish midfielder Thomas Kahlenberg gave Wolfsburg the lead after 27 minutes but Thorben Marx tied the scores with a 65th minute strike.
