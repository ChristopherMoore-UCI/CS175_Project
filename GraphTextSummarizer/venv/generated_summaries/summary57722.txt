Muntadher al-Zaidi, the man seen as a hero in some circles for throwing his shoes at then-U.S. President George W. Bush, was sentenced to three years in prison Thursday by an Iraqi court. Al-Zaidi threw his shoes at Bush during a news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in December in Baghdad. TV reporter Muntadher al-Zaidi, shown in a file photo, was jailed after throwing his shoes at President Bush. Other family members were seen crying and shouting curses about al-Maliki and Bush. Family members and journalists were cleared from the courtroom before Thursday's verdict.
