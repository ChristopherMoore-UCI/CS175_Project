Doni's teammate, Thomas Manfredini, received a three-year ban while former Italy international Giuseppe Signori was suspended for five years. Benevento had nine points deducted, Cremonese six, Piacenza four and Reggiana. The club's 38-year-old captain Cristiano Doni has also been banned for three-and-half years by the Italian Football Federation, which could effectively end his career. Marco Paoloni, a former goalkeeper for Cremonese and Benevento, was at the center of the allegations and has been handed a ban of five years. Third tier club Ravenna were expelled from the league and Alessandria have been relegated.
