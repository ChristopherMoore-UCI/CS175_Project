Randy Taylor, 48, was seen on the video and was arrested in her abduction Sunday, police told CNN affiliate WRC-TV, but Taylor's attorney, Michael Hallahan, told WVIR that Taylor was arrested because they found one of Alexis' hairs in his camper. Alexis and the unidentified man left before sundown, and that was the last Taylor saw of either of them, Hallahan told WVIR. That "guy," Alexis and Taylor all took separate cars to Taylor's camper in Lovingston, where Taylor bought $60 worth of marijuana. Another relative, Angela Taylor, described her as a "girly girl" and told WVIR that the volleyball player had just taken her senior pictures and was looking at colleges. The teen's aunt, Trina Murphy, told CNN she bought a car from a dealership where Taylor used to work, "which is really eerie."
