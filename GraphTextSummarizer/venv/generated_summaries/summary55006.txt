Five Americans who were monitored for three weeks at an Omaha, Nebraska, hospital after being exposed to Ebola in West Africa have been released, a Nebraska Medicine spokesman said in an email Wednesday. They all had contact with a colleague who was diagnosed with the disease and is being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. They were exposed to Ebola in Sierra Leone in March, but none developed the deadly virus. More than 10,000 people have died in a West African epidemic of Ebola that dates to December 2013, according to the World Health Organization. They are clinicians for Partners in Health, a Boston-based aid group.
