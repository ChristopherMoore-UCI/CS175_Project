"As football spreads across the globe with black players who are now among the best in the world, and you look at the legacy of fantastic Brazilian players like Pele and Garrincha, it really stems back to guys like Watson." It was also at a time when Scotland were very successful in international football," McBrearty said. Watson passed away in Sydney, Australia in 1902 aged 44, but McBrearty thinks the contribution he made to football has paved the way for the big-name black players we see in the game today. And it was Scotland which, in 1881, provided football with its first black international player -- British Guiana-born Andrew Watson. The Scotland team led by Watson pioneered a revolutionary passing game at a time when football was played in a very individual manner.
