Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport received permission from the Cuban government, "the final step in the approval process for launching direct flight service from New Orleans to Cuba," airport officials said in a statement Wednesday. -- An airport in New Orleans has received approval to join the ranks of U.S. airports hosting flights to and from Cuba, officials said Wednesday. " Earlier this year, the White House announced it would allow more academic, cultural and religious travel to Cuba, and would pave the way for more airports to service flights to Cuba. Previously, charter flights to Cuba flew out of airports in New York, Miami and Los Angeles. This year the U.S. government loosened restrictions, allowing the New Orleans airport and other international airports in the United States to apply to host flights to and from the island nation.
