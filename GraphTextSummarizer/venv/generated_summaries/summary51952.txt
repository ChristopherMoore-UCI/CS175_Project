Timeline, an interface that encourages users to make Facebook a kind of online scrapbook of their lives, has been optional for all accounts since December. The last time Facebook redesigned its profiles to include more photos, artists got creative, and they did it again again with Timeline. Timeline features larger "wall" photos and a huge cover photo in addition to a profile picture, and it emphasizes major life events. But among fans, the larger photos and ability to navigate events by year are some of the favorite features. Timeline has plenty of naysayers, who say they think the new layout is confusing and reveals too much personal information.
