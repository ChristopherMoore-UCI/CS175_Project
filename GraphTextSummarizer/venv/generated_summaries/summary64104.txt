"The knock-on effect of passing this bill will reach far beyond gay and lesbian people in Uganda, impeding the legitimate work of civil society, public health professionals and community leaders," said Aster van Kregten, deputy Africa director at Amnesty International. The bill also proposes years in prison for anyone who counsels or reaches out to homosexuals, a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender people. After years of controversy, the Ugandan parliament has passed a bill that punishes certain acts of homosexuality with life in prison. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. Before its passage Friday, parliament adjusted the death penalty clause to life in prison for "aggravated homosexuality."
