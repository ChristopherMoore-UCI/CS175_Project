The third-place candidate, popular musician Michel Martelly, claimed he had won more votes than Celestin and a review of results by an Organization of American States team supported that contention. She said she'll meet with all three potential candidates -- Manigat, Celestin and Martelly -- during her trip this week to Haiti, as well as with President Rene Preval. Clinton said she planned to keep up pressure on the Port-au-Prince government, headed by President Rene Preval, to honor recommendations from the Organization of American States related to who is on the ballot for its pivotal upcoming presidential runoff. Initial results put her in a runoff with Jude Celestin, a protege of the president. Shortly after the November 28 presidential elections, Haiti's electoral council announced that former first lady Mirlande Manigat had won but lacked a majority of votes for an outright victory.
