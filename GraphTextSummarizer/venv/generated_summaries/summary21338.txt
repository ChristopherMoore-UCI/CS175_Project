The defense has argued that the officers did not use excessive force and other measures had failed to subdue a combative Thomas. A second former Fullerton officer, Jay Cicinelli, was charged with involuntary manslaughter and excessive use of force. Outside the courthouse, Barnett told the press that the case had caused great harm to Southern California law enforcement, "All law enforcement has to look over their shoulders now, because they fear they can be prosecuted for doing their job." Michael Schwartz, attorney for Cicinelli, said, "We have a tragedy in this case. What followed was a struggle involving Thomas and several officers that had a badly battered Thomas pleading for mercy. The surveillance camera footage shows Thomas being beaten, clubbed, and stunned with a Taser by police.
