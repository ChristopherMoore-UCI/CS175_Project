The bride arrived for her wedding sporting a low-cut, cream-colored jumpsuit with a cape by designer Stephane Rolland. Instead of a traditional wedding party shot, Knowles commissioned an all-female portrait which shows women -- including sister Beyonce, mother Tina Knowles and singer friend Janelle Monae -- all wearing various designs in white. It was a second marriage for Knowles, who was earlier married to former college football player Daniel Smith, who is father of their son Daniel Julez, 10. Not only did Solange see Ferguson, who has directed videos for artists including his new sister-in-law and Katy Perry, but the pair rode vintage, white bikes on the streets of the French Quarter to get to their wedding ceremony which was held at the Marigny Opera House. The singer married longtime love, music video director Alan Ferguson, 51, on Sunday in her adopted city of New Orleans.
