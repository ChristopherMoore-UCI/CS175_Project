Hu listed a number of prescriptions to help China catch up, including, "Cultivate a high degree of cultural awareness and cultural self-confidence, improve the quality of the whole civilized nation, and enhance national cultural soft power." The essay was based on a speech Hu made to a meeting of party leaders in October where a broad agenda was set out to strengthen the role of Chinese culture in the country. China has a strict quota of 20 foreign films per year, but preliminary figures as of mid-December indicated that Western film franchises like "Transformers" and "Harry Potter" were likely to occupy the top four box office spots for 2011, according to state media. Fearing that the turmoil in many countries across the Middle East and North Africa would incite further unrest in its own population, the Chinese government last year "expanded restrictions on online information and access to communication services, reported government propaganda in domestic news outlets, restricted the freedom of foreign journalists, and arrested dissidents with little or no cause," according to a report published in November by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, a panel that advises the U.S. Congress. Amid the nervousness generated by that climate, Chinese leaders are worried that "the party's propaganda is no longer working," said Jeremy Goldkorn, the founder of Danwei.org, a popular English-language website about China.
