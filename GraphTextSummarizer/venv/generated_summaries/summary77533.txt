Brown is the daughter of R&B singer Bobby Brown and the late star Whitney Houston. "In an effort to do all he can to visit, Nick has repeatedly offered to meet with Mr. Brown privately to discuss his request in person, rather than through lawyers," lawyers Randall M. Kessler and Joe S. Habachy said in a statement. We hope Mr. Brown has a change of heart." Bobby Brown's attorney responded with another statement, saying Gordon has yet to tell Brown in writing what happened to his daughter. "Let me be very clear, Mr. Gordon was offered an opportunity to potentially visit Bobbi Kristina and he declined to meet the terms of any possible visit," Bobby Brown said in a statement through his lawyers. The boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown, who is fighting for her life at an Atlanta hospital, unleashed against her family Monday on Twitter, defending his actions and accusing her father of wanting her money.
