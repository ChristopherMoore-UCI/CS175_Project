A 16-year-old Norwegian soccer sensation -- Martin Odegaard -- is set for superstardom after being headhunted by Spanish giants Real Madrid. While his tender age means he will initially enter Real Madrid's B team -- coached by French great Zinedine Zidane -- it might not be too long before he's wowing the crowd at the Spanish club's Bernabeu stadium. Spanish giants Real Madrid are hoping so after swooping in for the kill. "It's an honor and a dream come true," Odegaard told the Real website as he was unveiled by the Spanish club alongside one of the Real greats Emilio Butragueno, who labeled the Norwegian as "an extraordinary talent. " "The reason I chose Real Madrid is because this team has the best conditions, both in sporting terms to develop as a player, and off the field to develop as a person," added Odegaard.
