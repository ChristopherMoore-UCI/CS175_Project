China has welcomed the EU Summit consensus, whose main elements include a 50% reduction in the value of Greek government bonds, steps recapitalize European banks and plans to attract capital for the already overburdened European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund, in order to reduce Greek debt from the current astronomical 160% of its current economy to 120% of total economic output over the next 10 years. In a phone conversation with Sarkozy on Thursday, Chinese President Hu Jintao made no mention of specific plans to invest in the scheme, but lauded Europe's progress in solving the debt crisis. -- As the dust settled after the latest agreement was struck to solve the Eurozone debt crisis, French President Nicolas Sarkozy admitted it had been a "mistake" to admit the stricken Greeks into the monetary union. China indicated that it may be in its best interest to contribute to a solution, although made no mention of specific plans to do so. Europe hopes to attract capital from sovereign wealth funds, particularly from developing nations like China and Russia, to supplement the â‚¬440 billion rescue fund, but analysts note that the structure of these investments remains unknown.
