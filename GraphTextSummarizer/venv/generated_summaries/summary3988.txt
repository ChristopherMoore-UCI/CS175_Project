Brin and his wife, Anne Wojcicki, appeared on Newsom's Current TV talk show Wednesday May 23 to discuss Project Glass and Sergey's work in the Google X labs. The Google co-founder told Newsom that Google X is now his primary focus at Google. California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom wore the specs on "The Gavin Newsom Show," and later told Wired about his brief experience with one of the world's most rarefied pieces of technology. Sergey Brin has once again hit the town with Project Glass -- but this time he let someone else wear Google's augmented reality headset. "I have some hopes to maybe get it out sometime next year," he told Newsom, "but that's still a little bit of a hope."
