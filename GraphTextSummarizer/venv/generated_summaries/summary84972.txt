Albert was approached by two members of one faction and struck in the head with a long portion of a wooden railroad tie, then punched in the face, Tandra Simonton, spokeswoman for Cook County prosecutors, has said. Albert's death prompted President Barack Obama, a longtime Chicago resident, to send Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Attorney General Eric Holder to the city to meet with school officials, the students and the community on the topic of school violence. Jurors deliberated only 30 minutes before convicting the teen of first-degree murder Wednesday in the death of Derrion Albert, CNN affiliate WGN reported. Authorities said Albert, 16, was an innocent bystander who ended up in the middle of a street fight between two factions of students from Christian Fenger Academy High School. The 15-year-old was the first of five defendants charged in Albert's death, WGN said.
