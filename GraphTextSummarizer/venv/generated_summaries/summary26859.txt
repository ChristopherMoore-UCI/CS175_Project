Departing just after sunset, the Australian Defense Vessel Ocean Shield sets out to the search zone in the southern Indian Ocean, one of the most remote places on Earth, some 1,100 miles off the coast of Western Australia. More than three weeks after MH370 is believed to have gone down in the southern Indian Ocean, no wreckage has been sighted. And the only way to do that is for search teams to find and confirm debris from the airliner, and to use computer models that can trace back currents and conditions and help pinpoint where the plane went down. Objects sighted by search aircraft and pulled from the ocean have no link to the missing airliner. The Ocean Shield finally departs just before 8pm, cloaked in darkness, only its deck lights guiding the way from Garden Island, out of Cockburn Sound, and into the Indian Ocean.
