Valencia is expected to help fill the void left by Cristiano Ronaldo following the Portuguese winger's impending 80 million euros ($130 million) move to Real Madrid. -- Manchester United have made their first signing of the summer after confirming a deal has been done for Wigan Athletic winger Antonio Valencia. Ecuador winger Valencia moves to Manchester United as a replacement for Real Madrid-bound Cristiano Ronaldo. The first Ecuadorian to play for United will make his debut for the Premier League champions on a four-match tour of Asia next month, before the Red Devils head for a four-team tournament in Munich. "I hope the fans at Wigan can understand that I am an ambitious guy and a chance like this might never come again for me," added Valencia, who will be 24 next month.
