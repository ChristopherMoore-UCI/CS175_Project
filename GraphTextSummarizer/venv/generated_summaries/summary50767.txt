Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is on track to run for President in 2016 even if Jeb Bush also jumps into the race, a source close to Rubio says. He's also been increasingly vocal on foreign policy issues -- potentially setting up a clash with leading Republican contenders like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has called for less U.S. intervention overseas. And he's working with incoming House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to craft health care legislation meant to be an alternative to Obamacare. A run for president would be a big risk for Rubio, a 43-year-old former Florida House speaker who looks like a sure bet to win a second term in the Senate in 2016. Rubio, though, would share one problem with Bush: He's championed an overhaul of U.S. immigration laws, a position that has fallen out of favor with much of the GOP base.
