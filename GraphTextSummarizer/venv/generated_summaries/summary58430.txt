The river at Minot crested at 1,561.72 feet above sea level Sunday morning, said Kinney -- below earlier predictions but still almost 4 feet above an 1881 record. Water levels had fallen to 1,561.48 feet by Sunday night, Kinney said. Many residents of Minot, who evacuated ahead of the rising water, approached the water's edge on Sunday, hoping to catch a glimpse of their homes, said CNN's Jim Spellman. "We did have a couple of close calls at the temporary dikes last night," Minot Mayor Curt Zimbelman told reporters Sunday. Minot officials told residents Saturday that tap water should be boiled for at least a minute before consuming in order to kill any dangerous organisms.
