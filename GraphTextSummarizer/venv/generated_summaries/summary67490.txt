Last year, Paul Joannides, a Cambridge art history professor, noted that a Michelangelo student had made a study of several Michelangelo sketches for works believed lost. Two Renaissance sculptures of a nude man riding a panther may have been created by Michelangelo, says a British museum. The museum and researchers at the University of Cambridge say they have "compelling evidence" that the works, attributed to a Dutch sculptor, are actually from Michelangelo. Further research indicated they were in Michelangelo's style, and X-rays roughly confirmed the era of their creation. The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge says that the bronze sculptures, known as the Rothschild Bronzes and dating from the 1500s, were probably created just after the famed artist's David and just before he painted the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.
