-- Zimbabwe's highest court Friday ordered President Robert Mugabe to ensure the African country holds elections by the end of July. The ruling was made after a former journalist with a defunct daily newspaper asked the court to order Mugabe to call for elections by end of June. Zimbabwe's parliament expires automatically on June 29 but Mugabe would have had until October 31 to hold elections. Opinion: Africa's rocky road to democracy Mugabe "is hereby ordered and directed to proclaim dates for presidential, general elections ... which elections should take place not later than 31 July 2013," he said in a packed Supreme Court chamber. A new constitution was one of the conditions set by regional leaders before fresh elections.
