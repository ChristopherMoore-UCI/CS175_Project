If you're lucky enough to be Canadian and have the name Elizabeth Gallagher, here is your itinerary: December 21: NYC to Milan December 28: Prague to Paris December 29: Paris to Bangkok January 7: Bangkok to New Delhi January 8: New Delhi to Toronto Toronto resident Jordan Axani, 28, is looking for a woman with the same name as his ex-girlfriend to take a couple of airline tickets off his hands. Axani posted on Reddit that he booked this "fairly wicked" trip in March when he and the original Elizabeth Gallagher were still together. The real question is whether it's possible for another Elizabeth Gallagher to travel under a ticket purchased for Axani's ex. Axani says he booked it on Priceline using Elizabeth's first and last name only (no middle name).
