"It's not uncommon to see several children living in a household with an elderly couple in rural China. Rutstein says the presence of street children is obvious in some cities, but it's safe to assume that many remain in rural towns, the byproduct of a huge demographic shift in China, as parents move to booming cities for work. China's aware of this and there are many efforts in place right now to professionalize the whole system of social workers, to introduce alternatives to institutionalization, or just sending children to a state orphanage, which traditionally has been the main response to these kinds of situations," he said. Users on China's social media platforms expressed shock and disgust, with some questioning how society could have allowed such young children to fall through the cracks. It's estimated there are 55 million "left behind" children in China, the sons and daughters of 200 million migrant workers who have moved to the cities for a better life.
