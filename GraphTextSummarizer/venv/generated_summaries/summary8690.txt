Most recently, police in St. Louis shot Kajieme Powell, killing him just a few miles from Ferguson, Missouri. -- In the past two weeks, police have killed at least four people with psychiatric disabilities, each of whom had a weapon. Similarly, if police will accommodate psychiatric disability by not forcing confrontation whenever possible, we will all be a lot safer. We also need police whose first instinct is to de-escalate tense situations whenever and however possible, and, when necessary, solve confrontations with the absolute minimum amount of force. Unfortunately, this runs directly against police training.
