But the result was somewhat overshadowed by the death of another Godolphin horse, Fox Hunt, in the inaugural Dubai Gold Cup, held earlier in the evening. The Mahmood Al Zarooni-trained stayer appeared to break his leg approximately 300 meters into the race, pitching his jockey, Silvestre de Sousa, to the ground in front of a packed Meydan grandstand. Fox Hunt was euthanized, while De Sousa fortunately escaped uninjured after his high speed fall. There had been more to celebrate in the World Cup itself, Barzalona cementing his reputation for exuberance by rising in his stirrups in celebration well before the finish line, echoing his win in last year's English Derby. Sheikh Mohammed himself, speaking exclusively to CNN after the race, said he felt "doubly happy" with the result, which saw the World Cup return to Godolphin hands after a six-year absence.
