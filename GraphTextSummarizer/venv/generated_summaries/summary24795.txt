Most of the clues on the "Jeopardy!" board mention proper nouns -- specific places, events, people, songs, books and so on, says Dr. Douglas Lenat, a machine learning pioneer, former Stanford professor of computer science and CEO of Cycorp, a company that develops semantic technologies. There's also been discussion of how Watson could be used in medicine to cross reference a patient's symptoms with compendiums of digitized medical journals and data -- a sort of statistical second opinion to a doctor's professional experience. Despite Watson's tremendous performance, the Final Jeopardy question at the end of Tuesday night's airing revealed the Achilles' heel that computer scientists have known all along: Watson doesn't really "think" anything, and it struggles with simple questions that most humans can answer without a second thought. " As Dave Ferrucci of IBM Research says, this points out the limitations of relying so heavily on statistical reasoning. Well humans, it's been a good ride, but after being eviscerated by IBM's supercomputer Watson on "Jeopardy!," it's probably time to pack up the truck and let the machines inherit the Earth.
