Some of the world's most famous people -- Tony Blair, Nicole Kidman, Damien Hirst, Kevin Spacey, Prince Phillip, and Malala Yousafzai among them -- have sat to have their image -- and something of their essence -- captured by him. You want to choose people you're going to find interesting company. We are interested in faces more than other things. Some things you can do without the person -- the dress and the pose you can do from the photos -- but then you try to get people back to sit for you for the face and the expression, For that bit, the photo doesn't tell the whole story: you want to see, not just how someone looks, but how a person moves and how they react to things, and if you can get those things in, that's what makes it come alive, really, and makes it more interesting than a photo. It's natural, we get so much more information about what's going on from other people's faces, expressions and reactions.
