As a private equity financier, Gomez -- in the words of the Boston Globe -- served as a director of several companies "while they took on significant debt and cut jobs or moved overseas." So to the extent that's new, it's moving in the wrong direction in the eyes of most Bay State voters. Markey will support President Obama; Gomez will oppose him. In the Senate, Democrat Ed Markey will fight alongside Massachusetts' rising star, Elizabeth Warren; Gomez would cancel her vote. Gomez will empower obstructionist Republicans like GOP leader Mitch McConnell and the tea party extremists.
