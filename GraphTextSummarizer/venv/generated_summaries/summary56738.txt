Stow was taken out of a medically induced coma over a week ago, and has since shown signs of some cognitive function, Los Angeles neurosurgeon Dr. Gabriel Zada said. On Sunday, Los Angeles authorities announced the arrest of a man that police described as the "primary aggressor" in the attack. Without the implementation of adequate security measures by the Dodgers defendants, along with inadequate lighting fixtures that have been in existence since the opening of Dodgers Stadium in 1962, Stow was inappropriately exposed to the aggressive acts of third parties," according to the suit. The suit lists Stow's parents, Elizabeth Ann Stow and David Edward Stow, as plaintiffs on behalf of his two minor children, Tyler and Tabitha Stow, according to court spokeswoman Elizabeth Diaz. The lawsuit alleges that security officers and managers at Dodger Stadium were apprised of a history of aggressive violent behavior and criminal gang activity in some crowds at the stadium, and neglected to provide reasonable safety mechanisms to protect Stow, including the failure to hire a security chief for six weeks prior to opening day.
