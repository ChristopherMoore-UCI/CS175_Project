A draft U.N. resolution on Syria obtained by CNN calls on "all states" to take steps similar to those the Arab League undertook in November when it imposed sanctions on Syrian authorities. The Syrian government blames the violence on terrorist groups and says security forces are only trying to protect civilians. The 22-member Arab League has called on the al-Assad regime to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders -- including the international news media -- to travel freely in Syria. On Wednesday, Syria's government agreed to a month's extension of the Arab League monitors' mission there. In the flashpoint city of Hama, security forces and pro-government militias assaulted neighborhoods overnight, an opposition activist group reported Wednesday.
