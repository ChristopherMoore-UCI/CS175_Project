Now, as emerging economies slow down and developed economies show new signs of growth, some may ask whether the G20 still has a role to play. As concern grows about economic troubles in emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil, we are unlikely to see a coordinated response from St. Petersburg. Emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil, South Korea and South Africa had to be brought into the mix and could no longer be treated as second-class citizens. If there were the remotest possibility of G20 agreement on Syria, it might be worth it, but there isn't. The real problem with the St. Petersburg summit, which contrary to expectations was relatively well-organized by Russia, is that the G20's global economy agenda has being taken over by the Syrian crisis.
