One bit of advice that I have clung to daily is, "Schedule, schedule, schedule!" The only way I will be successful is if I take seriously the advice to schedule. At the beginning of every week, I compare my work schedule with my training schedule. Now, in addition to everything else that I am committed to, I have to fit training for a triathlon into my life. After decades of raising three kids and taking care of other family members, my husband and I have found ourselves in a place we have never been before: one with free weekends.
