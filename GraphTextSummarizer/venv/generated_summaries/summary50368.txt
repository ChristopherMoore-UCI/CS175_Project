Between Saturday night and Sunday morning, teams in Cass County, North Dakota -- which includes Fargo -- rushed to three locations to reinforce sandbag dikes, said Capt. Despite the river peaking at 36.99 feet -- 19 feet above flood level -- Sunday morning, the region will have to contend with high water for a while. Water surrounded some homes near the river in Fargo, where 700,000 sandbags guarded the city from creeping waters. It is expected that we will stay well above major the major flood stage of 30 feet for about the next week or maybe a little bit longer." Overall, the situation in Fargo looked good, Mayor Dennis Walaker said Sunday. "It'll be about a week, so we're just going to continue to monitor things and kind of wait as that water very, very slowly goes down," said Robyn Litke, spokeswoman for Fargo, North Dakota.
