"No words are adequate to describe the impact Darrell Royal had on this state, the university, UT athletics and Texas football," Texas Athletics Director DeLoss Dodds said Wednesday. Dodds said Wednesday that the current Texas team would honor Royal during Saturday's home game against Iowa State at his namesake Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium. He compiled a 167-45-5 record at Texas from 1957 to 1976 and helped offensive coordinator Emory Bellard introduce the wishbone option offense to the Longhorns and to college football in the late 1960s. The wishbone formation, the three-running-back set that Bellard debuted on a collegiate level at Texas under Royal's guidance in 1968, helped the Longhorns go on a 30-game winning streak and spread to other colleges. -- Darrell Royal, the football coach who led the University of Texas to at least a share of three national championships in the 1960s and 1970s, died Wednesday in Austin after a battle with Alzheimer's disease.
