But the award for best attempt at Jewish outreach from a gentile governor with White House dreams goes to Wisconsin Republican Gov. Scott Walker. Perry released a statement on the first night of Hanukkah comparing the plight of the Maccabeesâ€”Jewish rebels who fought back the Seleucid Empire in the second century B.C.â€”to that of American tea partiers under British rule. -- Texas Gov. Rick Perry may not be dancing with rabbis this Hanukkah season*, but the Lone Star State's outgoing chief is still looking to find common ground with the Chosen. The son of a Baptist preacher, Walker, in an undated letter released in an August document dump but which didn't surface in the media until this December, concluded his correspondence to a constituent asking if he would light a Menorah in the state capitol for Hanukkah with the words, "Thank you again and Molotov. No matter how vast the darkness, all it takes is one candle to spread the light." Perry, who has hinted at a second run for the presidency in 2016, also used the occasion as a reminder of his support for the modern Jewish state, a must for any White House candidate.
