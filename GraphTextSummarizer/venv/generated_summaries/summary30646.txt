-- Longtime ABC News personality Barbara Walters will retire from broadcasting next year after a half-century trailblazing career, according to several media reports Thursday. ABC, where Walters has worked as a news anchor and talk show host since 1976, answered with "no comment" when CNN called about the reports quoting unnamed network sources in the New York Times and on Deadline.com. The plan is for her retirement to be announced in May, giving a year for ABC to pay tribute to her before she stops working in May 2014, Deadline.com reported. Viewers see Walters, 83, mostly these days as co-host of ABC's daytime talker "The View," which she helped create in 1997. She was promoted to co-host in 1974, but she was hired away by ABC in 1976.
