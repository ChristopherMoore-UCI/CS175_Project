" 'I defy that' Women in Egypt routinely face instances of sexual harassment -- according to a 2008 survey of 1,010 women conducted by the Egyptian Center for Women's rights, 83% of Egyptian women and 98% of foreign women have been sexually harassed. "Egyptian women undergo harassment and bullying on a daily basis." Award-winning Last week Mahmoud's inspiring work for women's rights was recognized at the prestigious Index Freedom of Expression awards. Her lyrics highlight the importance of girls' education and denounce sexual harassment of women on the streets of Egypt. Mahmoud describes how women can feel self conscious simply for walking to school or work. "These are matters that are very present in Egypt but no one is talking about them -- they are a big problem in Egyptian society," she explains.
