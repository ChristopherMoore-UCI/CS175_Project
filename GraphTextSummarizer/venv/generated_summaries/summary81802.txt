Isn't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home? What I do see in Graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents, mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence. Toya Graham raises an important point that's often missing in the discussions of how to curb violence: I don't see Graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel, or at least the inevitability, of violence. Mothers who are willing to defy the "expert" advice telling them that teenagers need the room to make mistakes; that hovering or even trying to anticipate their misbehavior only stunts their development and leads to more misbehavior.
