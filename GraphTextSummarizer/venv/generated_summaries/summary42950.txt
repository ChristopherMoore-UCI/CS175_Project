The Aviation Warrior, created by U.S. defense contractor Raytheon, was among a raft of new aircraft gadgets on display at the UK's Farnborough Airshow that appear to be adapting technology popularized by phones and tablet computer devices to fly modern jets. We're not there just yet, but aviation engineers have unveiled a semi-working prototype they say will soon allow pilots to carry cockpit technology in their flight suit. Already an advance on current in-cockpit systems, the Warrior technology will enable pilots to navigate through "brown out" conditions when dust or bad weather obscure land and hazardous buildings. Watch: Three CEOs in a cockpit Harris refuses to discuss Warrior's battery life -- an issue that blights user of many modern smart phones fitted with satellite tracking and other power-draining apps -- saying only that it meets military operational requirements. The Warrior system's wrist display uses the same "pinch-to-zoom" touch screens found on iPhones -- something its manufacturers believe will make it popular with pilots.
