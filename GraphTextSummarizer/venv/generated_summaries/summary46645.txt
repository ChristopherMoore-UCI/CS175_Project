The preliminary results of a referendum on an independent Southern Sudan will be announced in the next few days, with final results as early as February 7, the national commission that organized the vote said Tuesday, The South Sudan Referendum Commission (SSRC), which was formed last year by President Omar al-Bashir, said the preliminary results will be announced Saturday in Juba in Southern Sudan and on February 2 in Khartoum, Sudan's capital. Nevertheless, Khalil said, the referendum commission, which includes southern Sudanese and northern Sudanese members, worked easily together, "making decisions in accord. " Both the federal government of Sudan and the government of south Sudan had committed themselves to funding the referendum with 400 million Sudanese pounds (about $160 million), Khalil said, but the commission only received 26.6 million SDG in the north, and 60 million SDG in the south. The war pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in northern Sudan against black Christians or animists in the south. The commission faced three challenges during the referendum process: the legal aspect of the referendum itself, time and finances, according to commission chairman Muhammad Khalil.
