-- Authorities on Saturday identified a gunman killed by police after he opened fire at passing vehicles along a downtown street in Hollywood. Brehm fired a "significant number" of rounds, wounding three, police said. "A car drove by and he just shot right into the car," Amy Torgeson told CNN affiliate KABC. "So far we haven't been able to piece together really why he did it," Fierro told CNN Saturday evening. But they said they don't know why Tyler Brehm, 26, went on a surreal shooting rampage captured on amateur video Friday.
