The team also replaced a Science Instrument Command and Data Handling Unit, a computer that "sends commands to Hubble's science instruments and formats science data for transmission to the ground," NASA said. Hubble's "greatest discoveries," NASA says, include determining the age of the universe -- 13.7 billion years, discovering that "virtually all major galaxies have black holes at their center," and "providing evidence that the speed at which the universe is expanding is accelerating -- caused by an unknown force that makes up for more than 75 percent of the universe." NASA canceled an Atlantis mission to extend Hubble's operational life in January 2004 because the trip was considered too risky in the wake of the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster, which killed seven astronauts. " "This is a huge accomplishment," Preston Burch, Hubble Space Telescope program manager, said during a briefing. "It turned out very well," lead flight director Tony Ceccacci said during a NASA briefing.
