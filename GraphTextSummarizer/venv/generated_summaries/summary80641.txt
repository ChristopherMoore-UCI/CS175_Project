The official campaign period for the upcoming vote will be held April 2 to April 11, National Electoral Council President Tibisay Lucena said Saturday. -- Venezuela's presidential election to pick a successor to the late Hugo Chavez will be held April 14, Venezuelan state television reported Saturday. "All agreed that Henrique Capriles is the person to embody the alternative option of change, an alternative for everyone," Ramon Guillermo Aveledo, a leader in the opposition coalition, said Saturday of Capriles' nomination. His policies made him a polarizing figure in Venezuela, revered by legions even as others accused him of repressing dissenting voices and turning over once independent institutions to partisan loyalists. He steered much of Venezuela's vast oil wealth to social programs to end illiteracy, provide food for the poor and allow more people access to higher education.
