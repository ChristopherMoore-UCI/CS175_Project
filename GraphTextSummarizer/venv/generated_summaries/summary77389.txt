Harper has a bachelor of arts degree from Brown University, where he studied acting, and a masters in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government, which is a part of Harvard. "I had all this student loan debt, and I had this six-figure legal job offer in corporate law coming out of Harvard Law School. Harper's definition of wealth changed while he was filming "For Colored Girls" in Atlanta and writing a book about money and finance to encourage people to stop using a lack of money as an excuse to defer their dreams. "You know it was funny, just a few years before, I was in grad school at Harvard, and Spike was teaching a theater class or film classes at Harvard," he said with a laugh. Wake up at noon or 1 to audition for films and go to acting class in the evening and maybe come home and get a nap between 9:30 and 10 and go to work again at 11," he said.
