The move incensed China, which suffered under Japan's military aggression in World War II, and regards the shrine as a symbol of Japan's imperial past "If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul," Liu wrote. " Abe's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine exacerbated tensions at a time when relations between Japan and China have been strained over the sovereignty of a set of islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu islands in China and the Senkakus in Japan. Lord Voldemort, the arch-villain in the Harry Potter series of books and films, has played an unlikely cameo in a diplomatic feud between China and Japan. The riposte prompted Chinese state media to warn "a war of public opinion between China and Japan is now in full swing. "I think China and Japan are more like two kids who have not grown up," posted @Xiaowei Huang on China's popular Twitter-like platform Weibo.
