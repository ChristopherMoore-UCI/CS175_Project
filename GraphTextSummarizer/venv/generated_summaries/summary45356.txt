Patients with expensive health care needs one year are not guaranteed to spend a lot on health care in the following year -- and anyone could have a health emergency at some point. In addition, AOL employees are required to pay both a share of their insurance premiums and up to $6,000 per family in out-of-pocket costs, which means they are already paying a significant share of health-care spending increases. Rather than allow employees to sign up for various insurance plans through multiple companies, AOL is self-funded. Here's why two newborns and the costs of Obamacare were very unlikely reasons that AOL would have to change its 401(k) program to save money: Health care costs are unpredictable for everyone, not just new moms. Employers cannot blame the president for unpredictable health care costs either.
