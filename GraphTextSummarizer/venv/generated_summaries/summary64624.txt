San Diego State University is one of the first in the country to provide a single location on campus where veterans can access their benefits, meet others with common military backgrounds, and even relax and play Xbox. The American Council on Education surveyed 723 colleges and universities in 2009 and found that 65% of the respondents who offered services to veterans and military personnel prior to September 11, 2001, had increased their emphasis on those services since that time. The staff at the Joan and Art Barron Veterans Center does everything from helping coordinate psychological counseling for veterans who might need it, to managing the nation's first on-campus housing reserved exclusively for veterans. GI Bill over the course of the next several years will rise as we draw down and people get out of the services," said Curtis Coy, undersecretary for economic opportunity at the Department of Veterans Affairs. As the war winds down in Iraq and many men and women are retiring from the military, San Diego State recognizes a need to serve this type of student.
