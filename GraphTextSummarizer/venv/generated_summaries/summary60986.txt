"The Endless River" will be released in November and is Pink Floyd's first album since "Division Bell" in 1994. Few would have predicted that an 18-year-old Egyptian, who wasn't even born the last time Pink Floyd released an album, would become the cover designer of the British band's latest album "The Endless River". The band state that the new album is a tribute to Rick Wright, "whose keyboards are at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound" and died in 2008. The British band formed in the 1960s but found global fame in the 1970s with progressive rock albums such as "Wish You Were Here" and "Animals. " The cover art for "The Dark Side of the Moon", designed by Storm Thorgerson, and "Animals", with a pig floating above Battersea Power Station, remain some of the most recognizable album covers of all time.
