The ships were carrying medical supplies and medical personnel from the marines, Antara said, citing Col. Indarto Budiarto. On Friday, four warships from the naval base in Padang, West Sumatra, were to arrive to offer aid to victims in the Mentawai islands, according to Antara. On the country's hard-hit Mentawai Islands, at least six of the 27 villages were "practically been flattened," state media said, citing the governor of West Sumatra. The government is considering relocating some residents in the earthquake-prone islands near Sumatra, the state-run Antara news agency said. The naval base in Padang had set up aid command posts in the Mentawai waters, as well as medical command posts for victims, Antara said.
