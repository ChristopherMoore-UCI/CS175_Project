Democratic presidential nominee Bill Clinton came to Iowa the next year to address 5,000 excited Iowa supporters at the most attended event to date. "But now with Bill and Hillary Clinton both there, it probably becomes the more important event in Iowa Democratic party history. "Ready for Hillary and our supporters look forward to honoring Sen. Tom Harkin's legacy and continuing our work to support Iowa Democrats in 2014," the group said in an email to supporters, making no mention of Clinton's possible 2016 bid. A CNN/ORC poll out Friday found that Clinton 53% of all registered Democrats contacted in Iowa said they would support Hillary Clinton if the 2016 caucuses were held today. Iowa Democrats this year have close races up and down the ticket, including for Harkin's seat in the Senate, where Democrat Bruce Braley and Republican Joni Ernst are in a dead heat, according to a recent CNN/ORC poll.
