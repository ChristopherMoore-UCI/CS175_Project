Tata had been licensed since March 1, 2010, with state authorities to run the residential day care center, Texas Department of Family and Protective Services spokeswoman Gwen Carter said. Hawkins said Tata will be charged with at least one count of reckless injury to a child involving serious bodily injury. The blaze itself likely originated on an electric stove inside, which was on and had a pot on it containing oil, according to Houston Fire Department arson investigator Thomas Wood. Still, for all his positive thoughts about Tata prior to this incident, Kajoh said he couldn't defend her actions last week. Authorities hope to detain 22-year-old Jessica Tata on a felony charge that she caused injury to a child, according to Donna Hawkins, a spokeswoman for the Harris County District Attorney's office.
