Buchanan County Deputies Eric Dewayne Rasnake, 32, and Shane Earl Charles, 25, were shot multiple times after responding to a "larceny in progress" call at a salvage business in Vansant, Virginia, Sheriff Roy Foster said. On Monday, Virginia State Police named Randy Gilbert Newberry as the suspect in the shootings. -- Virginia State Police say they have identified the gunman who fired a high-powered rifle at four county deputies, killing two of them, officials said Monday, but they still don't have a motive for the shootings. "Please take comfort in knowing that their sacrifice was not in vain," an emotional Foster said Monday. Police said they repeatedly asked Newberry to "put his hands up and get on the ground," but the suspect ignored their orders and instead aimed a handgun at officers.
