"The design and the architecture of this particular property was very much to make a very traditional Omani house concept using local materials," says Jork Bosselaar, general manager of the Alila Jabal Akhdar. For centuries, European travelers would tell tales of Oman's Jabal Akhdar mountain -- of its lush gardens filled with grapes and pomegranate surrounded by otherwise parched desert terrain. He says part of the appeal of Jabal Akhdar is the cooler climate it offers visitors compared to other parts of Oman. The 86-room Alila Jabal Akhdar luxury hotel -- part of the wider Alila Group which operates throughout India and the Asia-Pacific region -- is one such company. The Omani government is hoping to make Jabal Akhdar (Arabic for Green Mountain) a focal point for showcasing tourism in the interior of the country.
