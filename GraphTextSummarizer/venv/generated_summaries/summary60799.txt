-- Game 7 of the NBA Finals will be all about heart, Miami Heat superstar LeBron James said. " The Spurs may have been deflated by giving away a 10-point fourth-quarter lead, but rebounded emotionally, thanks to an unusual early morning team dinner after the game, which ended after 11 p.m. Star center Tim Duncan said instead of each player going back to his hotel room and ordering room service and beating himself up, the team went out. Early in the season, the Spurs sent Duncan and three other players back to San Antonio for rest instead of to a contest in Miami that ended a six-game road trip. "He was about doing whatever it took," Heat guard Dwyane Wade said. James sparked the Heat to a comeback win in Game 6, hitting a key 3-pointer in the final 20 seconds of regulation.
