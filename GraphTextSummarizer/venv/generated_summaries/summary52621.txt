If Phuket seriously wants to attract quality tourists, then Soi Bangla is the perfect place to start a cleanup campaign. At least the singer hit the right note about Patong, the island's main tourist beach, and Soi Bangla, its tawdry walking street that so many Phuket tourists for some reason find irresistible. Soi Bangla's in-your-face sex show touts Soi Bangla says so much more about Patong, and Rihanna expressed it well. Slowly but surely, the sea, sun and sand that Phuket has sought to promote has become sex, stinks and sleaze in Soi Bangla. Put Soi Bangla back on track, and some other celebrities just might visit Phuket ... and tweet about the sun, sand and sea.
