Before his death, Osama bin Laden wanted to rebrand al Qaeda, Gartenstein-Ross said. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said it would be "a mistake to take our eye off the ball when it comes it al Qaeda" and warned that the rise of ISIS could aid the terror network. "He believed that its brand had been very much diminished by the excesses of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who had led al Qaeda in Iraq, which became ISIS later on," he said. "With ISIS's rise, it gives al Qaeda a prime opportunity to rebrand itself as being a more rational, more moderate voice of jihadism, and as a result I think there's a lot of risks of more money channeling into the al Qaeda network. " Some will come from quite moderate countries in the region who are looking at whether or not al Qaeda and some of its offshoots, such as al-Nusra Front in Syria, could be viewed as a counterweight to ISIS, Gartenstein-Ross said.
