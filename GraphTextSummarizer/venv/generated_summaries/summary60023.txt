Online movie reviewer Kent Lundblad said he was given a copy by a friend just hours after the rough "Wolverine" first appeared on a Web site Tuesday afternoon. Hugh Jackman stars in "X-Men Origins: Wolverine." Twentieth Century Fox said the FBI was investigating who leaked "X-Men Origins: Wolverine," which is set for release in U.S. theaters May 1. "The source of the initial leak and any subsequent postings will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law; the courts have handed down significant criminal sentences for such acts in the past," the studio's statement said. "We forensically mark our content so we can identify sources that make it available or download it," the studio said.
