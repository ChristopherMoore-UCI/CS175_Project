-- Thirty Congolese women on the border of Angola and Congo were held in a dungeonlike prison and systematically raped by uniformed men, according to U.N. officials. In another region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Western Kasai, at least 20 Congolese women also reported being raped, the United Nations said. These reported rapes come after nearly 500 people were systematically raped during rebel attacks this summer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Those who survived and were released then returned to the Congo in the nude and with no belongings, according to the United Nations. While these expulsions are legal, OCHA spokesman Maurizio Giuliano said they are concerned about the human rights violations of the deportees.
