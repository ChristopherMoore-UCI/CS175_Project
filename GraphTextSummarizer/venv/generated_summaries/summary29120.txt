Part of project management's job is to say "no" to many change requests, but that's not always possible. The overall failure appears to have been one of project management on the part of the government. The new Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport outside London was saddled with software problems. But the federal government has never had a fantastic track record in dealing with technology projects. It's like building a house: If the owners suddenly decide they want a big floor-to-ceiling picture window on the second floor, it may require rerouting water pipes.
