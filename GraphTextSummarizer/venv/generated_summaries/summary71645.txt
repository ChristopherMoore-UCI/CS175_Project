Opposition to Saleh has solidified in the wake of violent confrontations between security forces and protesters Friday in Sanaa, Aden and elsewhere. High unemployment, lack of political freedoms and government corruption have also stoked Yemeni anger. Saleh called the White House on Wednesday "to convey his regret for misunderstandings related to his public remarks that Israel and the United States have engaged in destabilizing activities in Arab countries," a White House statement said. Opponents of Yemen's long-time President Ali Abdullah Saleh have been demonstrating against him since the beginning of the year, part of the wave of popular protests that has been crashing over the Arab world. In the call to John Brennan, U.S. President Barack Obama's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism, Saleh also said that he is "firmly committed to meaningful political reform in Yemen and that he is reaching out to opposition elements in an effort to achieve reform through a democratic, inclusive, and peaceful process.
