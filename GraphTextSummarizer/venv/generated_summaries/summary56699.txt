Back then it was very crude, how we did split-screen," star Patty Duke said of playing the dual roles of Patty and Cathy Lane in the show, which was developed specifically for her. She teamed up with the Social Security Administration to do public service announcements encouraging seniors to sign up online -- using her old "Patty Duke Show" characters. In the sitcom, which ran for three seasons on ABC, Patty was a rambunctious teenager who always managed to find herself in some kind of trouble; cousin Cathy was a demure, worldly Scottish teenager who came to New York to live with the Lane family to finish her schooling. Patty Duke says she has many fond memories of working on "The Patty Duke Show." When it was time to be Patty, I would have to deal with my embarrassment of her stupidity.
