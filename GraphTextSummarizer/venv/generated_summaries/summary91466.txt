We haven't yet abandoned our closest Afghan allies to Taliban slaughter. A common truth among U.S. military veterans of the Iraq and Afghan wars (especially those of us who served on the front lines) is that our interpreters most likely saw more and worse combat than the majority of us. -- I never thought my Afghan translator would save my life by killing two Taliban fighters who were about to kill me. I turned and saw my Afghan interpreter Janis Shenwary glaring down the barrel of his rifle at the bodies of the two Taliban fighters he had just killed. But many end up on the Taliban or al Qaeda's hit lists.
