-- American student Amanda Knox, convicted last year of murdering her British roommate in Italy, was ordered Monday to face a new trial on slander charges, her lawyer Luciano Ghirga said. Knox was sentenced in December to 26 years in prison for the murder of the British exchange student in Perugia, Italy. Knox wore black pants and a dark green sweater for her court appearance in Perugia, Italy. " Mellas said Knox did not claim to have been "beaten" by police, but hit on the back of the head. Kercher, 21, was found semi-naked with her throat slashed in the house she shared with Knox in November 2007.
