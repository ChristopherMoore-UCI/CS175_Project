The killing was among a series of attacks against Iranian nuclear scientists in recent years. In January, Iran sent a letter to the United Nations secretary-general alleging that the killings of the scientists were terrorist attacks that followed a clear pattern. In January, Mohammad Khazaee, Iran's U.N. ambassador, blamed Israel for the attacks. "I want to categorically deny any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran," she said in January. "They are trying to assassinate the Iranian scientists to deprive Iranians from the right of using peaceful nuclear energy," Khazaee said.
