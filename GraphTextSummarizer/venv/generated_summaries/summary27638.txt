Obama and Biden also met with Haitian President Rene Preval and his wife, Elisabeth Delatour Preval. Before leaving Thursday, Obama is scheduled to hold a breakfast for young Mexican leaders and visit the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. Obama, fresh off an unannounced stop in Haiti, was greeted Tuesday night at Benito Juarez International Airport by Carlos Pascual, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico; and Arturo Sarukhan, the Mexican ambassador to the United States. The meeting at the Mexican Cultural Institute fulfilled a tradition in effect since 1980 of U.S. presidents talking with their Mexican counterparts before being sworn in to underscore the special relationship between the two nations. The first lady's visit reinforces the priority the White House gives Mexico despite the domestic and international problems President Obama faces, university political science professor Miguel Angel Valenzuela Shelley told Notimex, Mexico's state-run news service.
