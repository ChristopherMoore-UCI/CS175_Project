The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, released late Monday night, says a U.S. District Court must now set a hearing to determine the fate of death row inmate Albert Greenwood Brown. Brown was sentenced to death in 1982 for the rape and murder of Susan Jordan, who was walking to Arlington High School in Riverside when Brown pulled her into an orange grove, according to court documents. "The district court's decision to provide Brown the choice of a one drug option is not consistent with California state law and procedures," the court ruling said. The federal appeals court said a U.S. District Court made a mistake when it recently said that Brown should choose between a one-drug or a three-drug option for his lethal injection. The ruling could also delay Brown's execution for some time because California is running low on one of the drugs that is used in lethal injection.
