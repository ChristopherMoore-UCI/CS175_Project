A short video released by ISIS on Friday shows the apparent beheading of British aid worker Alan Henning, with the executioner blaming the death on the United Kingdom for joining the U.S.-led bombing campaign against the group. "The brutal murder of Alan Henning by ISIL shows just how barbaric and repulsive these terrorists are," UK Prime Minister David Cameron said, referring to the group also known as ISIS. At the end of the video, ISIS shows American aid worker Peter Kassig and threatens his life. "Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need," Cameron said. ISIS then claimed its first British victim, aid worker David Haines, according to video that appeared online on September 13.
