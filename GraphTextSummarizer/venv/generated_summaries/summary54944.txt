-- An African man who claimed he could double your money simply by applying a magic  potion to currency notes has been arrested at a Madrid bar where the Ecuadorean owner nearly  fell victim to the ploy, Spanish national police said on  Thursday. "It was a very unpleasant surprise," bar owner Cesar Tepan told CNN. He told police the suspect had come to the  bar a week earlier claiming he could double currency notes by applying a magic  potion, the police statement said. "He returned my 20," said Tepan, who's lived 16 years in Spain and has owned the bar in central Madrid for 11 years. Presto, and there  were soon three 20 euro notes visible, the owner told  police.
