Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa is seeking $80 million in damages from El Universo newspaper and its staff. In a statement Tuesday, the Inter American Press Association criticized "the ongoing harassment of the Ecuador's independent press through excessive and disproportionate legal suits by President Rafael Correa." Ecuador's government information website also showed images of a demonstration, saying Guayaquil residents were supporting Correa and his lawsuit. El Universo, an 89-year-old, family-run newspaper, is based in Ecuador's Guayaquil province. Correa filed the lawsuit after El Universo published in February a column by the newspaper's then-opinion editor, titled, "No to lies."
