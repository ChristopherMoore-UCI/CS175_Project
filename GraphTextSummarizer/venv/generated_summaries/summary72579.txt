Jacarezinho and Manguinhos are smaller favelas, far from tourist hotspots, but they became centers for organized crime and drug dealing after other slums were taken over by police. Three years ago, they took a similar approach in the notorious Cidade de Deus, or City of God, slum where military police backed by the army seized control from drug traffickers. -- Tanks, troops and police pushed through the streets of two shantytowns in northern Rio de Janeiro Sunday in a move to retake control of some of the city's most crime-ridden areas. Police said they seized automatic weapons, guns and grenades and arrested dozens of people in a series of slum raids over the weekend. In the predawn operation, state authorities targeted the slums, or favelas, of Jacarezinho and Manguinhos with more than 2,000 military troops and police.
