West Bank Palestinian government spokeswoman Nour Odeh said the Palestinians "don't recognize the legitimacy of any settlement construction in the occupied Palestinian territories, especially in East Jerusalem. Mohammed Shtayyeh, a leader in the Palestinian movement Fatah, criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, saying, "This is all Netanyahu and Lieberman have to offer: the destruction of the two-state solution and the imposition of an apartheid regime. But Israeli group Peace Now, a critic of settlement policies, called the announcement the "true answer" from Netanyahu to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and his "strong commitment" to a two-state solution. Israel's building of settlements in the West Bank and housing construction in East Jerusalem have been major stumbling blocks in forging peace efforts and a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians. The country's Land Administration on Monday published notices for bids to erect 609 units in Pisgat Zeev and 606 units in Ramot in East Jerusalem.
