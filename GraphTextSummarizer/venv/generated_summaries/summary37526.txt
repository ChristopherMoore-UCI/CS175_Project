-- After 20 years of mega-success together, country duo Brooks & Dunn say they are done. Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn have decided to call it quits as a country singing duo. Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn were successful singer-songwriters in their own right when they joined forces and scored their first hit as a duo with their 1991 debut CD, "Brand New Man." In a statement on their Web site, the pair said they will tour one last time next year as a goodbye to fans -- and then call it a day. "If you hear rumors, don't believe them, it's just time," the Web statement said.
