The horse breeding game, which has 50 million players worldwide, allows players to raise horses and ponies, take care of them, train them and enhance their skills and abilities. "It's great to be involved with a game that lets children and adults alike interact with horses, horse breeding and stable management on a daily basis, meeting like-minded enthusiasts through the game's social features and sharing experiences," Phillips said in a statement. An electronic version of the 32-year-old royal will be featured in an online game for horse lovers, 'Howrse,' in which the Olympic equestrian will mentor and guide players in the UK. Some of her own horses, including her Olympic mount High Kingdom, will be included in the game for players to "own" themselves, game maker Ubisoft said in a statement. Philips, who won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics, will guide players through the opening phases of the game and help them complete tutorials through interactive prompts and feedback.
