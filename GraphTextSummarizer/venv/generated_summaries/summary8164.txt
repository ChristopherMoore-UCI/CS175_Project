"U Smile," the second single from Bieber's new album, was slowed down 800 percent and uploaded to the web by Nick Pittsinger, a 20-year-old aspiring music producer in Florida. The song is reminiscent of late '90s work from Icelandic artists Sigur Ros and Bjork, as Bieber's voice is both heavily deconstructed and eerily intimate. "U Smile 800% Slowed" wouldn't have all those listeners without its connection -- real or not -- to Bieber fever. Pop heartthrob Justin Bieber may be the perfect Trojan horse for a meme. Assuming you don't have 35 minutes to spare -- remember, it's eight times as long as the original four-minute pop song -- "U Smile 800% Slower" turns the high-pitched bleats of the pubescent signer into primal howls and cries that seem to linger forever.
