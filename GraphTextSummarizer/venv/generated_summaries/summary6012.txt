His time of 9.77 seconds was well off his world record of 9.58 seconds but still good enough to comfortably beat American Justin Gatlin and Jamaican Nesta Carter. " Perhaps mindful of what happened in South Korea, Bolt's start was cautious and Gatlin led him early. There was no false start for Bolt on Sunday in rainy Moscow and he captured his second world title in the 100 meters. Jamaica was left reeling when two-time 200-meter Olympic champion Veronica Campbell-Brown, former 100-meter world-record holder Asafa Powell and Olympic relay gold medalist Sherone Simpson tested positive for banned substances before the world championships. But after getting fully into his stride, Bolt -- despite not feeling at his best -- eased past Gatlin and coasted home.
