Both the federation and Blanc issued denials Friday but minister Chantal Jouanno is seeking guarantees that there are genuine equal opportunities. Reports allege that senior officials have secretly approved limiting the number of black and Arab trainees to 30 per cent from the age of 12-13 and that national team coach Laurent Blanc had approved the quota. Quoting "scandalized" sources within the French Football Federation (FFF), it said the alleged directive from its National Technical Direction (DTN) had already been sent out to training academies. "Discrimination has no place in sport, whether it's in the stands or in the training academies," Ms Jouanno said. "I take note of the French football federation's denial about the existence of such a policy and I invite it to very quickly shed light on the allegations in the article," she added in a statement released to CNN.
