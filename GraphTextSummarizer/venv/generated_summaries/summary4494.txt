A lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Kilpatrick and former city Treasurer Jeffrey Beasley of soliciting the gifts from MayfieldGentry Realty Advisors, which regulators say picked up the tab for trips to Las Vegas, Bermuda and Florida on private jets. -- Ex-Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and his former treasurer got more than $125,000 in free travel and entertainment from an investment firm that made $3 million handling city pension funds, federal regulators said Wednesday. Beasley told the firm's owner, Chancey Mayfield, that his company was "in the doghouse" with Kilpatrick's administration after Mayfield backed Kilpatrick's opponent in the 2005 election, the lawsuit states, and Beasley offered to help Mayfield "clear the air" with the mayor. Beasley was indicted on federal bribery charges in February, with prosecutors accusing him of taking kickbacks from companies with city pension fund business. "At the same time Mayfield and MGRA secretly provided these gifts, they were seeking approval from the trustees of the funds, including Kilpatrick and Beasley, for over $115 million in investments," the lawsuit states.
