State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the United States "had indications of the use of a toxic industrial chemical, probably chlorine, in Syria this month in the opposition-dominated village of Kfar Zeita." If true, a chlorine attack would undermine a deal brokered by Russia last fall and approved by the U.N. Security Council that requires Syria to surrender its chemical weapons to the international community. The United Nations says more than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria since the opposition launched anti-government protests in 2011. -- A Syrian army helicopter dropped barrel bombs on a vegetable market in Aleppo on Thursday, killing 24 people, opposition activists said. The attack comes days after several U.S. officials said the Syrian government may have used chlorine gas in a deadly attack on its people. Dozens more were injured in the attack on the opposition-held town of Atareb, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria.
