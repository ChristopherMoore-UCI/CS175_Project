" The "universal service obligation" as it is known means broadband access is considered a staple commodity alongside services such as telephone and postal services, according to the Finnish Communications Regulatory Authority (FICORA). -- Finland has become the first country in the world to make broadband internet access a legal right for all citizens. "From now on a reasonably priced broadband connection will be everyone's basic right in Finland," said Finnish communications minister Suvi Linden. A report issued by the European Union in November last year stated that 24 percent of the EU population had a broadband access line subscription in July 2009. It added that 80 per cent of broadband lines in the EU had download speeds of two mbs or greater.
