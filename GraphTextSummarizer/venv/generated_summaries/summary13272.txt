Former F1 champion Michael Schumacher has been discharged from a Swiss hospital and is returning to his home, where he'll  continue his recovery from head injuries suffered in a skiing accident last year, his spokeswoman said Tuesday. " Schumacher, 45, sustained severe head trauma in a skiing accident at the French Alps resort of Meribel on December 29. Kehm appealed, as she has previously, for the privacy of his family to be respected as Schumacher continues his recovery. "Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months," said Sabine Kehm. He was treated first at a hospital in Grenoble, in France, and then in June moved to a hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland, near the Schumacher family home.
