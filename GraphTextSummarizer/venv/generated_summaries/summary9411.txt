"The wine is not especially rare or unusual -- they are the sort of wines that crop up at auction every now or then," he said. In what country would the presidential palace auction off some of its finest wines to buy more wine and boost state coffers? Built up over decades, it includes wines from Alsace, the Champagne region, the Rhône Valley and the Loire alongside those from Burgundy and Bordeaux. A recent sale from the cellars of the UK government saw just that effect, Smith said, with wines fetching more than might have been expected. The Élysée Palace -- the official residence of the French president -- has dipped into its wine cellars and put 1,200 bottles up for auction in Paris.
