A report Monday from the U.N. Development Program spotlighted the pressures on private Palestinian businesses, especially in Gaza, where it said the private sector "is on the verge of collapse with no scope for recovery" unless Israeli restrictions are lifted. The Paris conference focuses on short-term priorities for the Palestinians, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said those include providing immediate support for the Palestinian people -- particularly those living in Gaza -- and stabilizing the Palestinian economy. Sarkozy repeatedly told the conference he is a "friend of Israel," but he urged the Israeli government to withdraw troops from the West Bank, freeze settlements, reopen institutions in East Jerusalem and help the isolated population of Gaza. Livni said an agreement had been reached with the European Union to provide training for Palestinian police.
