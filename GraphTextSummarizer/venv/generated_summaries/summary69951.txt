Michigan is the latest state in which federal judges have struck down state constitutional bans on gay marriage. He was referring to the year that voters in Michigan, along with those in 10 other states, passed state constitutional amendments restricting "marriage or (a) similar union" to between one man and one woman. An ABC News/Washington Post survey released earlier this month found that 59% of Americans favor allowing gay or lesbian couples to legally wed. Michigan's amendment, specifically, states the rationale for its restrictions is "to secure and preserve the benefits of marriage for our society and for future generations of children." Friedman -- like federal judges in other recent, similar cases -- ruled Michigan's ban violates the Equal Protection Clause  in the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment. The plaintiffs in the Michigan case, April DeBoer and Jayne Rowse, sued in part because Michigan law also "restricts adoptions to either single persons or married couples." Friday's decision is different in that it opens the door for same-sex couples to get marriage licenses in Michigan very soon.
