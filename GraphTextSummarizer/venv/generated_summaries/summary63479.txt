"It hits your heart, to see more suffering on top of suffering. -- Can-Do founder Eric Klein spent most of 2010 in Haiti helping people recover from the devastating earthquake. According to Klein, nongovernment organizations working in Haiti are mostly responsible for slow progress, and he encourages donors to hold them accountable. I just want them to understand that the option to stop helping Haiti, while we address those questions, is that people will die," Stern said. This additional crisis of cholera in Haiti is being met by organizations already dealing with exhausted volunteers, donor fatigue and doubt.
