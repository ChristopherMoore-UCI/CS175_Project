" Obama and Vice President Joe Biden were calling House Democrats, urging them to support the measure. Conservative lawmakers complained that House Republican leadership punted their latest opportunity to combat Obama's signature health care law -- which they fought to defund during the October 2013 shutdown -- and his executive overhaul of immigration and deportation rules. In the early morning hours Friday, Obama signed a two-day extension, and the Senate is expected to pick up the legislation and vote on it later Friday, though they have until midnight Saturday before the next deadline. But long-clear divisions on the right remain -- and were evident in the House when 16 Republicans, many angry that the party hadn't fought harder to block Obama's executive action on immigration, opposed the measure in a key procedural vote and nearly dealt their leaders a major blow. After November's elections, when the GOP won the Senate and expanded its majority in the House, party leaders claimed a mandate.
