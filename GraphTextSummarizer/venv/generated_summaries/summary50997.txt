"It was logic to play soccer first due to my case; then I played table tennis as a challenge." Starting at 13, Hamadto spent years working hard to perfect his game -- initially he tried different options at gripping the bat, including holding it under his armpit, before deciding to handle it with his mouth. Hamadto, who is married and a father of three, has won several honors over the years, including the silver medal in the African Para-Table Tennis Championships last year. "Ibrahim is a very nice man with faith and perseverance," said Alaa Meshref, the president of Egyptian Table Tennis Federation. " Indeed, watching Hamadto playing, seeing the artistry in his game as he defends with panache and attacks with vigor, it's hard to disagree. Earlier this month, the Egyptian champion demonstrated his skills at the World Team Table Tennis Championships, held in Tokyo, Japan, where he was the guest of honor and played against some of the sport's biggest names.
