Francis Monteiro agrees that parents like him appreciate feedback from their children's teachers, but he says requiring teachers to grade parents is not the answer. Sharon Francis, who teaches first grade in the small central Florida city of Winter Haven, is not sure that grading parents will work. If Florida state Rep. Kelli Stargel's bill becomes law, public school teachers will be required to grade the parents of students in kindergarten through the third grade. Many parents and teachers have not welcomed the changes. "We have student accountability, we have teacher accountability, and we have administration accountability," Stargel said.
