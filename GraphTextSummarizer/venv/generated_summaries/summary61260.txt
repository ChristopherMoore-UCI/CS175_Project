If you overlook Laytown beach, a mere 30 miles north of the capital Dublin on Ireland's east coast, you would usually see golden sand stretching far and wide, the tide pulsing in and out of shore, the elements battering the coastline and the occasional dog walker. I think there's beach racing in Spain but this is the only one that completely adheres to the rules of racing. When the tide goes out, organizers shovel up and pat down the sand to create the racing line, but such are the elements that occasional pools of surface water can remain, which some horses don't mind but others despise -- merely another nuance to the racing at Laytown. "There truly is nothing like it, it's truly unique," says Kevin Coleman, who was born and brought up in Laytown and is one of a small team that runs the meeting. welcome to Laytown Racecourse.
