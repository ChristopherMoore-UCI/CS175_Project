Helicopters used in Iraq strikes U.S. Army Apache gunships were used against ISIS targets in Iraq's Anbar province over the weekend, the senior defense official who spoke about the plans for more Kobani airstrikes told CNN. U.S. officials don't see ISIS making a direct run for Baghdad, but concerns remain that ISIS elements are in the city and around the airport, the official said. A senior defense official said Monday to expect more airstrikes against ISIS targets in the Kobani area. More than $62 million, Pentagon says U.S. military airstrikes against ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria have cost more than $62 million so far, according to data provided by the U.S. Defense Department. As ISIS fighters attacked with tanks and heavy artillery, the city's defenders vowed to keep fighting.
