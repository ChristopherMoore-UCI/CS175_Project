Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war Prime Minister Tony Abbott said people should not let anger affect Australians' relationship with Indonesia. Australia lodged a formal complaint Friday over the treatment of two drug smugglers sentenced to death in Indonesia during their transfer to an island where they are expected to face execution. The Indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two Australians against President Joko Widodo. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers, and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. We appeal again to President Widodo, the leader of a strong and proud country, to show mercy and forgiveness and spare the lives of these two young Australians."
