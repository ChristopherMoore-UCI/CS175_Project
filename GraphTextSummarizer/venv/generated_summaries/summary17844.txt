-- South Africa's ruling party banned its controversial youth leader Julius Malema from taking part in any party activities Wednesday, after he gave a speech that was critical of President Jacob Zuma. Malema had already been suspended from membership of the party in November but was still allowed to attend party meetings while the appeals process was in progress. "It is under President Zuma that we have seen the youth of the ANC being traumatized, being expelled from their own home," Malema said, according to the ANC statement. He faced a string of charges, including sowing party divisions by comparing Zuma to his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, and bringing the party into disrepute by urging the toppling of the Botswana government. Malema has also been the subject of a criminal investigation by the national revenue service over allegations he used his political position to influence the awarding of government tenders.
