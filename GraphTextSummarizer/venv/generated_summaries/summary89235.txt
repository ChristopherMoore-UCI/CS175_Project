The group Kombase runs is devoted to helping farmers and other agricultural workers grow their operations by offering training in good business practices. "Most agribusiness entrepreneurs are not running their companies as businesses, but rather as lifestyle companies," Kombase says. "Farmers are not looking for hand-outs," says Michael Abu Sakara Foster, agribusiness executive for Sacco Farms. "There is enough funding available for agribusiness entrepreneurs but most investors would want to see some structures in the businesses in order to have enough confidence to put their money in," argues Kombase. "Agribusiness for me denotes the collective business activities that are performed from farm to the dining table," explains Malindube Kombase, regional director of Mobile Business Clinic.
