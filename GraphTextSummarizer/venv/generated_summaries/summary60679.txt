More in demand now are features for the growing number of users who want to watch TV on all their screens, big and small, and pull from a large selection of content options, not just the cable feed and their DVR. It is divided into five sections for live TV and recommendations, streaming content, media stored on the computer, social features and apps. There's also been a lot of buzz at CES about TVs that offer tailored recommendations. Samsung showed a revamped, busy interface called the Smart Hub that will appear on its next generation of smart TVs. Now smart TVs are adding support for these streaming services plus features that lets your tablet show you a mirror of what's on your TV -- sometimes alongside your social networks.
