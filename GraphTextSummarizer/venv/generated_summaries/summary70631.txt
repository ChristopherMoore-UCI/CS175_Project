The BP oil well, which ruptured April 20 after an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, spilled more than 2 million gallons of oil per day into the Gulf of Mexico before being successfully shut. In preparing the research, Oxford Economics looked at current spending, government models predicting oil flow and the effect of 25 past crises on tourism to develop a model to gauge the Gulf disaster's impact. That means there are options about how to handle the well, which has stopped pouring oil into the Gulf, he said. The well gushed an estimated 53,000 barrels (nearly 2.3 million gallons) of oil per day before it was capped. Since then, fresh, green grass has started growing again in some of the hardest-hit marshes of southern Louisiana, but oil continues to wash ashore in some places.
