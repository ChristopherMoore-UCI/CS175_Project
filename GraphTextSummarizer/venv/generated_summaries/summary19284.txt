The bitter child support and custody battle between Mel Gibson and Oksana Grigorieva apparently reached a conclusion, with Gibson agreeing in court Wednesday to pay his ex-girlfriend $750,000 and share time with their young daughter. "Lucia was born out of love and she was a planned child," Grigorieva lawyer Daniel Horowitz said after the hearing. The leaks to tabloids and negative statements traded between Gibson and Grigorieva since their separation last year will apparently come to an end. Gibson entered a "no contest" plea in March to a misdemeanor battery charge relating to an incident last year involving Grigorieva. The settlement, which was revealed in a Los Angeles courtroom Wednesday, also allows Grigorieva to remain in the home that Gibson has provided her until Lucia, who was born in October 2009, turns 18.
