We can only say we have started an investigation and we require the reports from all federations." Spokesman Mihkel Uiboleht said last Thursday that his Estonian Football Association had been informed about "possible manipulation" after the matches. -- FIFA has launched an investigation into two international friendly matches held in Turkey last week that yielded seven penalties amid claims of heavy betting patterns. "We received information of possible manipulation even before the game as the same agency also organized the match between Latvia and Bolivia and there was the same scenario there." Bolivia beat Latvia 2-1 in the resort of Antalya hours before Bulgaria and Estonia played out a 2-2 draw on the same ground. "We can confirm that FIFA has requested the match report from the federations," a FIFA spokesperson told CNN.
