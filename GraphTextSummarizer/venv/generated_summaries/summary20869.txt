Lewinsky's reentry into public life comes at the same time that Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton's wife and the former secretary of state, is considering a run at the presidency. During her book tour earlier this year, Clinton was repeatedly asked about Lewinsky's Vanity Fair essay. "#HereWeGo," the former White House intern who had an affair with President Bill Clinton tweeted early on Monday. Lewinsky penned an essay in May for Vanity Fair about her life after the affair and her reaction to the news that Hillary Clinton refereed to her as a "narcissistic loony toon" in a conversation with a close friend. Lewinsky, who is a contributor for Vanity Fair, wrote another essay for the magazine in July about online bullying.
