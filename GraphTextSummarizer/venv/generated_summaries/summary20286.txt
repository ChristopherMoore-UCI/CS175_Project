The Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, home of the Kings, is seeing a run on team apparel. Among the celebrities in attendance were longtime Kings fans Matthew Perry and Alyssa Milano, along with Will Ferrell, who made a raucous video cheering the Kings that went viral throughout now-hockey-crazy Los Angeles. In his 39th season as the announcer for Kings games, Hockey Hall of Famer Bob Miller said the anticipation was unbearable. And to marginalize them further, the Kings had to compete for fans against other local teams, some legendary: the Lakers, the Dodgers, the Angels and the Clippers. "I've been a Kings fan for 40 years and had a season's seat for 25 years," said Cheryl Baggs, holding a plastic cup of white wine.
