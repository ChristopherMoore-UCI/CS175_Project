Pointing to a leopard skin dress from the Russian collection of 1997 as an example, Loriot added: "I think you can have the same emotion when you see haute couture as a sculpture or a painting." Gaultier told me he did not sell any garments from his first two shows. And I am still doing, but maybe I will restrain [it] a little." Gaultier also surprised me by insisting he is not an artist, though he said he can be inspired by art. I would say his tartan punk, his Madonna Blond Ambition Tour costumes, and his chic rabbi garment from the 1993 collection that caused outrage could very much be seen as art. " Gaultier says he's no businessman, but that sounds like good business practice. "When you see the work, some of his dresses, I think it is art," Loriot said.
