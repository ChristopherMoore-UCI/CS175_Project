I wish you could see what I see, some 23 years later -- that what seems right now like a shameful, public declaration of your unlovability is actually one of the things you'll use as a source of strength time and time again. You'll dance badly and happily to "Funky Cold Medina" while listening to your girlfriends whine about how their dates are ignoring them in favor of the lively card tournament at the corner table. The college you chose contains your people -- warm, bold, weirdos bursting with life and art and big dreams, and they'll like you an awful lot. -- Dear 17-year-old self considering staying home on prom night because you don't have a date, Oh, you poor, stressed-out, self-hating misfit girl, just suck it up and go. High school prom, 50 years later Just a few short months from now, everything, all of it, will change -- for the better.
