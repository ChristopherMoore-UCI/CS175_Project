Boehner juggles assault on Obamacare, avoiding shutdown CNN counted days that lawmakers were in Washington excluding "pro-forma" sessions, which are technically considered work days but last only a few minutes and are usually ignored by members. He believes the shorter window in Washington squeezes out the heavy lifting of lawmaking and that a lawmaker's hours in the Capitol are filled with meet-and-greets, fundraisers and receptions instead of legislative work. "It's critical for members to have district work periods to hear from their constituents on a variety of matters," said Cantor spokeswoman Megan Whittemore, "including chronic unemployment, the next steps toward addressing immigration and our debt crisis." But others question whether more time in Washington would change anything. The time spent by members in Washington dropped sharply the following year and has decreased nearly every year since with each party controlling one house and partisanship defining the political climate.
