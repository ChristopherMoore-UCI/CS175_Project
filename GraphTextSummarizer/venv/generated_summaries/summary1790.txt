Blanchett was talking to Jonathan Hyla of the Australian TV show "The Project" in conjunction with "Cinderella," but Hyla's offbeat questions led to an awkward few minutes. UPDATE: Jonathan Hyla said in an phone interview Monday that his interview with Cate Blanchett was mischaracterized when an edited version went viral around the Web last week. Blanchett ended the interview laughing, Hyla said, and "she was in on the joke. Hyla thought he'd begin the interview on a casual note, saying Blanchett would be a good person to have a beer with. After some more back-and-forth, with an apparently sometimes testy, sometimes punchy Blanchett trying to steer the topic of conversation back to the film, Hyla finally tried another angle.
