Veena Malik appeared on the cover of the Indian edition of FHM wearing only one thing: a tattoo on her arm bearing the initials ISI, the acronym for Pakistan's infamous Inter-Services Intelligence agency -- causing a stir in her conservative homeland. The publication is even demanding a public apology and has threatened to counter-sue Malik for defamation. "She was completely aware of the cover," said FHM editor Kabeer Sharma. " In a telephone call with CNN, Malik said she had declined an offer a couple of months ago by an "international (media) agency" to pose nude for a fee but agreed to do a shoot for FHM India instead -- and without charges -- because it was a "personality" shoot. But FHM India says Malik knew the terms all along and approved the photos.
