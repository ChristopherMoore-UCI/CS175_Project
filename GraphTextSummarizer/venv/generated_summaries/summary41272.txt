Within 24 hours of finding the body, Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine announced that investigators had no reason to believe there was foul play. While the rallies have been peaceful, seven people, including Kendrick's parents, Moore and several other aunts, were arrested for obstruction at a rally on April 25, according to the Lowndes County sheriff's office. Authorities told the family that blood had rushed to Kendrick's head and upper body, his father said. The 53-year-old drove down to Valdosta from Decatur to rally alongside family and community members on April 18 and again on May 4. How could Kendrick Johnson, a three-sport athlete, fall into an upright mat while reaching for his shoe and not get out, as investigators said?
