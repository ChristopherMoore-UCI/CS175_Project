Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, are suspected of stealing three cars -- two with guns inside -- and are the subject of a law enforcement search that stretches from Kentucky to Georgia -- and maybe on to Florida. "I know Dalton and he has a history of making bad, bad decisions," said Chaffins, sheriff for the county of about 25,000 people in central Kentucky. "We know they've done wrong but you need to step up and take the consequences of what you done and come home before someone is really, really hurt," Tammy Martin, mother of Dalton Hayes, told CNN affiliate WAVE. "I haven't been sleeping very well lately." Hayes and Phillips are "increasingly brazen and dangerous," Sheriff Norman Chaffins of Grayson County, Kentucky, said in a press release. On Thursday, authorities said the Toyota Tacoma pickup stolen in Kentucky was recovered in Henry County, Georgia, just south of Atlanta.
