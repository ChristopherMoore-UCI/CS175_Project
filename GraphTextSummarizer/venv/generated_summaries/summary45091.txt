-- Bill Maher, the man famous for hating religion, is now becoming infamous for hating one religion in particular: Islam. (Maher had no Muslims on the panel in discussing Islam -- but that is typical for his show.) He said that it is "naive" to think that Islam isn't more violent than other religions and mocked President Obama for commenting that the terror group ISIS was not Islamic. Flash forward to 2012, when Maher discussed how women are unfairly treated in certain Muslim countries, which is truly an issue deserving of discussion. On last week's episode of his HBO show, "Real Time," Maher got into a heated exchange with Ben Affleck over Maher's use of sweeping generalizations to define Islam.
