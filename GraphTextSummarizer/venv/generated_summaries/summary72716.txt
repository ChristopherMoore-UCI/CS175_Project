Police sources also pointed the finger at Boko Haram Wednesday for an attack on a Nigerian army outpost in Maiduguri, the capital of Borno, in which two soldiers were killed. The suspect was initially detained successfully, but he escaped when suspected gang members attacked his police escort as he was being transferred to another town, police sources said Wednesday. Jonathan declared a partial state of emergency December 31 in four northern states, Borno among them, to contain a wave of attacks by Boko Haram. The fugitive, identified by police as Kabiru Sokoto, is suspected to be the mastermind of a series of deadly church bombings on Christmas Day. The bombings were claimed by Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group frequently blamed for sectarian violence in Nigeria.
