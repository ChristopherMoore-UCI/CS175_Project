Why do general audiences love "Star Wars," "Star Trek," and other science fiction films, but don't seem to care about what is going on in real space exploration? Much more exciting to have spacecraft "fly" like winged jet fighters in space, like in "Star Wars." Reality space exploration is done by professionals. I'll take reality space any day. Reality space hardware doesn't look cool enough.
