-- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday it had detained shipments of orange juice and concentrate from Brazil and Canada after finding traces of the unapproved fungicide carbendazim. The fungicide is allowed in limited quantities across Europe and Latin America, but the United States banned its use in 2009. Earlier this month, the FDA temporarily halted all orange juice imports after low levels of carbandazim were found in some juice shipments from Brazil. Brazil is the world's biggest exporter, accounting for 85% of total global exports. The agency discovered the substance in 11 shipments, six from Canada and five from Brazil.
