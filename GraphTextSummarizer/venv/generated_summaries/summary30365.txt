-- President Barack Obama was due in Ghana Friday, generating excitement in the west African nation and envy among its neighbors with many seeing his visit as sending a message to governments over their poor records on stability. President Obama says he chose Ghana partly because of the country's commitment to democracy. The two countries plunged into postelection chaos last year, forcing leaders to form contentious coalition governments. "By traveling to Ghana, we hope to highlight the effective governance that they have in place," Obama said in an interview with AllAfrica.com, which highlights news from the continent. Across Ghana, street vendors were stocking miniature American flags while citizens donned attire with pictures of the U.S. leader.
