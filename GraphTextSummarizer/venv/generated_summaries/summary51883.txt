Prosecutors admit their case is circumstantial, but have presented testimony from two women Guandique has admitted attacking along the same wooded trails of Rock Creek Park where Levy's remains were found. Looking through her cellphone records, Levy testified he called one that rang at the office of then-California Rep. Gary Condit. On Tuesday the jury heard from Robert Levy, the dead woman's father, who described the family's frantic search for Chandra, who by the first week of May was overdue for a flight home, and missing her graduation ceremony in southern California. "We were mad at Condit, trying to point him as the villain," Robert Levy testified on cross-examination Tuesday. "We were thinking Condit was the guilty one before we knew about this character here," Levy testified, looking toward the defendant.
