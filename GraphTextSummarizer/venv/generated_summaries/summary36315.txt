The missing Malaysia Airlines plane falls right at the nexus of several gripping story lines in the public narrative. The media can keep trying to tell the stories of poor people dying from lack of food and shelter, of children in rural communities and inner cities dying from gun violence, of black and Latina woman disproportionately being infected with and dying from HIV/AIDS. Is there a way to make the daily scourge of AIDS and child sex trafficking and gun violence as gripping as a missing jumbo jet? Arthur argues its not just the conflation of compelling plot lines that makes the Malaysia plane story so gripping â€” it's the fact that it's a lot of people, that it happened suddenly, and that we still don't know what happened. But no matter how numerous, no matter how gruesome and no matter how pressing, these and other critical stories may never pierce our consciousness, let alone capture world attention.
