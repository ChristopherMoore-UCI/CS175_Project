According to CNN's French affiliate BFMTV, a live grenade was thrown into the restaurant, in the heart of Paris' historic Jewish quarter, in August 1982 when it was packed with customers. International arrest warrants have been issued for three men suspected of having carried out a 1982 attack on a Jewish restaurant in Paris, the spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor said Wednesday. CNN's Sandrine Amiel reported from Paris, and Laura Smith-Spark wrote from London. Several cemeteries were also vandalized last month, with the damage including swastikas scrawled inside two Jewish cemeteries. Four people were killed in a terror attack in January on a kosher supermarket in Paris by an Islamist extremist, Amedy Coulibaly, who also shot a policewoman.
