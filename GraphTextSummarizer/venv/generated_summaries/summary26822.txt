Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher finished fourth for Mercedes in one of his best drives since his comeback to Formula One this season with Pole Robert Kubica fifth in the improving Renault. -- Ferrari's Fernando Alonso won an incident-packed Korean Grand Prix Sunday to take over the lead in the F1 world title race as his Red Bull rivals Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel failed to finish. It left Vettel in the lead while Alonso and Hamilton exchanged second position in a close battle, but on lap 46 of 55 the engine on the German's Red Bull gave up in a sea of smoke, oil and shattered parts. Rain had meant the early laps of the race were behind the safety car, but when it pulled off Webber made a mistake on lap 19 and collided with the unfortunate Nico Rosberg, who had been making a strong challenge in his Mercedes. Red Bull maintain their lead in the constructors' championship, with a lead of 27 points over McLaren, despite their misfortunes in Korea.
