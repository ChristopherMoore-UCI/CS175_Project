That's when court officials issued new rules. Federal law gives individual buildings and agencies, including courts, discretion to set their own security and access procedures. "The term demonstration includes demonstrations, picketing, speechmaking, marching, holding vigils or religious services and all other like forms of conduct that involve the communication or expression of views or grievances, engaged in by one or more persons, the conduct of which is reasonably likely to draw a crowd or onlookers," says the revised Regulation 7, which was effective Thursday. The regulations clarify a 60-year-old law blocking any demonstrations on court property, including the marble plaza that serves as the dramatic gateway to the building itself. But exactly just what could be said and where the public could assert its First Amendment rights was a source of contention -- at least until Thursday.
