When asked about the petition January 29, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the petition program doesn't necessarily mean action would be taken but it's rather "an opportunity for the voices of the American people" to be heard. " More than 273,000 people signed the petition, which calls for Canadian pop star to be deported because of his representation in the world of pop culture. The White House has declined to comment on a "Deport Justin Bieber and revoke his green card" petition, saying the "We the People" Whitehouse.gov petition system allows the Executive Office to dodge comments "to avoid the appearance of improper influence." For those of you counting at home, that's 12.5 billion concert tickets -- or 100 billion copies of Mr. Bieber's debut album. "We would like to see the dangerous, reckless, destructive, and drug abusing Justin Bieber removed from society and his green card revoked," the petition says.
