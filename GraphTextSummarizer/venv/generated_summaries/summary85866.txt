"We accept the clarification and celebrate the good news that Disney Junior has an exciting project in early development that does have a Latina as the heroine of the show." Just days before meeting with the media group, Kanter tried to clarify the princess' ethnicity on their Disney Junior Worldwide Facebook page: "Some of you may have seen the recent news stories on whether Sofia is or isn't a "Latina princess." Backlash for Disney's first Latina princess The National Hispanic Media Coalition, a Latino media advocacy organization, met with Nancy Kanter, Disney Junior Worldwide's senior vice president of original programming and general manager, to discuss the impact of "Sofia the First" in the Latino community. All our characters come from fantasy lands that may reflect elements of various cultures and ethnicities but none are meant to specifically represent those real world cultures. Nogales said he appreciated Disney/ABC's commitment to diversity and that he looks forward to seeing more Latino lead characters as the stars of their shows. After unveiling its "first Latina" princess last week, Disney now says Jamie Mitchell, the producer of the TV show "Sofia the First," "misspoke" during a press tour and that the title character is not a Latina.
