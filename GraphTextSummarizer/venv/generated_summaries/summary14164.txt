The killings come at a delicate time for Kurds in Turkey, where analysts say the government has recently entered into talks with Kurdish leaders -- among them the jailed head of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan. The PKK, a pan-Kurdish nationalist movement, is best known internationally for the guerrilla war it has fought for nearly three decades against the government of Turkey, a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives. The fact that one of the women was a founding member of the PKK, the Kurdish Workers' Party -- a group viewed by Turkey, the United States and others as a terror organization -- led to heightened speculation. The suspect, Omer Guney, is a 30-year-old Turkish national who, prosecutors said, has been a member of the Kurdish nationalist PKK for two years -- the same group co-founded by one of the victims. The ethnic Kurdish population extends across parts of Turkey, Syria, Iran and Iraq.
