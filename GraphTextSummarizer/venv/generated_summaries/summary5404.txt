While parties unhappy with America's use, and some would contend abuse, of US dollar dominance, financial institutions could set up dollar transaction mechanisms that completely skirted the US. The international bank fell under US jurisdiction by virtue of facilitating transactions in dollars which passed through the US. French officials exploded in outrage after BNP Paribas agreed to plea guilty to criminal charges, pay nearly $9 billion in fines, and have access to dollar clearing suspended for a year for its persistent violations of US economic sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan.

It included ongoing records-doctoring to hide the true identity of customers and stymieing the US investigation.
