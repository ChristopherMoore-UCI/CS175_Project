The demonstrations in Amman were the third in as many Fridays, with protesters gathering in front of the Al Husseini Mosque to decry government policies they blame for rising prices, low wages and unemployment. About 3,000 people gathered in the Jordanian capital for the event, according to national police spokesman Lt. Col. Mohammad Al Khateeb. -- Islamists, leftists and union members marched Friday in downtown Amman, demanding more significant economic and political reforms to help struggling citizens. Al Khateeb said there were protests in six other cities on Friday, with crowd estimates totaling about 2,200. In recent weeks, the government has announced several measures intended to ease citizens' economic hardships.
