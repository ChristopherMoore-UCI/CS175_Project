Recently freed FARC hostage Ingrid Betancourt tells Larry King that her captivity was "hell." Watch the entire remarkable interview Â» Now that she is in France and has been reunited with her children and her mother, Betancourt said she is still concerned with the fate of other hostages held in the FARC-controlled jungles. " Despite her nightmare, Betancourt said she harbors no hatred for FARC rebels. "You just, you don't have the possibility of even moving to take your bag without asking for permission." Betancourt's campaign for Colombia's presidency was built on her promise to curb drug trafficking and FARC's methods of kidnapping innocent people. She was rescued July 2 in an elaborately planned ruse that hoodwinked FARC captors into giving up Betancourt and 14 other hostages including three American contractors.
