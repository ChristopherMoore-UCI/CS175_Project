Shortly after the attacks, the U.S. teamed up with other nations to launch a war on terror,  which led to the death of al Qaeda leader  Osama bin Laden. It had similarities with al Qaeda: both were radical anti-Western militant groups devoted to establishing an independent Islamic state in the region. Other nations have been on a campaign to root out any groups with ties to al Qaeda. Most Johnny-come-lately terror groups are also based off of it, and it has carried out suicide attacks in farflung nations such as  Indonesia, the U.S., Kenya  and Iraq. Then there's the ever-present threat of al Qaeda, the brutality of the Boko Haram and the looming Taliban.
