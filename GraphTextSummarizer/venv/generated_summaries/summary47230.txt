Official: 31 dead, 200 rescued after ship capsizes near Lampedusa Lampedusa, not far from Sicily and the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter European Union countries -- and such fatal maritime accidents are all too common. The Navy crew used two 11-person boats to rescue the men from the raft, which was about 75 nautical miles southwest of Malta, according to Maltese officials. The San Antonio, which was 60 nautical miles away, answered a call from the Maltese government. A Maltese military statement said the men would be taken to Maltese Grand Harbour and turned over to the Maltese coast guard. The Maltese military said the men were migrants from Somalia.
