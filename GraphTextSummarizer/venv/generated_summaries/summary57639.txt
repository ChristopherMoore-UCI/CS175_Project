The women in Iridimi camp have now embraced solar cooking wholeheartedly, even converting their menfolk, who were skeptical initially because the food tasted different. " And back in Iridimi camp, the ray of hope that solar cooking is bringing to some of the world's most destitute people -- along with personal safety, improved health and entrepreneurial opportunity -- will continue to shine. They do what they have to for survival, but that doesn't mean they like it." Eventually, Jewish World Watch were put in touch with KoZon, a small Dutch nonprofit who were carrying out a pilot in Iridimi camp, home to 17,000 refugees. The climate in Chad allows the women in Iridimi camp to cook on solar for about 330 days per year. For the 2.5 million people who have fled the four-year conflict in war-torn Darfur, refugee camps in eastern Chad hold the promise of a safe haven.
