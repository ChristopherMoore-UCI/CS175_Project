At issue is whether the Pentagon can withhold these kinds of government records -- including various media material -- that would be an invasion of privacy, or involve "internal rules and practices of an agency." -- A federal judge wants to see secret videotapes showing terror suspects forcibly removed from their cells at the Guantanamo Bay military prison. The defendants in a lawsuit demanded access under a Freedom of Information Act request, claiming military guards have been mistreating the four prisoners, including the alleged "forced cell extractions" (FCEs). The case is International Counsel Bureau v. U.S. Department of Defense (cv-08-1063). The current lawsuit was filed four years ago, and is one of several brought by Gitmo detainees over their treatment and continued custody without charges or trial.
