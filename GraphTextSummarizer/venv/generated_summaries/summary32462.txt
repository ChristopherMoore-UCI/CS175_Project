The EU appears to be increasingly run by a small cabal of core countries which impose decisions on others, ignore national institutions and practices, and even force elected governments out of office in preference to so-called non-political administrators. The markets realize that Italy's debt predicament is similar to peripheral countries, and are sensing that the crisis is gradually moving to the core. The credibility of the euro would suffer across the world, defeating the purpose of the monetary union for Germany and other countries at the core. Solvency means that Italy could be reliably expected to service its national debt out of its expanding gross domestic product (GDP). Peripheral countries, in particular, are steadily forced toward the exit, with Greece under the most intense pressure.
