This year alone, North Korea has fired shells toward South Korea, apparently engaged in illicit arms transfers with Cuba, and is suspected by America's top general in South Korea of potentially having developed the skill to weaponize the nuclear devices it has been working on. A direct cyber-retaliation against North Korea may pose challenges; the nation is less networked and less reliant on intellectual property than free nations. Ironically, one of the best ways to achieve this change is with the type of cultural and electronic warfare North Korea has just waged against us. Although Washington would like very much to ignore North Korea, Pyongyang has just brought Trotsky's axiom into the 21st century with a seminal cyberattack that will have an immediate economic and cultural impact. In 2010, after North Korea sank a South Korean Navy ship, President Barack Obama said Pyongyang must be "held to account."
