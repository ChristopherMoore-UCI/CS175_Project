When pages become home to "edit wars," as the entries for Bush and Democratic rival John Kerry did during the 2004 election, they may be given temporary protection by administrators. And certain controversial pages get "protection" -- either full protection, which means they can only be edited by administrators, or semi-protection, under which they can only be edited by logged-in users whose accounts have been verified. The thinking is that with a team of volunteer editors spanning the globe, rough edges will eventually be smoothed out and good information will triumph over falsehoods and misinterpretations. In an interesting look at cultural interests, five of the 10 most disputed pages in Spanish were those of soccer teams -- Club America, Athletic Bilbao, Newell's Old Boys, FC Barcelona and Alianza Lima. But the study's authors noted that with most other languages, more local or regional topics prevailed.
