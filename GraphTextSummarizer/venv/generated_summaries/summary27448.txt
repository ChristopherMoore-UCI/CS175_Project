-- One person was killed in a shooting involving Border Patrol agents at the U.S.-Mexico border, Mexican state media reported Thursday. "Preliminary information available at this moment once again generates serious doubts about the use of lethal force by Border Patrol agents, which the Mexican government and Mexican society strongly condemn and deplore," Mexico's foreign ministry said in a statement Thursday night, according to Notimex. In 2010, the FBI investigated after a Border Patrol agent shot and killed a Mexican teen along the border between El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Citing preliminary reports, the Border Patrol said agents saw smugglers drop drugs on the U.S. side of the border in Nogales, Arizona, then return to Mexico. In response to similar shootings in September and July, Mexico's foreign ministry has criticized what it said was "disproportionate use of lethal force" at the border.
