The FAA issues ADs when it discovers a potentially unsafe condition on a type of aircraft, and it wants airlines to inspect their fleets or conduct preventive maintenance. The FAA said it issued an AD requiring airlines to inspect Airbus A320 aircraft for possible cracking of a landing gear part. -- The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday proposed fines against two of the nation's largest airlines, saying the airlines flew planes on hundreds of occasions in violation of FAA or airline safety standards. In a letter to its employees, US Airways Chief Operating Officer Robert Isom called the FAA announcement disappointing. Three of the planes were flown while not in compliance with FAA rules known as Airworthiness Directives, or ADs.
