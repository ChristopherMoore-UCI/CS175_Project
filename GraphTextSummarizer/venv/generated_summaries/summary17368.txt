In an e-mailed statement to the news organization, Edward Snowden distanced himself from his father, Lon Snowden; his father's attorney, Bruce Fein; and Fein's associates, saying "they do not possess any special knowledge regarding my situation. The man wanted by the United States for leaking details of National Security Agency intelligence gathering says journalists have been misled into printing false claims about his legal situation, The Huffington Post reported Thursday. Snowden's father: 'I know my son' "I ask journalists to understand that they do not possess any special knowledge regarding my situation or future plans, and not to exploit the tragic vacuum of my father's emotional compromise for the sake of tabloid news." "I would like to correct the record: I've been fortunate to have legal advice from an international team of some of the finest lawyers in the world, and to work with journalists whose integrity and courage are beyond question," Snowden said in the statement. The statement was released the same day The Wall Street Journal reported that Lon Snowden's legal team does not trust his son's closest advisers: WikiLeaks and Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald.
