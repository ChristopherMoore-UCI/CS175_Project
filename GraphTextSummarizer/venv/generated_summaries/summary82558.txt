"Those that incited violence on the street in the guise of protest, that tried to tear down what New York City police officers did every day. Weeks of street protests over a grand jury's decision not to indict police officers who killed Eric Garner -- along with Mayor Bill de Blasio's statements in sympathy with the goals of the demonstrators -- had already antagonized police unions (which, to make matters even more fraught, are in the middle of trying to settle a contract with the city). We don't yet know what polluted swamp of mental sickness led Ismaaiyl Brinsley to embark on a multistate rampage that culminated with the barbaric, execution-style killing of NYPD Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos on a New York City street. The call for civility hadn't yielded much in the way of results -- the unions continued to bash the mayor, and a street demonstration earlier this month for the first time turned violent, with a pair of police officers beaten on the Brooklyn Bridge. Pataki pronounced himself "sickened by these barbaric acts, which sadly are a predictable outcome of divisive anti-cop rhetoric of Eric Holder and Mayor de Blasio."
