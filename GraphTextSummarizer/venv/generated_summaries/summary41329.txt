The FBI hopes a $20,000 reward will help solve the 2009 slaying of James Kitterman, a government contractor who was found dead in his car in Baghdad's Green Zone. "The investigation itself has included hundreds of interviews during the past five years with potential witnesses in the U.S., Iraq, Afghanistan and the Philippines, but despite that we still need the public's help," the FBI said. Kitterman was a 60-year-old Texan who owned Peregrine Eyes, a construction company that was building a helipad at the U.S. Consulate, according to the FBI. Andrew Ames, a spokesman for the FBI, said Friday that "the manner in which the murder was carried out has not been released." His now-defunct company had about 45 employees that were primarily from the United States and Philippines, the FBI said.
