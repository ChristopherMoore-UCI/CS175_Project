The officials said the president was angry when he learned Monday afternoon about the flight, which sparked fear in the New York-New Jersey area. "It is absolutely outrageous and appalling to think that the FAA would plan such a photo shoot and not warn the public, knowing full well New Yorkers still have the vivid memory of 9/11 sketched in their minds," the New York Democrat said. "While federal authorities took the proper steps to notify state and local authorities in New York and New Jersey, it's clear that the mission created confusion and disruption." New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne said the department had been alerted to the flight by the federal agency "with directives to local authorities not to disclose information about it." Sen. Chuck Schumer echoed the mayor's sentiments in a separate news conference Monday afternoon, saying the Federal Aviation Administration should have notified the public to avoid panic. Schumer said the FAA's decision to not announce the fly-by "really borders on being either cruel or very very stupid." Building evacuations took place across the Hudson River in Jersey City, New Jersey.
