For children born with a windpipe defect or without one, and for others with defective or diseased organs, manipulating stem cells to generate healthy tissues or organs could be their only chance at survival. Exactly what happens to the windpipe after it is transplanted isn't clear, but researchers believe that placing stem cells, which are capable of developing into different types of body cells, can pick up signals from their environment and integrate with existing tissues. Last year, in describing Lyles' operation, TIME's Alice Park wrote: "Macchiarini has been perfecting the process of using stem cells to seed bioengineered scaffolds for organs like the trachea since 2008; in his first such procedure, he used a donor trachea to replace that of a Spanish woman, stripping the organ of its cells and coating it with the woman's own stem cells. TIME.com: Stem cell therapies may cure chronic conditions Macchiarini performed the nine-hour operation on April 9 at the Children's Hospital of Illinois after carefully creating the windpipe using stem cells from Hannah's bone marrow that were saturated over a matrix of plastic fibers shaped into a tube. Macchiarini told the New York Times that the body's regenerative capabilities may help such bioengineered organs to integrate with existing tissues.
