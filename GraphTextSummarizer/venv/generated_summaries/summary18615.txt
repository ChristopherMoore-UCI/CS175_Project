Read more from CNN affiliate WSB When the man finally left -- taking her car and cell phone, among other items -- Windom wondered how she would free herself of her bindings. Amy Windom says a "MacGyver" moment helped alert authorities after a terrifying incident Tuesday. Campos told CNN that there is no evidence to believe Windom's story is a hoax, although all elements of the incident are under investigation. Six minutes after Windom's boyfriend called 911, officers arrived and discovered Windom still tied to her bed, suffering a cut she sustained when the man struck her with his gun, according to Carlos Campos, a spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department. Windom's 2009 Acura has not been recovered, and authorities do not have a lead on the suspect.
