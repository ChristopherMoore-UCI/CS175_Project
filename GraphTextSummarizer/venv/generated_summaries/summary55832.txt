-- A U.S. filmmaker arrested in Venezuela and accused of instigating unrest was released from prison and expelled from the country, his attorney told CNN affiliate Globovision. Timothy Tracy was on a flight to Miami Wednesday morning, attorney Daniel Rosales said. He was accused of funding opponents of President Nicolas Maduro, successor to the late Hugo Chavez. Venezuelan Minister of Interior and Justice Miguel Rodriguez confirmed the release on his Twitter account, but maintained that Tracy was "captured doing espionage in our country." "Shooting video is not evidence of participation in what the government calls an 'act of destabilization.'
