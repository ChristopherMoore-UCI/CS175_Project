Allen County Sheriff Ken Fries told HLN's Nancy Grace on Tuesday night that comments by Plumadore during the investigation indicated he was key to solving the case. Michael L. Plumadore, 39, is charged with one count of murder in the death of Aliahna Lemmon, whose remains were found Monday night. In the probable cause affidavit released Tuesday, investigators with the Allen County Sheriff's Department said Plumadore eventually admitted striking the girl repeatedly in the head with a brick while she stood on the front steps of his mobile home in the early hours of December 22. The man accused of killing a 9-year-old Indiana girl allegedly told police he beat her in the head with a brick, dismembered her body and stored parts of it in his freezer, according to court documents released Tuesday. Plumadore, described as a family friend, was being held without bond Tuesday after his initial court appearance.
