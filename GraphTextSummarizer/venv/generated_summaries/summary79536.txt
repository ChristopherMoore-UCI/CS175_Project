Pierre and Yolande Korkie were kidnapped in Taiz province in May of last year while on their way back to South Africa for the funeral of Pierre Korkie's father. While Pierre taught in Yemen, Yolande worked in hospitals doing relief work. The official SAPA news agency reported in January that Pierre and Yolande Korkie had been married for 20 years. Pierre Korkie, the South African man who was killed during a U.S. Special Operations Forces raid in Yemen on Friday, was a "respected teacher" who served the poor, according to videos made by his widow before his death. Korkie and American photojournalist Luke Somers were fatally shot in an al Qaeda compound by a terrorist as a secret mission to rescue the hostages unfolded, a U.S. official told CNN.
