Prince William's shield was given to him on his 18th birthday by the queen and shows various royal emblems from different parts of the United Kingdom, while Catherine's shield is from the Middleton family's coat of arms. -- A new coat of arms to represent Prince William and his wife, Catherine, as a married couple was unveiled Friday, more than two years after their televised wedding was watched by people around the globe. That coat of arms was granted to Catherine's father, Michael Middleton, in March 2011, ahead of the couple's April wedding, the palace said. If any British citizens living in England, Northern Ireland or Wales want to follow in the Middleton family's footsteps, they can also apply to the College of Arms in London for their own coat of arms, according to the body's website, while Scots can apply in Edinburgh. The coat of arms was approved by William's grandmother, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, earlier this year but was shown publicly for the first time Friday.
