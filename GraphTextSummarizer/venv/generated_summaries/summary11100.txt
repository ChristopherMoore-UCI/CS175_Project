Rescue officials are at the scene helping to pull people from the rubble. The hospital has called in all doctors and nurses who were not working Friday to deal with the emergency, the spokeswoman said, as ambulances brought people in. He said the area was not very busy because it was a diplomatic district, with the Liberian and U.S.embassies nearby, but that there were people working there. Bomb squad officers and other security teams were sent to the scene, deputy police spokesman Yemi Ajayi said. Zoran Jovanovic, head of mission for the International Red Cross in Abuja, said the explosion was heard at 10:15 a.m. local time.
