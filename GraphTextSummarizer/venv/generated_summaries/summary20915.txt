According to the survey, 50 percent of Americans believe the GOP taking control of the House and the Senate next year will be bad for America, and 52 percent expect it to lead to more gridlock. Half of Americans believe Republican control of both chambers of Congress will be bad for the country, and a majority say it will in fact cause more gridlock in Washington, according to a new CNN/ORC nationwide poll. Democratic Party approval levels, meanwhile, have remained static. Sixty-eight percent of Americans polled say the GOP isn't cooperating enough with President Barack Obama, while 57 percent say it's Obama who's not cooperating enough with the GOP. Indeed, the CNN/ORC poll shows that a vast majority of Americans — 74 percent — saw the GOP's wins earlier this month as a repudiation of Democratic policies, far more than the 16 percent who saw it as a mandate for Republicans to pass their own.
