While the number of goals per game had been trending down since the 1994 World Cup held in the United States, this tournament has seen an early explosion in the number of balls hitting the back of the net. Seferovic's 93rd minute goal was the latest anyone has ever scored in World Cup group play, according to ESPN. But entering this year's World Cup, much of the focus lay on Messi's lack of goal scoring in the 2010 tournament, which ended with a 4-0 Argentine loss to Germany in the quarterfinals. It was the first goal confirmed by goal line technology -- introduced at this World Cup by FIFA. While the fans at the stadium watched replays and booed the referee's call, new goal line technology showed it was indeed a goal.
