-- Australia is emerging from the grip of its strongest La Nina weather pattern on record -- a meteorological event that brings either devastating floods or, in the case of its counterpart El Nino, scorching droughts. Its opposite effect, El Nino, is usually marked by wetter weather over South America. "There was a very slow moving trough over inland Australia that stretched from the far northwest, through the Northern Territory and on to the southeast including New South Wales and Victoria," said Jenny Sturrock, acting senior meteorologist at the National Metereological Centre. The Bureau of Meteorology's Indigenous Weather Knowledge project aims to build a weather map of Australia based on knowledge of weather patterns from indigenous communities. Under this system, a startlingly complex mosaic of weather patterns is being mapped.
