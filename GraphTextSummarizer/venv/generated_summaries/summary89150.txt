See who's on Obama's short list for cabinet posts Â» Dan Pfeiffer, current communications director with the transition team, will be Obama's deputy communications director. He began work with the Obama campaign in January 2007 as traveling press secretary before returning to Chicago, Illinois, to work as communications director. Gibbs, an Auburn, Alabama, native who has worked for Sen. Fritz Hollings, the Democratic Senatorial Committee and Sen. John Kerry's presidential campaign, was communications director and then a senior strategist for the Obama campaign. A senior Obama aide told CNN there has been no development on a possible Clinton appointment since they informed CNN Thursday that she is "on track" to be nominated for secretary of state. Unlike Gibbs and Pfeiffer, Moran is not already on Obama's communications team.
