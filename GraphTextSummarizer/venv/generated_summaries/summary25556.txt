By whom, no one can say for sure, but Syria's merciless war does not differentiate between combatant and civilian -- and it is leaving behind countless children like Maram who have lost one or both parents along with their innocence. "We're trying to raise our children away from all of the ideologies happening inside Syria," Beyti's co-founder Yakzan Shishakly tells us, alluding to the radical extremist violent Muslim ideology that is thriving in his homeland. At Beyti there is bath time, fresh clothes, and beds to sleep on. Their fathers are all dead -- some lost to illness and some, like Maram's dad, to the violence consuming Syria. "There were some cases that were very obvious, those were the cases of anger and aggression," says Mayada Abdi, head of the orphanage, describing some of the children who have come to Beyti since it opened.
