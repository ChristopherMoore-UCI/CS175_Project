As a result, there were cases in which the military had to let suspected drug traffickers or other criminals escape because there was not a police officer available to make an arrest, Flores said. In an effort to purge its national police force of corruption, the Honduran Congress voted to empower its military to carry out most police duties for at least 18 months. The Honduran military had already been involved in operations against Mexican drug cartels operating in the country, but the new rules will give them more powers. Tuesday night's vote gives the military a broad mandate over day-to-day crime fighting in the country, and gives the armed forces additional powers against organized crime in the country. The decree gives the military the power to make arrests, searches, and execute warrants in police matters.
