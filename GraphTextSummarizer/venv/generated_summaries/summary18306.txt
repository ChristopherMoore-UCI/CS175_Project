The race was a celebration of sport in a citywide event that drew international attention and competition. The marathon course took runners along the West Bank separation barrier, into the Aida refugee camp, and under guard towers. For runners like Jamaani, the marathon is a statement made one step at a time. In its third year, the marathon drew runners from all over the world, pilgrims of a sort making a journey to the holy land, not for religion, but for sport. For Jamaani, this isn't just a race for time.
