"Really all it would have taken was a split second for him to impact the lives of several people, possibly killing someone just by his very actions," Salazar told CNN affiliate KSAT last week. The video was posted to the police Facebook page under Rodriguez's name, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. -- Police say the motorcyclist raced through traffic at reckless speeds in San Antonio, Texas, then posted a video to Facebook last week titled "Catch Me If You Can." It turns out, they could. It shows a motorcyclist dangerously cutting through rush hour traffic in San Antonio at speeds of more than 100 mph, according to authorities. Last week, authorities announced that they believed Rodriguez was the motorcyclist.
