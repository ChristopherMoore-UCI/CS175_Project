Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts is threatening to "shut down the Senate" with a Ted Cruz-style filibuster if President Barack Obama tries to thwart the congressional ban on moving Guantanamo Bay detainees into U.S. prisons. Obama's options could include vetoing an annual bill setting military policy, which since 2010 has included the ban on transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United States, or he could attach a signing statement saying he considers that restriction an infringement on his executive power, the Wall Street Journal reported. The possibility of transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United States could be a dangerous one for Democrats. The White House denied a Wall Street Journal report that it is considering ways to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, which could lead to detainees being transferred into the continental United States. Boehner also quickly sought to parlay the report into an advantage for Republicans in the Nov. 4 midterm elections, saying that "each and every Democrat should make their position known" and pledging that the House GOP would oppose any effort to keep detainees housed in Guantanamo Bay out of the United States.
