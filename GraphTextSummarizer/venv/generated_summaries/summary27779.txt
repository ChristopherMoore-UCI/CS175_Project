Like many hardworking Americans earning minimum wage, Margaret Lewis knows firsthand what it's like to live on the edge. It is incumbent on members of Congress to raise the federal minimum wage and index it to inflation, putting more money into the pockets of ordinary Americans to boost our economy and aid a real, long-term recovery. We have little reason to expect large corporations that are the principal employers of low-wage workers to voluntarily offer higher pay; rock bottom wages are a core profit-making strategy for retail giants and fast food chains. Nor does reality match the myth that prosperity at the top will eventually "trickle down" to workers at the bottom: corporate profits are at their highest level as a share of GDP, and wages at their lowest, since the 1950s. The federal minimum wage hasn't kept up with inflation, but CEO pay has risen 725% over the last 30 years and 80% of all real income growth has gone to the richest 1% of Americans.
