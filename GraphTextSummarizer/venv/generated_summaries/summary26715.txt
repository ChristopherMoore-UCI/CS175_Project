Watch Dr. Anne Schuchat discuss availability of H1N1 vaccine Â» Georgia, for example, is going to get less than half of the amount of H1N1 vaccine that it was expecting to receive this month, state Public Health Commissioner Dr. Rhonda Medows said. As of Wednesday, 11.4 million doses of flu vaccine were available to be ordered and 8 million doses had been ordered by state health departments, the CDC said. The CDC had hoped that about 40 million doses of H1N1, or swine flu, vaccine would be available by the end of October. CDC believes that up to 12 million fewer doses of H1N1 vaccine than expected will be available by month's end.
