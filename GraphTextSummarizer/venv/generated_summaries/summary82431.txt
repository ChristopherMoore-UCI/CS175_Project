The former French colony asked France and the United States to help ensure "the rebels return home...instead of destroying and killing Central Africans," President Francois Bozize said. They should fix what is happening." France has a permanent presence of 200 to 300 military personnel at Bangui's airport under the mandate of the Economic Community of Central African States. That was where Bozize made his remarks asking for foreign help, said Margaret Vogt, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general. The president of the Central African Republic asked Thursday for help from other nations to stave off rebel advances that threaten his rule. But French President Francois Hollande said Thursday that the troops are not intended to "protect a regime" against the advance of the rebels, but instead French nationals and interests.
