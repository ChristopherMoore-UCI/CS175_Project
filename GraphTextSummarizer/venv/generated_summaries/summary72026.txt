The incredible discovery of the Higgs boson will open up new ways of probing the part of the universe that is invisible to our everyday senses: beyond ordinary matter, into the extraordinary world of dark matter. We know enough about dark matter to be sure that it's not just some kind of ordinary matter that is hiding in the shadows. Likewise, in our galaxy, dark matter and ordinary matter pass right through each other all the time. In many of those models, the Higgs is the one particle that readily interacts both with ordinary protons and neutrons and also with dark matter. But once we better understand the Higgs and the particles it decays into, we might be able to infer the presence of dark matter just by process of elimination, by pinpointing events in which more energy went into the collision than we detected coming out.
