Syrian state television said security forces raided the village of al-Bayda to capture terrorists. At least 32 people died in violence across Syria on Friday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said. -- A fire broke out at Damascus International Airport when two mortar shells fired by rebels hit a kerosene tank and a parked plane Friday, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said. CNN cannot independently verify reports of casualties in Syria because access by international media is heavily restricted. Meanwhile, the death toll after a Thursday raid by government troops in the Syrian coastal region of Banias could be as high as 150 people, activists said Friday.
