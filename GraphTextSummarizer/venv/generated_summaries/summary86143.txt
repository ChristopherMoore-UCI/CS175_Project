On Tuesday Kim Dahl and Arrianna visited the site of the collapse -- where the new I-35 West bridge stands. Kim Dahl is among 122 victims and their families who've filed suit against URS Corp., an engineering and construction firm hired by Minnesota DOT to conduct engineering analysis on the bridge before it collapsed. Kim Dahl has had to give up what her husband Dave Dahl would call the "wilder motor sports," and the five of them have taken on a new hobby: road trips. For 13-year-old Arrianna Merritt, the words mother and hero go hand in hand. "They did not do what they promised to do -- and as a result -- that bridge collapsed."
