Opponents cite studies indicating that wages and growth are lower in right-to-work states, and they say that such legislation is little more than an effort to bleed unions in the name of worker freedom and choice. In states without right-to-work laws, 10.8% of the workforce belonged to unions. " Critics also say that such laws allow nonunion workers to "freeload" -- gain the benefits of union representation without shouldering the burden of paying for it. Michigan's storied labor movement and its allies mobilized last week to stop Republican-backed legislation that would give workers the right to opt out of union membership and, critics say, weaken unions. The battle over right-to-work legislation in Michigan has renewed debate over labor policy and the role of unions in the American economy.
