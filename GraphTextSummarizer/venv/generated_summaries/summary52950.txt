Polly Beltramo, 46, of Palo Alto, is accused of biting a 2-year-old girl and a baby boy on the cheek at BookBuyers in Mountain View on Thursday, police said. Beltramo has been arrested on felony child abuse, police said. "Suddenly a little boy, who was just a couple of months old, started screaming," Reed told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. "I went to him and his cheek was bleeding." Beltramo allegedly fled the store and was later found at a nearby coffee shop, police said. Bookstore owner Rammurti Reed said he heard the girl screaming and saw a red welt on her cheek.
