Particularly concerning, U.S. officials say, is the potential for instability in the countries where Ebola is rampant and the possibility for the virus to mutate into a more dangerous form. "If we do not arrest that growth, and don't arrest that growth now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of cases." Epidemiologists and others who are monitoring the disease have claimed developed countries like the United States haven't sent enough resources to the region, and U.S. officials acknowledge that Tuesday's announcement reflects the fact that more needs to be done to stop Ebola's spread. On Tuesday Obama will announce significant new U.S. efforts to combat the Ebola epidemic, which has moved quickly across the western part of Africa and sent governments there scrambling to respond. The U.S. has committed more than $100 million in the effort to combat Ebola, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Obama plans to call on Congress to approve an additional $88 million as part of a bill to fund the federal government. The efforts of the United States -- deemed more extensive than any previous U.S. response to an epidemic -- have so far been unable to stop the spread of the deadly virus, which Obama and White House officials are calling a national security problem.
