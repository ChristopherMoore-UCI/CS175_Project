President Obama's decision to order a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq by the end of the year will most likely lead to disaster. The president defends his actions on the basis of his campaign pledge to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq and former President George W. Bush's withdrawal timeline of 2011. Two weeks ago, Iraq publicly defended the actions of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, an early and telling sign that Iraq was preparing for the withdrawal of American forces. But should we see the loss of Iraq and the rise of Iran, all this will be for naught. Under Obama's plan, a mere 160 U.S. troops would stay in Iraq to guard the U.S. Embassy.
