"Others will discover other things on TheBlaze TV which they might like more." If people were surprised by the takedown of the O'Keefe video, Beck says it's because they don't remember who he was before his Fox News days. The series garnered strong praise from places such as long-time Beck nemesis Media Matters. While the numbers are strong, that is still a significant reduction from Beck's nightly audience when he worked at Fox News and talked to millions on the traditional media outlet. "I think that's people forgetting who I was and what I was saying when I was on CNN before Barack Obama," said Beck, who was a Headline News host from 2006 to 2008. The online network that airs Beck's program also has shows such as "Real News," a news roundtable show; "The B.S. of A," a comedy show; "Liberty Treehouse," a children's program; and "Independence USA," a reality show.
