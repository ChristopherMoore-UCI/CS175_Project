-- Turkey moved one step closer to prosecuting the senior commanders behind a military coup in 1980 when a Turkish court approved on Tuesday a prosecutor's indictment of retired army general and former president Kenan Evren, semi-official Anatolian Agency reported. The overthrow brought an end to years of bloody killings between right- and left-wing Turkish militants, and many prominent voices in Turkey and abroad initially welcomed the coup. "Ending the belief of impunity is very, very important," said Congar of 'Taraf' newspaper, which has published many damning reports about the Turkish military in recent years. Hugh Pope, co-author of "Turkey Unveiled," said the coup "brought Turkish politics back to the kindergarten. "September 12th is the mother of all coups in Turkey's history," said Yasemin Congar, columnist and deputy editor of the Turkish daily newspaper "Taraf."
