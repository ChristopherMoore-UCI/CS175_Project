A personal irony for the director is that, for the 14 months Jones was making this movie about family togetherness in the United States, he was away from his own family in England. "I'm hoping it might catch the moment, and it might catch the Christmas spirit and the Thanksgiving spirit," director-writer Kirk Jones told CNN over coffee in Hollywood. The movie is targeted at people with parents, brothers, sisters or children, Jones said. Audiences emerged from preview screenings thinking about their own parents or children, Jones said. But Jones, a British director best known as the writer-director of the 1998 surprise hit "Waking Ned Devine," made this into an American story.
