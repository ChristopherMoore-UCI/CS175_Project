We already have Chinese companies winning contracts in Saudi Arabia on railway constructions, on plant constructions, and down the road it will be services. If the Gulf wants to get up to speed in the quickest time possible it will need Chinese engineers, construction companies and equipment companies. And with China's 30 years' experience in developing its own infrastructure and the standard of Chinese engineering, there's a lot going for Chinese companies. VC: There's enormous interest from the Gulf to look into China and that's partly because of the trend of the fund flow from the West to the East. -- Victor Chu is chairman and CEO of Chinese investment firm, First Eastern Investment Group.
