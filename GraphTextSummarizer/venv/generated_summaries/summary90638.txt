The victory in Val d'Isere was the 61st World Cup win of Vonn's career, which means she is just one win away from equaling the all-time record held by Annemarie Moser-Proell. " Vonn leads the downhill World Cup standings on 232 points ahead of joint Olympic downhill champion Tina Maze, who finished seventh. American ski star Lindsey Vonn exorcised the ghosts of a grueling fight back from injury with victory on the slopes of Val d'Isere, Saturday. A year ago on the same snow, the 30-year-old aggravated a right knee injury, which ended her season and quashed her hopes of defending her downhill crown at the 2014 Winter Olympics. But Vonn -- who credits her golf star boyfriend Tiger Woods with inspiring her comeback -- underlined her return to form at the famous French ski resort with a dominant downhill World Cup win on the OK piste.
