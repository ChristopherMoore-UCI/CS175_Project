Oklahoma will seek the death penalty for Alton Alexander Nolen, 30, who is charged with first-degree murder in the beheading of a 54-year-old woman at his former workplace, District Attorney Greg Mashburn said in a court document Thursday. Nolen was trying "to get revenge on certain people he felt responsible" for his job loss, Mashburn said. Nolen also faces an attempted murder charge in the stabbing attack on another woman, as well as a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, Mashburn said previously. The large kitchen knife used in the attack came from Nolen's home, Mashburn said.
