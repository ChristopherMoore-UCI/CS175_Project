Dhegani Mahato was attacked and set on fire by family members and others after a shaman allegedly accused her of casting a spell to make one of her relatives sick, Police Officer Hira Mani Baral said. The attack occurred Friday in Bagauda in Chitwan district, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu, Baral said by telephone. -- A 40-year-old mother of two was burned alive in central Nepal after she was accused of being a witch, police said Saturday. Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai appealed to the people not to heed to shamans and faith healers. "Those arrested have confessed to their crime and will be charged with murder," Baral said.
