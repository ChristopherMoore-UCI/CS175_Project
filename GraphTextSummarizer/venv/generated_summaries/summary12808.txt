"She came back with mixed emotions," Mel Coulter told CNN affiliate WSVN in Miami, Florida. But Charisa Coulter's heart remains in Haiti, her father said, because her best friend, Laura Silsby is now alone behind bars. The 10 Americans, many of whom belong to a Baptist church in Idaho, have said they were trying to help the children get to a safe place after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake flattened cities and towns in Haiti. Coulter, Silsby and eight other Americans had been detained in Haiti on suspicion of kidnapping 33 children after the killer earthquake January 12. The missionaries were stopped by Haitian authorities on January 29 as they tried to cross the border with 33 children without proper legal documentation.
