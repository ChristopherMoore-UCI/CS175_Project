"We know that there is already great anticipation building for the next super hero film from Zack Snyder, and we are equally eager to see what he has in store for Superman and Batman as they share the big screen for the first time ever," said Veronika Kwan Vandenberg, president of Warner Bros. Pictures' international distribution. "Peter Pan has delighted people of every generation for more than a century, so we are thrilled to bring him back to the screen next summer for today's moviegoers," said Dan Fellman, president of Warner Bros. Pictures' domestic distribution. It may not be much consolation to those fans, but Warner Bros. also announced that a new Peter Pan adventure film will take the July 17, 2015, release slot vacated by Superman and Batman. Warner Bros. Pictures decided to delay the release of the so-far untitled movie until May 6, 2016, to give "filmmakers time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story," the studio said Friday. -- Superman and Batman fans will have to wait another two years before the two superheroes meet on the big screen.
