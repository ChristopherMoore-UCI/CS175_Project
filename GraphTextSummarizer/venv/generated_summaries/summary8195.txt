Editor's note: Bryan Batt, who plays the closeted art director Salvatore Romano in the Emmy award-winning cable TV series "Mad Men," has acted in nine Broadway and nine Off-Broadway productions, such as "Sunset Boulevard," "Beauty and the Beast," "Jeffrey" and "Starlight Express." Batt: My real Broadway break was in "Starlight Express." Now, out gays and lesbians such as TV host Ellen DeGeneres and pop singer Clay Aiken are featured on the cover of People magazine. "We have to work toward acceptance on all levels," says actor Bryan Batt, who is openly gay. They should show people who are living their good, healthy, responsible, productive lives as role models who just happen to be gay.
