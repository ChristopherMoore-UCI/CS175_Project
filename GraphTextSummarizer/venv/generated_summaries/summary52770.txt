"I think that when you keep these secrets, and something that you learn as you read more and go into treatments and get help is, that these secrets kill," Brady told "ET" Monday. And when you have a job like Brady's, some assume that you wouldn't be prone to depression to begin with. It was a battle that he kept to himself until an interview Monday with "Entertainment Tonight," when he said that Robin Williams' recent death made him realize how important it was to speak publicly about facing depression. No, I'm not always happy, because I'm human." Depression was a factor when Brady's marriage ended in 2006, but it wasn't until his 42nd birthday in June that Brady knew he needed to seek help. Williams, who had been dealing with severe depression, was found dead of an apparent suicide in August at the age of 63.
