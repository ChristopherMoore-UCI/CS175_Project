This week, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is announcing new recommendations for Pap tests to screen women for cervical cancer. â€¢ Women who have been vaccinated against HPV should begin cervical cancer screening at the same age as unvaccinated women, i.e. at age 21. Today, death from cervical cancer is relatively rare in the U.S. In 2009, about 4,000 American women died of cancer of the cervix. For women 30 and over, Pap tests should be done every three years. The new guidelines advise women to reduce the number of tests they receive over their lifetime.
