Egypt's military has launched a plan to swiftly enact constitutional reforms, an important step to get the embattled Arab nation back in working order, political and military figures said Tuesday. The military has formed "an apolitical and independent constitutional committee" to propose constitutional reforms within 10 days, according to Wael Ghonim, the activist who spearheaded the protests that toppled of former President Hosni Mubarak's regime. State media reported Tuesday that 3,000 police officers protested outside police headquarters in the central city of Sohaj for better working conditions, pay raises and the removal of their superiors. It also reported that Mohammed Tantawi, head of the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, met Tuesday with the panel to make sure plans are on target for the reforms. The ministry created a Facebook page in an attempt to bring back "good relations with the public and improve the image of Egyptian police," according to a statement carried by state media.
