Injured Tendulkar gets World Cup call "It's a little bit frustrating, especially when you're in a little bit of form, but the selectors have been building towards this for a while now and they're plans and unfortunately I've not been in it," he admitted. -- Ashes hero Alastair Cook has all but given up hope of playing for England in the World Cup in the sub-continent next month. Cook told CNN that he is in direct competition for an opening slot with captain Andrew Strauss and does not rate his chances of inclusion very highly when the final 15-man line-up is announced on Wednesday. Whether he gains a place for the World Cup, or gets a call-up later during the tournament as a replacement, Cook's place in cricket history is assured after a hitting double century and two other centuries as England emphatically retained the Ashes Down Under. "To achieve that, and the manner in which we achieved it, was very special," he said. Yet, ironically, the Essex opener's place was under threat for the tour after a sorry run of form in England's summer Tests which left him low on confidence and self-belief.
