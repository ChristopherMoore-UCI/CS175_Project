Nurses describe alleged assault by Kennedy son He said one of the nurses had been trying to "exercise unnecessary control over the behavior of the father and son," and lunged at the pair. After Kennedy was arraigned in February, his attorney released a statement stating that nurses initially agreed to let him take the baby outside and demanding "appropriate disciplinary action" be taken against Lane and Luciano.
