"The growth aspect has tended to receive much more attention than the darker side of the Indian story," Professor Babu Mathew, Country Director of Action Aid India, told CNN, "More and more the poverty goes unnoticed, and there is less and less of a voice for the excluded peoples." The result has been a massive explosion of wealth creation among the middle and upper echelons of Indian society, with Indian billionaires now occupying four of the top eight slots on the annual Forbes rich list. Director Danny Boyle's film "Slumdog Millionaire" shines a stark light on poverty in India. Both are based in modern day India, both feature characters who succeed against all the odds, and both have garnered considerable critical acclaim, with "Slumdog Millionaire" recently awarded the three top prizes at the British Independent Film Awards. Above all, both narratives shine a stark light on poverty -- an aspect of Indian society that has increasingly been pushed into the background by a decade and more of upbeat headlines about the country's dramatic economic growth.
