-- Part of Paris Charles de Gaulle airport was evacuated Friday due to the accumulation of snow on the roof, and hundreds of flights were canceled because of a shortage of de-icing fluid, authorities said. Paris' second airport, Orly, has not had to cancel flights because they are not running out of glycol, which is using for de-icing, authorities said. About a foot of snow had fallen on the roof Friday by the time authorities decided to close the terminal, French media reports said. Dublin airport was experiencing delays Friday because of de-icing and because airplanes are in the wrong places after the week's disruptions, it said in a statement. Nearly 2,000 passengers were moved from Terminal 2E to other parts of the airport, authorities said, calling the measure "preventative."
