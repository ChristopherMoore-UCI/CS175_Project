Like the freshman Manziel, the other two finalists represented potential firsts among Heisman winners: Te'o would have been the first exclusively defensive player to win the trophy and Klein the first Kansas State player. He bested a field of finalists that included Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te'o and Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein. Manziel received 474 first-place votes, cast by past winners and members of the media, to 321 for Te'o and 60 for Klein. Other vote-getters were Southern Cal wide receiver Marquis Lee and Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller. -- Texas A&M freshman quarterback Johnny Manziel on Saturday was named the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner, making history.
