-- Federal investigators at the Nestle USA plant in Danville, Virginia, have found evidence of E. coli bacteria in an unopened package of raw chocolate chip cookie dough, two sources at the Food and Drug Administration told CNN Monday. All of the infected persons had been confirmed as having the outbreak strain of E. coli 0157:H7, the CDC said Monday. A spokeswoman for Nestle said the company's baking division was informed Monday of the finding. Thirty-four people have been hospitalized and nine developed a kidney disease called hemolytic uremic syndrome. The tainted sample was manufactured last February 10 at the Nestle Plant in Danville, said the sources, both of whom requested anonymity.
