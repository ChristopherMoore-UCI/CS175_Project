Celski jumped right into rehabilitation under the care of Dr. Eric Heiden, the speed skating legend who is now an orthopedic surgeon, and then Dr. Bill Moreau, the director for sports medicine clinics for the U.S. Olympic Committee. And then inexplicably, two of the South Koreans crashed, and the 19-year-old Celski followed teammate Apolo Anton Ohno across the finish line to stunningly finish second and third. He is working so, so hard," Moreau told freelance writer Joanne C. Gerstner in early November. Before his injury, Celski was the heir apparent to now six-time medallist Ohno. He finally got back on the ice on November 16, just eight weeks before the Olympics.
