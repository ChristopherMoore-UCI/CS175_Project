Chavez said that he called and wrote to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad seeking the hikers' release at the behest of actor Sean Penn. In response to a report that his health was failing and that he had been rushed to the hospital, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said Thursday that he had the best proof that his recovery from chemotherapy is advancing fine. The Nuevo Herald, citing two unidentified sources who said they were witnesses, reported Thursday that Chavez had been taken to a military hospital on Tuesday because of kidney complications. Chavez said he considers Penn a friend, and after the two spoke about the hikers, he agreed to add his voice directly with the Iranian president. Last week, a representative for Penn confirmed a report that Penn had flown to Venezuela months ago to speak about the hikers' plight with Chavez.
