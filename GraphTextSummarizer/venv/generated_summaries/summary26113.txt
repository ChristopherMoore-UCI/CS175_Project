Burns was assigned to the Loughner case by the 9th Circuit Court, where he's based, after Arizona federal judges recused themselves from the case because their state's chief federal judge was allegedly killed by Loughner. Loughner, 22, is accused of shooting U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, and 18 other people on January 8, six of them fatally. But David Bodney, an attorney for two Arizona media outlets seeking the search warrant results, said federal officials have already released selective details of the search and added that the First Amendment and federal law provide "a strong presumptive right of public access" to the records. Friday's hearing was held in San Diego because presiding Judge Burns and Loughner's federal public defender, Judy Clarke, are based in the city. Federal prosecutors and Loughner's public defender have opposed requests to make public the photos, asserting Loughner's privacy rights and his 6th Amendment guarantee for a fair trial.
