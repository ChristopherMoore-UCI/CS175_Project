It was not a vintage display by Pep Guardiola's men in the wake of their Champions League semifinal second leg tie against Real Madrid in midweek. Espanyol, who are still chasing a Europa League place, offered stiff resistance in the Nou Camp, but Barcelona were always in command and Eric Abidal came off the bench for a second appearance after his successful recovery from a liver tumor. Goals from Andres Iniesta and Gerard Pique have taken Barcelona to 91 points, eight ahead of Real Madrid, who thrashed Sevilla 6-2 Saturday to keep alive their slim hopes. Barcelona will clinch the title Wednesday night if they avoid defeat against Levante. They will then turn their attentions to the Champions League final against Manchester United on May 28 at Wembley.
