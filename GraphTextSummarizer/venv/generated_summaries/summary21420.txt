Kellett boasts that Sprint subscribers can receive access to unlimited wireless data on 4G, whereas she expects other carriers will put caps on how much customers can download. Teresa Kellett, Sprint's director of 4G, said she doesn't foresee Verizon's (and eventually AT&T's) speed advantage being an issue. Rumors are flying that Apple will build an iPhone compatible with Verizon's network, a phone which may or may not use 4G. "We feel very strongly about our Evo," Dunleavy, the Sprint spokeswoman, said. Sprint, the third-largest U.S. cellular provider by number of subscribers, rolled out its first 4G city network two years ago in Baltimore, Maryland. "Wireless is a very competitive arena," acknowledged Sprint spokeswoman Kathleen Dunleavy.
