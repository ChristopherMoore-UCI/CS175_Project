"Congress did not and could not imbue corporations with the dignity interests that FOIA protects when it shields living, breathing human beings from invasions of personal privacy," said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel of the Constitutional Accountability Center. They want a blanket rule exempting corporations from personal privacy protections. "I suppose families have rights of personal privacy, don't they?" added Chief Justice Roberts, extending the term beyond individuals. The company said the material was exempt from public release, since it was collected strictly for "law enforcement purposes," according to court filings, and it argued that disclosure would cause an "unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. At issue is whether corporate "personhood" extends to the Freedom of Information Act, which exempts the public release of government documents that invade personal privacy.
