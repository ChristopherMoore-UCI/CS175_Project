It's an example of the extreme lengths Walt will go to keep his misdeeds a secret, which include ... 6.Letting Jane die ("Phoenix," season 2) Walt decides to let Jesse's relapsed-junkie girlfriend choke on her own vomit because she knows everything and is the one person he doesn't trust who can expose him. Running over bad guys ("Half Measures," season 3) To save Jesse, Walt uses his Pontiac Aztek, one of best comedic devices ever, as a battering ram to take out two drug dealers who, like Walt, work for Gus. Jesse killing Gale ("Full Measure," season 3) Gale, Walt's assistant in the super lab set up by Gus, is unaware that he's being groomed to take over so that Gus can kill Walt (Gus tells Gale that Walt is dying of cancer, which by this point is no longer true). Just as Walt is about to be killed by Gus' henchmen, he's able to get a message to Jesse, who does the only thing he can to save his partner. That final shot -- a slow zoom-in of a plant, lily of the valley, in Walt's backyard -- is the moment viewers realize it was Walt who gave berries from that plant to the son of Jesse's new girlfriend, which sets off a chain events leading to Gus' death.
