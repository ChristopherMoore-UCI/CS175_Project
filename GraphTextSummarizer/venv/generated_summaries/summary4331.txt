-- Midfielder Park Ji Sung ended his seven-year stay at Manchester United on Monday by signing a two-year contract with English Premier League team Queens Park Rangers. Meanwhile, Tottenham Hotspur have reached an agreement with Dutch champions Ajax for the transfer of Belgium defender Jan Vertonghen. He has been a big player for Manchester United and played a big part in their success in recent years. Vertonghen becomes new Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas' second signing after Icelandic midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson, who joined from Hoffenheim last week. During his time at Old Trafford, Park has won four Premier League titles and the European Champions League in 2008.
