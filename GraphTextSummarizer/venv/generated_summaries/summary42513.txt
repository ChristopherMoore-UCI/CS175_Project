It turns out (and some of you may already know this) that he is hardly the only victim of this scheme, both through e-mails and through social networking sites. I wasn't one sentence into reading the Kessler e-mail to Special Agent Jason Pack before he knew exactly what it was. This was not some e-mail from an address I'd never heard of, saying that a bank in Nigeria had $100 million waiting for me; this was from Kaye Kessler, from his regular e-mail address. People around the country had been receiving them; always, the e-mails had been asking for money to be sent. The people who receive the e-mails think they're from you, that you're in trouble and that you're turning to them for money.
