The second-degree murder indictment against Kryzie King, 27, comes five months after she allegedly beat and tortured little Myls Dobson while the boy was in her care in a Manhattan apartment, prosecutors said. The murder charge was added after the medical examiner's office concluded in April that Myls died from "child abuse syndrome including dehydration," said Julie Bolcer, spokeswoman for the New York City medical examiner's office. A review of the case later found that New York City child welfare caseworkers visited the boy's home nine times without even realizing that his father was in jail, city officials said. " Myls died January 8 after his father, Okee Wade, left the boy in King's care before Wade went to jail in connection with a fraud case, police said. On the day Myls died, King called 911 after allegedly assaulting him.
