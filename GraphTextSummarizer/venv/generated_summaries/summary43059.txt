Fees are not cheap but long waiting lists for international schools in places like Hong Kong and Singapore suggest that demand is strong. "International schools are now big business and there are many well-funded groups buying and building schools," ISC said. The Hong Kong government extended a HK$273 million interest-free construction loan to Harrow but critics said the move was too generous and more support should have been given to local schools. Other prominent schools targeting Asia include Wellington College and Dulwich College in China, Branksome Hall in and Dwight School in South Korea, Epsom College in Malaysia, and Haileybury in Kazakhstan. In Hong Kong, an influx of expatriate workers in recent years, combined with international schools' growing popularity among locals, has lead to a severe shortage of places.
