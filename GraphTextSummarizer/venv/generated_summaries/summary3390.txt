Working with the Cairo-based journalist Jack Shenker, Larkin produced a 6,000-word photo essay on satellite cities, called Cairo Divided, in English and Arabic, available for only the cost of postage and packing. In 1969 a development plan was launched to expand Greater Cairo into the surrounding deserts, according to a 2009 report by U.N. Habitat, the United Nations agency for human settlements Mohamed Elshahed, a doctoral student who started a blog, Cairobserver, on the city's architecture and urban planning, has also taken an interest in satellite cities. Larkin became interested after the American University of Cairo moved to a new campus in New Cairo in 2008. An hour or so drive from the chaotic and congested streets of downtown Cairo is a very different world. Elshahed said the main cities with names such as 6 October and 15 May, as well as New Cairo, were each made up of many individual developments, some a further 15 or 20 minutes drive into the desert.
