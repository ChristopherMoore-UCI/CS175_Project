This year, North Korea has made the usual protestations of the joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises, which it has referred in the past as "joint saber-rattling." The purpose of the new missiles are for North Korea to defend its waters and "strongly react to any attempt of the enemy's fleets of warships for military attack, through close combat or distant combat," according to North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency. "Whether the KPN (Korean People's Navy) acquired the system directly from Russia or a third party is unclear," wrote Joseph S. Bermudez  in the North Korea analysis site, 38 North. North Korea tested what it described as a new type of "cutting-edge" anti-ship missile with its leader Kim Jong Un pictured beaming at the launch, as shown in state media on Saturday. After the Korean War, which ended with an armistice in 1953, the U.S. has maintained military personnel in South Korea.
