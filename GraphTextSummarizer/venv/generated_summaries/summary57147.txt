"While size plays a role -- taller horses tend to have a longer stride -- I wouldn't necessarily say male horses have more stamina," said Rogers. "It tends to be that male horses are a bit bigger and taller than females -- a bit like men and women," said Rogers. " That said, stallions -- male horses which haven't been castrated -- can also be flighty, if somewhat more aggressive on the track, added Rogers. Try horse racing, where female jockeys regularly jump in the hot seat alongside their male counterparts. In British flat racing, 63% of horses are male, while 37% are female.
