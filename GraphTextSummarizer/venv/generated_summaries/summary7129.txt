Zelaya and Micheletti are Liberal Party members, and their rift splintered the party and may have hurt Santos. Lobo's legitimacy remains in doubt because Sunday's elections were held under the rule of interim President Roberto Micheletti, who assumed power after a June 28 coup ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Many nations said before the election they would withhold recognition if Zelaya were not returned to power. The United States on Monday urged Honduras to take the next steps toward resolving the crisis, such as having the nation's Congress vote on whether to restore Zelaya to power. The pact said Congress would vote on whether to reinstate Zelaya to power after consultation with the nation's Supreme Court and other bodies.
