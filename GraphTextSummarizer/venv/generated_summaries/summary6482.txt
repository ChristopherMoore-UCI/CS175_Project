-- Coast Guard and Air National Guard crews spent a second day in search of four sailors from a yacht that ran aground off San Francisco over the weekend, the services said Sunday. But the remaining four people aboard remained unaccounted for Sunday afternoon, and rescuers were searching a 15-by-30-mile patch of the Pacific Ocean in hopes of finding them alive. The search effort included three helicopters, a C-130 transport and four Coast Guard vessels, including the cutters Aspen, Pike and Sockeye. The vessel's skipper reported that the yacht was hit by a series of large waves that rolled it over, tossing several crew members overboard and running it aground, the Coast Guard said Sunday. Late last month, the Coast Guard rescued racers taking part in an around-the-world contest when a giant wave damaged their yacht off the coast of San Francisco.
