The country's subsidies led to an artificially low price for diesel and gasoline, which resulted in widespread smuggling of those products to neighboring countries, where smugglers sold it for a profit, Morales told CNN en Espa√±ol. The president of the Confederation of Private Business People, Daniel Sanchez Solis, disputed Morales' assertion that the business sector had orchestrated the demonstrations. -- Bolivian President Evo Morales on Thursday defended his decision to end fuel subsidies, a move that caused gasoline and diesel prices to spike and has led to protests in major cities since it was announced over the weekend. " Sanchez said he was not opposed to raising the price of petroleum products, but he criticized what he said was Morales' failure to consult with other sectors prior to acting. "I have a lot of faith." Morales also said his government will seek to counter the impact of the price increases by investing $300,000 per rural municipality across Bolivia to spur economic growth through the creation of infrastructure projects with an emphasis on irrigation.
