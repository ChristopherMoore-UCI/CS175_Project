She was referring to an unprecedented series of protests that erupted after Turkish riot police repeatedly attacked a peaceful sit-in in Istanbul's Gezi Park in May. Demonstrators had initially organized a small Occupy Wall Street-style protest against government plans to bulldoze the park and replace it with a shopping mall. "Police have systematically used tear gas as a weapon on hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, firing tear gas canisters and capsules directly at protesters at close range," the medical groups wrote in an open letter addressed to Erdogan. At least 30 suspects were detained, Turkey's semi-official Anatolian Agency reported, in connection with anti-government protests that erupted in Istanbul in late May. -- Turkish counter-terror police launched pre-dawn raids against scores of targets across Turkey's largest city Tuesday. For several days, riot police repeatedly attacked sit-in participants with pepper spray, tear gas and water cannons.
