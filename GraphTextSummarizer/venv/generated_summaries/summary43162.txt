" O.J. Simpson is appealing his conviction for charges including kidnapping and armed robbery. A jury in October 2008 convicted Simpson, 61, on charges including armed robbery and kidnapping. He was sentenced in December to serve a term of up to 33 years in prison, with eligibility for parole after nine years. The four received probation in exchange for their testimony; Stewart received a sentence similar to Simpson's, but will be eligible for parole in seven and a half years. " Simpson's conviction came on October 3 -- the 13th anniversary of his controversial acquittal in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman.
