Meyers will follow in the footsteps of prior Emmys hosts Neil Patrick Harris, Jimmy Kimmel, Jane Lynch and "SNL" alum Jimmy Fallon. "Seth's expertise and ease in front of a live audience during his time at 'SNL,' as well as his comedic brilliance both as a writer and in front of the camera on 'SNL' and 'Late Night,' makes him the perfect choice to host the Emmys," Paul Telegdy, the network's president of late night and alternative programming, said in a statement. Just a few months after leaving the sketch comedy series to take over NBC's "Late Night," the network has announced that Meyers has been tapped to host the 2014 Emmy Awards. The Emmy Awards, now in the 66th year, will air live on NBC on August 25. Billy Crystal to honor Robin Williams at Emmys
