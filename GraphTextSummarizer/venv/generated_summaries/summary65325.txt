Pay rise: Kaka could soon be earning $726,000 per week Reports circulated Wednesday that the AC Milan midfielder is being offered a Â£500,000 ($726,000) per WEEK salary by English Premier League club Manchester City. For example, the U.S. President receives about $7690 per week, while British Prime Minister Gordon Brown receives around $5233. Manchester City is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, a man believed to be worth about $22 billion -- so funding the salary shouldn't be a problem. Kaka's current salary at AC Milan was believed to be about $208,000 per week. A comparison of a variety of salaries shows just how highly footballers, and professional sportsmen and women are paid in relation to other jobs.
