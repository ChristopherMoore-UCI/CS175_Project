Sancoff is CEO of Juliet Marine Systems â€” maker of a futuristic-looking, 21st-century warship that he says can protect large Navy ships from attacks by small boats. " Traditionally the Navy "hasn't had much use for such small craft," Pike wrote to CNN via e-mail, "apart from inshore operations, since they generally don't operate well in the open ocean due to large waves. A year after unveiling Ghost and pricing it at $10 million per boat, the Navy has unofficially expressed interest, Sancoff said, but nothing more. "I love to pose the question: Where are the Googles, the Microsofts, the Apples, in the defense industry?" "A lot of times the reason why small companies don't venture into it is because the barriers of entry are so difficult." For its part, the Pentagon says there's no official "requirement" for Ghost. Now 14 years later, Sancoff said such attacks remain among the Navy's biggest threats.
