A week after the death of Brazilian presidential candidate Eduardo Campos in a plane accident, his running mate Marina Silva announced she would replace him on the ticket, setting the stage for a tighter race. The announcement was widely expected, and a poll released Monday showed that Silva, a well-known environmentalist, had a better chance of defeating President Dilma Rousseff in the Oct. 5 elections than Campos would have. At the news conference on Wednesday, the PSB also announced that Congressman Beto Albuquerque would be Silva's running mate. Silva unsuccessfully ran for president in 2010 for the country's Green Party. That would mean a run-off vote in which, according to the poll, Silva would garner 47% of the ballots, compared with 43% for Rousseff.
