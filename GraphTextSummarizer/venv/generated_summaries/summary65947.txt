Under the Bush administration, especially, industry succeeded in using federal laws as a shield against state regulation. But at the same time that the federal government is trying to do more, it is ironic to see federal law used to block state pollution controls. New federal regulations on pollution from electric power plants are a long-overdue step in the right direction. But when electric cars were first introduced, the Bush administration took the very unusual step of getting involved and siding with industry. It was probably a surprise to Congress that the effort to allow markets to control this industry gave the industry special immunity from the kinds of pollution regulations that apply to every other industry.
