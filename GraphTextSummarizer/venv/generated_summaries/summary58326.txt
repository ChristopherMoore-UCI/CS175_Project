Heyns said the executions "undermine previous steps towards the abolition of capital punishment in the Gambia. "I strongly condemn the executions that took place last week in the Gambia, and call for a halt to further executions," said Christof Heyns, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. The country once had been at the forefront in the region's efforts to abolish in law and practice the death penalty, with a moratorium on the death penalty for 27 years and the abolition of capital punishment for drug offenses in April 2011, Heyns said. Gambia's human rights record has drawn steady criticism since his election, but the president has won supporters by building new hospitals, schools and other infrastructure. -- The United Nations Tuesday urged the tiny West African country of Gambia to refrain from executing 39 more death-row inmates, after nine others were recently put to death.
