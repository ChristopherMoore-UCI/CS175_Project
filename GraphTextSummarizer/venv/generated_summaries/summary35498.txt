In his first public comments since the election, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid Wednesday pledged cooperation with Republicans when they take Senate control in January. "I am ready to work with him in good faith to make this institution function for the American people," Reid said while standing across the aisle from Sen. Mitch McConnell, who will take over as the next majority leader. Reid pointedly promised not to engage in a "strategy of obstruction," which he has accused Republicans of pursuing while Democrats were in charge. Despite the tough rhetoric, Reid also complimented McConnell and said he holds him in the "highest regards. " For his part, McConnell sounded emboldened when making his opening statement on the floor, immediately after Reid spoke.
