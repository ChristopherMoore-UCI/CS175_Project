Meanwhile tea party Republicans have bounced from Sarah Palin to Donald Trump to Michele Bachmann to Rick Perry to (now) Herman Cain, transfixing the media every time they lose faith in one messiah and search for another. But it cannot be excluded as utterly impossible, on two conditions: If the U.S. economy continues as weak and sick as it is today, and; If tea party Republicans revert from the utterly unelectable Herman Cain to Rick Perry, who as governor of Texas possesses at least the paper qualifications for the presidency. If candidate Romney loses, tea party Republicans will claim that the GOP lost because it failed to nominate a "true conservative." Tea party plans call for a radical shift in the burden of taxation from the rich to the poor -- and promise big reductions in government spending without touching any of the benefits of current retirees. From the point of view of non-tea party Republicans, this is the ideal outcome of the 2012 election.
