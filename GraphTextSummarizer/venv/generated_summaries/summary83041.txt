"We've never had a cannon not fire or miss a net, and I mean we're talking tens of thousands of cannon shots combined between us all," he told CNN in a telephone interview. The stunt show, which has been touring since 1991, features monster trucks, two-wheel driving, fire stunts and car crashes. David Smith Jr., who holds the Guinness Book of World Records entry for distance shot from a cannon (59.05 meters), said he had not before heard the terminology about a safety net's failure to engage, but said careful planning can make the shots less dangerous. The incident occurred in the afternoon during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show at the Kent County Showground, southeast of London, police said. The British Press Association, citing police, said a safety net failed to engage.
