The coalition says the no-fly zone imposed as part of a U.N. Security Council resolution aims to prevent further attacks by regime forces on Libyan citizens and opposition groups, especially around Benghazi. "Earlier this afternoon, over 110 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from both U.S. and British ships and submarines -- struck more than 20 integrated air defense systems and other air defense facilities ashore," U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney told reporters. The senior military official said earlier that phase two of the mission would include planes flying over Libyan airspace near Tripoli, and in the Mediterranean Sea near Benghazi. Obama noted that military action "is not an outcome that the U.S. or any of our partners sought," pointing out that Gadhafi was offered the opportunity to comply with an immediate cease-fire. The initial mission will be commanded by U.S. Army Gen. Carter Ham and U.S. Africa Command.
