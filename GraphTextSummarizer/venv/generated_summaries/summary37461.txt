Satellites and other spacecraft are an integral part of navigation, weather, space science, earth science and ultra-fast global communications -- not to mention robotic and human exploration. The payload sits atop a huge amount of fuel, often weighing many times more than the satellite or material being sent into space. The first stage has to do the most work because it lifts the full weight of payload plus fuel from a dead stop. To increase the weight of the payload a rocket can lift, more fuel is needed, enough to lift the extra payload weight and lift the weight of the extra fuel. That accelerates the rocket faster because at no point are any rocket stages dead weight.
