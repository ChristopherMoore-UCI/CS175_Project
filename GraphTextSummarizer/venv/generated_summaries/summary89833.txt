Can we please stop saying, "Happy New Year?" Believe me, there are some odd superstitions out there that will supposedly bring you luck for the year, from kissing a loved one as the clock strikes midnight to writing your new year's wishes on a piece of paper and planting it in the ground to eating lentils or black-eyed peas on New Year's Day. Telling people "Happy New Year" more than a week after the first of the year is like keeping your Christmas lights up until February. But among the vast array of omens that predict good fortune for the coming year, not one involves saying Happy New Year's for weeks on end. However, even if you are reading this after January 7, I still sincerely wish you, and your family, a very happy and healthy New Year.
