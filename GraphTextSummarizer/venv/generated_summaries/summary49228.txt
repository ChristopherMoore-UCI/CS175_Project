Snowden in transit through Moscow was a chance to posture as a defender of human rights in answer to Western -- for them most woundingly U.S. -- comments on the recent Russian record. And the Russian president tried to mitigate the possible provision of asylum for Snowden by the condition that he would not be permitted to harm Russia's US "partners" while under Moscow's protection. Snowden has been allowed to stay at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow -- or at least so it is said -- for too long simply to be handed over to U.S. officials. There have also been Russians, concerned to work for human rights in their own country, more ready than ever to believe that the West has let them down in contesting renewed Kremlin pressure on civil society, and who have been willing to use Snowden as a symbol of their commitment to universal values. It merely puts the case into a different context, while making it harder for Moscow to return him to face trial in the U.S., to send him off to another country, or to grant him permanent asylum in Russia for that matter.
