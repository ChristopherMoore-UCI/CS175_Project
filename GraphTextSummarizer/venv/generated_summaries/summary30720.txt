The March 11, 2004, train bombings in Madrid, Spain, which killed 190 people, were not suicide attacks nor orchestrated by al Qaeda central, but its doctrine certainly motivated the plotters. British services have foiled plots linked to al Qaeda since the 2005 transportation bombings, and Israel has significantly reduced the plethora of suicide attacks it once faced. Indeed, the Mumbai attacks had all the hallmarks of a powerful transnational terrorist group inspired by the ideology of al Qaeda. Some have suggested the Mumbai attacks cannot have a transnational connection because al Qaeda uses the tactic of suicide bombers and does not indulge in hostage-taking. Likewise, although al Qaeda may not have directly planned and coordinated the Mumbai attacks, the gunmen were clearly inspired by the goals and ideology that Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri preach.
