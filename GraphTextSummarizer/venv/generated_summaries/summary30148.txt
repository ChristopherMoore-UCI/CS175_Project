When he opened the studio for production four years ago, Perry named the backlot 34th Street, "as in Miracle on 34th Street." A large fire at the southwest Atlanta film studio of Tyler Perry on Tuesday night damaged the backlot facade of one of Perry's sound stages, according to a statement from the studio Wednesday. "Mr. Perry wishes to express his heartfelt thanks to the Atlanta fire department for their professionalism in their quick response and limiting the damage," the studio said. Officials do not know what started the fire, said Atlanta Fire Capt. The multimillion-dollar studios sit on 60 acres and include five sound stages, a 5-acre pond, a theater, a chapel, a commissary, a gymnasium, Perry's office, an art department where sets are designed, hair and makeup facilities, a wardrobe department, set decoration, a post-production facility and the backlot, according to the studio website.
