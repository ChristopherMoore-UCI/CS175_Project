The justices will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a dispute involving contraception coverage and religious liberty. The church-state issue now in the spotlight involves three-pronged rules negotiated last year between the Obama administration and various outside groups. Obamacare's supporters say it does not require individual company owners to personally provide coverage they might object to but instead places that responsibility on the corporate entity. The large retailer says it already provides coverage for 16 federally approved forms of contraception -- such as condoms and diaphragms -- for its roughly 13,000 employees, who Hobby Lobby says represent a variety of faiths. The White House has said it believes a requirement on contraception coverage is "lawful and essential to women's health" and expressed confidence the Supreme Court would ultimately agree.
