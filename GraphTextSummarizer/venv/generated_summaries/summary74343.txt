Billy goats have struck mortal fear deep in the heart of an inveterate Cubs fan since 1945, after Chicago tavern owner Bill "Billy Goat" Sianis pronounced a curse on the club on October 6 of that year -- just a month after the end of World War II. Sianis went to Wrigley Field to support the Cubs as they battled the Detroit Tigers in the World Series, according to his tavern's website, which dedicates a page to the legend of the Billy Goat curse. Sianis appealed directly to then club owner P.K. Wrigley, asking him why he couldn't take his beloved pet and personal mascot to the game. Last May, a group of five Cubs fans took a goat named "Wrigley" on a trek across the country in an attempt to lift the curse. When the team lost the game that day, Sianis sent a telegram, the website says, to Wrigley proclaiming: "Who stinks now?" The team's record hasn't been the same since.
