The gay community is still a force in West Hollywood, but today that community has prospered, aged and settled down. -- From the time it was first incorporated by a group of gay activists, West Hollywood has styled itself as America's gayest city. Mayor John Heilman says, "Priorities have shifted." Heilman believes that West Hollywood may have matured over the last two decades but, "is still a dynamic and vibrant community." Resident Dave Coerman agrees, "I think its still one of the most liberal and progressive communities around." It's a town where the American flag and the gay pride rainbow flag fly side by side. Lynn Pickwell has lived in West Hollywood for 23 years.
