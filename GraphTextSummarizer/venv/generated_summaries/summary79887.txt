-- A court hearing is scheduled Thursday in the case of a northern California couple accused of abducting Jaycee Dugard and holding her captive for more than 18 years in a ramshackle backyard compound. Phillip Garrido, 58, and his wife, Nancy, 54, are charged with 29 felony counts in the kidnapping of Dugard, who was 11 when she was snatched in 1991 from the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California. I want to thank you for your support, and I'm doing well," Dugard said in a home video released exclusively to ABC News. Dugard now lives in seclusion with her mother, Terry Probyn, and Dugard's two daughters. Authorities say the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound behind their home for 18 years.
