He wanted to incorporate an aspect of hospital life that many patients don't know about: the morbidity and mortality (M&M) meetings, where doctors gather to talk openly about the mistakes they've made. Based on the book "Monday Mornings," the show follows five doctors at a fictional hospital called Chelsea General as they face the realities of having made mistakes. Those types of mistakes aren't made in this hospital. As awkward and unsettling as it may be, a lot of those advances are sometimes made because of mistakes, and the worst possible thing is that nobody learns from the mistakes.
