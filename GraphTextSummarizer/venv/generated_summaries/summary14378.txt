Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests Last week, a number of press advocacy groups decried the initial spate of arrests. Six journalists were taken into custody while covering the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, on Monday and early Tuesday, aggravating what one press freedom group has called a "concerted, top-down effort to restrict the fundamental First Amendment rights of the public and the press." "Picket was released when it was discovered that the trooper misunderstood directions from his superiors and was told to not allow vehicle traffic through but to allow foot traffic through. Ron Johnson said at a news conference early Tuesday morning that 31 people had been arrested amid Monday night's protests. Other journalists reported being threatened with arrest and affected by tear-gas on Monday night.
