Separately, large numbers of court employees have been furloughed -- amounting to 8,600 court staff days and 12,500 public defender days. Judicial officials have already begun implementing staggered cuts to such areas as staff salaries, court security and federal public defenders. The impact includes delays of civil and bankruptcy cases; furloughs of hundreds of court staff and federal public defenders. -- Forced federal spending cuts have had a "devastating impact" on judicial operations nationwide, prompting a request to Congress for emergency funds to keep operations going at minimal levels, court officials say. While courts have to deal with cuts, federal prosecutors do not at the moment.
