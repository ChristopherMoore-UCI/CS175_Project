The Republic of Ireland striker doubled the lead eight minutes later in equally assured fashion latching on to a sloppy pass from Leandro Bacuna before jinking past defender Nathan Barker. Rudi Garcia's men had plenty of chances to win the match against a Cagliari side who haven't won away from home all season, but were denied all three points thanks to a combination of sloppy finishing and some sturdy goalkeeping from Vlada Avramov. "We didn't manage to score a goal but the man of the match was Avramov," Garcia told Sky Italia. Gervinho, who was returning after a month out with a hamstring strain, went closest in the half heading against the post from close range just before the break. The result means Roma now have 33 points from 13 games while Cagliari have 14 points and remain in 14th place.
