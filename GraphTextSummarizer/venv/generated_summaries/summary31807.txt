Iran's former reformist President Mohammad Khatami called on Iranians to keep up the struggle, noting that "all doors are not yet closed. " Author and foreign affairs analyst Fareed Zakaria spoke to CNN about this week's events in Iran. Ahmadinejad's main political rival, Mir Hossein Moussavi, also released a statement Wednesday criticizing the government and its crackdown on the media, which he said has created a "bitter, coup d'etat atmosphere" in Iran. His statement prompted Iran's government to block publication of the newspaper. Zakaria: Not really, because while it might seem like the West has few options, in reality, Iran has fewer.
