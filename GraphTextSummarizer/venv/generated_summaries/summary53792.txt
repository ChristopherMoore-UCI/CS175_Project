Thiago's dismissal for a second yellow left Barca on the back foot, but when Messi's late shot hit the post, central defender Pique was the first to react to grab the clinching second. Ronaldo's double left him level with Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi on 35 league goals as the superstar pair match each other goal for goal to maintain their incredible scoring rates. Barcelona had earlier briefly cut Real's lead to just three points after Messi and Gerard Pique scored in a 2-0 win at Mallorca. Gonzalo Higuain put Los Blancos ahead early in the first half before two goals apiece from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema completed the rout. Messi, who became Barcelona's all-time leading scorer in midweek, got on the scoresheet in the first half.
