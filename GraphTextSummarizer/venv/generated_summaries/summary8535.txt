As Yemen collapses into warring factions, and the United States surveys the wreckage with few good options, one party besides the Houthi seems set to benefit: al Qaeda. Yemen is close to becoming a failing state; the sort of place where al Qaeda incubates quickly. The fighting in Yemen provides an opening to ISIS, which is keen to outflank al Qaeda and prove itself the true defender of the faith. The Houthis' power grab gave al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula the best recruiting sergeant they could hope for. U.S. officials say AQAP still poses the most active threat to the homeland and fear it is starting to share its bomb-making know-how with jihadists in Syria, specifically with the Khorasan Group, reputed to be an al Qaeda "A team" based in Syria.
