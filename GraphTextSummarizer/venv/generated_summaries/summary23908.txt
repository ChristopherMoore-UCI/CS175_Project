"Oftentimes, kids walk up to two hours to school in rural areas, since their families can't afford to pay for public transportation," said Wortzel. Its mission is to expand access to basic educational materials for schools in Central America. Since 2006, TALICA has established school collections and donated about 4,500 books and supplies to seven public school libraries in five communities, and helped establish a community library and the first-ever medical collection in the village of Balgue, Nicaragua.
