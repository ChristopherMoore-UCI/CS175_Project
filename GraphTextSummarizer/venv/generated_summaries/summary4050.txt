Racial tightrope walk Obama played on skin color while taking a stab at House Speaker John Boehner, who has antagonized Obama on many issues in the last few years and who has his own host of problems with the conservative members of the House Republican Caucus. President Obama slipped into the role of comedian-in-chief Saturday night and took jabs at journalists, lawmakers, celebrities and -- most pointedly -- his own administration's botched rollout of HealthCare.gov. "These days the House Republicans actually give John Boehner a harder time than they give me -- which means orange really is the new black," Obama said making a simultaneous reference to the popular Netflix series and to Boehner's legendary tan. Shirtless Putin Obama sought to turn recent conservative criticism of his foreign policy on its head by pointing out past compliments Putin has received from Pat Buchanan and Rudy Giuliani. After remarking that the White House Correspondents' Association celebrates its 100th anniversary this year, McHale joked, "100 years ago, CNN was only searching for the Wright brothers' plane." Obama also took a shot at MSNBC's ratings in the large, full ballroom.
