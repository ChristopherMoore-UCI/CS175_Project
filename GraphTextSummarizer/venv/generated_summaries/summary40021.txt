And while Malala's young life has dazzled the world in a short time, Satyarthi, 60, has already spent decades working to combat the shocking reality that even today, millions of children are forced to work in slavery, often to pay off their parents' debts, enduring exploitation and trafficking. BBA started as a direct-action group and evolved into the cornerstone of a global movement to free children from slave labor and give them the chance of having not just a real childhood but also the chance of a decent life. In contrast, Satyarthi, a children's rights and anti-slavery activist, is known mostly in the world of human rights defenders. But most people had never heard of the heroic and highly effective work of her fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner, Kailash Satyarthi. In 1980, he founded Bachpan Bachao Andolan, Save the Children Mission, to rescue and protect children from servitude and trafficking.
