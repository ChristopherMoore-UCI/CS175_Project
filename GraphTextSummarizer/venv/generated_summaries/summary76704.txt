"But this does not translate into the cutting off of diplomatic ties." Relations between Kigali and Pretoria have been frosty since Gen. Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, a critic and rival to Rwandan President Paul Kagame, was shot and wounded in Johannesburg in June. "In recent months killings, arrests and the closure of newspapers and broadcasters has reinforced a climate of fear," said a statement from Amnesty's Africa Programme Deputy Director Tawanda Hondora. The Rwandan government has repeatedly denied any involvement in the incidents in Rwanda and South Africa. Molobi said Ambassador Gladstone Dumisani Gwadiso was questioned by Rwandan authorities on South Africa's handling of the incident. Amnesty International said Rugambage had been investigating the Nyamwasa's shooting and on the day he died, the tabloid Umuvugizi published a story alleging that Rwandan intelligence officials were linked to Nyamwasa's shooting.
