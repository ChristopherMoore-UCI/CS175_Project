It's not clear when the photo was taken, but it was among those on a roll of 35 mm film that Loughner dropped off at a Walgreens store in the hours before the shooting rampage that took six lives and left 13 others wounded, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The video, released by Pima Community College to the Los Angeles Times and KOLD-TV following a public records request, was cited in campus police records as among the reasons administrators suspended Loughner in September following a series of outbursts and incidents that disrupted classes and left teachers and students shaken. He also complains about illiterate students and campus police, calling the college "one of the biggest scams in America." -- Arizona shooting suspect Jared Loughner photographed himself posing with a 9mm handgun while wearing a red G-string, a law enforcement source said Saturday. Police say Loughner used a 9mm Glock handgun with an extended magazine in the attack on a constituents meeting hosted by Giffords outside a Tucson, Arizona, Safeway store on January 8.
