Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice John Ingram handed Nechemya Weberman a 103-year-sentence without the prospect of parole. "We honestly and truly believe that this was a setup," said defense attorney George Farkas after sentencing. The case brought scrutiny on the Satmar Hasidic community, many of whom live in the insular Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "The abuse of a child cannot be swept under the rug or dealt with by insular groups believing only they know what is best for their community," District Attorney Charles Hynes said in a statement. -- An unlicensed counselor in Brooklyn's ultra-Orthodox Jewish community was sentenced Tuesday to spend the rest of his life in prison after repeatedly sexually abusing a young girl in his care.
