The incident was discovered on June 13. The CDC report says the potential exposure happened between June 6 and June 13. And the CDC is carefully reviewing all the other procedures for labs working with dangerous pathogens, and it has put together a rapid-response command structure to hopefully help the labs avoid future incidents. CDC lab leader reassigned during anthrax investigation CNN's Miriam Falco contributed to this report. The lab involved in the anthrax incident will remain closed for such dangerous microbes until Frieden personally approves its reopening under conditions that prevent any such mishap from happening again, Frieden said.
