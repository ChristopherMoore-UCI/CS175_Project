-- Former world No.1 Ana Ivanovic is hoping to lead Serbia to a historic first Fed Cup final in Moscow this weekend. In the absence of world No.2 Sharapova and 10th-ranked Zvonareva, Russian captain Shamil Tarpishchev has turned to two-time grand slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, as well as Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, Maria Kirilenko and Elena Vesnina. Our plan is just to fight until the last point -- we'll see what happens." Serbia, who have been beaten by Russia in their last three Fed Cup meetings, is in its strongest position yet to finally claim a victory. The 2011 Wimbledon champion will be joined by 23rd-ranked Lucie Safarova, and doubles partners Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka. "We have had a good team for a while but we never seem to come together and actually go for it," she said on the official Fed Cup website.
