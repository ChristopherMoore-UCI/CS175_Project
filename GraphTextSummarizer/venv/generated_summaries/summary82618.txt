As bombs fell they went out and filmed video after gruesome video. The government had cut the power supply in to Daraya and conserving phones was a matter of survival. The young activists we met told us with pride that Daraya had almost emptied as security raids hunted activists down in alleyways and as they hid at the homes of friends and relatives. Its citizens were among the first to take to the streets after the Syrian uprising began but the town's proximity to the Mezza military airport had brought them uncomfortable scrutiny from the Air Force Intelligence service. Many of those who helped us are still inside Syria so I don't want to say anything more but in the days and nights after we left I stayed close to my laptop and phone.
