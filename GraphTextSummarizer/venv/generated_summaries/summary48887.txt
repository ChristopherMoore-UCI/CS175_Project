In addition to reducing maternal mortality, providing voluntary family planning methods and education enables young women to avoid early pregnancy, allows more girls to attend school longer, makes it possible for women to have fewer, healthier children and helps break the inter-generational cycle of poverty. If we want to ensure that we leave our children and grandchildren a safe and healthy world, then it is critical for world leaders to support the U.N.'s vital work on voluntary family planning and reproductive health for women across the globe. The real tragedy is the fact that one-third of these deaths could be prevented if women had access to voluntary family planning. The fund is an agency focused on assisting governments in delivering quality sexual and reproductive health care -- including voluntary family planning -- throughout the life cycle of women across the globe who want and need it. The best way to do this is to listen to women and fund international family planning.
