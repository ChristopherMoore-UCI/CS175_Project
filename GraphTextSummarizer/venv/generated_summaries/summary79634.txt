-- Tim McGraw "instinctively swatted" at a fan who refused to let go of his leg during the finale of an Atlanta concert last week, a rep said. The summer leg of McGraw's "Sundown Heaven Town" tour continues through the end of August. An energetic woman reaches out and grabs the side of his leg, and McGraw reacts. " The fan's clutching -- and McGraw's response -- are seen on a video posted on TMZ.com. The site later posted a clearer video that appears to show the woman ripping McGraw's jeans.
