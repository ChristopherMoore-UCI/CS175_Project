Opinion roundup: Where Obama, and America, go from here We still support the man who has stood up for us: Sixty percent of voters age 18-29 chose President Obama on Tuesday. The youth vote was imperative to the legalization of same-sex marriage in Maine and Maryland, the rejection of constitutional discrimination in Minnesota and the election of a president who supports equal pay, reproductive rights and fair immigration reform. In August, I wrote that in this election, young people would display a deep commitment to our country and its ideals, and provide a preview of the America we intend to build. The word was that we had fallen out of love with President Obama, the man who inspired us four years ago. The next time someone claims that my generation doesn't care and won't help, remind them that we showed up, voted for change and are ready to get to work.
