Others named as possible FCC chairs were FCC Commissioners Mignon Clyburn and Jessica Rosenworcel, Clinton administration FCC executives Susan Ness and Cathy Sandoval and Obama adviser and communications expert Susan Crawford. We thought President Obama wanted women in his inner circle. It's long past the time to close the gender gap in our nation's leadership and in the media and telecom industries' leadership especially, where in 2011 only 28.4% of TV news directors were women, according to the Women's Media Center's 2012 Status of Women in the U.S. Media report. Women are more likely to have the expertise for such decisions in the interest of consumers and also to be affected by those decisions. Never in the 80 years of the FCC has a woman of any race or group been its chair, though women have been the nation's majority for a long time.
