"The idea of the essay is to drive the audience into a war environment," Quintao said about his "Front Row" project. Entertainment photographer Gabriel Quintao has been capturing the faces in the crowd for a few years now and likens their devotion to a battle scene. "Who wants to see the concert comfortably from an empty space?" While he's never seen a serious injury from his position in the pit, the space between the stage and the crowd, Quintao hopes his photos do justice to the level of emotions portrayed in the name of fandom. Music fans often reach the height of fandom as they crush themselves to the front of the stage in an effort to get as close to the performers as possible. Gabriel Quintao is a Brazilian photographer based in Sao Paulo.
