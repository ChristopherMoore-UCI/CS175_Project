Flint and the two brothers lived in the Belvedere family home in San Diego, said friend Andre Briones. San Diego authorities, now leading the investigation, declined to comment in detail about the Gianni Belvedere's autopsy other than to say the manner of death was a homicide, and the final autopsy report won't be available for a few weeks, said Hastings. San Diego police made the announcement one day after authorities identified a decomposed body found in a car trunk 100 miles away in Riverside as being that of Gianni Belvedere, 24. Flint then moved to San Diego at her fiance's invitation, Briones said. Police found her dead in car with a gunshot wound to the head, and Salvatore Belvedere was in the driver's seat fighting for his life with gunshot wounds to the head and torso.
