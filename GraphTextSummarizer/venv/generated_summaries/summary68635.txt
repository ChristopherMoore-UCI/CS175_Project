Obama said the Environmental Protection Agency and United States Department of Agriculture will spearhead an effort to determine why honey bees, monarch butterflies and other pollinators are dwindling and find ways to boost their conservation. President Barack Obama created a task force comprising various agencies to address the issue of rapidly diminishing honey bees and other pollinators. "Pollinators contribute more than $24 billion to the United States economy, of which honey bees account for more than $15 billion through their vital role in keeping fruits, nuts, and vegetables in our diets," the White House said. "Honey bees enable the production of at least 90 commercially grown crops in North America. In addition, Obama's budget for next year recommends about $50 million for multiple agencies to help boost research, increase the number of acres dedicated to pollinators' conservation programs and boost funding for research on pollinator losses.
