-- With space shuttle Atlantis on its way to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope, that leaves one shuttle, Endeavour, at the ready on the other launch pad here. Atlantis mission specialist John Grunsfeld would go first -- and, actually, twice. Space shuttle Endeavour, in background, sits poised to launch in case Atlantis, in foreground, meets trouble. Endeavour is far more than a postcard picture -- it's on standby in case something goes seriously wrong with the Atlantis mission. With the Atlantis crew safely aboard, Endeavour would pull away and begin preparing to head home.
