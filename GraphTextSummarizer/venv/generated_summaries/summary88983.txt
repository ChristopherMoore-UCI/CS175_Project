The $1.6 billion contract involves a minimum of 12 flights, with an option to order more missions for additional cost, according to SpaceX. SpaceX is one of a few of private companies receiving NASA funds to develop the capability for commercial transport of astronauts into space. It also marks the culmination of six years of preparation to bring commercial flights to the space station after the retirement of NASA's space shuttle fleet in 2011, which left the United States with no means of independently sending humans into space. SpaceX calls its capsule is "the only spacecraft capable of returning a significant amount of cargo from the space station," saying that other vehicles that deliver cargo to the International Space Station are destroyed after they leave the station. Alan Lindenmoyer, NASA's head of commercial space systems, said the space agency is waiting to recover the spacecraft's cargo and will review post-flight reports. SpaceX Dragon triumph: Only the beginning The mission began May 22, when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched the capsule into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida.
