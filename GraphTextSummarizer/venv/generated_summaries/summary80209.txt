Fourteen-year-old "Hunger Games" actress Willow Shields and pro partner Mark Ballas danced a cha cha to start the night. Business tycoon and Shark Tank star Robert Herjavec — who was introduced to partner Kym Johnson with an offer of his Ferrari if they won — filled the second dance slot with a cha cha. Redfoo and McKinney were at the bottom of the scoreboard and are in jeopardy of being sent home next week, while Willis and Lynch's scores are sure to secure them past week two. Carrie Ann Inaba, Len Goodman, Bruno Tonioli and former pro dancer Julianne Hough each resumed their season 19 seats at the judges' table. Double amputee Noah Galloway and Sharna Burgess danced an inspiring cha cha.
