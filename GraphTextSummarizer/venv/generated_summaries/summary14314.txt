"Holding one when the enemy has said they're going to try to disrupt it makes it even more difficult." Despite Saturday's attack, ISAF spokesman Lt. Col. Todd Vician told CNN that NATO-led forces in Afghanistan remain confident the elections will be credible. The area around the ISAF headquarters is heavily fortified with concrete blast barriers and extra security forces. -- A suicide car bombing exploded outside the NATO headquarters in Afghanistan early Saturday, killing seven people and injuring 91 just five days before the country holds presidential elections, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. This summer has been the bloodiest in Afghanistan since 2001, particularly in troubled Helmand province in southern Afghanistan. The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack, an ISAF spokesman told CNN.
