-- Colombia's largest rebel group reportedly claimed on Tuesday to be holding French journalist Romeo Langlois, who disappeared over the weekend, and described him as a "prisoner of war. Langlois' disappearance "is the responsibility of the government of Colombia for engaging in their ranks a foreign national as a correspondent of war," said an editorial posted by the New Colombia News Agency. The statement was reported by various media groups in Colombia, including the El Tiempo newspaper and Caracol Radio. The rebel group has been at war with the Colombian government since the 1960s, and has used kidnapping forces and civilians as a key strategy. " A woman claiming to belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, also known as FARC, called a group of local journalists and read a statement she attributed to the group.
