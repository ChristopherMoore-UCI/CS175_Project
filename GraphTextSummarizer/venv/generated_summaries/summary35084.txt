And Michael Chiklis, who last starred in the "The Shield" but headlined "The Commish" back in the '90s, was one of the most sought-after actors this development season before he joined ABC's "No Ordinary Family" (Sept. 28). Perennial favorites include Kevin Bacon, Lisa Kudrow, Claire Danes, Ashley Judd, William H. Macy, Susan Sarandon, Elisabeth Shue, Josh Duhamel, and Scott Speedman. What is this, the return of the '90s stars? The fall season doesn't officially begin until Sept. 20, but the broadcast networks have already kicked off development for the following September. "Friends'" Matthew Perry is headlining ABC's mid-season comedy "Mr. Sunshine."
