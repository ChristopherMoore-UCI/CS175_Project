"Since the 2006 World Cup in Germany, the media perception of German football and Germany in general has dramatically changed," added Pfeiffer, who has lived in England since 1986. "The weather is good and the beer is better," quipped the Bundesliga's chief executive Christian Seifert after being asked why German football attracts so many tourists. "They also vary greatly; others in England showed a strong sense of respect for the achievements and consistency of German football." "At the moment it is really cool to read all the very well-informed and positive articles about German football in the British press," says Karl Pfeiffer, the director of educational links at London's Goethe-Institut. "The project is for school children and it is great to see how interested they are in in German football, too."
