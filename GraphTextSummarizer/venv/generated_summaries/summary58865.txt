I'm lucky because the president (Silvio Berlusconi) gave us the opportunity (with new signings) to get important results," Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri said, AFP reported. Robinho went close for Milan early in the second half with a curling shot which hit the post and Kevin Prince Boateng shot narrowly wide on the hour mark. "We won 23 out of 36 games and proved that we deserved it," Allegri said, AFP reported. "Allegri deserves a 10 out of 10, he was the architect of this success, he managed to keep the group compact," Gatusso said, AFP reported. Milan's vice-captain Gennaro Gattuso was full of praise for his coach.
