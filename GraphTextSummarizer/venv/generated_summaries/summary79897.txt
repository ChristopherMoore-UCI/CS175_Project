Cruyff's compatriots are seeking to earn the northern European nation a first World Cup title, having lost in the 1974 final in Germany and then again in Argentina four years later when he had retired from the international stage. Only two teams have ever held both titles at once, with France doing it the other way around to Germany by winning the 1998 World Cup and then Euro 2000. Spain will add the World Cup to their European title by beating the Netherlands in Sunday's final, according to Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff. Spain must improve on their form so far if they are to become the first team in 36 years to win the European Championship and then the World Cup, according to midfielder Andres Iniesta. Dream swansong for Dutch captain "Holland is a very balanced team, they know their strengths and their weaknesses, and up until now they have always been able to make their strengths shine through," he said.
