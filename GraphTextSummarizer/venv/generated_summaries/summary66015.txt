Ferrari driver Fernando Alonso told CNN that F1 was "still in shock" over Schumacher's accident and condition. "The family of Michael Schumacher is again requesting to respect its privacy and the medical secret, and to not disturb the doctors treating Michael in their work. Schumacher ended up 9 meters (30 feet) from the edge of the piste, said prosecutor Patrick Quincy. The announcement marks a key change to Schumacher's condition, which has been routinely described as "stable" by agent Sabine Kehm in recent weeks. The German has been inundated with support from around the world during his stay, with his former stable Mercedes running the message "Keep Fighting Michael" on its silver livery when they revealed their new car for testing on Monday.
