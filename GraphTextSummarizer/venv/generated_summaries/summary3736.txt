Castro also shot back at U.S. President Barack Obama, who criticized Cuba in a speech in Santiago, Chile, on Monday and demanded greater freedoms for the Cuban people. -- Former Cuban President Fidel Castro said Tuesday he resigned as the head of the Communist Party five years ago and has never tried to resume the post -- one that he was thought to still hold. " Cubans and foreign observers had believed that the head of the Communist Party was the one title that Castro still held after he was forced to cede power to his younger brother, Raul Castro, due to a health emergency caused by intestinal problems. "Without hesitation, I resigned all of my state and political positions, including that of the First Secretary of the Party, when I fell ill and I never tried to exercise them again after the proclamation of July 31, 2006," he wrote in an essay published in Cuban state media. "When the president looked anxiously at the public after mentioning treacherous Cuba, waiting for an explosion of applause, he was met by a glacial silence," Castro wrote in the essay.
