From his experience of recruiting across the continent, Swaniker concludes that Kenya, Nigeria and Zimbabwe are producing the best students, while schools are weakest in Liberia and South Africa. The initiative is the brainchild of Fred Swaniker, a Ghanaian-born entrepreneur who hopes to instil a new generation with the skills to navigate Africa towards prosperity in future years. So far over 400 students have taken part in the ALA's leadership program and over the next 50 years, Swaniker says the school's aim is to create 6,000 new leaders for Africa. These are just a few of the students hand-picked to attend The African Leadership Academy (ALA) -- a prestigious school in Johannesburg, South Africa that aims to create the continent's leaders of tomorrow. "We really need leaders from all walks of life to solve the diverse challenge that we have in Africa," he adds.
