"I don't think the person who they spoke with realized that drones couldn't be flown in the park or the implications of what they were being told," Amy Bartlett, spokesperson for Yellowstone National Park, told CNN. Drones are banned in national parks. This is the latest in a string of recent drone incidents in national parks and beyond. Authorities at Yellowstone National Park are investigating reports that a tourist crashed a drone into the Grand Prismatic Spring, the park's largest hot spring, on Saturday. And volunteers reported that a herd of bighorn sheep at Zion National Park in Utah scattered after being harassed by a drone.
