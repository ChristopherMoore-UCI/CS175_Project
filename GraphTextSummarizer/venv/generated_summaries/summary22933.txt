"They were just staring at me because they couldn't believe that I was walking." But having experienced life in America -- a life without fear -- coming back to Falluja, where most of the buildings still bear the scars of war, was a traumatic reality check. Mohammed's story came to the attention of the Global Medical Relief Fund, a U.S.-based charity that helps children in war zones across the globe. "But when I went to America, I saw such kindness and humanity." Everyone wanted to see Mohammed walk, and everyone wanted to know what America was like. Within months, Mohammed and his mother, Jinan Mohammed, were on their way to the United States, an experience that changed their lives and their perspectives.
