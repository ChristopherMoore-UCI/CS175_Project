Maloney has run "millions of dollars of negative attack ads against Dr. Hayworth, which are not true, and we figured, what better way to respond than with her son," said Terence Michos, a Hayworth campaign adviser. After Hayworth told the Poughkeepsie Journal that while she has no problem with recent court rulings legalizing same-sex marriage in some states, the federal government "should not impose the definition of marriage on the states and I think every state is proceeding as it should," Maloney accused Hayworth of allowing discriminatory state policies. The spot is an attempt to insulate Hayworth against Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney's criticism of her stance on social issues like same-sex marriage, which she's said the federal government shouldn't mandate nationwide. The race is an attempt at a comeback for Hayworth: She'd previously won the Hudson Valley seat in 2010 before being ousted by Maloney in 2012. "As a gay man, coming to terms with who I am wasn't easy," Hayworth's son Will says in the ad.
