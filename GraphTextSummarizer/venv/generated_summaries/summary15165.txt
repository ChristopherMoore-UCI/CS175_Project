His was just the most recent in a series of public missteps by celebrities who have been increasingly called upon to create buzz for tech products. Martin Lindstrom, a brand adviser to Fortune 500 companies and author of "Buyology: Truth and Lies About Why We Buy," said such flubs are "a major risk" companies run when they sign up celebrity endorsers. Turns out, CBS, which airs "Big Bang," was locked in a lawsuit with Dish and other DVR makers over the systems' ability to skip ads. "The concept of conventional celebrity endorsement has expanded from just engaging the superstars to everyone from the 10-minutes-of-fame person to even people who have carved out some niche audience on a very focused topic," he said. And while celebrity tweets make the headlines, Lindstrom said, the prevalence of social media now means they're not the only ones we look to to decide what we think about a product.
