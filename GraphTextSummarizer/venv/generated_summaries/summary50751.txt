California's secretary of state late Tuesday released semi-official results showing Proposition 8 had passed 52.5 percent to 47.5 percent. He's going to get the opportunity likely to appoint Supreme Court justices. I mean, they're talking about discrimination, equal protection. And I think that it's something that, we, of course, have to watch because we're talking about equal protection, we're talking about discrimination. And so, my guess is that that court is going to weigh in, probably reinstitute the right to marry for same-sex couples and then that's going to be likely based on the U.S. Constitution and our Supreme Court is going to weigh in.
