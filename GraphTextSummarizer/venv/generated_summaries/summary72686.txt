President Barack Obama says an undervalued currency is giving Chinese companies an unfair advantage in selling products, and this week the House of Representatives passed a bill that would let the United States put tariffs on goods from China. We benefit enormously from having cheap Chinese goods. but I'd say there are many, many benefits the Americans derive from having cheap Chinese goods. The reason there is almost no inflation in America is largely due to cheap Chinese manufacturing. Americans get cheap mortgages for that reason, get cheap credit, get cheap interest rates for their credit cards.
