-- More than $60,000 worth of computers, jewelry and personal items have been stolen from the Palo Alto, California, home of the late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. In his recent book "Steve Jobs," biographer Walter Isaacson describes the house as on a corner in a "family-friendly neighborhood" of old Palo Alto. Kariem McFarlin, 35, of Alameda was arrested and charged with residential burglary and selling stolen property, according to Scott Tsui, supervising deputy district attorney for Santa Clara County. But a report in the San Jose Mercury News says that the burglar made off with iPads, iPhones, Macs, Tiffany jewelry, Beats headphones and Cristal Champagne, among other items. He has confessed and has written a letter of apology to Steve Jobs' widow, Laurene Powell, the Mercury News reported.
