The new game launches Thursday on most major platforms: iOS, Android, Amazon Kindle Fire, Mac, PC, Windows Phone, and Windows 8. Rovio's "Angry Birds" has spawned board games, books, toys and soda pop, while "Star Wars" has lent its name to everything from comic books and Legos to snowboards and umbrellas. In their relentless quest to exhaust the galaxy of new marketing opportunities, "Angry Birds" has partnered with Lucasfilm for a "Star Wars"-themed version of the blockbuster mobile game. You won't be shocked to hear that "Angry Birds Star Wars" merchandise is already for sale in retailers worldwide. To quote from Rovio Entertainment's press release, the game follows "a plucky group of Rebel birds in their fight against the evil Imperial Pigs."
