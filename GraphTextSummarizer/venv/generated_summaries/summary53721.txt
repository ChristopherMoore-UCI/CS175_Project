-- Sen. Hillary Clinton will win Florida's Democratic presidential primary Tuesday, CNN projects, although party sanctions have stripped the state of its convention delegates and no Democrats campaigned there. They opted to concentrate on next week's "Super Tuesday" contests in states such as New York, California, Missouri and Georgia. Donna Brazile, who managed former Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid, said many Democrats were likely to turn out to vote on a state constitutional amendment that would limit property tax increases and expand homestead exemptions. Her leading rivals, South Carolina primary winner   Sen. Barack Obama and  Sen. John Edwards, did not campaign in Florida. Obama described the primary as a "beauty contest" Tuesday, and his campaign issued a statement declaring the race a tie in the delegate count: "Zero for Obama, zero for Clinton."
