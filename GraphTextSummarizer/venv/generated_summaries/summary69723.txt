Though Boehner was successfully able to convince Rep. Michael Grimm to resign on Monday after pleading guilty to a felony tax evasion charge last week, Rep. Steve Scalise, the majority whip now embroiled in scandal over a 2002 address he gave to a white supremacist conference, remains a tougher mess to clean up, leaving the speaker open to attack from the left and the right. And many conservatives came out Tuesday offering their full support for Scalise, including Iowa Rep. Steve King, and Boehner's allies say they remain confident he'll be fine in the election. In a coordinated move, both Boehner and his deputy, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, issued back-to-back statements of support for Scalise on Tuesday afternoon. Facing calls for a coup from his conservative base in next week's speaker race that grew louder on Tuesday, Boehner can't afford to let Scalise, a former Republican Study Committee chairman and one of his strongest links to that conservative base, go. While this wouldn't be the first time that Boehner's faced a conservative challenge for his speakership, many on Tuesday began to speculate that the controversy surrounding Scalise, and Boehner's handling of it, may breathe new life into a challenge.
