Earlier Thursday, Gates met with the Commanding General of U.S. Forces in Iraq, General Lloyd Austin, and with the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, James Jeffrey, at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad. -- U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters in Baghdad that his current visit to Iraq will probably be his last. Like most top-level U.S. visits to regional hot spots, Gates' visit to Iraq was unannounced, most likely for security reasons. Gates also addressed the possible U.S. government shutdown. Later, Gates will meet with Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said a senior defense official who agreed to talk on background Gates message to Iraq's leadership will be "that it is important for them to complete the government-formation process, particularly to get the security ministries dealt with," a senior defense official said.
