Another provision of the cruise industry rule mirrors the Department of Transportation's tarmac delay rule for airline passengers in giving cruise passengers the right to disembark a docked ship if adequate food, water and restroom facilities are not available onboard. "The Cruise Industry Passenger Bill of Rights codifies many longstanding practices of CLIA members and goes beyond those to further inform cruise guests of the industry's commitment to their comfort and care," said Christine Duffy, president and CEO of CLIA, in a statement. The bill of rights is effective immediately for passengers who purchase cruises in North America for any itinerary on CLIA's more than two dozen North American member cruise lines, which include Carnival, Costa, Disney, Holland America, Royal Caribbean and others. The organization's new policy also provides the right to emergency medical attention, timely information related to itinerary changes and mechanical problems and full or partial refunds for voyages that are canceled or ended early due to mechanical failures. The bill also assumes responsibility for passenger transportation and lodging in cases when mechanical issues cut voyages short.
