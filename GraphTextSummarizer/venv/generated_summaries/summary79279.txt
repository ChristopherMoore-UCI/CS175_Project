Less than four months after taking the oath of office for the second time, he is seen as falling prey to some mysterious witchcraft that casts a fatal spell on re-elected presidents. But does that amount to a jinxed second term, or the same kind of partisan standoff that has marked Obama's years in office? And such stories ricocheted onto NBC's "Today" show, on which, we learned, "some observers" are questioning whether "Mr. Obama is falling victim to the second-term curse." One can almost conjure up a bubbling cauldron of black smoke with a wand-wielding wizard laughing diabolically. Now, there's no question that second-term presidents often stumble or run out of gas. "Will Obama suffer the 'second-term curse'?" asks the Washington Post. "President Obama stares down the second-term curse," says Politico.
