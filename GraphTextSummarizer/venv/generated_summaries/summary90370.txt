Weissmuller appeared in Tarzan movies through 1948, according to the online movie guide site, with other chimpanzees appearing in the role of Cheetah. Cheetah was known for his ability to stand up and walk like a person, sanctuary volunteer Ron Priest told WFLA. Several chimpanzees appeared in various Tarzan movies, many of which were popular in the 1930a and 1940s. He said he and others at the sanctuary "send our deepest sympathies to our colleagues at Suncoast." Westfall writes on the site that he was told Cheeta was one of the original chimps in the Tarzan movies during the 1930s and 1940s. Condolences poured in to a Florida primate sanctuary Wednesday after it announced the death of Cheetah, a chimpanzee that the sanctuary said starred in the Tarzan movies during the 1930s.
