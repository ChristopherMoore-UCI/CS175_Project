Outlining the Muslim Brotherhood's vision for a "new Egypt," Mohamed Morsi said the group wants a civil democratic state with laws drawn from Islamic Shariah law. Mahmoud Hussein, the Brotherhood secretary general, has said that any Muslim Brotherhood members who join competing political parties will be penalized. After the results were announced, Muslim Brotherhood leaders declared their intentions to compete for around 50% of parliamentary seats in the upcoming election. In statements to the news media made after Mubarak was forced from office in February, Mohamed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood leader, declared that the group would seek 35% of the seats in Parliament. Lotfy said he regrets the move by Brotherhood leadership to ostracize him and insisted that the new party he has helped to establish will work toward fulfilling the goals of the revolution.
