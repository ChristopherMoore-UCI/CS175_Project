John Sawers, British ambassador to the U.N., told BBC of Iran approaching Western nations with offer. The British government dismissed the offer and Iran's nuclear enrichment program restarted once again, the BBC reports Iran has denied offering any such deal and reiterated its position Saturday. "Iran's high officials have repeatedly stated that Iran has not had any part in attacks against American and British forces, and there is no evidence to support these baseless accusations," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said, according to the semi-official Mehr News Agency. The United States and other Western nations believe Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapons program, but Iran says it is developing nuclear capability to produce energy. Interviews with top brass from former President Bush's administration and British envoys indicate that Iran and the West had neared agreements several times in the past few years, but never reached success.
