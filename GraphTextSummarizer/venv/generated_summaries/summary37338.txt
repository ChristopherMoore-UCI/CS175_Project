The center was packed with young people participating in weekend activities, like auditions for a singing competition and a rehearsal for a production of "To Kill a Mockingbird," CNN affiliates reported. Family members said Dr. William Lewis Corporon and 14-year-old Reat Griffin Underwood died as a result of injuries they suffered in the shooting at the Jewish community center. "This was a community center full of young teens, and they were on lockdown after the shots started," CNN affiliate KSHB reporter Lisa Benson told CNN. Video from CNN affiliate KMBC showed a man who appeared to be the suspect sitting in the back of a patrol car and shouting, "Heil Hitler." Douglass said police are investigating statements the suspect made after his arrest, but declined to provide additional details. Authorities are investigating whether the shootings were a hate crime, Overland Park Police Chief John Douglass told reporters.
