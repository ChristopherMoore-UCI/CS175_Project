The book jumps from Wade's tumultuous childhood with his sister on the south side of Chicago to his more recent past, when the 30-year-old NBA star was awarded joint custody of his two sons after a bitter court battle with his ex-wife. -- Miami Heat star Dwyane Wade says he felt numb as a child when he watched his mother inject herself with heroin. She took 10-year-old Dwyane to live with his father, Dwyane Wade Sr., in Robbins, Illinois, away from the drug deals and police raids he had grown accustomed to. Jolinda Wade, 57, is now a pastor in Chicago -- and drug-free. That mom appeal is helping diversify Wade's fan base.
