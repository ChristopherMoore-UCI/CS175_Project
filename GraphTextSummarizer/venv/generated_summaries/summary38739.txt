"The speed of the tongue is quite incredible," co-author Pedro M. Reis, an assistant engineering professor at MIT, told CNN. "Lions and tigers [tongues] will go about half [the speed] of house cats," said Roman Stocker, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at MIT. -- While dogs slurp to alleviate thirst, cats display a mastery of physical dynamics that leaves their whiskers, chin and the counter top free of liquid, researchers found. Unlike humans, who can seal their cheeks to suck in liquids, dogs and cats rely on lapping, Reis said. Big cats don't lap as rapidly as house cats, the scientists said, in part because their tongues are larger.
