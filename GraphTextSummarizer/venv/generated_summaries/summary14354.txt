-- The father of George Zimmerman, the man accused of shooting and killing and unarmed black teen, says the teen threatened to kill Zimmerman and beat him so badly that it forced Zimmerman to shoot Trayvon Martin. A surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, his hands cuffed, exiting a patrol car. Tracy Martin, Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows Zimmerman was profiling his son. Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually. The shooting has hit a nerve in the nation, sparked a debate about racial profiling and ignited protests and calls for Zimmerman's arrest.
