Midway through this month's Winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia, there was a bright and glorious full moon that lit the night sky high above the Earth. Today, in space, Russian cosmonauts and American astronauts circle the Earth in harmony together, traveling aboard the International Space Station. Then, not long after, a disembodied voice from beyond where anyone could see, the voice of the man alone in the capsule, John Glenn, telling a waiting world that he was in orbit and had achieved weightlessness, that he was free of the Earth's gravity. The ceremonies, as is tradition, are expected to center on two themes: competition, and the common ground that exists between different nations. There was one day in particular, early in the effort, when the United States was still trying to catch up with the Soviets and put a man into Earth's orbit.
