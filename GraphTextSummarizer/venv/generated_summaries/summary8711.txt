"I began leaving love letters all over New York City back in October 2010," Brencher writes on her personal website, "as a way to try to fight off my own loneliness and depression." " In fact, in addition to sending letters directly to those who are nominated, More Love Letters encourages recipients to pass their messages on, or leave them for others to find. Through its Campus Cursive program, More Love Letters has sent letters to more than 100 college campuses. Brencher said one book in particular seems to be a popular location to leave love letters: "The Perks of Being a Wallflower." "We've seen a lot of people start to leave love letters in their favorite books."
