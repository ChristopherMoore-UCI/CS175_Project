Katja Wulff explained to me, "We often dress our cats in little outfits and one day we just tried leggings with Gucci. The other blog Wulff was talking about is something called Kaffekokarkokboken, which sounds like you accidentally inhaled a Wheat Thin, but loosely translates to "Coffee Boiling Cookbook." Wulff and Sörensen also turned their coffee pot hobby into an actual cookbook, and it includes lots of great photo cameos by Gucci and their other two cats, Iggy and Zappa. " As the blog became more popular, Wulff, along with her graphic designer boyfriend, Dan Sörensen, started a Facebook page where they also post fan submissions. Wulff says her secret to doing it right is stuffing the leggings with "other tights, panties, and some of Dan's boxers I don't like.
