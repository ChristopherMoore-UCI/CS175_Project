Global human rights groups have documented widespread abuse of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia. Human Rights Watch Saudi researcher Adam Coogle said that "Saudi Arabia needs to get serious about protecting migrant workers by providing adequate avenues to justice and mechanisms of redress." "Employers often abuse this power in violation of Saudi law to confiscate passports, withhold wages and force migrants to work against their will or on exploitative terms." In addition, he said, no evidence has emerged to indicate that the incident occurred in Saudi Arabia or involved a Saudi. "We are taking this very seriously and are looking into it with Saudi security," said the commission's Mohammed Al-Madi.
