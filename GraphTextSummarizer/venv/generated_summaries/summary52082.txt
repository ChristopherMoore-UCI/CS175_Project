-- Strong winds and heavy rain battered Scotland and eastern England Thursday, disrupting rail and road traffic as northwestern Europe braced for heavy storms sweeping across the North Atlantic and North Sea. "It will be many hours yet before services return to near normal levels, and so the network in Scotland and the north of England will continue to be severely impacted by today's storm," British train operator Network Rail said in a statement, adding that hundreds of engineers were working to clear trees and other debris from rail lines. It said arctic polar air would stream into the country, but spokesman Andreas Friedrich said DWD did not expect as strong wind speeds as in Scotland. Four others involved in the collision suffered minor injuries, Police Scotland said in a statement.
