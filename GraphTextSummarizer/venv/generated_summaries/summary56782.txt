Authorities from San Bernardino flew to Mexico late Friday to get Briant. The men ransacked the home before leaving with Briant, a small amount of cash and some personal property, San Bernardino sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Beavers said. Briant Rodriguez, 3, was taken during a home invasion on May 3 in San Bernardino, California, police say. Briant Rodriguez was found wandering the streets of Mexicali, Mexico, by a police officer late Thursday, said San Bernardino County Sheriff Rod Hoops. Hoops said Briant's mother is "a Mexican citizen living here in the United States," but that he is unsure of her immigration status.
