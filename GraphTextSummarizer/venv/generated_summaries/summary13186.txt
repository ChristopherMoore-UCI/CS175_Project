IDC's report sums it up nicely: "While some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of Windows 8, the radical changes to the UI, removal of the familiar Start button, and the costs associated with touch have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices. Even Apple's Mac computer sales are basically flat year over year, yet its iPad business continues to grow. This is backed up with real data, most notably in the latest IDC report released this month that says PC sales are down 14% year over year. There are a ton of theories floating around out there, but the consensus seems to be that PC makers still haven't figured out how to leverage the transition into mobile devices. It made a huge gamble with the introduction of Windows 8, a radically different kind of operating system designed primarly for touchscreen devices.
