Trent Mays, a former high school football player, must register every six months for 20 years with the sheriff and the county where he resides after he completes his sentence, Judge Thomas Lipps ruled, according to the court's chief probation officer, Fred Abdalla Jr. The case received widespread attention after a blogger who once lived in Steubenville uncovered some materials posted to social media sites. -- An Ohio judge Friday classified as a sex offender one of two Steubenville, Ohio, teenagers convicted of raping a 16-year-old girl last year. The ensuing ire over the case brought national attention and criticism to the city from around the country, leaving city officials struggling to defend the community and residents weary of the media spotlight. While Mays' status was the subject of Friday's hearing, no hearing date has been set for Richmond, according to Abdalla.
