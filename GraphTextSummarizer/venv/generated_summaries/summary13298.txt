A coal or rock outburst occurred Monday night at the Brody Mine No. 1, owned by Brody Mining LLC, MSHA spokeswoman Amy Louviere said. "These groups of violations, taken alone or together, constitute a pattern of violations of mandatory health and safety standards in the coal or other mine which are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards," the MSHA report stated. Last year, MSHA issued 514 citations, orders and safeguards to Brody Mine, Louviere said. There was a "pattern of violations" and repeated failure to meet mandatory safety standards at the mine, according to an October 2013 letter from the MSHA to the mining company. Brody Mine No. 1 has been cited in the past for safety violations.
