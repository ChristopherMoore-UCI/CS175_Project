-- British Muslim groups voiced their horror and condemnation Thursday over the slaying of a soldier in a London street by attackers who said they were acting to avenge Muslim deaths overseas. "A lot of Muslim leaders in this country weren't born here, they don't speak the language necessarily, they don't understand a lot of the pressures and debates and issues that young Muslims are having." He said Muslim leaders were unwilling to bring about change, saying they preferred to debate minor theological issues than take practical steps to educate young people about political action. But Muslim commentators also suggested there is more that the country's leaders can do to address issues within the Muslim community, particularly among alienated young men. There has been a sense of inertia in some cases, he said, and Muslim communities haven't always reacted as quickly as they should have.
