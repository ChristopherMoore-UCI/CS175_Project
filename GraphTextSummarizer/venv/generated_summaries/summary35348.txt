Toobin: Does Florida law let killers go free? "We foretold that this would happen while we debated this law and a lot of us voted against it," Florida state Rep. Christopher Smith told CNN on Friday. Although a grand jury is scheduled to convene April 10 to look into the case, authorities have declined to arrest Zimmerman, sparking a national debate over Florida's "stand your ground" deadly force law amid concerns about racial profiling. The case unfolded when Zimmerman, who was patrolling his gated community, saw Martin walking in the neighborhood. " The lawyer said he and Zimmerman had not discussed what happened the night Martin was shot, though he said that Zimmerman has talked with authorities -- unaccompanied by counsel -- whenever they have asked him to do so.
