Podemos last year won five seats for Spain in the European Parliament, considered a strong showing for a newcomer. The new Spanish party, Podemos, aims for a repeat of the Greek scenario in Spain, with some polls already show it ahead of the incumbent Conservatives and the main opposition Socialists for national elections due later this year. Tens of thousands of supporters of Spain's new anti-austerity party filled central Madrid on Saturday, just a week after a like-minded party won national elections in Greece. It's the same place where anti-austerity protests began four years ago during a deep economic crisis, and Podemos is seen partly as an outgrowth of that movement, which leveraged social media to further its message. He said Saturday's protest would start the countdown on Spain's conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose party has labeled Podemos as a supposedly dangerous choice that can't possibly deliver on its promises.
