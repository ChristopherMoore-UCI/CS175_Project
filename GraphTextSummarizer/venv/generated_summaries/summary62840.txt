-- Nelson Mandela's current hospitalization is due to a lung infection, authorities said Tuesday. Tuesday's statement said he had a recurrence of a previous lung infection. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate spent 27 years in prison for fighting against oppression of blacks in South Africa. Just last month, South Africa launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front. Mandela has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa.
