The pair proved just as hard to separate when it came to world records, with both men treating the 100m and 200m breaststroke world record like a hot potato. The 32-year-old has propelled not only himself but Japanese swimming into the spotlight in the 21st century thanks to a series of remarkable performances on the global stage, smashing records and scooping multiple world and Olympic titles. Stroke of genius Kitajima may not possess the physical stature associated with modern swimming champions -- most pros are considerably taller and heavier than his 1.78-meter, 72.5-kg (160-pound) frame -- but that didn't stop him rising above his contemporaries. Hansen got his revenge on Kitajima in subsequent world championships, beating the Japanese star in the 100m in both 2005 and 2007. "I want children to start swimming and have lots of dreams in swimming," Kitajima tells CNN's Human to Hero series.
