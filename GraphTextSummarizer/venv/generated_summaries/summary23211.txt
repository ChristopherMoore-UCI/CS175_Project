The vote is part of a new CNN Opinion project that focuses on bringing attention to overlooked places and issues. Not because this is a popularity contest, but because I firmly believe that stories are more meaningful for people when they're part of them. The stats presented in the documentary are staggering: 1 in 7 Americans is on food stamps; a college degree is needed to compete, but the cost of college has soared since the 1980s; 400 of the richest people in the United States control as much wealth as the bottom 50% of Americans. I'm asking you to pick stories you find most compelling or important from a list of 20 -- and I'll report on the five winners. (While this story was being completed, "illegal animal trade" jumped into fifth place, for instance).
