Sue and Willie Coleman made the decision to drop their efforts after reviewing copies of Coleman's will and other trust documents provided by attorneys in Utah, where Coleman lived with his former wife, Shannon Price, until his death last week. Coleman's ex-wife Shannon Price had previously announced a weekend service for Coleman, who died over a week ago after a fall at his Utah home. "Mr. Coleman had completed an Advanced Health Care Directive that granted Shannon Price permission to make medical decisions on his behalf if he was unable to do so," said the hospital statement, which Price authorized. The document was in effect when the decision to remove Coleman from life support was made last Friday, the hospital said. Coleman and Price divorced in 2008, but they were living together in Santaquin, Utah, when he suffered the fall, which proved fatal.
