"The most important care of patients with Ebola is to manage their fluids and electrolytes, to make sure that they don't get dehydrated," said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But what may seem basic in the United States can be difficult to come by in West Africa, where Ebola has already killed more than 4,500 people -- largely because access to health care is limited. But with a mortality rate of 50% in the current Ebola outbreak, a WHO panel said it is ethical to offer drugs to fight the virus -- even if their effectiveness or adverse effects are unknown. -- There's no cure for Ebola. This may be the most critical factor in beating Ebola.
