"Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder which causes people to make noises and tics that they can't control," Cohen says. More than 20 years later, Cohen is a camp director, celebrating the first year of Camp Twitch and Shout, a place for youngsters, who like Cohen, have Tourette syndrome. Atlanta-based child neurologist Howard Schub says such camps help children better cope with their condition. " Twitch and Shout campers display motor tics common to most kids with Tourette syndrome such as eye blinking, facial grimacing, shoulder shrugging, head jerking, and -- in a few rare cases -- cursing. At 35, Cohen is an elementary school teacher, the author of a book on Tourette syndrome and now a camp director.
