" In an interview with Radio France International Diouf said "the whole system of African football is corrupt" and spoke of "shenanigans" and "scams" within Senegalese soccer. The ban follows comments the striker, who plays for English club Blackburn Rovers, made in the media relating to corruption in African football. The FSF accused Diouf of "having greatly damaged the image of both Senegalese football and of its officers and administrative techniques. The FSF claim Diouf failed to appear at a disciplinary hearing earlier this month, though the player denied having been informed about it in a subsequent interview with French sports magazine Stade. Earlier this month his current manager at Blackburn, Steve Kean, said he thought it was time Diouf left the club after he failed to report on time for pre-season training.
