In 2001, with massive amounts of data about polio cases around the world, the CDC (working with the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and consultants at Kid Risk, Inc.) faced an important choice: Direct $100 million in funding dollars and settle for controlling the outbreak of polio, or attempt to completely stop all new cases of polio? For example, every year, the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) holds an international analytics conference that includes a competition for best work in analytics, Big Data, and the applied mathematical field of operations research. If you want to examine an outstanding example of the way that Big Data saves lives, look at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which won the 2014 competition for their quest to eradicate polio. In his CNN opinion piece, "The Big Dangers of Big Data" , Konstantin Kakaes of New America raises some  interesting points about the ways that designing certain types of Big Data projects could lead to bad societal results. These are but two of the countless examples of how advanced analytics and operations research can appropriately leverage Big Data to achieve tangible results and benefits.
