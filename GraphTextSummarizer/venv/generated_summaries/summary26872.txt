That's the way to bring costs down without undermining the quality of care provided to Medicare patients. Low reimbursement rates will just force doctors and hospitals to stop taking care of Medicare patients and thereby impair their access to care. In addition to mending entitlement programs, the GOP plan calls for top-to-bottom reform of the federal bureaucracy, with an emphasis on cutting programs of low or marginal value so that more money can be invested in what truly matters. The Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (plus the new 2010 health care law) will increase from about 10% of the nation's total economic output this year, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), to nearly 16% in 2035. The GOP plan would hold the line on tax hikes and keep revenue at roughly its historical norm of just above 18% of GDP.
