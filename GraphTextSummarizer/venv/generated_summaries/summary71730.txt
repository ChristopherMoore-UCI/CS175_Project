The town of Gonesse, located north of Paris, was scheduled to hold a memorial service Sunday to honor the 113 victims who died when the Concorde jet crashed there on July 25, 2000. -- Ten years after 113 people died when a Concorde jet crashed into a hotel outside Paris, local officials say the country's government has not done enough to protect people living near the airport. The crash, coupled with rising costs and a slump in demand, eventually led to Concorde's retirement in 2003. A court is expected to rule in a manslaughter case related to the crash in December, a statement from Gonesse's government said. "Seventy-five percent of air accidents have happened in taking off or landing in densely populated areas," Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy said in a statement.
