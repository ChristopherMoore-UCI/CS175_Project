Many of those who purchase beer in Whiteclay drink it there and return to the reservation drunk. What both sides agree on is that alcohol abuse is common on the reservation and beer is easy to get. The neighboring border town of Whiteclay , Nebraska, is home to fewer than 15 residents but supports four beer stores that manage to sell 11,000 cans of beer a day to their predominately Native American customer base. "Alcohol is behind every social problem we have," said activist and tribe member Olowan Martinez. In the long term, Eagle Bull said, stores on the reservation could eventually shut down the Whiteclay operations.
