Born without a fibula bone in each leg, the South African is the first double amputee to run at the world championships, and next year he will be the first to race at the Olympics. "I think next year's going to be quite a big year, as far as demand on my performances," the 24-year-old told CNN. The International Association of Athletics Federations had at first decreed, after a series of tests, that the blades gave Pistorius an unfair advantage. So I know next year is going to be a big year. He overturned that at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and maintains that he will be competing on a level playing field in London next year.
