We drove north into central London, seeing shops smashed on Tottenham Court Road, and then into Camden -- the bohemia of cool -- suddenly awash with gangs of masked teenagers without a policeman in sight. By Tuesday in London it was clear that sheer numbers of police were needed. After several hours the police managed to re-establish order in Peckham, but by then the genie was out of the bottle. The fire brigade and police watched the vehicles burn, but made no attempt to extinguish them, apparently for fear of being attacked. Fed-up with the spreading chaos, communities were taking on the role of the police, groups of men protecting businesses, mosques, temples and cafes in different parts of the city, applauding the police as they sped past to the latest flash-point.
