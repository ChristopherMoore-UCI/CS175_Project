Jackie reported her rape, plus two other similar gang rapes she learned about at the same Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, to Dean Nicole Eramo, head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board. On the day the Rolling Stone article about Jackie's alleged rape was published, Caitlin Kelly, a Web producer at The New Yorker, wrote a string of tweets imagining what it would look like if people responded to her wallet being stolen the way they respond to rape. For instance, the federal government estimates that 65% of rape or sexual assault cases are unreported, while 17% of car thefts are unreported. Jackie's female friend insisted, "She's gonna be the girl who cried 'rape,' and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again." Will Drew and UVA get off easily while Jackie's life -- and other college women like her -- is shattered?
