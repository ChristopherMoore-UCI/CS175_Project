"The world has been littered with English players who haven't adjusted to being a big player at a European club," journalist Michael Calvin, who has regularly crossed paths with Bale during his meteoric rise over the past three years, told CNN. David Platt began Italian lessons while still at Aston Villa -- a move to Bari then just a possibility -- while Steve McManaman mastered Spanish quickly to become at ease almost instantly with Real Madrid teammates and fans alike. "Real Madrid and Perez are looking at him as helping them launch into a completely different commercial market," added Calvin, author of the recently published "Nowhere Men," which looks at football's unknown football talent spotters -- a club's scouts. It is a huge leap from being the boy at home playing FIFA to being the hope of world football." Calvin, though, also makes the point that Bale is no innocent bystander in all this. " Herbert Kilpin was the first British footballer to ply his trade overseas professionally in 1891 and he was a founding member of Italian club AC Milan eight years later.
