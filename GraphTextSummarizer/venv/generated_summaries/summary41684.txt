Pelosi, before handing over the gavel, reiterated that House Democrats are prepared to work with the Republicans on proposals to help the middle class, create jobs, and cut the deficit. The first order of business for the new House majority was passage of a new set of rules to govern the chamber. Boehner, first elected to the House in 1990, inherited the speaker's gavel from Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-California. The new House has the largest freshman class with no previous experience in elective office since 1948. Ten of Boehner's 11 siblings were present when he was formally sworn in by Michigan Rep. John Dingell, the longest-serving member of the House.
