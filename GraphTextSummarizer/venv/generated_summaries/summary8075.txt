A statement by Obama praised Bryson's efforts to boost U.S. exports as commerce secretary and said Bryson has agreed to serve as a member of the president's Export Council. The White House said Obama will meet with Bryson in the Oval Office later Thursday to thank him for his service as commerce secretary. Obama nominated Bryson to succeed Gary Locke as commerce secretary in May 2011. Bryson's deputy, Rebecca Blank, will continue to serve as acting secretary, Obama's statement said. "I have concluded that the seizure I suffered on June 9th could be a distraction from my performance as secretary and that our country would be better served by a change of leadership of the department," Bryson's letter said.
