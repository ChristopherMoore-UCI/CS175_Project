The flame was also accompanied on its flight from Greece by footballer David Beckham, London Mayor Boris Johnson and Sebastian Coe, head of the London 2012 organizing group. The Olympic torch began its 70-day, 8,000-mile journey around Britain Saturday from Land's End in Cornwall, with three-time Olympic gold medal winner Ben Ainslie the first to carry the torch. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who greeted the flame on its arrival in Cornwall, said it was the start of an exciting journey. Ainslie, a sailor who grew up in Cornwall, southwest England, passed the torch on to 18-year-old surfer Anastassia Swallow, the second torchbearer. The flame had been on an eight-day journey round Greece after being lit at ancient Olympia, birthplace of the Olympics, on May 10.
