Flores, a Virginia Beach, Virginia, native, says even though she was used to hurricanes, this one was the worst. Vacation season is nearly over, and kids are returning to school with the telltale tans and smiles that mean they had a wonderful and relaxing holiday. The couple was supposed to fly to St. Lucia, stopping briefly in Puerto Rico to change planes. "Upon arriving in Puerto Rico, we discovered why our plane was not full and why our flight [to St. Lucia] had been cancelled," Flores wrote in her iReport. And frustrating doesn't even begin to describe the feelings of many other iReporters who wrote in to tell us about their worst vacations ever.
