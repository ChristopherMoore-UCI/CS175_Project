"Today I want to appeal directly to those other young boys, now men, who were also subject to abuse at the hands of these men," Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald said. London's Metropolitan Police have opened investigations into the deaths of three young boys, a probe that is tied to "allegations of serious and organized sexual abuse," it announced Thursday. In addition to sex abuse, McDonald said that his team "is also investigating the possible murder of three young boys. Nick has told police how a car would be sent to collect him and drive him to the apartment in Dolphin Square, McDonald said. In a statement, detectives involved in Operation Midland, an investigation launched last month into sexual abuse dating back more than 30 years ago, pleaded for the public's help in tracking down victims, witnesses and assailants.
