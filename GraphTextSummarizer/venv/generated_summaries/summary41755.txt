-- Two U.S. filmmakers were injured Saturday when their small plane crashed into a three-story residential building in downtown Nairobi. People gather around the wreckage of a plane that struck a building in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Saturday. "Before the plane crashed, witnesses said it was flying unusually low," said Francis Mwaka, a Kenyan federal communications official. Dan Parris, 25, and Rob Lehr, 26, both from St. Louis, Missouri, were shooting an independent documentary on poverty in Africa. The plane was headed to nearby Wilson Airport, where most light aircraft land in the Kenyan capital.
