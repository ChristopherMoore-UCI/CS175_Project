A NATO official said if there is a need to send personnel to Rabta it might be done by individual nations rather than the alliance which would have to reach a consensus on sending NATO forces on a new mission. At the moment no one has publicly said whether Moammar Gadhafi's forces or rebel forces are in control of Rabta, although U.S. officials have said for days they believe the stockpile is secure. NATO has begun high-level internal discussions on how to protect Libya's mustard gas supplies if the stockpile suddenly was deemed to no longer be secure, an Obama administration official tells CNN. "We are watching the chemical weapons and SCUD missiles to make sure they are not used in the endgame," a senior NATO official told CNN. Any force could include both military personnel as well as intelligence or contractor personnel with the technical expertise in monitoring chemical stockpiles.
