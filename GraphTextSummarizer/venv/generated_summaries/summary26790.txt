The so-called Defense of Marriage Act is a valueless tradition that, like laws against interracial marriage that were finally overturned by the Supreme Court in 1967, undermines the spirit of love and commitment that couples share and sends the wrong message to society. The Respect for Marriage Act will provide couples with much-needed certainty that their lawful marriages will be honored under federal law and that they will have the same access to federal responsibilities and rights as all other married couples. To end this injustice, I co-authored legislation that would ensure that valid marriages are respected under federal law, and spoke at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol announcing the bill's introduction this week. Regardless of this fact, immigration continues to be used by some, including U.S. Representative Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, as a tactic to stop debate and progress in health care reform. Whether it is immigration, health care, or any other issue, the American people expect their elected representatives to build fair and workable solutions and to engage in debate that is not based on false information or lies.
