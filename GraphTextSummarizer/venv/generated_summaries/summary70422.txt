-- Sen. John McCain played offense against Sen. Barack Obama during much of the final presidential debate as he challenged his rival on his policies, judgment and character. Watch what Obama says about Ayers » Obama said Ayers has become the "centerpiece" of McCain's campaign and said the fact that McCain keeps bringing Ayers up "says more about your campaign than it says about me. Watch McCain say he's no Bush » McCain aides said they had been working on him to be more explicit in drawing a distinction between himself and Bush. Obama said he is the candidate who can bring "fundamental change" to the country and continued to try to link McCain to President Bush. In one of the more forceful moments of the debate, McCain turned to Obama and said, "I am not President Bush."
