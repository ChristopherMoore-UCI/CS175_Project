Prosecutors have questioned Omar Suleiman, Egypt's former vice president and intelligence chief, the general prosecutor's office confirmed Tuesday, about events that took place during his brief period as vice president. "Whether the president gave the official order or remained silent knowing the shooting of protesters would take place, he is responsible for the 846 protesters who died during the January 25 revolution, especially since the killing started from Day One," said Judge Omar Marawan, the commission's secretary-general. Members also concluded that police used extreme force against protesters and fired shots at people who were trying to film the unrest from balconies and windows. -- Ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was complicit in shootings of anti-regime protesters during a period of upheaval in the country, a member of an official fact-checking commission said Tuesday. The commission watched videos that confirmed several prisons were opened by security forces, according to the report.
