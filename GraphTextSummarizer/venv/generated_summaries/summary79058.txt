" Moti's heroics were made all the more remarkable given he performed them in front of legendary Steaua goalkeeper Helmut Ducadam, the club's honorary president. But in a dilapidated stadium in the north east of Bulgaria, one club's European Champions League dream came true on Wednesday night. " Ludogorets now takes its place in the draw on Thursday alongside European powerhouses Real Madrid -- the defending champions -- Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Juventus. Ducadam made four successive saves in Steaua's 1986 penalty shootout with Barcelona in the European Cup final, delivering the trophy for his side. I have no words to describe the feeling," Moti, who used to play for Steaua's rivals Dinamo Bucharest, told UEFA's official website.
