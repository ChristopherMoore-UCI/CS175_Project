-- A half-dozen contract security officers at the federal courthouse where baseball's Roger Clemens was put on trial last month are in trouble with their employer for accepting gifts from Clemens' defense team after the judge declared a mistrial, the U.S. Marshals Service said Thursday. Clemens, under a six-count indictment accusing him of lying to Congress during an investigation of illicit steroid use, may still face a re-trial on those charges. After the mistrial, according to the Marshals Service, a number of courthouse security officers employed by a contractor received baseballs autographed by Clemens, reportedly in appreciation of their escorting him through a large mob of media covering the trial. "These alleged violations did not jeopardize judicial security," the Marshals Service said, leaving any discipline up to the contractor that is conducting it own investigation. While no laws were broken, "It is a violation of the contract for Court Security Officers to accept gifts in connection with official duties," according to a policy cited by the Marshals Service.
