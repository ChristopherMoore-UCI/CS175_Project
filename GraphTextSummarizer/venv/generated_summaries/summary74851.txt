"It's important for black women to see other black women breast-feeding," said Nicole Sandiford, who started "Black Women Do Breastfeed" in 2010 as a blog and Facebook group. Sandiford: I named it "Black Women Do Breastfeed" so that people could be aware that there is community of black women who do breast-feed and who are interested in breast-feeding and want to share their experiences. I thought one thing I can do to broaden the conversation is collect stories of black women who are breast-feeding." Georgia mother Shlonda Smith also breast-fed her five children, but somewhere along the way, a friend said to her "you're the only black women I know who breast-feeds," remember Smith, who joined "Black Women Do Breastfeed" as a co-administrator in late 2013. "Black Women Do Breastfeed" also received negative comments about its name and its focus on black women. "It became important to me to see other black women breast-feed and make it visible that yes, black women do breast-feed," Smith said.
