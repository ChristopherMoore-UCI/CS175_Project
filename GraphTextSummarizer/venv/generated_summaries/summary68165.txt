The only other thing Hasan said in court was the names of his current lawyers: Col. Chris Poppe, Maj. Hasan's new lead attorney Poppe said they wished to defer entering a plea or any new motions in the case. "I have consistently argued that Major Hasan has not been treated fairly. However, Major Hasan fully understands that I stand ready and anxious to resume an active role." Hasan was shot by Fort Hood police officers and has been paralyzed from the center of his chest down since the attack.
