Even before the trial, Erwiana's case became a cause celebre for campaigners who say that Hong Kong rules dictating that domestic workers reside at their employers' homes expose hundreds of thousands of foreign workers -- mostly women -- to potential abuse. Despite abuses, foreign domestic workers still flock to Hong Kong When Erwiana's employer escorted her to the airport in early January 2014, other Indonesian women noticed her condition and pressed her to tell them what had happened. Amnesty says workers are under pressure to stay in abusive situations because Hong Kong law demands they leave the city within two weeks of terminating their contract, if they can't find a new job. " Erwiana's claims led to protests in Hong Kong, demands for justice and calls for the law to be changed to allow domestic foreign workers to live outside their employers' home. A Hong Kong housewife has been found guilty of imprisoning and abusing a young Indonesian maid whose case has prompted protests and calls for reform of the city's laws governing domestic workers.
