Several men appeared to help the elderly man, all of whom came forward in the first 24 hours. While the fire department urges people to not dive into the middle of a fire for their own safety, Johns can't help but be impressed by seeing ordinary people at their best.

"There's over half a million people in Fresno and this guy's picture is all over the news and nobody could find him," says Fresno fire department spokesman Koby Johns. A man who spends his free time helping out elderly people in his neighborhood with their gardens naturally thought about what he could do to help.
