Third seed Murray will next face Cypriot Marcus Baghdatis, who beat French 16th seed Richard Gasquet 6-4 6-4. But no more Brits remain in the ladies' singles, as third seed Maria Sharapova edged closer to her first Olympic medal by overcoming Britain's former junior Wimbledon winner Laura Robson 7-6 (7-5) 6-3. Sharapova, who was the first woman to carry Russia's flag at the opening ceremony, faces a rematch with German 15th seed Sabine Lisicki -- who beat her in the fourth round at Wimbledon. British hopes in the competition remain in the hands of Wimbledon finalist Andy Murray, who beat 43rd-ranked Jarkko Niemenen from Finland 6-2 6-4. World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka strolled into round three with a 6-1 6-2 demolition of Spain's Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez, earning a match with Russia's Vera Zvonareva.
