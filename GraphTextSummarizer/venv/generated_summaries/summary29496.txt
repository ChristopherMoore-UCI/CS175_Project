North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch, the state-run Korean Central News Agency said last week. As part of the deal, Pyongyang also agreed to refrain from nuclear tests and long-range missile tests, but just last week announced it would launch a rocket with a satellite attached in mid-April. North Korea ejected inspectors from the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy Agency from its Yongbyon nuclear complex in April 2009, about a month before it conducted its second nuclear weapons test. The satellite would be sent into orbit in mid-April to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Sung, North Korea's founder and current leader Kim Jong Un's grandfather. He is in South Korea attending international nuclear conferences ahead of the Seoul Nuclear Security Summit next week.
