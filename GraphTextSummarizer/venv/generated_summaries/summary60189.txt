Jenkins "corrected that in the grand jury" testimony, Bassil said, stating that while she knew Lloyd provided marijuana to Hernandez, "she had no other evidence" that he dealt drugs. Among other things, Bomberg alleged Jenkins destroyed evidence --  a box that Hernandez, who until earlier this year was a standout tight end for the New England Patriots, asked her to find in his North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home and "get rid of." At that time, Bassil said, Jenkins was subject to "heavy-handed questioning" during an "extremely difficult" period when Hernandez, the father of her young child, was under arrest for murder. Aaron Hernandez's fiancee pleaded not guilty to perjury on Tuesday, with prosecutors alleging she lied to those looking into the death of Odin Lloyd, whom Hernandez is accused of killing. I don't need to know any more detail." Bomberg, the prosecutor, also said that Jenkins lied to police when she told them Lloyd was a drug dealer.
