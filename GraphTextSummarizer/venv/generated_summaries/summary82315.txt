During rush hour, bullet trains leave urban stations around Japan as often as every six minutes. With the fastest speed of Shinkansen trains at a "mere" 320 km/h (200 mph) -- and some of its technology decades old -- Japan is now facing intense rivalry not only from European train giants France and Germany, but also China, whose 10,000-km (6,200 miles) "gaotie" track currently in operation is the world's longest high-speed rail network. Last month, it held a maglev road show for U.S. politicians, taking them on a test ride in central Japan. For Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the answer lies in maglev, or magnetic levitation, trains that can reach speeds of 506 km/h (315 mph). Japan expects to spend more than $100 billion on the recently announced proposal to build a maglev rail to run the 286-km distance between Tokyo and Nagoya.
