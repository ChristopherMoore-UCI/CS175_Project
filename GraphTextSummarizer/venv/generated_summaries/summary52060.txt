The resurfaced footage comes on the heels of controversy caused by comments regarding homosexuality that Robertson, 67, made to GQ magazine this month. -- "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson is ruffling feathers again, this time for comments he made years ago about how girls should marry when they're still teenagers. He describes the story as "river rat counseling" he was giving to a "boy" of unknown age and -- referring specifically to marrying teenage girls -- also advises the crowd to "check with Mom and Dad about that, of course." " A&E quickly suspended Robertson from filming future episodes of the hit show after he made those comments. "It seems like, to me, a vagina -- as a man -- would be more desirable than a man's anus," Robertson told GQ when opening up about topics he said he couldn't discuss on the show.
