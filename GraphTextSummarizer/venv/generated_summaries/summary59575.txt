Boston Police Crime Laboratory technicians were able to extract DNA profiles from both sets of samples, and those DNA profiles matched one another, the news release says. Now, however, there is an "unprecedented level of certainty" that DeSalvo raped and killed Sullivan, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said in a news release Friday. Solving a murder with DNA Conley said earlier this month that scientists had tried several times in the late 1990s and early 2000s to isolate DNA evidence from semen found in Sullivan's body and on a blanket. A lab test confirms DNA evidence taken from the body of a murder victim matches Albert DeSalvo, who at one point confessed to being the Boston Strangler, Massachusetts authorities said Friday. The evidence was taken after Mary Sullivan, 19, was sexually assaulted and strangled to death on January 4, 1964, in her Charles Street apartment in Boston.
