-- Ten Americans detained and accused of child trafficking in Haiti after they allegedly tried to bus 33 children into the Dominican Republic insist their effort was an attempt to get the children to a shelter. Henry told CNN affiliate KIVI Saturday that the group had been planning to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but that the earthquake sped up the timetable for transporting the Haitian children there. But a Haitian judge has charged the 10 with child trafficking, they said. But that is kidnapping and it is more serious because it's involving children," he said. "We came into Haiti to help those that really had no other source of help," Laura Silsby, a member of the Idaho-based charity, New Life Children's Refuge, told CNN on Saturday.
