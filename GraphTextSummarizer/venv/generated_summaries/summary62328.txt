-- Mac computers are known for their near-immunity to malicious computer programs that plague PCs. "This isn't the first botnet that's been built using Mac computers," Nazario said. It seems that as sleek Mac computers become more popular, they're also more sought-after targets for the authors of harmful programs. But that may be changing somewhat, according to computer security researchers. This Trojan horse program, dubbed the "iBotnet," has infected only a few thousand Mac machines, but it represents a step in the evolution of malicious computer software, Haley said.
