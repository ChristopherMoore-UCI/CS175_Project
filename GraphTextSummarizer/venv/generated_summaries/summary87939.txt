Several Illinois Democrats, including Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and Iraq war veteran Tammy Duckworth, a former congressional candidate who now serves in Gov. Rod Blagojevich's administration, have been mentioned as possible Senate replacements for Obama. Obama followed his years as a community organizer and lawyer with a successful bid for the Illinois state Senate. Obama wrote about moving to Illinois two decades ago "as a young man eager to do my part in building a better America." "On the South Side of Chicago, I worked with families who had lost jobs and lost hope when the local steel plant closed. Obama said his memories of the people of Illinois "will stay with me when I go to the White House in January. " Obama's Senate office will close sometime within two months.
