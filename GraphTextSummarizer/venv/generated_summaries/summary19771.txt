And that, according to Peter Truscott, former UK Energy Minister and Putin biographer, will force the Kremlin to take measured steps going forward. A few months later, Putin talked of re-igniting growth as he hosted the G20 Summit in St Petersburg. During the height of the Western-led banking crisis, Putin chided co-members of the G8 for their careless ways and lack of corporate governance. Putin's popularity has skyrocketed at home, but that is weighed against economic isolation abroad. But it is Putin's annexation of Crimea and unrest in Eastern Ukraine which will define 2014 and very likely his legacy.
