"Multiple independent sources also confirmed that Vilma offered a specific bounty -- $10,000 in cash -- to any player who knocked Arizona quarterback Kurt Warner out of the 2009 Divisional Playoff Game and later pledged the same amount to anyone who knocked Minnesota quarterback Brett Favre out of the 2009 NFC Championship Game the following week," the league concluded after a months-long internal investigation. "Consistent with the panel's decision, Commissioner Goodell will, as directed, make an expedited determination of the discipline imposed for violating the league's pay-for-performance/bounty rule," said league spokesman Greg Aiello. The NFL said its investigation found that the Saints had an "active bounty program" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. " In March, the league suspended four current and former Saints players -- Jonathan Vilma, Scott Fujita, Anthony Hargrove and Will Smith -- concluding that they had leadership roles in the pay-for-injury program. During this time, players were purportedly offered payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game.
