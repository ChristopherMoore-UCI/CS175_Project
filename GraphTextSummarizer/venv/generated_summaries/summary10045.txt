-- After four days of bloody mayhem, Kenyan security forces have "ashamed and defeated" the terrorist gunmen who had besieged Nairobi's Westgate Mall, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Tuesday. U.S. law enforcement sources said they were scouring intelligence reports for evidence of a U.S. connection, but a senior U.S. official said Monday the claim was looking less solid as they continued to investigate. Mwagi Dorcas told CNN's "New Day" on Tuesday that she hid behind luggage in the mall's ground-floor grocery store, memorizing a Muslim prayer sent to her by family in a desperate bid to save her life should attackers find her. Kenya is a key U.S. partner in battling Islamist terrorism and has also contributed military forces to an African Union expedition to fight Al-Shabaab forces in Somalia. Tuesday morning, security forces said they were making final sweeps of the mall and dealing with explosives left behind by terrorists.
