Here's the surprising thing: the Royal Navy runs on "soft skills" (and never on shouted orders). These are the qualities of character and culture that are remarkably resilient and, most importantly, instilled in all Royal Navy personnel. Words uttered by the world's most famous secret agent who is adored by his country, feared by the bad guys and trained by Britain's Royal Navy. What I learned is that when people gather together to achieve an end (excellence in military operations or in business for example), what gets things done is those soft skills. How people are at work affects how they work.
