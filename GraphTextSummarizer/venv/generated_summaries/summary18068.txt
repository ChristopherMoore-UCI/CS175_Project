Four people died and at least 30,000 residents in southern Mexico were affected by heavy rain and winds from the former Tropical Storm Frank, the government-run Notimex news agency said Wednesday. In the nearby state of Tabasco, also in southern Mexico but on the Gulf of Mexico coast, heavy rain affected 48 localities and nearly 7,700 people, Notimex said. -- As Hurricane Frank gained strength far from land over the Pacific Ocean on Thursday morning, southern Mexico dealt with the aftermath of the system's assault on the mainland earlier in the week. Hurricane center meteorologists predicted the system's strength -- currently Category 1 (74 to 95 mph) -- would change little Thursday, and then would gradually begin weakening on Friday. The deaths and damage occurred in Oaxaca state, on Mexico's Pacific coast, Notimex said.
