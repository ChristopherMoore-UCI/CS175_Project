On climate change, abortion and the death penalty, "we're not seeing Americans necessarily becoming more liberal," said Frank Newport, editor in chief of Gallup. In 1996, Gallup found 27% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, while 68% opposed it. Last year, 53% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, while 45% opposed. A CNN/ORC International poll found in September that 53% of Americans supported same-sex marriage, up from 44% in 2008. Still, Pew found that even among the oldest Americans, support for same-sex marriage has gone up over the past 10 years.
