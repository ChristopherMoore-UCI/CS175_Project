When Sacra's temperature went up, he sent the president of SIM, the aid organization he works for, an email that read: "To all of you at SIM, and to my colleagues here in Liberia at ELWA Hospital, I apologize," read a tearful Bruce Johnson, president of SIM USA. The doctors said they are exploring "experimental options," calling on experts throughout the world to see what experimental therapeutics might work best and what treatment is "most promising." Sacra, the third American with Ebola to return to the United States for treatment, was stationed in Liberia when he was exposed to the virus. He said Sacra was concerned that the attention on his case would disrupt broader patient care at ELWA Hospital in Liberia. " Rick Sacra had been to Liberia with SIM before, and volunteered to go again after he heard fellow missionaries Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly had contracted the virus, Johnson said. Sacra was following all protocols and taking necessary precautions against Ebola, Johnson said.
