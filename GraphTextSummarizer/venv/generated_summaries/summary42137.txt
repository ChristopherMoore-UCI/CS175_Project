-- David Moyes' first Manchester derby ended in crushing defeat Sunday as his United team suffered an embarrassing 4-1 loss away to English Premier League title rival City. While the result echoed City's 6-1 thumping of United at Old Trafford two years ago, which gave Roberto Mancini's men a five-point cushion at the top on the way to a long-awaited league title, this time the victory has merely kept the Light Blues in touch with leading sides Arsenal and Tottenham. The France midfielder calmly volleyed in the fourth goal at the far post from a cross by Jesus Navas -- another new addition to City's squad -- after captain Vincent Kompany stopped a United attack and charged upfield. It lifted City up to third in the table, with new manager Manuel Pellegrini vindicated in restoring Alvaro Negredo to the starting lineup as the Spain striker set up two of the goals. Nasri was criticized for his performance in last season's corresponding fixture, a tempestuous 3-2 defeat for City marred by pitch invasions and coin throwing, but he has been a different player this campaign.
