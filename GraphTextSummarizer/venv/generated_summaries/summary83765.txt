"This will be a difficult transition for all of us, but Kate and I will work out a schedule that enables our kids to have plenty of quality time with both of us at home in Pennsylvania," Jon Gosselin said in Tuesday's statement. Kate Gosselin filed for a divorce from Jon on Monday, after 10 years of marriage and four weeks into the current season of the popular reality show. Jon and Kate Gosselin announced their official separation on Monday evening's show. " "Following a retrospective of Jon and Kate's first 10 years airing on June 29th, the show will be on hiatus until August 3rd," the network said. "Over the course of this weekend, Jon's activities have left me no choice but to file legal procedures in order to protect myself and our children," she said in a statement released by TLC on Tuesday.
