"Watching Eurovision is a national tradition in Sweden," said Maria Akesson, 28, a motion graphics student from Stockholm. The ultimate winner is decided by a combination of public vote and a jury that consists of Swedish industry experts, and Eurovision judges from 11 other countries. Unlike in many other western European countries, the privilege of representing Sweden at the annual contest is hotly contested, through a grueling series of televised heats which have grown to become more popular than Eurovision itself. That love of music has translated to a long history of Eurovision success, with the most wins in the competition after Ireland (seven), France, Luxembourg and the UK (five each). Proud tradition "A lot of people don't know this, but Swedes are obsessed with music," said Blankens, who followed his stint on Melodifestivalen (Melody Festival) by producing the Swedish version of American Idol.
