Jackson headed into his office at the Blackwater training facility, where he was joined by Chris Taylor, who had just been promoted to vice president of strategic initiatives, and Mike Rush, the director of Blackwater Security Consulting. Scott Helvenston and Mike Teague were in one SUV, Wesley Batalona and Jerry Zovko in another, as the convoy drove a little over a mile into town. They linked up with Prince by phone, as he arrived at his unmarked office in a McLean high-rise in the dark hours of morning. " Donna Zovko, mother of Jerry Zovko, who was killed in Fallujah, testifies at a House hearing. Jackson, who had seen Mike Teague less than two weeks before, would be the one to tell Teague's wife and 15-year-old son that Mike wouldn't be coming home.
