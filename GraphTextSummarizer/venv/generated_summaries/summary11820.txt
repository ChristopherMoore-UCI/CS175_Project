-- About a dozen Italian women have posted an open letter to the pope on the internet in which they claim to have had intimate relationships with priests and urge the church to abolish celibacy for Catholic clergy. She said she knows of about 40 women who were or are in special relationships with priests. "We decided that it was (time) to make our reality known," Salomone told CNN. The relationship was not sexual but platonic, Salomone told CNN Friday. Another one of the signatories to the letter is Antonella Carisio, who Salomone said had a sexual relationship with a Brazilian priest.
