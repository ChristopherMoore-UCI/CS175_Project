The iconic World Trade Center cross --  two intersecting steel beams that held up when the Twin Towers collapsed on September 11, 2001 -- was moved Saturday to its new home at the nearby 9/11 Memorial and Museum. I urge all those who believe in the consolation and power of the Cross to visit it in its future home in the Memorial Museum." Joe Daniels, 9/11 Memorial president, said the cross is "an important part of our commitment to bring back the authentic physical reminders that tell the history of 9/11 in a way nothing else could. "I am grateful to the leadership of the Memorial Museum for their sensitivity, compassion and professionalism. The service was led by Father Brian Jordan, a Franciscan monk who ministered to workers clearing the area after the 9/11 attacks. "Its return is a symbol of the progress on the Memorial & Museum that we feel rather than see, reminding us that commemoration is at the heart of our mission."
