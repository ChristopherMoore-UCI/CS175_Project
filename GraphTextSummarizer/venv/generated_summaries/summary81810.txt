In addition, Canadian production will be suspended for the week beginning May 23, and U.S. production for the week starting May 30. " "We are trying to continue production as much as possible and keep our work force intact in order to facilitate a smooth transition back to full production when all parts are available," said Steve St. Angelo, executive vice president of TEMA. Previously, Toyota Motor Engineering and Manufacturing North America, Inc. (TEMA), had said it would suspend production on Mondays and Fridays between April 15 and April 25. Officials said Tuesday that the drop in production would continue and that Toyota would stop production all together between the dates of April 28 to May 9. -- Toyota has announced drastic production cuts in North America and China due to difficulty in supplying parts following the massive earthquake and tsunami in Japan.
