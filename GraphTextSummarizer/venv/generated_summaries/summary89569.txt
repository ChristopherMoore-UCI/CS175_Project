-- They are some of the most spectacular diamonds, rubies and sapphires in the world, and they have graced the outfits of monarchs for centuries, now -- just in time for Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee -- Britain's Crown Jewels have gone on display in a new-look exhibition. "But they are also a working collection, and we wanted to get that across to visitors; that they are real, and that they are very much used, both during coronations and more regularly." Once through the heavy steel doors -- weighing 2,000 kilos each -- visitors are guided through the process of coronation, allowing them to feel part of the procession, with all its pomp and circumstance. Perhaps the most important piece is the St Edward's Crown, which dates from 1661, and is worn by the monarch at the moment of coronation. Many of the items in the Tower of London today date back to the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, and the rule of King Charles II, though the collection has been added to and expanded over the centuries since. It was used for the crowning of George V at the Delhi Durbar, because the traditional Crown Jewels are not permitted to leave the country, but has not been worn since.
