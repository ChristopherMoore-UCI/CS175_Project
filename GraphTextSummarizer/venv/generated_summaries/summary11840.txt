The Transportation Security Administration says it will have several teams of behavior-detection officers working with local police in Tampa, Florida, as an added security measure for the high-profile game. This month, the TSA also held a four-hour training session on behavior detection for about 100 Tampa-area police. Fans take in the sights Thursday at the NFL Experience at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. They'll also be around key hotels associated with the Super Bowl, the airport and other transportation centers in Tampa. According to White, if a TSA officer observes someone displaying unusual behavior, a local police officer will follow up by questioning the person.
