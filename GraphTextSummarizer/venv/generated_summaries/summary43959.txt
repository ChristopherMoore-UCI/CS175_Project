If the plane had been flying at 12,000 feet, CNN aviation analyst Mark Weiss said, it would have burned more fuel than it would at a higher altitude, which could mean projections about where it ended up are off base. "We've had so much information come out and so much contradictory information come out, that I caution against jumping to any types of conclusions at this point," said Mark Weiss, a former American Airlines pilot and CNN aviation analyst. "I don't know that we're necessarily searching in the right place," CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said. During the plane's last contact with air traffic controllers as it was approaching Vietnamese air space, it was reportedly flying at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet. The equipment was moved to JFK International Airport in New York on Sunday and will be shipped to Australia via commercial air Monday, the official said, emphasizing that the move doesn't signal any change in the status of the search.
