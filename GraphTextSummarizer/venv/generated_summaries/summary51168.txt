Robert Strang, a former DEA agent, says infiltration of Mexican drug cartels is not only happening, but it's essential in investigations aimed at dismantling Mexican criminal organizations by targeting their finances. Felipe Gonzalez, a federal senator with Mexico's ruling PAN party, says they will demand an investigation to determine whether the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration allowed its agents to launder money, possibly even on Mexican soil, as part of an investigation into the inner workings of Mexican drug cartels. -- Allegations surrounding a U.S. investigation that may have involved laundering money for Mexican drug cartels are causing concern on both sides of the border. As a result of this cooperation, we have seized illicit transnational criminal organization money all around the world through our partnership with law enforcement. Last month, a small group of Mexican legislators requested the extradition of American agents involved in Operation Fast and Furious.
