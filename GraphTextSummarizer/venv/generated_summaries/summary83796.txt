One mission will have you battling in Panama during the late '80s, and then the next takes you to a luxury resort in the Cayman Islands in the near future, with different characters and different weapons. (Game publisher Activision, in a recent statement, said, "Including Gen. Petraeus and other real-life figures was strictly a creative decision made many months ago when the storyline was drafted.") Other real-life people in the game include former Panamanian President Manuel Noriega and Lt. Col. Oliver North, the central figure from the 1987 Iran-Contra scandal. If you like multiplayer action, "Black Ops II" gives you plenty of modes. Players are tasked to attack or defend different points on a battlefield, and can either do it at ground level, by taking over one of the combat units, or by directing all the troops from an overhead view. Historical footage from the 1980s and '90s features former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.
