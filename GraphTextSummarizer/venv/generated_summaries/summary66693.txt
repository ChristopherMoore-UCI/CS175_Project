Human Rights Watch, a prominent humanitarian watchdog group, issued a report Friday detailing "torture and ill-treatment" of protesters over the past month, and U.N. human rights experts released a statement deploring the crackdown on peaceful demonstrations. The announcement of the new Cabinet came amid continued anti-regime protests and clashes between demonstrators and security forces, a conflict that has caused scores of deaths. The thousands who gathered there chanted for the reform of the regime, trials for officials responsible for protesters' deaths, and solidarity with protesters in other cities. Witnesses also reported demonstrations in Baniyas, Dair Elzour, Douma, Zabadani, the outskirts of Damascus and other cities where protesters called for political, economic and social changes. Activists, however, say the government has cracked down violently on peaceful protesters.
