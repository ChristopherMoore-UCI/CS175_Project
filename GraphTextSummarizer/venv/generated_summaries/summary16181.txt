The only way we will enact real tax reform, and grow the economy, is by lowering tax rates and broadening the base by scaling back these egregious handouts. There is no better place to start than scaling back ludicrous handouts to millionaires that expose an entitlement system and tax code that desperately need to be reformed. Senate Democratic leaders have already signaled they will use the debate as a purely partisan exercise designed to embarrass Republicans into opposing tax cuts for the poor while defending tax cuts for the rich. Millionaires receive tax earmarks and deductions crafted by both parties that allow them to write off billions each year. On the tax side, both parties have been reluctant to alter tax earmarks and deductions, such as the mortgage interest deduction.
