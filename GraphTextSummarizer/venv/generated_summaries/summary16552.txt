-- Lori Berenson, an American activist convicted of aiding Peruvian terrorists, returned to Peru after spending the holidays with her family in New York, family members said. She returned Thursday night to Lima on a flight from Newark, New Jersey, said her mother, Rhoda Berenson. Berenson is on parole in Peru through 2015 but was given permission to leave the country to be with her family. Under the permission granted by the court, Berenson could have remained in the United States until January 11. Rhoda Berenson said the family's time together was appreciated and that she expects her daughter to return to the United States at the end of her sentence in 2015.
