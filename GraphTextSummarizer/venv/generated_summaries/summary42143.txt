"To me it's the most significant race in the world," says trainer Andrew Balding, whose Kingsclere stables have yards named after great Epsom Derby winners of the past, such as Ormonde and Flying Fox. But it was his performance in the Epsom Derby that year that earned Mill Reef his place in the pantheon of greats: cruising around Tattenham Corner in fourth place, any doubts over his ability to handle the mile-and-a-half distance were dispelled as soon he passed the two-furlong pole. "At least he's got Group 1 experience (the sport's top level of competition) from last year, so we know he is the caliber of horse that should be running in the Derby. " The stone masons of Kingsclere had better be prepared to work overtime after Derby Day, because there might just be a yard with Bonfire's name on it. Trained by Balding's father Ian, Mill Reef was considered by many to be the greatest racehorse of his day.
