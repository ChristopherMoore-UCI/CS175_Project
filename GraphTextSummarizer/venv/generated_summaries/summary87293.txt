-- Four days after suffering a humbling defeat to Simona Halep, Serena Williams turned the tables on the Romanian to win a fifth WTA Finals title with a crushing straight sets 6-3 6-0 victory in Singapore Sunday. A total of 26 winners flowed from the racket of the 33-year-old American veteran -- who was winning the end of season crown for the third straight year -- the first player since Monica Seles in 1992 to achieve the feat. Fourth-ranked Halep began where she left off to take an early 2-1 lead with a break of service, but this was a very different Williams on the other side of the net. "She was more motivated and more focused maybe in this match, and she tried to hit the balls very strong," Halep told gathered reporters. Williams had called her 6-2 6-0 reverse in round-robin group play Wednesday "embarrassing" and she set about putting the record straight in the title match.
