While Thakkar acknowledges that there are still many challenges when it comes to doing business in Africa, he says the continent holds a fantastic opportunity going forward. "Money should never be a measurement for anything," says Thakkar, founder of the pan-African multi-sector business conglomerate Mara Group. " Echoing a growing chorus of voices cautioning against exploitative behavior from foreign investors, Thakkar adds that, whilst Africa still needs investment in many sectors, gone are the days where the continent desperately relied on outsiders. At just 31 years old, and already heading a vast business empire he built from scratch, Ashish Thakkar has been referred to by some as Africa's youngest billionaire. "I'm taking quite a few of flags into space, as a way to kind of send a strong message that 'look, we as Africa have the vision and the ability as well," says Thakkar.
