With six years and dozens of Cabinet nominations under his belt, President Barack Obama has learned that first picks don't always work out. Here are other first picks who didn't make it: Susan Rice -- Secretary of State When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton left her post following Obama's re-election in 2012, Susan Rice quickly emerged as the frontrunner to replace her. Bill Richardson, the former Clinton administration official who in 2008 was serving as governor of New Mexico, was Obama's first pick for Commerce. The letdown of going with second (or third) choices for Cabinet positions isn't new for Obama. Sen. Judd Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire, was Obama's next pick.
