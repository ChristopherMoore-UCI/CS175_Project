The baby was born August 25 in a remote village in India's eastern state of Bihar along the border with Nepal. He was admitted to the hospital the next day with acute dehydration and infection that doctors say he probably caught during a 683-mile (1,100-kilometer) journey in a rickety train compartment. Bisoi described the case -- called ectopia cordis, which only affects five to eight cases in 1 million live births -- as a "lifetime opportunity" that might shed light on how to deal with similar conditions in the future. The child's 24-year-old father, Chander Majhi, is a laborer in Bihar, one of India's most impoverished states. All India Institute of Medical Sciences, a state-run hospital, carried out the operation free of cost.
