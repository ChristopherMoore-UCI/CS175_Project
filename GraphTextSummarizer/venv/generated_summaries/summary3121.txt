-- The father of Bradley Manning, the soldier responsible for the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, says he believes his son didn't do it. The material covered numerous aspects of U.S. military strategy in Iraq, gave what some called a ground view of events in the Afghanistan war and revealed the inner workings of U.S. State Department diplomacy in leaked cables. "It's my country as well, and leaking information that's going to damage my country, and the soldiers in our military, you know, that would be very upsetting," Brian Manning said. " His son, a former Army intelligence analyst, was convicted last month of stealing and sending a trove of classified data to the website WikiLeaks. He doesn't see how he could have done it, Brian Manning told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 in an interview that aired Tuesday night.
