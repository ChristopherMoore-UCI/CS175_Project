The U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq said Sunday that only 100 members of the MEK remained at Camp Ashraf. Maryam Rajavi, the head of the MEK's political arm, called for those remaining at Camp Ashraf to be transferred to the United States or put under the protection of U.N. peacekeepers. Sunday's clash at Camp Ashraf follows news that Iraq's internal strife killed 804 people and wounded more than 2,000 in August, according to the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq. Sunni-Shiite frictions have escalated since an April incident in Hawija, in northern Iraq, where Iraqi security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. The MEK's new site at Camp Hurriya, the base formerly known as Camp Liberty, has come under fire as well.
