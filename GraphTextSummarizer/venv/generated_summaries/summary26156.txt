-- A wicked opportunity is brewing at Wookey Hole Caves in western England. Aspiring witches audition for the job Tuesday at Wookey Hole Caves in England. Today, the caves at Wookey Hole are part of a tourist attraction with rides, a circus, theme parks and restaurants. Applicants are told they must, however, be knowledgeable in the history of witchcraft, be willing to travel, sleep overnight in caves, and cannot be allergic to cats. The would-be witches have one minute to perform for the panel Tuesday, employing their best cackle and whatever props they can carry, organizers say.
