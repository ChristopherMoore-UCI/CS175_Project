It's a frat-house flick with more on its mind than beer, bongs, and beer bongs. Seth Rogen was recently quoted in an Entertainment Weekly magazine article as saying that there have been only one and a half good movies ever made about frat life: "Animal House" and the first half of "Old School." Directed by "Forgetting Sarah Marshall's" Nicholas Stoller, "Neighbors" stars Rogen and Rose Byrne as Mac and Kelly Radner, a 30-something couple with a newborn daughter, a sensible station wagon, and a crushing mortgage on a house littered with breast pumps and baby monitors. Exhibit A: As the film opens, Rogen and Byrne are getting hot and heavy in the bedroom, only to realize that their baby is watching Daddy tell Mommy he's about to take her to ''Bonertown.'' James Franco may play Tommy Wiseau in film based on 'The Disaster Artist' One of the best surprises in Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien's script is its refusal to succumb to lazy sitcom stereotypes, which would set Rogen up as the oafish Kevin James man-child and Byrne as the nag.
