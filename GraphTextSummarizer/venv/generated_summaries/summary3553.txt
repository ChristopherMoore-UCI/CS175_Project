BER, the company managing the construction, said in a statement: "Reasons for the renewed delays are problems with the fire extinguishing system, especially with regards to the fresh air vents in case of fire, but also the complexity of the entire construction situation." " Germany's largest daily newspaper, BILD, has called the situation surrounding Berlin's new signature airport a "disgrace for Germany," and quoted several international reports on the problems with the construction process. -- The opening of Berlin's new international airport has been postponed again, officials said, in the latest of a series of setbacks that have led some in Germany to slam the project as a national embarrassment. The airport's original opening in June 2012 was canceled only days beforehand, when problems with the sprinkler systems came to light. Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit stood down as head of the supervisory board overseeing the project on Monday, as he acknowledged the airport would still not be ready for its latest scheduled opening on October 27.
