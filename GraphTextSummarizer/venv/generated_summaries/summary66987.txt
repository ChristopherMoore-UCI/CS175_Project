Power napping is a lot like normal napping, only when you're done with a power nap, you're expected to actually do stuff. And that's why I was rather excited this week to discover all the social media buzz over the amazing new Ostrich Pillow. The Ostrich Pillow was conceptualized by the European design duo kawamura-ganjavian, who wanted to find a creative way to provide people with the health and productivity benefits commonly associated with power napping. And as a bonus, in addition to the small face opening for breathing, the hand holes at the top kind of make you look like Admiral Ackbar from "Star Wars. The official sales pitch for the Ostrich Pillow even claims that a 20-minute power nap can increase productivity by 37%.
