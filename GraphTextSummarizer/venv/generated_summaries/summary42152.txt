His own attorney, James Sultan, admitted that Hernandez "witnessed" the killing of Odin Lloyd, "committed by somebody he knew," but said his client did not commit the crime. Hours after Hernandez was charged with murder, he was let go from the team. Well, Aaron Hernandez, the former New England Patriots tight end and now convicted murderer, made none of those excuses. The NFL for the most part does a great job vetting its players, and certainly Hernandez is an anomaly in the league, where despite the ugly headlines, the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding, law-abiding citizens. But neither the Patriots nor the NFL has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the Hernandez case.
