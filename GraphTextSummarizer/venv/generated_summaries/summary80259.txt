In a letter to the counsel's office, Grassley noted that he had asked Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan whether any White House advance staff had been involved and hadn't had an answer back by Monday. According to sources, the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- signed in at the Cartagena hotel where Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. Meanwhile, House Homeland Security Chairman Peter King said he expects more Secret Service members to be forced out soon. When asked about the possibility of White House Communications Agency staff members being involved, Carney pointed out that they are members of the military. At the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by White House staff or advance team members.
