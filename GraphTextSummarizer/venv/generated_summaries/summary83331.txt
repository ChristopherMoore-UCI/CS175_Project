Specifically, the estate -- which is controlled by Dexter King and Martin Luther King III -- wants his 1964 Nobel Peace Prize and his traveling Bible, which was used by President Barack Obama when he was sworn in for his second term. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued Dexter King in 2008, accusing him of converting "substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America" for his own use. The complaint does not mention the possibility of a sale, and attempts to contact the King brothers, through the estate, Tuesday were unsuccessful. I have absolutely no desire to be in court or to fight yet another public battle," Bernice King said in her statement Tuesday. -- The children of Martin Luther King Jr. are back at loggerheads -- this time over his Bible and Nobel Peace Prize.
