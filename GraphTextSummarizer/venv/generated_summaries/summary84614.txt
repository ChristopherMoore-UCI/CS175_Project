The much-traveled Matthaeus replaces Stanimar Stoilov, who quit after Euro 2012 qualifying defeats to England, and more damagingly, Montenegro earlier this month. "Lothar Matthaeus is the new national team coach," Bulgarian Football Union president Borislav Mihaylov told a press conference Tuesday. His first game with Bulgaria will be against Wales next month as they attempt to get their qualifying campaign back on track in the October 8 clash. Meanwhile, Paulo Bento was confirmed Tuesday as the new Portugal coach until the end of Euro 2012. But his managerial career has been less successful and his last job was a one-year spell in charge of Maccabi Netanya in Israel and he has also coached Partizan Belgrade and Red Bull Salzburg.
