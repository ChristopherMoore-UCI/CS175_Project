Walsh said lawmakers must also address suicides amongst military family members, too. Warrior suicides and military family member suicides are "connected," Walsh said. To address that, Walsh's bill would extend the time to receive mental health treatment from five years to 15 years. It also calls for annual reviews of care programs within the Defense Department and the VA to ensure resources are being used effectively to help service members and vets struggling with mental health issues. Sometimes it can take longer than five years for service members and veterans to realize they're experiencing the symptoms of  Post Traumatic Stress and other mental injuries.
