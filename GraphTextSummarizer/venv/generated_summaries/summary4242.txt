Once van der Sloot is eligible for release he's expected to be extradited to the United States to face charges related to the Holloway case. The Alabama 18-year-old was last seen leaving an Aruba nightclub in 2005 with van der Sloot and two other men. He has been linked to the disappearance of American teenager Natalee Holloway, who vanished in Aruba in 2005. Van der Sloot was indicted on federal charges of extortion and wire fraud after American authorities accused him of extorting money from Holloway's mother by offering bogus information about her daughter's disappearance. Leidy Figueroa, the Dutch convict's wife, told RTL, a newsgroup in the Netherlands that is also a CNN affiliate, that van der Sloot was stabbed twice.
