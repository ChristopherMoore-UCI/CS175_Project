It's not the first time the President, who represents the Institutional Revolutionary Party that once ruled Mexico for more than 70 years, has faced allegations of government corruption and accusations the government is too slow to fight crime. He compared it to a massacre of students during a Mexico City demonstration in 1968. Even as he deals with the investigation into the missing students and its aftermath, an investigative report from Mexican news website Aristegui Noticias over the weekend alleged that Mexico's President and his wife have been living in a lavish $7 million mansion owned by a contractor that's won lucrative government projects. It's a rapidly unfolding political crisis for Pe√±a Nieto, threatening his efforts to revamp Mexico's image abroad and convince citizens that drug-related violence is on the decline. Spanish for "enough, I'm tired" -- became a trending hashtag on Twitter and a topic of viral YouTube video posts as people in Mexico and around the world fired back.
