Loved far and wide A line of Mingo County residents who came to view Crum's body stretched out into the parking lot of the local high school Saturday evening, CNN affiliate WSAZ reported. Maynard's mother, Olgie, said her son spent time in a state hospital for mental health issues in recent years. Deputies drove up with Crum's widow, Rosie Crum, who is now sheriff, in the late afternoon. Emotionally disturbed A search of Mingo County court records shows no criminal arrests or civil cases involving Maynard. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has traced the gun that authorities say was used in the shooting of Crum, according to West Virginia State Police.
