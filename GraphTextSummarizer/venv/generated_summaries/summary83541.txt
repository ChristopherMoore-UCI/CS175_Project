Not suprisingly, when we asked what people thought about this school's policy on CNN's Facebook page, we got a ton of comments, the majority outraged by the school's decision. "I don't think kids should have their fun pasttimes discontinued, but head trauma can be serious," said Marilyn Decker on Facebook. Soft nerf balls will be provided during recess, and kids can play with hardballs during gym and intramural athletics. "Without opportunities to learn how to navigate space with their bodies, and to negotiate rules, risks, and experimentation of cooperative play, how are children going to ever be able to handle themselves in any society as adults?" said Alex Martin, an associate director at a Manhattan nursery school. "With children in close proximity to each other, it is not safe for them to be engaged in unstructured play with hardballs," said the district.
