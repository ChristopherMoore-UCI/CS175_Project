-- Suspected Maoist rebels in eastern India who held up a train carrying 300 passengers Wednesday ended their siege after a four-hour standoff, officials said. Then, elections officials will count the vote electronically in a single day -- on May 16, three days after the last round of polling. And in neighboring Bihar state, suspected Maoists, who had called for a general strike, set eight trucks on fire, shot dead a driver, and blew up a government office on Wednesday, police said. Maoist rebels seized the train as India continued to vote. No one was hurt, said A.K. Chandra of India's east-central railway.
