One of the last resorts for veterans struggling with the return to civilian life is a suicide-prevention hot line based in upstate New York. While the responders handle the incoming calls to the hot line, health techs alert police departments and ambulances across the country to get help to veterans trying to take their own lives. The men and women who answer the Veterans Crisis Line phones are on the front lines of an all-out war on suicide. The numbers illustrate a small segment of the continuing emotional and physical toll of 10 years of war in Afghanistan and Iraq and how it defies a host of efforts by the government to detect and solve the problem of suicide. Veterans can also reach out for help by sending a text to 838255.
