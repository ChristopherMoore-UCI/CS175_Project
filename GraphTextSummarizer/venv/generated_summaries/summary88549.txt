Russia is, by comparison, the world's second largest military exporter after the U.S., earning $13.2 billion from arms exports last year. European Union countries earned $583 million from weapons exports to Russia in 2013, the bulk of which was part-payment of the Mistral deal, according to analysis from IHS Jane's. Russia's other significant deals include its purchase of two German engines for missile boats in 2001, and four light transport aircraft from the Czech Republic in 2012, according to the SIPRI databases. The trade with Russia compares to $4.3 billion worth of weapons the EU licensed arms companies to sell to the U.S. But in the short-term, the arms ban is unlikely to have a significant impact on Russia's military might.
