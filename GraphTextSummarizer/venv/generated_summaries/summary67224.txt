The Post has already shown its hand by trying to make this all about Sharpton, since they know he's the black bogeyman to white America. Roland S. Martin says NY Post editors should have seen that the cartoon would be considered offensive. In a statement to The Associated Press, Col Allan, the Post's editor-in-chief, said the cartoon was an obvious reference to the story of a chimp in Connecticut that viciously attacked a woman and was killed by police. What could be seen as silly humor if President George W. Bush were in the White House has to be seen through the lens of America's racist past, as noted by the leaders of the New York Association of Black Journalists, who also are demanding an apology from the Post. Oh yes, the Post will have its defenders, accusing African-Americans and others of being hypersensitive.
