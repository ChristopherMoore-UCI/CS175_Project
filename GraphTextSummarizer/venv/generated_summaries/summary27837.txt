"It's called Carnival International, which means the world is coming together," says Alain St. Ainge, the country's minister of tourism and culture. -- The Seychelles is perhaps best known as a vacation destination; with its pristine blue waters and picture-perfect beaches, it's no wonder the smattering of islands (155 in total) off the coast of Madagascar has for generations wooed Hollywood's top brass. The carnival attracts a truly international crowd, with 26 out of the 55 parade floats run by foreign countries. This year, the event attracted Chinese acrobats, Himalayan musicians, gold-plated Indonesian spectators and one American country singer. As it happens, there's more to the island nation than just sun and sea.
