It has received critical acclaim for its eclectic sound, mixing styles including prog rock and dub with traces of traditional South African rhythms. But Mcata said the band's music is ultimately traditional, with their rock sound based around "ancient rhythms." Ramoba agreed that South African traditions are at the heart of the band's music. Guitarist Mpumi Mcata told CNN, "In the beginning people were like, 'oh, they are black, they play rock ...' "South Africa is still segregated, so you have a situation where they put us in front of a white audience and the white audience is confused, and you put us in front of a black audience and the black audience is confused. Although their fusion of styles is a creating a stir outside South Africa, it took a while for their music to be accepted in their home country, where four black musicians playing rock music is still a rarity. Although the band have toured all over Europe and the United States, they say their most memorable gig was in Soweto itself, where the South African dance music of Kwaito reigns supreme.
