We were shown several workshops that teach skills including arts and crafts, baking, culinary arts, carpentry, shoe making and computer skills. Inmate Ramos said Van der Sloot has nothing to worry about since many at Castro Castro have been accused of similar crimes. The last thing we heard before going into Castro Castro prison here was the sound of a metal door closing behind us and the clanking of bolts and locks. Inmates are housed according to their crimes and every inmate group has a leader who serves as a liaison between the inmates and jail officials. We were able to speak freely to inmates in one pavilion used to house inmates accused of drug crimes.
