It's easy to just think of Winkler as "The Fonz" instead of as a man who's also done multiple Adam Sandler movies, "Arrested Development," and "Childrens Hospital" among other things (like wear orange shirts on "Royal Pains"). What I love about this in general is that it's just another wonderful, unexpected line on Winkler's rÃ©sumÃ©. Winkler, who was diagnosed with dyslexia as an adult, is also the author of 17 children's books centered on Hank Zipzer, a boy with dyslexia who overcomes his struggles at school and with bullies. According to the British Embassy in Washington, he's spent much of the last two years touring the U.K. to educate about dyslexia and other learning difficulties.
