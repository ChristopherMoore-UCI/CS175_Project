Pakistan's High Commissioner to the UK Imran Mirza has visited Hussain at the hospital and given him documentation -- including a Pakistani passport -- so that he and other Pakistani officials could continue to have access to him, said Pakistani Information Minister Pervez Rasheed. Hussain -- who had been ill and was preparing to leave his home to get checked at a hospital when he was arrested, according to MQM Senior Deputy Gov. Nadeem Nusrat -- was still in a hospital Thursday under police watch. There is no indication whether that attack had anything to do with MQM or Hussain's arrest. The party appealed for people to go about their business as usual and remain peaceful, with senior leader Haider Abbas Rizvi telling reporters that Hussain himself has related that he doesn't want supporters to take the law into their own hands. Some protests called by MQM after Hussain's arrest turned violent, something that the party condemned.
