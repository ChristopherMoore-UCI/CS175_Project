"Nothing has happened here in terms of the punctures that we have seen and that is the most important thing." Vettel added: "We have had three days with different drivers in different cars and no failures. The Silverstone test doubled up as an opportunity to evaluate new drivers and for many of the regular race drivers to trial the new Pirelli tires which will be introduced at the next grand prix in Hungary. Wolff was watched late on in the test by her husband Toto Wolff, who is a minority shareholder in the Williams team and director of the Mercedes F1 team. It is difficult to read into testing but to put Wolff's time into context the leading Williams car was also just over two seconds slower than Vettel during qualifying at the last race in Germany. Experienced Ferrari driver Felipe Massa, who was on track at the same time as Wolff, praised her impressive full track debut.
