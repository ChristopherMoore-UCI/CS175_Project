When family members were asked to produce a birth certificate or adoption papers for Amber Rose Nicklas, they could not. Maxwell says it appears Amber had been living with the same family in Phoenix, Arizona, for most of the time she was missing, but police are still investigating how she ended up with people who are not her biological family. Authorities got a tip that Amber could be at a home in Phoenix and went there with a court order Wednesday afternoon. When investigators tried to serve the court order, they found that a woman in the home had hidden the child in a shower under a pile of clothes and towels, said Phoenix police Sgt. Authorities confirmed Amber's real identity through footprints, photographs and DNA swabs.
