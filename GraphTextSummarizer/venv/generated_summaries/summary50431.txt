Automatic transmissions outnumber manual 10 to 1 in the market for used vehicles. Clearly, the marketing and sale of used vehicles is a big business. For Krista Glotzbach, director of marketing at Vast.com, the San Francisco, California-based aggregator of data (which provides used vehicle search data for AOL Autos), the various permutations are nearly endless. Because Vast.com has a variety of sources for its data, including Web "crawls" (an automated Internet search for used vehicle information), the data is, by definition, revealing in its own right. With that volume comes its share of fraud, notably in the marketing of vehicles damaged by flood.
