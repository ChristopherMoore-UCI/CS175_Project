"We need more energy, and maybe cleaner energy will supplant less clean energy over time--and it already is--but I don't think that shutting down dramatically one form of energy is a good idea for an economy," the first-term senator said on "Real Time." Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican who hails from Kentucky coal country, tried to find some "middle ground" with HBO host Bill Maher on climate change, saying Friday night that he supports deregulating alternative sources of energy. " Maher, a liberal leaning independent who shares some of Paul's libertarian views, sounded encouraged by Paul's talk on alternative energy but challenged the senator on his point about the discussion surrounding climate change. Also on the program, Paul reiterated his position in favor of criminal justice reform for nonviolent drug convictions and vowed: "I will do everything to end war on drugs. While saying he's not against some regulations, such as on carbon emissions and clean water, Paul said he plans on introducing legislation "in the next month or so" that would cut regulation of alternative fuels.
