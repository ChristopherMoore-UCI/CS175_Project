Italy gave indications Thursday that there may be growing support for former EU commissioner Mario Monti to take the helm in place of Berlusconi. Intended to cut spending and boost growth, they include pension reform, with plans to raise the retirement age from 65 to 67, the privatization of state-owned companies and sale of state-owned properties, the liberalization of certain professions and investment in infrastructure. In a post on Berlusconi's official Facebook page, he wrote that he had sent a telegram to Monti congratulating him on being appointed by the president to be a "senator for life, reflecting the outstanding achievements" in certain arenas. Italy has one of the highest national debts in Europe, about 120% of GDP or about  â‚¬1.9 trillion and has seen low growth in recent years. Berlusconi appeared to signal his support Thursday for Monti, who has a reputation as a hard-working, intellectually rigorous technocrat.
