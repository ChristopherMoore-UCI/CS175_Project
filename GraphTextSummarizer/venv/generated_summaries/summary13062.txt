Floyd Mayweather Jr will fight Juan Manuel Marquez at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Saturday. The Michigan-born fighter took part in reality television show Dancing With The Stars and also made several appearances on WWE but returns to the boxing ring for the first time since December 2007 with a non-title welterweight bout against Mexican Marquez. -- Floyd Mayweather Jr has exclusively told CNN that his WWE and dancing talents will be put away for the time being as he prepares for his comeback fight against Juan Manuel Marquez. I missed being in the sport of boxing - the sport is still in me and on Saturday night I am going to be the best I can be. "Marquez is a solid opponent who is tough and he is going to be at his best and the main thing is just to be me, be focused, be smart, be sharp and go out there and execute the game plan which is to relax and be Floyd Mayweather," he said.
