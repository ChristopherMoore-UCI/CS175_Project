-- Cuba marked the 58th anniversary of the start of Fidel Castro's revolution Tuesday, without a speech from his younger brother, current President Raul Castro. The National Day of Rebellion has traditionally been used by Fidel or Raul Castro to make major announcements or set policy. Last year, Raul Castro announced reforms to permit a bigger role for the private sector to soak up some of the 1 million state jobs that he said would need to be eliminated. Instead, Cuba's vice president took the podium to talk about economic challenges ahead but did not reveal any new details about reforms under way to allow more private enterprises and shrink the role of the state. "We are not applying patches or improvising, but looking for permanent solutions to old problems," 80-year-old Vice President Jose Ramon Machado Ventura told crowds in the eastern Cuban city of Ciego de Avila.
