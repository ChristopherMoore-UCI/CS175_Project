"We are thankful for the support from our Japanese friends and other agencies committed to ensuring the safe recovery of our airman," said Col. Al Wimmer, 35th Fighter Wing vice commander. Japanese Coast Guard, Japan Self Defense Forces, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Navy and civilian vessels were among those agencies that worked to retrieve the pilot, now aboard a U.S. commercial vessel. -- A pilot who ejected before a U.S. fighter jet crashed into the waters off northern Japan on Sunday was rescued and was in stable condition, military officials said. "The tireless efforts of everyone involved ensured a successful recovery," Wimmer added. The pilot was the sole person aboard an F-16 Fighting Falcon, which crashed about 200 miles northeast of Hokkaido Island.
