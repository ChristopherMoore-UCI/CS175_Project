But we comedians are advised by show promoters to avoid telling jokes mocking the political leaders and religions -- not just Islam, but also Christianity and Judaism. Being sentenced to hard labor is doubly painful since comedians go into comedy to avoid hard labor. I always knew an Arab Jon Stewart or Chris Rock would emerge and use comedy to skewer political leaders. However, Bruce's lawyer argued that the comedian was not being prosecuted for his profanity but rather for mocking political leaders and religion. In the Arab world, however, stand-up comedy and satirical political comedy shows like the one Bassem Youssef hosts are a very new development.
