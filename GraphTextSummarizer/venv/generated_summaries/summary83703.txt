Most people think global growth will average 3% per year for the foreseeable future, as opposed to 5% before the global economic crisis. Smarter school and university curricula and a higher focus on relevant skills -- helped by technology and the democratizing power of the Internet -- will allow young people to equip themselves for success in a competitive global marketplace, just as technology renders other jobs obsolete. Long-term thinking and genuine collaboration between all stakeholders would not only provide quality, sustainable growth and employment, it would once again re-balance national income towards labor, helping addressing the long term trend we are seeing towards income inequality. This explosive growth has put huge strains on our natural resources, but at the same time it has helped create conditions for an unprecedented period of global economic growth, which has seen billions lifted out of poverty. On paper, preventing people from working later in life looks like a sound way of freeing up jobs for those entering the jobs market.
