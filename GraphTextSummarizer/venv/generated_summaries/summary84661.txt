Jean Amoura, M.D., an associate professor of ob-gyn at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in Omaha, has studied access to emergency contraception in Nebraska pharmacies and says barriers to access are often logistical. In roughly 20% of the phone calls, pharmacy workers reported that emergency contraception was not available for any caller or patient, regardless of age. "It's unclear if the pharmacy workers who provided incorrect information to the study callers were simply unfamiliar with the law, but one of the unfortunate results of the age restriction is that it requires drugstores to keep emergency contraception behind pharmacy counters," Nucatola said in a prepared statement. Deborah Nucatola, M.D., senior director of medical services at Planned Parenthood, which provides reproductive health services -- including emergency contraception -- at more than 800 health centers around the country, says easing restrictions on emergency contraception may help address the uneven access seen in Wilkinson's study. In the study, two female research assistants at Boston University called every commercial pharmacy in five major cities and asked whether emergency contraception was available to them that day.
