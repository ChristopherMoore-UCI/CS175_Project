Brogan Rafferty, 17, of Stow, Ohio, a high school sophomore, was convicted in October on charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder in connection with the killings, CNN affiliate WJW reported. Richard Beasley was found guilty on 26 counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping, aggravated robbery and other charges. The investigation into the killings began the night of November 6, 2011, when a Noble County deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a "white, middle-aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm," according to Sheriff Stephen S. Hannum of Noble County. The wounded man -- Scott Davis from South Carolina -- told the law enforcement officer that he had answered an ad on the Craigslist website offering work caring for cattle on a 688-acre property in eastern Ohio before he was shot by Beasley. Jurors will return March 20 to determine if Beasley should receive the death penalty, CNN affiliate WKYC reported.
