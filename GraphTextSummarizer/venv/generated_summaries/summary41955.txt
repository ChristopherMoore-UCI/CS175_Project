Girls may choose not to speak up for many reasons, but it's hard to ignore the power of a culture that pushes them to choose boys over each other and punish other girls to protect their own reputations. Girls must understand not only their moral obligation but their power to be allies to each other at parties and other potentially unsafe spaces for girls. Last year, researchers found that girls of elementary school age were more likely than boys to commit acts of social aggression at school after viewing them on television. If boys knew that girls banded together to support each other, they would be less inclined to share on social media, much less commit, these horrific acts of sexual violence. The accusation of rape disrupts the intricate social ecosystem of a high school, one in which girls often believe that they must preserve both their own reputations and relationships with boys above all else.
