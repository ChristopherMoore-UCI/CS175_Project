" It was a good day for Czech tennis players, as Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka won the first doubles title of the WTA Tour season at the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand. Estonia's Kaia Kanepi claimed her first WTA Tour title by beating Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova 6-2 6-1 in the final of the Brisbane International on Saturday. The 21-year-old, who won the season-ending WTA Championships in October, also saw off the challenge of world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki on Friday and did not drop a set against American Bethanie Mattek-Sands or Bulgaria's Tsvetana Pironkova. Seventh-ranked Tomas Berdych gave the Czechs an unbeatable lead when he triumphed 7-6 (7-0) 6-4 against Richard Gasquet to also be undefeated in the men's singles and leave the French still seeking a first title. Petra Kvitova continued her perfect start to 2012 by helping the Czech Republic win the Hopman Cup teams event for the second time, beating France 2-0 in Saturday's final.
