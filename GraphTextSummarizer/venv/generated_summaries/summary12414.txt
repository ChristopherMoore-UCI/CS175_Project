Indeed, Gowan says he has records of seven other air marshals at the Orlando field office who have had their homes foreclosed or have suffered short sales of homes, some after voluntarily taking transfers to or from other TSA offices. Gowan and his attorney say they believe the TSA is firing Gowan not because of concerns about his finances, as stated in government documents, but because of lingering doubts or anger agency officials may have about accusations from a former girlfriend, who accused Gowan of breaking into her home and of domestic violence. As long as Gowan remains suspended without pay, the TSA will be able to show that his delinquent mortgage payments are increasing, he wrote in court documents. Zielinski and Gowan say they are particularly riled by the TSA's findings that Gowan had failed to take actions to mitigate his debts, had taken on new debts, and had increased his mortgage delinquencies. Subsequently, the TSA said the allegations were not a factor in the decision to revoke Gowan's security clearance.
