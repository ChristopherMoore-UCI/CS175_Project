Watch Trevor Noah's standup The son of a black South African woman and a white Swiss man who met when interracial relationships were illegal in South Africa, Noah jokes that he was "born a crime." " Last year, British comedy supremo Eddie Izzard took Noah to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe, the biggest arts festival in the world. "Comedy is really getting quite popular in South Africa," says Noah. "My ideal setting is I walk from the streets, backstage and straight onto the stage," says Noah, who last year became the first African comedian to perform on Jay Leno's The Tonight Show in the United States. At just 28 years old, Noah  is already a big name in his country's fledgling standup scene, as well as a cover star for Rolling Stone South Africa.
