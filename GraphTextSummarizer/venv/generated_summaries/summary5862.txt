New York City Councilman Dan Halloran said three sanitation workers and two Department of Transportation supervisors came to his office saying their bosses ordered the slowdown, telling workers that "the mayor will see how much he needs us" and "there will be plenty of overtime. "DOI is continuing its multi-borough investigation into whether there is any evidence of intentional acts of commission or omission related to the snow clean up and has been conducting its investigation since last week," the department said in a statement Tuesday. Authorities in Brooklyn also said they would review what happened with respect to snow removal last week. -- Officials in New York said Tuesday they are looking into what happened to cleanup efforts during last week's monster blizzard. Similarly, the head of New York's sanitation workers union, Harry Nespoli, has said he was not aware of any slowdown and doubted there was a protest by workers.
