It's also something that is no longer necessary with advancements in technology," says Dr. Daniel Antoine, the curator of physical anthropology at the British Museum in London. "We've found that a lot of the mummies had terrible dental health issues, specifically tooth decay and numerous abscesses caused by infections that spread to the blood stream," says Antoine. Despite being in a woman's sarcophagus, CT scans told researchers the body was male, that he died around 600 BC, and that he probably lived in terrible pain because of a plethora of dental abscesses. You can virtually remove the bandages to look at the body and any amulets covering the body, then remove the skin to look at the bones and any preserved organs," says Antoine. "We're even able to discern the inscriptions on some of the amulets," notes Antoine, including one of the Eye of Horus on a plate covering the incision used to remove her internal organs.
