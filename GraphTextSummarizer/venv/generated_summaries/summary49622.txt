Yet the ability to steal gossipy celebrity emails is clearly not the same as having the capacity to undertake physical attacks at thousands of movie theaters across the country. In the Sony case, most signs point to North Korean linked hackers; the government of North Korea had expressed deep anger over "The Interview," and there are similarities to other attacks traced back to North Korea in certain reported attack techniques. After all, there seems to be a new plot twist almost daily, the latest coming Wednesday with news that movie theaters across the country were canceling plans to screen "The Interview" after a group calling itself the Guardians of Peace warned that moviegoers would suffer a "bitter fate" if they went to see the film. Indeed, a survey by PWC of business executives found that only 39% of them weighed the impact of a cyberattack on their brand image and only 25% on lost secrets and other intellectual property. From North Korean hackers to embarrassing emails about our favorite stars, the recent hack of Sony Pictures seems to have all the makings of a Hollywood movie.
