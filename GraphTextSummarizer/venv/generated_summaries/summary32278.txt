A major fire devoured thousands stalls in a market in Guatemala's capital Tuesday, state media reported. The fire spread quickly, officials said, because many makeshift stalls in the market were built with wood and plastic. Authorities haven't determined what caused the fire, which broke out around 2:30 a.m. in La Terminal market in Guatemala City. "People often stay to sleep in their posts," Guatemala City Mayor Alvaro Arzu said. President Otto Perez Molina flew over the market Tuesday and vowed that government funds would be devoted to rebuilding, AGN said.
