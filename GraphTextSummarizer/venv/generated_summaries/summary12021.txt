McCluskey and Welch were arrested late Thursday at a campground on the edge of Apache and Sitgreaves National Forests in Springerville, Arizona, U.S. Marshal David Gonzales said Friday. "We were convinced that this would go down in a bloody shootout," Gonzales said of how law enforcement officials had anticipated the apprehension of the couple would take place. An Apache County judge read a lengthy list of felony charges to a quiet John McCluskey, 45, who was wearing an orange-and-white striped jail uniform and was flanked by sheriff's deputies. McCluskey, 45, was serving a 15-year sentence for attempted second-degree murder and other charges when he and fellow convicts Tracy Province and Daniel Renwick broke out of the prison July 30, allegedly with Welch's help. They have been linked to a supremacist group, Gonzales said.
