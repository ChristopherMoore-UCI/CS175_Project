-- Ian Murphy, the online news website editor who duped Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker into taking a prank call by posing as a billionaire conservative activist, told CNN Thursday that Walker is a "delusional" politician seeking to help wealthy GOP backers. Describing the legislation as a necessary precursor to the process of producing a budget that addresses Wisconsin's $3.6 billion deficit, Walker on Wednesday said that if isn't passed by week's end, or "we lose out on about $165 million in savings" that the bill generates for debt restructuring, it could result in further layoffs. " Walker raised the specter of layoffs "that would affect 1,500 individuals" if the Democratic senators do not return to Madison promptly. Murphy, editor of the news website "Buffalo Beast," posed as business tycoon David Koch while placing a call to Walker's office. And that is for those 14 state senators to come back to Wisconsin to debate this bill, to participate in democracy and to allow us to move forward, and to do ultimately the job they were elected to do," Walker said.
