-- The State Department has issued a travel alert warning U.S. citizens in South Africa to be aware of increased terrorism risks during the World Cup, which starts June 11. " The alert comes as Vice President Joe Biden gears up for a trip to Egypt, Kenya and South Africa during the week of June 7. Any credible threats will be conveyed to the public, the alert said, urging all U.S. citizens to register with the embassy in South Africa to enable them to get updated security information. "There is a heightened risk that extremist groups will conduct terrorist acts within South Africa in the near future. "While driving, keep doors locked and windows closed ... and when stopping at intersections at night or in isolated locations, leave enough space in front of your vehicle for a quick exit.
