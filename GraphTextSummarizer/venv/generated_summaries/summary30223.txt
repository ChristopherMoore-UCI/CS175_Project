I've also come to believe there are gray areas -- or to use Miley's performing partner, Robin Thicke's words, blurred lines -- in life. But I do care that Mr. Thicke (who I also think is an awesome artist) seems to have abdicated his responsibility (as a man -- not a celebrity) to model respectable behavior towards women. My kids were glued to Miley's Hannah Montana years Miley Cyrus upholds MTV VMAs tradition I've spent a lot of time around teens and young adults in my life. But I do believe there are other places in life where the lines are black and white.
