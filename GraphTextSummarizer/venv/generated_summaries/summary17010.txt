An opposing view on reopening the Gulf to deepwater drilling A Gulf of Mexico Regional Citizens' Advisory Council is essential to formalizing the public's role in overseeing what the industry does in our Gulf. Gulf Restoration Network believes further steps must be taken immediately to ensure the safety of oil drilling in deep off-shore waters. We strongly urge Congress to support the plan and ensure BP fines go toward restoring the Gulf. The White House's "America's Gulf Coast: A Plan for Long-Term Recovery in the Aftermath of the BP Oil Spill," assembled by Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, lays out a vision for community recovery, improving public health, coastal restoration and marine resiliency that can begin to restore the Gulf. Regulatory reforms and policy changes are urgently needed to prevent drilling disasters, ensure oil-rig safety in the Gulf and elsewhere and guarantee rapid response and cleanup when accidents happen.
