One of the biggest questions about "Fifty Shades of Grey" -- other than who would play the seductive Christian Grey -- was how the film would be rated. The film stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele, an inexperienced young woman who falls for the rich and mysterious Mr. Grey, played by Irish actor/model Jamie Dornan. "Fifty Shades of Grey" opens in theaters February 13. But for all the talk about sex, those involved in the project don't want moviegoers to forget that "Fifty Shades" is a love story at its heart. According to Variety, the MPAA has deemed "Fifty Shades" worthy of an R rating, thanks to "strong sexual content including dialogue, some unusual behavior and graphic nudity."
