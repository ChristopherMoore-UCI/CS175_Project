Myanmar has stripped away temporary voting rights given to the country's embattled Rohingya minority only a day earlier, following protests by Buddhist nationalists. About 1.3 million Rohingya, a Muslim minority, live in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, where they are regarded as foreign interlopers from neighboring Bangladesh, and face widespread prejudice. In December, the United Nations passed a resolution urging Myanmar to give access to citizenship for the Rohingya, many of whom are subject to extreme discrimination. On the urging of the international community, Myanmar has outlined a pathway for delivering citizenship to the Rohingya. The move prompted protesters, including many Buddhist monks, to take to the streets of Yangon Wednesday, demanding that the law be revoked.
