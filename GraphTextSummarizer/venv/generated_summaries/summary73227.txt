Kingston's Sabina Park had been due to host the fifth one-day match on June 3, as well as a warm-up game on June 6-7 and the opening Test from June 10. Cricket South Africa chief executive Gerald Majola backed the move by the West Indies board. -- West Indies cricket officials have moved two international matches from Jamaica due to the outbreak of violence on the Caribbean island. "CSA is monitoring the situation closely there with the West Indies Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the South African Government," he told the Cricket South Africa Web site. The second Test will be held in St Kitts from June 18 and the final match is in Barbados from June 26.
