Ganic, who was arrested at England's Heathrow Airport in March at Serbia's request, is wanted in Serbia for conspiracy to murder in breach of the Geneva Conventions, a spokesman at Britain's Foreign Office said. -- Former Bosnian leader Ejup Ganic will not be extradited to Serbia, a British court ruled Tuesday, setting him free. Though Bosnian, Ganic was born in Serbia and speaks with a recognizable Serbian accent. The extradition request was politically motivated, Justice Timothy Workman found in throwing it out. Many independent commentators at the time regarded Ganic as a relative moderate in the wartime Bosnian leadership.
