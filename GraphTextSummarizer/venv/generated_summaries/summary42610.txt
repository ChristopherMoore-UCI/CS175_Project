It includes top Shiite parties, but not Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Dawa party. For now, the alliance is mainly made of top Shiite parties with a few small secular, Sunni and other parties. The alliance includes the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, former Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Fadhila party and others. The prime minister's State of Law Coalition, which mainly includes members of his Dawa party, won control of most of the country's provincial councils in January's elections, turning back mainly Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq opposition. The announcement came after months of intense negotiations between the country's Shiite parties and recent reports of disagreements between al-Maliki's Dawa and other Shiite parties on who would lead the alliance.
