The amount of the prize ballooned to $590 million as the drawing approached, with Florida lottery officials selling about $45,000 worth of tickets an hour at the peak. Gloria Mackenzie, 84, came forward to claim the second-largest U.S. lottery jackpot, more than two weeks after the $590.5 million Powerball drawing on May 18, Florida Lottery officials announced Wednesday. She passed up a payout spread over 30 years for a somewhat smaller one-time lump sum, pocketing $370.9 million before taxes, Lottery Secretary Cynthia O'Connell said. We are grateful for this blessing of winning the Florida Lottery Powerball jackpot and appreciate the interest of the public, the state of Florida and the lottery. Why you keep playing the lottery Mackenzie was accompanied by her son, a "trusted family friend and her legal and financial advisers" when she came in to the lottery's Tallahassee headquarters to get her winning ticket validated, O'Connell said.
