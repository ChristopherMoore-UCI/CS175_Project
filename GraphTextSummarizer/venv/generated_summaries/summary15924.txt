A sheet of ice covered part of Madison Avenue NW in Washington because a water main broke on Friday, CNN affiliate WJLA reported, trapping about half a dozen cars. "I can't even move the car," A.J. Kumar told WJLA. A storm was heading toward the Rocky Mountains, too, creating a chance of snow from Montana down through Colorado and into northeastern New Mexico, CNN meteorologists said. The storm snarled roads, forcing the closure of I-95 southbound in Baltimore and leaving so many disabled vehicles that emergency vehicles couldn't get through, CNN affiliate WBFF reported. The National Weather predicted Monday high temperatures of 22 in Philadelphia, 17 in New York City, 10 in Chicago, 4 in Cleveland and 25 in Washington.
