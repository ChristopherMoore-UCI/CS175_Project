Lynch, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, was nominated by Obama last month to replace Holder, who has served as head of the Justice Department since the beginning of the Obama administration. The Senate Republican's most senior member is ready to support President Barack Obama's attorney general nominee, U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch. Orrin Hatch, a high-ranking member of the upper chamber's judiciary committee, spoke to reporters Tuesday on Capitol Hill about Lynch's credentials and Republican's desire to see Eric Holder, the current attorney general, leave office. He voted for both Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama's attorneys general, Janet Reno and Eric Holder. Holder is one of the more controversial members of the Obama cabinet.
