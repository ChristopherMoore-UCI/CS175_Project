We decided to come to Ringgold, Georgia, because it's a small community, and most likely they didn't have resources they would need to deal with this type of storm. Among the communities affected by the storms was Ringgold, a small town in northwest Georgia. Ringgold, population 2,800, had limited resources to deal with the emergency until 2008 CNN Hero Tad Agoglia and his First Response Team rolled into town. And so we decided to start helping families who lost loved ones in the storm. Ambulances and fire trucks need to get to home sites to perform search and rescue, so we help with that.
