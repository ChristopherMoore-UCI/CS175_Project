The United Methodist Church says it welcomes members regardless of sexual orientation, but same-sex marriages cannot be performed in Methodist churches or by ordained ministers under church policy. " Upon hearing of that decision, Schaefer told CNN in March, "It doesn't seem fair, two United Methodist minsters are charged with the same exact 'crime' of officiating at their son's same-sex weddings -- one is defrocked, the other one's case is dropped without conditions." Jimmy Creech, the first United Methodist minister to be defrocked over performing a same-sex marriage ceremony in 1999, acted as an adviser to Schaefer during the trial. "The decision is a win for Frank Schaefer, for the United Methodist Church, and for the movement toward justice and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender United Methodists," Creech said in a statement. Frank Schaefer, pastor at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in Lebanon, had his credentials restored and is now entitled to lost salary and benefits since his defrocking in December, according to a written decision released by the church. After his suspension Schaefer told the Board of Ordained Ministry that he could not uphold the church's Book of Discipline in its entirety because it discriminates against gay people.
