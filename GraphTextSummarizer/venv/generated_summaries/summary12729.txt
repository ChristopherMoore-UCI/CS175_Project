"Early estimates indicate that the total savings could be in the range of $1.5-$2 billion," Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement released Tuesday night. Budget cutting has been a main priority at the Defense Department for several years, even before Hagel took over. -- Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, the former enlisted man who earned his sergeant stripes as a grunt in the jungles of Vietnam, is cutting the budgets of the Pentagon's top brass by 20%. "Personnel reductions associated with these savings will be determined during the development of detailed execution plans," Little said. "These cuts will be implemented even if Congress lifts sequester-level budget caps," Little said.
