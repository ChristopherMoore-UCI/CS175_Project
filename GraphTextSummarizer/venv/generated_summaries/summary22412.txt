While Lionel Messi was battling Thomas Muller to be the tournament's top goal scorer, while Tim Howard and Guillermo Ochoa were batting away shots on goal, while Roy Hodgson and Fabio Capello were stalking the sidelines, CNN was looking at the bigger picture. Then we averaged the three measures -- ranking, manager salary and population size -- to come up with our own prediction for how each team would fare in the World Cup. Next we added in each country's population size, since bigger countries have larger pools to draw potential soccer stars from. Belgium did even better, coming sixth, nine places higher than our calculations suggested. Soccer-mad Mexico came dead last, paying manager Miguel Herrera about $214,000.
