Events like Bike Week and its little brother, Biketoberfest, are what keep Daytona Beach running, Kilian said. He said he goes to "keep updated on motorcycle stuff as far as styles, what's done to them, meet people who enjoy bikes, to get patches and all the toy stuff, so to speak, and enjoy other people who enjoy the same thing." Daytona Beach-based Roar Motorcycles specifically markets accessories and motorcycles for women. Bobby Mitchell, left, and Sheila Justin enjoy Bike Week in Daytona Beach, Florida. Bobby Mitchell, 52, also a radio producer in Orlando, grew up in Daytona Beach and has been going to Bike Week his entire life.
