Police said that after the protest was scheduled to end Tuesday at 2 p.m., a large group of protesters still congregated at Trafalgar Square. "As a result a group of around 150-200 people who still refused to leave were contained by police in Trafalgar Square. The protesters say they are angry at government plans to remove the current annual cap of 3,000 pounds (about $4,700) on university tuition and allow schools to charge as much as 9,000 pounds (about $14,200). -- Police say they arrested a total of 153 people when students protested against planned hikes in university tuition. Despite repeated requests to disperse, this group remained," London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement late Tuesday. Others were charged with violent disorder, common assault, obstructing police and criminal damage.
