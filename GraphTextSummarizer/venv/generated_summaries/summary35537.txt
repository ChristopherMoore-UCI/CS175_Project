"(This is) a youth-organized action to tell President Obama to reject the Keystone Pipeline," said Nick Stracco, who participated in XL Dissent, the name of the rally. Hundreds of students and youth organizers were arrested outside the White House Sunday as they protested against the Keystone XL pipeline under review by the Obama administration. Participants said they hoped that a strong statement from younger voters would further pressure President Barack Obama to reject the project. Environmental groups oppose the pipeline because extracting and refining the tar sands oil emits 17% more of the carbon pollution that contributes to climate change than conventional oil production. " Kerry, who is known for his effort to combat climate change, will determine if the pipeline project is in the national interest and make a recommendation to Obama.
