The Federal Aviation Administration investigates all violations of restricted airspace, and FAA spokesman Allen Kenitzer told CNN the agency is investigating the three cases over Los Angeles. Flight restriction orders are usually put in place surrounding stadiums during large sporting events, scenes of natural disasters and areas around the president's movements. Currently there are 49 TFRs over airspace in the U.S. according to the FAA's website, including one restriction that's been in place since 2008 over Mt. Kilauea in Hawaii, an active volcano. The FAA keeps an up-to-date list of restricted airspace on its website, something pilots are supposed to check prior to departure. The penalties for violating restricted airspace can be severe according to the FAA.
