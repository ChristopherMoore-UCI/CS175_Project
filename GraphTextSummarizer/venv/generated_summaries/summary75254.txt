-- Three suspects arrested in Thailand on alleged terror ties have confessed to making counterfeit passports and other documents, the Thai news agency reported Thursday. According to police, the cell was dedicated to stealing travel documents, mostly passports, and sending them to Thailand, where they would be falsified and turned over to groups with links to al Qaeda, such as Lashkar-e-Taiba, a militant group based in Pakistan. Since the March 11, 2004, commuter train bombings in Madrid that killed 190 and wounded 1,800, Spanish police and international police forces have kept a close eye on suspected Islamic radicals living in or transiting through the country. They allegedly provided stolen travel documents to terrorist groups, the national police said. Their partners in Spain stole tourist passports and shipped them to Thailand, where they were forged, according to the news agency.
