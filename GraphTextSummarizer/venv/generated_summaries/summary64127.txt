-- Twice defending champion Venus Williams moved closer to a Wimbledon title hat-trick on Monday when fourth-round rival Ana Ivanovic left in tears after quitting their Court One match through injury. Ivanovic concedes to holder Venus in tearful fashion after suffering injury anguish at Wimbledon Serbia's former world number one lost the first set 6-1 against third-seeded American rival Williams and was serving in the first game of the second when she was forced to stop because of a thigh problem. World number one Dinara Safina, who has yet to win a Grand Slam title, faced 2006 champion Amelie Mauresmo on Centre Court -- and Wimbledon's new roof was shut for the first time during their match when rain fell midway through the second set. Williams turned up the heat in the first set when her family belatedly took their seats having been on Court One watching Venus. Sister Serena, the second seed and a two-time Wimbledon champion, joined Venus in the last eight with a 6-3 6-1 victory over Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova.
