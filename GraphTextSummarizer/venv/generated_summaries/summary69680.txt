Conrad Hilton, the younger brother of celebrity heiress Paris Hilton, has reached a plea deal: He would admit guilt to misdemeanor assault against flight attendants in exchange for a federal felony charge being dropped, court papers says. The flight's pilot, who was second-in-command to the captain, "noticed the smoke detector above the bathroom ceiling had been stuffed with paper towels, apparently to prevent the smoke alarm from sounding," court papers said. Hilton signed court papers last week that state he "repeatedly entered the bathroom to smoke marijuana and tobacco" during Flight 269 from London to Los Angeles, court papers said. Read the plea deal "He also become belligerent toward some of the flight attendants," according to court papers signed by Hilton and his attorney. Read the initial federal complaint (Warning: profane language) When Hilton became enraged because a flight attendant was following him, he shouted several times that "I am going to f------ kill you!" and used other vulgarities, court papers said.
