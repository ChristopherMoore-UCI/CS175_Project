"This project exemplifies the promise that a future generation of robots can have both in space and on Earth, not as replacements for humans but as companions that can carry out key supporting roles," said a statement from John Olson, director of NASA's Exploration Systems Integration Office. For more than three years, a team of General Motors engineers and NASA scientists worked side by side at the Houston's Johnson Space center -- designing, engineering and building the 300-pound, human-like machine. "We spent a lot of effort working on the technologies that will allow us to have robots work right next to human operators very safely," Linn said. "We've used robots for years and years," said Marty Linn, GM's principal robotics engineer. "That's really what it was designed to do, to help astronauts in performing their regular tasks," Linn said.
