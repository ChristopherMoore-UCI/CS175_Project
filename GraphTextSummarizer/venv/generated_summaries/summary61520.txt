The suspension comes after a court determined Busch committed an act of domestic violence against his former girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, NASCAR officials told CNN. NASCAR will expedite any appeal, NASCAR Executive Vice President Steve O'Donnell told reporters. Kurt Busch, the 2004 NASCAR top series champion, has been suspended indefinitely from NASCAR events, the auto racing circuit said Friday. "Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately," NASCAR said in a news release. "We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold," Hardin said.
