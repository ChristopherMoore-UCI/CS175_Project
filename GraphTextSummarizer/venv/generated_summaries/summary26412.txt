Well before the first media accounts of the attack on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, Abdulkader Hariri, a Twitter user in the town, tweeted this: "Breaking: Huge explosions shook the city in what might be the beginning of US airstrikes on ISIS HQs in Raqqa" Hariri is believed to be the first person to report on the first strikes the United States carried out against ISIS inside Syria. If any doubts lingered over Twitter's capacity to break news first, the overnight raids launched by U.S. forces on Syria on Tuesday night offered another case study of what the microblogging site does best. " In this respect, Hariri's tweet recalls the U.S. raid on Abbottabad in Pakistan in May 2011 in which Osama bin Laden was killed -- and one Twitter user unknowingly reported details. "US military & partner nation forces have begun striking ISIL targets in Syria using mix of fighters, bombers and Tomahawk missiles. Some of the first public accounts of the military operation that killed the terrorist leader came in the form of tweets from Sohaib Athar, a 33-year-old IT consultant.
