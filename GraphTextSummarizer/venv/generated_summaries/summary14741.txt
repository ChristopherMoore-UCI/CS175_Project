The 33-year-old Long Island resident had appeared on a list of pharmacy clients who received various drugs from the Haven Drugs store, Dormer said. "The officers had to use force" because Laffer became "extremely violent" during the arrest, Dormer told reporters. Police said David Laffer has been accused of fatally shooting two employees at Haven Drugs in Medford as well as two customers before leaving with a large quantity of prescription drugs Sunday morning. Laffer has been charged with first-degree murder and resisting arrest. Both Laffer and Brady appeared "strung out" and "under the influence" at the time of their arrests, Dormer said.
