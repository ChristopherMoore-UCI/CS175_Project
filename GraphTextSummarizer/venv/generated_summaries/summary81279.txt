The documentary, due out next year, examines the theory that Monroe was killed by government agents because of her affair with President John F. Kennedy. Monroe changed her name from Norma Jeane Baker to Marilyn Monroe early in her acting and modeling career. An FBI agent involved in the investigation of Monroe's death on August 5, 1962  -- which was ruled a suicide by drug overdose -- tipped off collector Keya Morgan to the film's existence. A short clip of the four-minute, silent 16 mm film provided to CNN to shows Monroe puffing on a cigarette, laughing and drinking wine on a couch. The copyright to a home movie of Marilyn Monroe "just sitting around" with friends will be offered through an online auction this week, according to a man who found the film while researching the actress' death.
