"The strongest growth is coming from China and the rise of Chinese buyers has made up for declines in sales from buyers from the UK and Mexico." Sales to international Chinese buyers still represent only a tiny fraction of the overall US market, which recorded $928.2bn in sales in the year to March. Ms Liebman says she saw "hundreds of millions" of dollars in sales last year to Chinese buyers and the pace has intensified since the start of 2012. "The past quarter has been our best quarter ever in terms of sales to Chinese buyers. The 23 per cent jump in sales value, despite flat sales volume, suggests that Chinese buyers have been active at the top end. According to a report published by the National Association of Realtors this week, buyers from China and Hong Kong made up the second-largest group of foreign buyers of homes in the US in the 12 months to March -- Canadians took first place -- accounting for $9bn of sales.
