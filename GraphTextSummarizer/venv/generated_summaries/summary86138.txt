Although Tamara is breastfeeding after re-lactating (with the help of supplements and a breast pump starting months before the birth), Logan is also pumping for baby Josie because Tamara doesn't have a full supply of milk. It was at that point, in 2005, that Tamara and her daughter met another mom, Logan, at their local public library during story time. Although the families had planned for a different scenario (Logan and Tamara took a doula class together so that Tamara could serve as Logan's doula), Nathan ended up serving as Logan's primary support during the long labor. Although Tamara knew it was a genuine offer, she didn't know that she would ultimately take Logan up on it. Tamara eventually approached Logan to ask if she was still serious about her offer.
