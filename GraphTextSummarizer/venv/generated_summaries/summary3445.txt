If the network implements the "concept" proposal and broadens the geographic boundaries for sharing donor livers, it would "represent the most drastic change in liver allocation ever," the authors wrote, and "would significantly disadvantage many areas of the country currently able to serve their patient populations." And the number of people needing liver transplants is expected to rise. Their letter argues that the changes could reduce the "number of liver transplants performed in Georgia by 25%" and "inevitably drive up costs, decrease survival rates, and waste precious resources in an already constrained sector of healthcare." With the nation's obesity epidemic, fatty liver disease has become a growing problem with more patients needing transplants. Each organ has a different system for handling its waiting list, and the network has seen a particular problem with donated livers.
