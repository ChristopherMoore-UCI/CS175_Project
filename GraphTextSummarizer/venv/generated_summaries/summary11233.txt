"The press hasn't reported that I was a client of people who I trusted [who] had knowledge and expertise in the areas of tax law that would protect my interests." Snipes is best known for his roles in the "Blade" action films, the comedy film "White Men Can't Jump" and the drama "Jungle Fever." Snipes' attorney said he is appealing Snipes' misdemeanor convictions for not filing tax returns in 1999, 2000 and 2001. "This is another thing that has been misreported: It has been framed that I was a conspirator and that I was an architect in a scheme by an organization that has been characterized as tax protesters," Snipes said. Last February, a jury convicted Snipes on the misdemeanor charges, but he was acquitted of more serious felony charges of tax fraud and conspiracy. -- Actor Wesley Snipes said he was nervous about going to jail on Thursday, but was hopeful that his prayers would be answered.
