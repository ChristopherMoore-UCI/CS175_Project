It was Donohoo's freshman year of high school when Nancy and Bill Donohoo learned what was wrong with their son. But when friends started to notice Donohoo was different, Nancy Donohoo was quick to explain to a group of 10-year-olds why. Then, just teaching Donohoo to talk was a challenge in itself, Nancy Donohoo said. "There was a doctor in Huntsville that dealt a lot with hyperactive children," Nancy Donohoo said. At 6, Nancy Donohoo drives her son to Memorial Hospital, where he's entering his 16th year of service with the cafeteria.
