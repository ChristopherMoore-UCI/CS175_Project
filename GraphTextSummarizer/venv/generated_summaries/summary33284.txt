After Japan surrendered, the Vandenberg was the first Navy ship to return to New York Harbor. About 300 boats positioned themselves as close as possible to the site, and cheers went up when the Vandenberg slipped beneath the water seven miles south of Key West, the spokesman said.

The Vandenberg was towed to Key West last month.
