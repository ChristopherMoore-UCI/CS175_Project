Prosecutors argued that Judge Thokozile Masipa misinterpreted a complex South African standard defining a technical form of intent that proved to be a central aspect of the case, according to CNN legal analyst Kelly Phelps. But critics of the verdict have argued that Masipa didn't correctly apply the intent standard, which is broader in South African law than what it typically means in casual conversation, Phelps said. Pistorius was found guilty of culpable homicide, or negligent killing, in the death of Reeva Steenkamp. A judge in Pretoria ruled Wednesday that South African prosecutors can appeal Oscar Pistorius' conviction, but denied the state's bid to challenge his sentence. The decision means that the decision over Pistorius' fate isn't over, with the legal battle possibly extending well into next year.
