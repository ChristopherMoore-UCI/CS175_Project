Nishiyama said Friday that authorities hope to start injecting fresh water (rather than the current seawater) into the reactor's core and spent nuclear fuel pool. 2 Like with No. 1, there has been evidence of high radiation levels in spots in and around the No. 2 reactor -- though not as high as that of the No. 3 unit. As with unit No. 6, three holes were punched in the building earlier in order to relieve pressure and prevent a hydrogen explosion. As with unit No. 5, three holes were punched in the building earlier in order to relieve pressure and prevent a hydrogen explosion. The water is being pumped in to help cool down nuclear fuel rods and prevent the further emission of radioactive material.
