Spanish media, citing police sources, said the suspects are linked to ETA's killing two years ago of a police intelligence officer in the Basque region, but Rubalcaba only would confirm that investigators were analyzing possible links to a series of unsolved ETA attacks. Rubalcaba said the arrests Tuesday have "enormous importance" because the four are suspected of operating clandestinely for ETA, under the cover of living and working "as normal citizens, integrated into Basque society, which makes it very difficult for police to find them. -- Police arrested four suspected members of the Basque separatist group ETA early Tuesday, seizing 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of explosives, Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union. The pre-dawn raids took place in Bilbao, the largest Basque city in northern Spain, and the nearby town of Galdakao, where police also found bomb-making components, Rubalcaba said in a nationally televised news conference.
