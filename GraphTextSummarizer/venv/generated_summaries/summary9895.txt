It doesn't give much away, but the inference is that phone manufacturers have been focusing on increasing the number of megapixels in camera phones, rather than picture quality. Starting February 25, more than 65,000 people are expected to descend on Barcelona, Spain for Mobile World Congress (MWC): a trade show for the mobile industry to show off its latest phones, tablets, apps and services. One product area I'm hoping will see some development at MWC is tablets. Nokia generated the biggest buzz at last year's MWC with its PureView camera phone, a model with an unbelievably high 42-megapixel camera sensor. HTC also really needs a hit right now, and it's taking no chances by holding its MWC press conference a week before the show actually starts to make sure someone else's shiny gadget doesn't blast it off the news agenda.
