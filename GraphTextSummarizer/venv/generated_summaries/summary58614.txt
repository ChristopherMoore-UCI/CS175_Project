But knowing it would be impossible to keep Catherine's visit to hospital a secret, Buckingham Palace took the unusual step of pre-empting press speculation and revealing the news immediately. Usually proclamations of royal births are posted on the gates at Buckingham Palace only after the 12th week of pregnancy. It is believed a new spirit of openness has been embraced by William and Catherine in an attempt to prevent the massive press interest and speculation that surrounded Princess Diana. Royal advisors are being surprisingly open about Catherine's condition, despite recent intrusions into her private life, including the publication of topless photos, which were condemned by Buckingham Palace. Buckingham Palace were forced to make the announcement only after Catherine was taken to hospital suffering from acute morning sickness.
