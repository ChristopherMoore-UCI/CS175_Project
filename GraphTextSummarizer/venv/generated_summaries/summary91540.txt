Beijing residents say pollution is worsening despite authorities' assertions that air quality has improved since the city hosted the 2008 Olympic Games. The weekend's pollution levels have prompted an "orange fog" warning in Beijing because of diminished visibility, according to state-run Xinhua news agency. "With their difficult meteorological conditions and a large number of pollution sources, addressing pollution is a long-term and difficult task," Deborah Seligsohn, adviser of the World Resources Institute, said last year. Last year, heavy haze and smog forced the cancellation of almost 700 flights at Beijing airports. Beijing will remain covered in gray until Wednesday, when the wind will sweep in to the rescue and blow the smog away, according to state media.
