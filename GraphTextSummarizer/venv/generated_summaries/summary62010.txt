On January 20, at least 211 people were killed in Kano in attacks that left the police headquarters and other government buildings in charred ruins. Harsh police tactics led to an armed uprising and the arrest of Yusuf, who later died in police custody. In 2009, Nigerian police forces moved to crack down on Boko Haram. No one immediately claimed responsibility, but suspicion fell on the militant group Boko Haram, which has carried out multiple bombings and shootings across the north in recent days. A police station in Mandawari was attacked at 6 a.m., just after the dusk-to-dawn curfew was lifted, police said.
