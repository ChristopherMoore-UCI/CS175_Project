During the February sweeps, The Tonight Show beat Jimmy Kimmel Live and The Late Show with David Letterman among adults 18-49 (1.003 million versus Letterman's 920,000 and Kimmel's 898,000) and attracted a bigger audience (3.5 million viewers versus Letterman's 3.2 million and Kimmel's 2.5 million). Last August, Stern claimed that reports about Leno taking a pay cut to limit staff reductions was not the entire truth. On his radio show this morning on Sirius XM, Stern casually mentioned how he's going to "take over The Tonight Show" when addressing the public drubbing that Matt Lauer has received over Ann Curry's departure last summer. 'Enlightened' canceled by HBO Stern likes to talk trash about Leno. Stern also said he's been "feuding" with Leno for years.
