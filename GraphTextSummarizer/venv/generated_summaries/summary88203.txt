Christian music has come a long way in the 40 years since Norman pioneered Christian rock. Norman, a hippie musician who set out to sing about his faith, blazed the trail for Christian rock. " "Between 1969 and 1979, Larry Norman was the Christian rock scene's answer to Bob Dylan, John Lennon and Mick Jagger," said Emmy-nominated director David Di Sabatino, who takes a critical look at Norman's career and life in his documentary "Fallen Angel: The Outlaw Larry Norman. The vision he created for where Christian rock music could go still resonates today." Norman sang about drugs, politics, racism, sex, venereal disease and Jesus -- sometimes in the same song -- getting his music banned from Christian bookstores that might have sold it.
