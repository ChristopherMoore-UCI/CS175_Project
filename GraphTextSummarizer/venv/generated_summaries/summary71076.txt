Swelbar said it had a direct impact on the growth of air travel to smaller cities like Green Bay, Wisconsin. GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney trusted a DC-9 to ferry his running mate, Paul Ryan, from stump speech to stump speech.

Bottom line: The DC-9 helped Americans who live in smaller towns embrace air travel.
