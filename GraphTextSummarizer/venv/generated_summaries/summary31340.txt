A post attributed to the Alaei family said that Arash was released after spending 1,160 days in prison. -- Arash Alaei, a pioneering HIV and AIDS doctor, has been released from an Iranian prison, his family said Sunday. "My dearest friends, colleagues and family thank you so much for your tireless help and support. Since opening a hometown clinic in 1999, the men raised awareness about HIV, dispelling myths about the virus and treating people who are shunned because of it. I am very happy that other prisoners got released, too and now their parents, family members and friends got reunion after a while.
