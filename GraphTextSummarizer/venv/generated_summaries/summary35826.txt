In city halls, e-bikers are lobbying to gain access to bike lanes, bike paths and bike parks -- where motorized vehicles including e-bikes are often banned. "People with electric bicycles are often shunned whenever they go to bike stores for parts or for repairs." Experts who design community bike plans for roadway bike traffic and off-road bike paths generally don't factor in e-bikes, says Jennifer Toole of Toole Design Group. "If electric bikes become really popular, cities will start dealing with them." If that happens, she says, the result will likely be more bike lanes and a re-evaluation of whether bikes should be allowed on sidewalks. Lemire-Elmore believes the culture at traditional bike stores can be closed-minded -- which has contributed to a widespread attitude against e-bikes.
