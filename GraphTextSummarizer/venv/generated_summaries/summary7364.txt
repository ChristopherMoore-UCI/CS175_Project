That's about 2,000 more babies born using treatments from IVF clinics than in 2011. Of those births, IVF treatments account for about 1.5% of all babies born in the United States that year. The number of multiple embryos being transferred in IVF treatments has also declined, according to the report. That also makes 2012 the year with the highest percentage of babies born through IVF than ever reported previously, according to the society. Only 3.9% of 42-year-olds got pregnant as a result of IVF treatment.
