The economic Mood Map is a regular part of CNN's Davos coverage and gives you the chance to share sentiment about the economic climate in your county. The results only indicate the sentiments felt by CNN.com users and may not reflect public opinion. The four questions you answer have multiple choice answers, representing sentiments from positive to negative. The data mostly come from the OECD, the United Nations and National Statistics Offices. So if 50% of respondents were very positive and 50% very negative, the country in question would be colored from the center of the scale.
