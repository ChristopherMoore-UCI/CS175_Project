John, 66, was diagnosed with "appendix abscess surrounding retrocaecal appendicitis" after falling ill during the tour, publicist Gary Farrow said in a written statement. -- Sir Elton John faces surgery soon for appendicitis that has derailed his European tour, a spokesman for the singer said Tuesday. "To know that he made such super-human efforts and continued to perform to thousands through his illness only confirms his dedication to his European fans. The concert will still happen with Ray Davies, Elvis Costello, Gabrielle Aplin and Nick Lowe performing. The surgery will be performed in the United Kingdom in "the coming weeks" after he undergoes an intensive course of antibiotics and "doctors can be confident they have sufficiently reduced toxins within the inflamed appendicitis site," Farrow said.
