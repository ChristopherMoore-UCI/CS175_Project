Firefighters named the newborn Noel, in honor of the Christmas holiday, said Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Erik Scott. The infant was taken to an area hospital, Scott said, and would be placed in protective custody. In California, a parent or legal guardian can surrender a newborn at fire stations and hospital emergency rooms with no fear of arrest. -- A 27-year-old mother surrendered her baby girl to firefighters in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve "There was a sense of relief." Both the baby and mother were given identification bracelets.
