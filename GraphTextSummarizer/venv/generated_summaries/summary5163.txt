"Anybody that has any information we'd love for them to come forward," daughter-in-law Lauren Sponseller told HLN's Ryan Smith. -- The family of South Carolina lobbyist Tom Sponseller asked for the public's help Tuesday in locating the missing man. Police have not yet ruled out the possibility of foul play, said Columbia police spokeswoman Jennifer Timmons. His family made various attempts to reach Sponseller on his cell phone Saturday, but was not successful. He was last reported seen in his Columbia office around noon on Saturday.
