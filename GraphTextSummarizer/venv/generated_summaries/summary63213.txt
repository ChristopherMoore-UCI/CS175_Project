If you start naming them, it's really hard if the worst were to happen," said Dr. Lisa Argilla, manager of veterinary science at Wellington Zoo. The penguin -- whose gender is unknown pending DNA test results due this week -- stunned passers-by when it showed up at a beach north of Wellington last week. -- A young emperor penguin discovered thousands of kilometers away from its home might survive ingesting a bellyful of sand, New Zealand zoo officials said. "This is only the second time an emperor penguin has been seen in New Zealand," said Kate Baker, spokeswoman for the Wellington Zoo, where the bird was taken for treatment. "I think people have a real soft spot for penguins," Argilla said.
