Russia controls the current network of pipelines that supply Europe with natural gas. Officials from six countries gathered Monday in Turkey and signed a deal to build a U.S.-backed pipeline, aimed at breaking Russia's near-monopoly on natural gas supplies to Europe. To challenge the Nabucco proposal, Russia has proposed a competing natural gas pipeline to southeastern Europe. The proposed pipeline could end Russia's near monopoly on gas supplies to Europe. However, Nabucco got a boost after Russia turned off the gas to Europe in January, during the latest in a series of price disputes with Ukraine, according to industry analysts.
