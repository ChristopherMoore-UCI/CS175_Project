Radioactive material was found during an "extensive" inspection last month, although testing suggested radiation levels were too low for his neighbors to be worried, Moberj said. Sweden's nuclear watchdog said Thursday. The man, named in local media reports as 31-year-old Richard Handl, contacted the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority in July to ask whether he was allowed to build a nuclear reactor, the organization's research director Leif Moberj told CNN. Handl was quoted by the Helsingborgs Dagblad newspaper as saying he had his own Geiger counter and had not noticed any problems with radiation. "We realized he probably had radioactive material at his home which you are not allowed to have without a permit, which was why the authorities decided to inspect his home," Moberj said.
