As Bieber took the stage with model Lara Stone to introduce singer Rita Ora, there were some noticeable jeers mixed in with cheers. The 20-year-old singer stripped down to his skivvies at 2014's "Fashion Rocks" event on Tuesday night in Brooklyn, where he was greeted with a negative reaction from some in the New York audience. The singer seemed unfazed by those who weren't pleased with his appearance at the show, turning to Stone and telling her that he doesn't "feel comfortable unless I'm in my Calvins. " "Calvins" as in his Calvin Klein underwear, which he proudly showed off to the increasingly enthusiastic crowd. If nothing else, it seems Stone approved.
