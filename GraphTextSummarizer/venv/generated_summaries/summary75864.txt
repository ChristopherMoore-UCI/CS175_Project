Also, while some folks have reported that using a bumper case prevents contact with the antenna band and preserves reception quality, AppleCare reps are being told to not give bumper cases to disgruntled users. According to documents leaked to Boy Genius Report, AppleCare representatives are being given a strong company line to deliver to unhappy iPhone 4 owners who complain about reception issues. Our testing shows that iPhone 4's overall antenna performance is better than iPhone 3GS. iPhone owners in our newsroom have seen reception decrease from five to two bars simply from holding the phone with two points of contact between the owner's hand and the antenna band. One law firm is even preparing for a class-action lawsuit against Apple and is soliciting iPhone 4 customers to contact them about reception issues.
