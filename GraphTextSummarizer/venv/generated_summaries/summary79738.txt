Nearly a year after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster, the exclusion zone remains off-limits due to high levels of radioactive contamination. It's hard to imagine that many people once lived here, as we drive into the center of town. Tomioka, in the southern end of the exclusion zone, has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant. These communities are complete ghost towns, frozen in time. I'm carrying two radiation meters with me, one to measure surface radiation and one to track how much my body accumulates.
