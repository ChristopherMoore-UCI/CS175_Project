The most recent spike "probably" occurred "because the containment vessel in reactor No. 3 has been damaged," a spokesman for Japan's nuclear safety agency later told reporters. In addition, Edano said, cooling systems at two other reactors, No. 5 and No. 6, were "not functioning well. Hydrogen explosions had previously occurred in the plant's No. 1 and No. 3 reactors. Crews restored backup power, but problems keeping the reactors cool forced plant officials to take the drastic step of flooding them with seawater. Authorities later allowed them to return after radiation levels dropped, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said.
