The Arab League has called on President Bashar al-Assad's regime to stop violence against civilians, free political detainees, remove tanks and weapons from cities and allow outsiders, including the international news media, to travel freely around Syria. Abdelkader Chaar, 22, is thought to have been arrested in Aleppo, Syria, on January 8. Chaar was born in Syracuse, New York, moved to Aleppo with his parents when he was a boy and is currently a medical student at Aleppo University, his uncle said. Protesters on Friday focused their attention on political prisoners and demanded the release of detainees. The U.S. government confirmed Friday the arrest of a U.S. citizen in Syria, a State Department official said.
