In the new novel, Claire has moved on from New Orleans, the scene of her last case in "Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead." Gran says she's borrowed from several different schools of psychology and religion, things she finds personally interesting, to come up with Claire's world view. The self-described "world's greatest private eye" returns in her second adventure from author Sara Gran in "Claire DeWitt and the Bohemian Highway" hitting bookstores this week. Claire is a new age heroine who uses dreams, visions and intuition to uncover clues and close cases. Neither Gran nor Claire takes themselves too seriously, just take a look at the names of some of Claire's past cases, including, 'The Case of the Kleptomaniacal Occultist" or "The Case of the Missing Miniature Horses."
