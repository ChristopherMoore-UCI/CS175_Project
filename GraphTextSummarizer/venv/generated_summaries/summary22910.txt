The near-sellout concert comes nearly six months after Lady Gaga was forced to cancel her sold-out show in Jakarta amid an uproar by Islamic hardliners against her costumes and dance moves. The adjustments are in keeping with informal rules that make the concert "suitable for Indonesia" and will satisfy the local government, Muslim Indonesians and clerics, Ibrahim said, adding that he spoke with many parties. "She'll have to cover up a little bit," said Chairi Ibrahim, project manager for Dyandra Promosindo, one of the promoters for the Jakarta show of the "Dance Again World Tour" on Friday. Ibrahim said that Lopez's case was different because "people know her from 'American Idol,'" where she'd been a judge, and saw her as a "normal girl," while Indonesian clerics deemed Gaga's lyrics as "not very good to youngsters. She and all the dancers must wear clothes that don't show men's chests or women's cleavage, and sexual dance moves will have to resemble laughs as opposed to "making love," he added.
