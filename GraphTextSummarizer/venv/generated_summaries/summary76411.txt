But it's something that became extremely important after losing one of my best friends, Scott Pollock, in December 2005, and realizing that life was way too short to just be thrown away on junk food and little activity; that wasn't living. I have worked with several different coaches and have had the opportunity to travel the country showing people how an adaptive athlete with CP gets it done. When Scott passed, I made a promise to him and myself that I would do everything in my power to keep his dreams of making a difference for people with different abilities in the world of fitness alive. If this last year has taught me anything, it's to embrace every challenge that comes your way because you never know when that challenge is going to turn into great opportunity. That first day I spent close to an hour with Scott Lefferts, owner of CrossFit Hard Core Boca Raton.
