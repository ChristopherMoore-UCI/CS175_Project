Jewell and another man fought Friday night in the parking lot of the Atlanta strip club Body Tap, police spokesman Officer James Polite said. Jewell was taken to a hospital, where he died of blunt force trauma to the head, Polite said. Polite said police don't know why the fight started. -- Kandi Burruss, the newest cast member of the reality show "The Real Housewives of Atlanta," was mourning the death Saturday of her fianc√©, who died after a fistfight the night before. In late August, Burruss told WVEE Radio in Atlanta, "We're on hiatus," and she told Essence.com last month that the two were taking a break from each other.
