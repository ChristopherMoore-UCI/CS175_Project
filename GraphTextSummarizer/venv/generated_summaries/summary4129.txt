An unexpected heat wave bathes Paris in summer light, so I take in the stunning views of the city from Sacre Coeur Basilica and go explore hilly, bohemian Montmartre. This visit is for savoring Paris: walking to wherever fancy strikes, sitting in any park or caf√© that looks inviting and eating as many baguettes, pastries and other delectable things as my budget (and figure) will allow. You might easily miss the modest pedestrian bridge with the shiny accessories in the tourist rush to find historic Pont Neuf or the ornate Pont Alexandre III, but I am taking it slow on my second visit to Paris. My favorite: a raspberry pistachio gateau, with the tart ruby fruit nestled in sweet clouds of pale green cream in between layers of flaky puff pastry. -- When you're in love in Paris, you show it with a lock.
