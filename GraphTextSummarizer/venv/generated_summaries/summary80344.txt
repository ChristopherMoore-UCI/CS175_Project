The FDA announced a proposed rule in December that would require manufacturers of antibacterial hand soap and body wash to prove their products are more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of infection. "Millions of Americans use antibacterial hand soap and body wash products," the agency said in a statement. There is some evidence that long-term exposure to some ingredients in antibacterial products, including triclosan, "could pose health risks, such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects," according to the FDA. -- Minnesota is clamping down on triclosan, an ingredient used in some toothpastes, cosmetics, antibacterial soaps and body washes. The exceptions to this rule are individual products that have received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for consumer use.
