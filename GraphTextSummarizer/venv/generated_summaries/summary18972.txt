Fox allowed Lohan to live in her West Hollywood, California, home as long as she followed a new set of rules, including regular drug testing. -- A judge on Friday ordered actress Lindsay Lohan to remain in a drug rehabilitation program until January 3 for a probation violation. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills, California. The Beverly Hills courthouse has been the scene of several Lohan appearances over the past year related to violations of her probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Elden Fox sent Lohan to jail four weeks ago, but another judge overturned the decision to deny the actress bail later that day.
