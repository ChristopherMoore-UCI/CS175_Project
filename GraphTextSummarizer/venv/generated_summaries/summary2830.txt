"We've had enough of these mega cruise ships just meters away from San Marco, from now on there will be clear limits on the size of ships that can enter Venice." And from January traffic will be cut by 20% -- from 2012 levels -- on ships weighing more than 40,000 tonnes which enter the Giudecca canal linking the main part of Venice to the island of Giudecca. The city has imposed new restrictions on cruise liners entering the city -- with those weighing over 96,000 tonnes banned from sailing down the world famous Giudecca canal from November 2014. The grand architecture allied to the ornate palaces and grand statues which adorn Venice's enchanted waterways leave tourists awestruck. "Finally the trend towards gigantic ships in the lagoon has been turned around," the mayor of Venice, Giorgio Orsoni, said in a statement to the media.
