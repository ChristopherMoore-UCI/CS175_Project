-- Oil companies evacuated workers from offshore wells, New Orleans prepared for possible flooding and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency as a tropical depression formed Thursday in the Gulf of Mexico. New Orleans -- much of which sits below sea level -- is likely to see 8 to 10 inches of rain in the next few days, Mayor Mitch Landrieu told reporters. The National Hurricance Center issued a tropical storm warning Thursday evening for an area stretching from Pascagoula, Mississippi, to Sabine Pass, Texas. It was six years ago this week that Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast, devastating coastal Louisiana and Mississippi and inundating much of New Orleans. The hurricane center said tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area.
