She knows where that word came from." Join the discussion about disparaging words The embattled Schlessinger, 63, announced Tuesday she will not renew her contract that is up at the end of the year, telling CNN's "Larry King Live" she wants to "regain my First Amendment rights." Schlessinger apologized for her remarks but Hanson said that was not good enough. Hanson has been married three years and called Schlessinger for advice after she kept hearing her husband's friends make comments about black people. Hanson called Schlessinger August 11, seeking advice on how to deal with racist comments from her white husband's friends and relatives. National furor erupted after Schlessinger ended up using the word 11 times during the five-minute call with Hanson. Hanson said Schlessinger's offense went beyond using a derogatory word.
