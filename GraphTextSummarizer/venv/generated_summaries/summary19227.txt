When news first hit in December 2011 that Disney was going to introduce its new and much younger princess, there was no mention of Sofia's Latina background, let alone that her mother was from "a place with Latin influences," until this week. Disney's spokeswoman provided a recent statement to CNN to help clarify what exactly makes "Princess Sofia" Latina: "The range of characters in 'Sofia the First' -- and the actors who play them -- are a reflection of Disney's commitment to diverse, multicultural and inclusive storytelling, and the wonderful early reaction to 'Sofia' affirms that commitment. Yet this week, Disney announced that Sofia was indeed Latina. #Hispanics" and "#Disney finally comes out with a #Latina princess" Some criticized what they saw as a lack of cultural signifiers or ethnic identity in the Sofia character. In the story, Sofia's mother, Queen Miranda, was born in a fictitious land, Galdiz, a place with Latin influences.
