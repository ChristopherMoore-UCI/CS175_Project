The U.S. Air Force is grounding more than 100 planes used to support ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan because of fatigue cracks in the wings, Air Force officials said Friday. The average age of the A-10 fleet is now 28 years, but the entire Air Force fleet has an average age of 25 years, according to Air Force statistics. No A-10 has had an accident because of the cracks just discovered, according to Air Force officials. This risk is of great concern to the Air Force and is representative of a systemic problem for our aging Air Force fleet," the Air Force said. Numerous F-15s flying in Iraq and Afghanistan also were grounded until they were inspected, forcing the service to fly other aircraft in their place.
