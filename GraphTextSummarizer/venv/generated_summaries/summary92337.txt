The men and women were randomly assigned to one of four treatment strategies for one year: continue taking donepezil; stop taking donepezil and start taking an inactive placebo; substitute memantine for donepezil, or continue taking donepezil and memantine together. Although the combination of donepezil and memantine -- a common strategy in the U.S., but not the U.K. -- had no added benefit, each drug had "independent positive effects," says Howard, who advises patients at this stage of the disease to continue taking both drugs if possible. In a new study of 295 people with an average age of 77 and moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's, those taking donepezil saw improvements "equivalent to around four months' worth of deterioration in cognition and function," says lead study author Dr. Robert Howard, professor of old-age psychiatry at King's College London, U.K. Put another way, those who discontinued donepezil lost "about a third more cognition over [one year] than they would have if they had stuck with it," says Gary Kennedy, M.D., director of geriatric psychiatry at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, who was not involved with the study. For example, people who were taking only an inactive placebo were more likely than patients in other groups to drop out of study, suggesting these families had noticed the placebo "medication" wasn't working. People who continued taking donepezil did better on two different scales of cognition and impairment than those taking no medication or those taking memantine alone.
