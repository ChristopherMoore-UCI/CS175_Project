Randy Travis's publicist denied media reports that the country singer had heart surgery, but he did say Tuesday that Travis received a device to help blood flow. Travis had recently been on the road, performing in Detroit on June 28 and Chicago on June 29. "Viral cardiomyopathy can be caused by 30-plus different viruses, but it's almost impossible to pinpoint which virus it is," said Dr. Ramin Oskoui, a cardiologist and internal medicine specialist in Washington. Travis, 54, was admitted to an unidentified Texas hospital on Sunday because of complications related to his "recently acquired viral cardiomyopathy," Travis spokesman Kirt Webster said in a written statement. "To say that Mr. Travis' alcohol use exacerbated his problems would be pure speculation, but if someone told me alcohol played a role in his cardiac problems, I wouldn't be surprised," Oskoui said.
