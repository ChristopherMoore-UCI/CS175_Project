"Primus and the Chocolate Factory" reunites the band's classic lineup of bassist and singer Les Claypool, drummer Tim "Herb" Alexander and guitarist Larry LaLonde. Anyone who gets one of them, wins free Primus concert tickets for life. It's not quite a tour of the chocolate factory, but for Primus fans it will do. The band goes full "Willy Wonka" on us with their new release "Primus and the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble." -- Alt-metal rockers Primus were never ones to do things the normal way, so why start now?
