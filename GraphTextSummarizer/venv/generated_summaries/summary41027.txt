In addition to Leto, Smith and Robbie, "Suicide Squad" also stars Tom Hardy as Rick Flagg, Jai Courtney as Boomerang and Cara Delevingne as Enchantress. Jared Leto is Joker, Will Smith is Deadshot in 'Suicide Squad' One lingering casting announcement is that of Waller, the government agent who heads up "Suicide Squad's" team of villainous antiheroes. "I have been given a lot of roles that are downtrodden, mammy-ish," Davis told The New York Times' Magazine in September. According to Latino-Review, Viola Davis is said to be in negotiations to land the role of Amanda Waller in the upcoming movie, which is based on the DC Comics series. In addition to appearing in two dramatic films slated for release in 2015, she's also now the star of ABC's hit drama "How To Get Away with Murder" -- a show that's given Davis the kind of meaty leading role she'd been waiting for.
