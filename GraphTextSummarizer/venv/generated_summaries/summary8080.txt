They're not necessarily the must-see places, lest New York City be on the list every year," says Emily Wolman, Lonely Planet editor-at-large. To compile the annual list, Lonely Planet asks its U.S. staff and authors for urban and nature recommendations, well-known and lesser-known spots and locations that have a timely angle for 2014, says Wolman. Grand Rapids and Lake Michigan's Gold Coast It's such an overlooked part of the Midwest, says Wolman, and so deserving of attention by travelers who love art, beer and food and the beach. From Grand Rapids, it's an easy 30-mile drive to Michigan's Gold Coast, "one of the United States' most unexpected beach getaways," says Wolman, at least to folks outside the Midwest. "Yosemite is celebrating that with a bunch of preservation efforts," says Wolman.
