"You could see maybe in the next several years ... an elusive billion-dollar jackpot," said Victor Matheson, economics professor at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. The size of U.S. lottery jackpots are growing, with almost no end in sight. The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. But who cares about odds, when you've actually won almost the equivalent of the net worth of Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods? Somewhere out there, a lucky person -- or two -- may be walking around with a ticket to easy street in his or her pocket, purse or sock drawer.
