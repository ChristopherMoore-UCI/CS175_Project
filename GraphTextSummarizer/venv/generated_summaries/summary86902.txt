Christoph Waltz, LÃ©a Seydoux, Monica Bellucci, David Bautista and Andrew Scott also star in director Sam Mendes' second Bond film. Then, there's an abandoned home in the mountains, the new Aston Martin DB10, and a secret meeting of shadowy men, including one who addresses Bond as "James." James Bond's latest mission has been revealed in the first trailer for "SPECTRE" which was released Friday. Though lacking in stunts and explosions we have come to expect from Bond teases, the first look at "SPECTRE" was packed with clues to the movie's closely guarded plot. Bond's assistant, Moneypenny, presents him with "personal effects" recovered from the ruins of the "Skyfall" house: a singed old photo of two boys and a man and a temporary certificate of guardianship.
