Since 1988, a cycle of droughts have contributed to swamp fires, he added. The fire has had minimal impact on wildlife, said James Burkhart, fire information officer for the refuge. Jason Curry, a spokesman for the federal Incident Management Team, said the preserve will be shuttered to the public indefinitely -- at least until authorities, likely with major help from the weather, get it under control. Burkhart, who worked for more than 30 years as a ranger at the refuge, said a 2007 wildfire was more problematic because of higher sustained winds. As Curry noted, wildfires are nothing new to the swamp, helping shape the terrain, clear out loose debris and provide good conditions for some vegetation.
