Attacks targeting Shiite pilgrims have spiked in recent days as hundreds of thousands of worshipers have been making their way to the holy city of Karbala in southern Iraq and other Shiite shrines. Security officials in southern Iraq said around 28,0000 security forces have been deployed to protect the pilgrimage. Shiites in Iraq and across the world are observing a period of mourning commemorating the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, prophet Mohammed's grandson, a 7th century Imam and one of Shiite Islam's holiest figures. Security has been increased around the shrines, especially in Karbala where the governor expects around two million pilgrims this year from Iraq and other countries. -- At least 10 Shiite pilgrims were killed and dozens wounded in attacks targeting them in Iraq on Tuesday evening, officials said.
