Editor's note: Actor Rainn Wilson plays paper salesman Dwight Schrute in the television comedy "The Office." Rainn Wilson says fellow members of his Baha'i faith are being persecuted in Iran. There is a resolution on the situation of the Baha'is in Iran being sent to Congress. In fact, since 1979, more than 200 Baha'is have been killed, holy places and cemeteries desecrated, homes burned, civil rights taken away and secret lists compiled of Baha'is (and even Muslims who associate with them) by government agencies. Now, as I mentioned, this all happened in Iran, and needless to say the Muslim authorities did not like the Baha'is very much, accusing them of heresy and apostasy. It's bad right now for all the peace-loving Baha'is in Iran who want only to practice their religion and follow their beliefs.
