-- A lawyer for San Diego Mayor Bob Filner criticized the city for not providing sexual harassment training to the mayor, saying its failure to do so violated the law. Filner never received sexual harassment training while serving in Congress from 1993 to December 2012, Berger wrote. The City Council believes San Diego shouldn't be part of the Jackson lawsuit in the first place because it had no role in the mayor's behavior and because of the city's zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment. In a letter to the city attorney, Harvey Berger wrote that Filner might never have been sued for sexual harassment had he been properly trained. San Diego mayor sued, called unfit for office Jackson isn't alone.
