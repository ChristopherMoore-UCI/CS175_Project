Seven Al-Shabaab militants are dead after they attacked  Somalia's largest base for African Union troops, according to the African Union Mission in Somalia. Al-Shabaab said it attacked an African Union military base in Somalia on Thursday in retaliation for a U.S. airstrike that killed their leader near Barawe in September. "I condemn this reprehensible attack on the AMISOM base camp in Mogadishu which also hosts the UN Headquarters for Somalia," U.N. Special Envoy for Somalia Nicholas Kay said. Two militants in a car detonated themselves inside the Halane Military base in Mogadishu, AMISOM spokesman Ali Aden Houmed said. Established in 2007, the U.N.-backed AMISOM currently has some 20,000 African Union troops deployed in the impoverished nation to "conduct peace support operations" and to "stabilize the situation."
