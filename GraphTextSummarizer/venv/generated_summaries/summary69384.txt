Singer said it is "easily provable" that Travolta was not in California on the day the first incident allegedly happened "since John Travolta was on the East Coast working on a movie on the date that anonymous 'Doe No. 1' claims he interacted with our client." Okorocha said he was in discussions with Travolta's lawyer for weeks before filing the suit last week and was never told this. "This second 'anonymous' claim is just as absurd and ridiculous as the first one," said Travolta lawyer Martin Singer on Tuesday afternoon. Travolta and his lawyer "already conceded he was in Los Angeles on January 16, and we can prove it," Okorocha said. Travolta's statement "gave plaintiff confidence that his predatory behavior was finally under control," the suit said. In the first incident, Travolta allegedly groped a male massage therapist repeatedly and finally masturbated himself during the two-hour session in a bungalow at the Beverly Hills Hotel on January 16, 2012, according to court documents filed last Friday.
