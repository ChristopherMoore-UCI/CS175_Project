After short periods of staying with friends and family, Kearney graduated high school and went to college on a scholarship where she excelled in both academics and track and field. Designed around Kearney's coaching philosophy, the nonprofit strives to connect young men and women with needed resources to realize their fullest potential. Needless to say, Kearney's athletes are known to get results. "If I could utilize the techniques that I used to produce results in sports, why can't I utilize those techniques to produce results in life," Kearney says. Track practices were recorded and then played for Kearney on a VCR in her hospital room.
