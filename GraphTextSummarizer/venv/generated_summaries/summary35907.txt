When he started out as a plastic surgeon 26 years ago, providing free care to patients was simple, Moore says; it just required a phone call to the hospital. In Lexington, costs are covered by donations and private foundations, and patients are referred to SOS by hospitals and free clinics. Moore, who shares a plastic surgery practice with two of his four brothers, started a program that provides outpatient surgical care to Kentucky's uninsured -- for free. "But Dr. Moore gave me hope." In the 1950s, when Dr. Andy Moore's father was the first plastic surgeon in town, many residents didn't have health insurance.
