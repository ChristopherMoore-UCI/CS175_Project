The price includes free beer, wine, soft drinks, and coffee. Each line offers state-of-the-art ships with luxurious meals, reasonable cabins, plenty of entertainment (discos, saunas, gambling), and enough duty-free goodies to sink a ship. You can cover a lot of territory in Scandinavia without ever checking into a hotel. The ships are big -- at 56,000 tons, nearly 200 yards long, and with 2,700 beds, they're the largest (and cheapest) luxury hotels in Scandinavia. Smorgasbord translates to something like "bread and butter table."
