-- Vice President Joe Biden on Wednesday issued a sharp warning to ISIS militants, saying after the United States is done grieving the death of two American journalists, their killers will have to answer for their actions. " Biden opened his remarks in memory of Steven Sotloff, the journalist who was beheaded by ISIS militants Tuesday, two weeks after James Foley was executed in the same horrific manner on video. ISIS video shows beheading of American journalist Describing the perpetrators as "barbarians," Biden vowed that Americans would not be frightened or intimidated by the heinous acts. Previewing Biden's trip, the campaign for former Republican Sen. Scott Brown, who's challenging Shaheen for her seat in this year's midterms, released a Web video that shows footage of the vice president supporting President Barack Obama's foreign policy, an agenda the Brown campaign labels a "failure." We dusted ourselves off and we made sure that Osama bin Laden would never, ever again threaten the American people," Biden said.
