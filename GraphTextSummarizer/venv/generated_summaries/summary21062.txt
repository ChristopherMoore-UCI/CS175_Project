Mohamed Abdelshafy grabbed his first goal for Egypt nine minutes from the end, but there was still time for Algeria goalkeeper Faouzi Chaouchi to pick up a second yellow card -- and for Mohamed Gedo to make it 4-0 in stoppage time. Chaouchi was then dismissed two minutes from time as he swung his foot at Gedo, who moments later finished past substitute keeper Mohamed Zemmamouche for the fourth. Halliche was sent off and Hosni Abd Rabou converted the spot-kick to put Egypt on their way for a possible third successive title. Defending champions Egypt will play Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations final after thrashing bitter rivals Algeria 4-0 in a semifinal that saw their opponents finish with just eight men. The result proved sweet revenge for Egypt who missed out on a World Cup spot when they were beaten by Algeria in a play-off.
