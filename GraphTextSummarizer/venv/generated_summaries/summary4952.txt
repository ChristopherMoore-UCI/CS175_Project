" â€¢ "in my opinion Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto died as a result of a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of the bomb-blast and due to head impact somewhere in the escape hatch of the vehicle." The only X-ray records, taken after her death, were of Ms Bhutto's head. Ms Bhutto's head did not completely disappear from view until 0.6 seconds before the blast. At the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of Ms Bhutto's vehicle. Ms Bhutto's injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch.
