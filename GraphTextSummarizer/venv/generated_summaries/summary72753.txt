-- Two men accused of failed car bomb attacks in London and a car bombing at Glasgow International Airport last year went on trial Thursday. The case stems from the discovery in June 2007 of two explosives-filled Mercedes sedans in central London. Their trial at London's Woolwich Crown Court is expected to last up to 12 weeks. The following day, with attention still focused on the averted attacks in the capital, a Jeep sped through the barriers outside Glasgow International Airport and slammed head on into the terminal. The incidents happened just days after British Prime Minister Gordon Brown took office.
