Several communities are already adapting to electric vehicles and that there are examples of "reverse innovation" which is innovation from developing countries that spreads to richer countries, he said. In Bangladesh, he found garages, propped up by bamboo and tin, transformed into charging stations for electric vehicles. "In many places both inside China and in other Asian countries, the three-wheeler is considered a symbol of a less-than-modern-economy, not appreciated by some image-conscious businessmen and government officials," said Ed Benjamin, chairman of the Light Electric Vehicle Association, the trade association for such vehicles. With fuel prices increasing, Tokushige says there is growing willingness to adapt and to find new business opportunities with electric vehicles. The Philippines is one of the first nations to make a concerted push towards electric vehicles, which it plans to roll out first in Manila and to the rest of the country.
