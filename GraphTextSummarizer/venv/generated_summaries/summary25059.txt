-- Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has dismissed reports that Wayne Rooney could be leaving the English Premier League leaders as "absolute rubbish" and insisted Friday the striker would be at Old Trafford next season. City manager Roberto Mancini appeared to rule out any attempt to sign Rooney this time around when he addressed reporters Friday. Balotelli, a second half substitute for Gianpaolo Pazzini, who had put Milan ahead at Genoa Friday night, scored the second to seal the three points. He went on: "There is absolutely no issue between Wayne Rooney and I. To suggest we don't talk to each other on the training ground is absolute nonsense." I think that Rooney is one of the best strikers in Europe but I think it is difficult he can leave Man United," added the Italian.
