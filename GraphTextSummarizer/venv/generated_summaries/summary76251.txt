The charge is related to the May 2009 bombing that killed 30 people at Pakistan's intelligence headquarters in Lahore, said Amanda Marshall, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon. "We will find and prosecute those who use this country as a base to fund and support terrorists," said U.S. Attorney Amanda Marshall. "Khan allegedly provided Jaleel with advice to help him in his efforts to travel undetected from the Maldives to commit violent jihad and used coded language when communicating with Jaleel to avoid detection," according to a news release issued by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Oregon. -- A naturalized citizen living in Portland, Oregon, has been charged with one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists. Jaleel was killed during a suicide bomb attack on the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence in Lahore, Pakistan on May 27, 2009.
