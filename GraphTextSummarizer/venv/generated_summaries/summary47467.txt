The Irishman's form has suffered a dramatic decline in recent years and he is still searching for a first win on the European Tour or PGA Tour since claiming the U.S. PGA Championship. The disappointment follows on from the 42-year-old's failure to qualify for the Masters for the first time in 14 years last month, with his five-year qualifying exemption from his 2008 U.S. PGA Championship win having expired. Harrington was unable to advance from the 36-hole qualifying event at Walton Heath's New Course, falling six strokes short after recording rounds of 75 and 71. Harrington's compatriot Shane Lowry, meanwhile, built on his second-placed finish at the European PGA Championship Sunday to finish top at Walton Heath. The 114th U.S. Open takes place from June 12-15 at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club.
