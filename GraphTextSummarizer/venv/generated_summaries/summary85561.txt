So when I learned CNN's Talk Asia had booked the Beach Boys for an interview in Hong Kong, I jumped at the chance to interview Al Jardine, Mike Love and Brian Wilson. And they're still capturing the sweet, adolescent purity of "Surfer Girl." "Surfer Girl," released in 1963, marked Wilson's emergence as a producer. Dennis and Carl Wilson passed away long ago, but the band includes three original members -- Al, Mike and Brian -- as well as David Marks and Bruce Johnston, who joined the band in 1965. -- A pre-teen me once learned how to slow dance to "Surfer Girl." " Three years later, Wilson would produce "Good Vibrations" -- considered by Rolling Stone magazine as his "ultimate triumph as a producer, and one of the most innovative pop hits of the Sixties."
