A levee in Poplar Bluff, Missouri, failed on Tuesday, city and county officials said, sending water flooding into a rural but populated area of Butler County, causing the evacuation of more than 6,000 people. " Record or near-record floods are expected from Smithland, Kentucky, to Cairo, Illinois, on the Ohio River and then south to New Madrid, Missouri, downstream from the juncture of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, Schwein said. A levee also failed in nearby Scott County, Moreland said. The National Weather Service said snow melt from the upper Midwest and rapid runoff from as much as a foot of rain in Mississippi and Ohio river valley states is contributing to the flooding. Indiana also sent 80 prison inmates to the southwestern part of the state, where record flooding was already reported in Gibson County.
