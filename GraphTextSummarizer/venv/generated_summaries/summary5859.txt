One recent poll showed only 37% of Israelis believe Obama has a "positive" position towards Israel, a mood that has undoubtedly helped Netanyahu enormously, despite the fact that large numbers of former security officials have said Netanyahu is endangering the country by undermining ties with Washington, and despite Israelis saying close relations with the United States are the second most important factor for Israel's security, behind only Israel's own military strength. This point was underscored in a recent poll that asked Israelis recently if they believed President Obama would agree to a deal that Israeli officials considered harmful to Israel's security. By appearing to dismiss Netanyahu's warning of a "nuclear nightmare" over the Iran talks by arguing that the prime minister was offering no "viable alternatives," Obama missed an opportunity to reassure security conscious Israelis that the United States will safeguard their survival. The fact that Obama has become one of the key reasons why Netanyahu continues to win elections in Israel is ironic considering Israelis are profoundly worried about the deteriorating ties with the United States, a relationship they consider key to ensuring their country's survival. Understand that, and you will understand Israel -- and why President Barack Obama may have inadvertently given Benjamin Netanyahu a helping hand.
