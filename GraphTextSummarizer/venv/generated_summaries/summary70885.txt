"Made a new Instagram, gonna post lots of beautiful photos of naked women I think. The 22-year-old daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis took a topless stroll down the streets of New York and documented it on social media to protest what she says is discrimination on the photo sharing site Instagram. The actress said Instagram removed her account, but she complained that other explicit photos -- including one with a woman hiding her nipples using a pair of handguns -- were allowed. The New York Daily News reported that Willis launched her skin campaign after Instagram removed one of her photos it said violated its community guidelines. "This is about helping women feel empowered to make personal choices about their bodies not dictated by what society says is decent," she tweeted.
