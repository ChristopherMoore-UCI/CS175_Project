Brewster said that line in Bates' statement was referring to a lecture given at a seminar in Washington by Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. That would be less than the 480 hours of field training that the Tulsa World said is required to be an "advanced" reserve deputy, which Bates claimed to be. Bates would also have needed firearms certification training. It also said Bates had undergone 300 hours of training. Branstetter said she's run into similar obstacles when asking for the names of supervisors who'd signed off on Bates' training records.
