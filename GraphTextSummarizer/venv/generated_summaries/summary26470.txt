Neruda, a member of Chile's Communist Party, was also a lawmaker in the South American country and served as its ambassador to France. But the foundation's leader told Radio Bio-Bio this week that the organization opposed the exhumation because they did not believe there was a "third party" involved in Neruda's death. -- Chile's Communist Party said it wants authorities to exhume poet Pablo Neruda's body as part of an investigation into his 1973 death. Chilean Judge Mario Carroza ordered an investigation into Neruda's death in June, noting that police, witness and medical records would be examined, Chile's judicial authority said. " As part of a massive investigation of 726 reported human rights violations during Gen. Augusto Pinochet's rule, authorities exhumed former Chilean President Salvador Allende earlier this year.
