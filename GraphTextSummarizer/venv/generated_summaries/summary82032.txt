Like many immigrants today, my grandparents came to America not because they fell in love with American culture, but because they were desperate to escape poverty. "I grew up telling people I was American," Chun Yee Yip O'Neill, a native New Yorker who works for the city's Museum of Chinese in America, told me. Or maybe I'm American-Italian or an American of Italian descent. Like the comedy, "Black-ish," and the coming PBS documentary, "The Italian Americans," it will delve into how much cultural diversity should matter when it comes to being American. So, when I went to college, I said, wait a minute, they don't see me as American, so I'll call myself Chinese-American."
