During Friday prayers, one preacher in the mosque stated the film was intended to irritate Muslims and drive their anger against U.S. interests in the area. But Yemenis reject "democracy" such as this video, which allows the maligning of other faiths and beliefs. The Arab Spring improved this situation because the U.S. demonstrated its support for the revolutionary movement in Yemen and other Arab countries. Democracy, for them, does not justify the vilification of other beliefs, but to show respect for them. Such acts, they say, contradict the teachings and principles of Islam -- the religion of peace and tolerance.
