Other Mac news could include the latest Macbook Pro and Mac Mini updates and a release date for the all new Mac Pro. The announcements are expected to include a redesigned, thinner iPad and a Retina display iPad Mini. Apple is planning an October 22 press event to show off the latest additions to its iPad line, according to AllThingsD's John Paczkowski, confirming an earlier report in Current Editorials. Last year, Tim Cook introduced the iPad Mini, the full sized iPad with Retina display, and some new Macs. The new Mac operating system, OS X Mavericks, was announced in June at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.
