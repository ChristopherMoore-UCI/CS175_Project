Some members of al Qaeda and even Western diplomats allege that Iran, one of the few Shiite Muslim nations, is bankrolling the Houthi rebellion in an effort to control Yemen's Red Sea coast on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. U.S. officials consider AQAP the most dangerous branch of al Qaeda, according to CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank. Sakkaf called the situation "the completion of a coup," adding that President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi "has no control." Yemen, the poorest country in the region, is home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, which most recently claimed responsibility for the massacre of journalists at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris. But on Tuesday, the situation in Yemen apparently became much more dire, as the country's minister of information said Shiite Houthi rebels had taken over the nation's presidential palace. Many would-be jihadis from the West are recruited into al Qaeda through a slick English-language online magazine, Inspire, that's run out of Yemen.
