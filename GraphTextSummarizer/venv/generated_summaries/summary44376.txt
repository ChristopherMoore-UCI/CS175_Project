-- Early on Tuesday morning, two Palestinian men from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber entered a synagogue in the sleepy West Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof and went on a killing spree. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attacks and hammered Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas for inciting the ongoing violence in Jerusalem. Israeli border police blocked access to several East Jerusalem neighborhoods that have been recent flash points for conflict. It was his first condemnation of any attack in Jerusalem since the unrest began last month. Ultimately, though, there is also the question of whether the Palestinian leader actually has the ability to bring stability back to Jerusalem.
