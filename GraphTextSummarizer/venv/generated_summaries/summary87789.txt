"Ever since I was born, daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine," said Paris Katherine Jackson, the second of Michael Jackson's three children, as a massive memorial service for her father neared its end in downtown Los Angeles. " More emotional tributes followed from former Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson, actress Brooke Shields and brother Jermaine Jackson, among others. And the city, which is $530 million in debt, set up a Web page asking Jackson fans to donate money to help with expenses. Three thousand police officers, almost one-third of the Los Angeles police force, were on hand to ensure the Jackson events proceeded smoothly, Los Angeles Assistant Police Chief Jim McDonnell said. A bevy of singers took the stage next, none of whom was listed in a scrapbook of Jackson photographs that fans were handed when they walked in.
