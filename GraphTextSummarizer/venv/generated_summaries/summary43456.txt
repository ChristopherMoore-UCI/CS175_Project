The initial furor this week among Internet users over the video appeared to stem from uncertainty about when the beating took place and the current status of the mother and child. As a result, the mother was convicted of child abuse and sentenced to 18 months in prison, he said, declining to disclose her name. The mother was 18 years old when she inflicted the beating on her 10-month-old child in May 2011, according to Arjunaidi Mohamed, the chief of police in Petaling Jaya, the suburb of Kuala Lumpur where the attack took place. The baby was put into the care of a foster family after her mother's arrest and is now doing "very well," said Fatimah Zuraidah Salleh, deputy director of the children division of the Social Welfare Department. The video fueled anger and disgust among Internet users from Malaysia to Massachusetts, where local news broadcaster WWLP-22News reported receiving "many emails" about the footage.
