Treating OCD and hoarding Doctors may prescribe drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for OCD symptoms. Jeff Bell found treatment for OCD very difficult, but says it helped him turn his life around. He frequently speaks out about it and has written a memoir called "Rewind, Replay, Repeat." Psychologists are debating where OCD belongs in relation to other psychiatric disorders, and whether certain symptoms are actually part of other conditions. Currently, OCD sits with anxiety disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the American Psychiatric Association to help diagnose mental illness. Many experts, such as Jonathan Abramowitz, professor of psychology at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, believe OCD should stay with anxiety disorders.
