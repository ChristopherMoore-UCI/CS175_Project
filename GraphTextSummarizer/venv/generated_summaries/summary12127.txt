It was the militias of Misrata that brutalized Gadhafi loyalists the worst, the rights group says. National security adviser Mutassim Gadhafi, another son, made it safely to Sirte, his father's hometown. Human Rights Watch says the militiamen who ravaged Gadhafi also captured, tortured and killed dozens of his loyalists following his death, violating international war crimes laws. Senior security adviser Mansour Dhao was in tow, he told Human Rights Watch, as well as Gadhafi's personal guard, driver and a bunch of other bodyguards. It didn't take long before the video was uploaded to the Internet, where the world watched the violent end to Libya's eight-month uprising in 2011 -- and to Gadhafi's life.
