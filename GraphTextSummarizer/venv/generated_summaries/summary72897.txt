Morsy was elected president of Egypt in 2012 but went on to push a pro-Islamist agenda that angered opposition liberals, Frida Ghitis said. Less than a week later, Mohamed Morsy was removed from power with the help of the military, putting Egypt on course for more pain. Morsy still has support and his Muslim Brotherhood group is likely to still have an important role in Egypt's future. In the immediate aftermath, world leaders from Iran to the United States reacted to events in Egypt and brushed up on their knowledge of the world's newest leader, interim President Adly Mansour, who until Wednesday -- when the military suspended the constitution -- was head of the Supreme Constitutional Court. And come the military's Wednesday deadline, Morsy disappeared from view -- though he was still tweeting -- as his opponents camped out in Tahrir Square until a general announced on TV that Morsy was no longer in power.
