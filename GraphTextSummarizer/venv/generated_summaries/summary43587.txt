The current flow is at 1.36 million cubic feet per second but when the river's flow reaches 1.5 million cubic feet of water per second at Louisiana's Red River Landing, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will open the spillway and send a torrent of water down the Atchafalaya River, Jindal said. Fourteen Mississippi counties affected by flooding have been declared major disaster areas eligible for federal assistance, Gov. Haley Barbour announced Wednesday in a statement released by his office. President Barack Obama has signed disaster declarations for Tennessee, which will help direct federal aid toward recovery efforts in areas hit by severe storms, flooding and tornadoes. The Corps opened 38 more spill gates to the Bonnet Carre Spillway in Norco, Louisiana, north of New Orleans on Wednesday, sending millions of gallons of water rushing into Lake Pontchartrain and, eventually, the Gulf of Mexico. -- As a historic crest of the swollen Mississippi River rolls southward, residents throughout the river region are on high alert and braced for the possibility of more flooding in the days ahead.
