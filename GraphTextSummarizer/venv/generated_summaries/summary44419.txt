But police said Wilson shot Brown after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun. -- Blood from Michael Brown that was found on the uniform and in the police car of Officer Darren Wilson appears to back the officer's version of events, but still leaves questions unanswered, law enforcement sources told CNN. Brown's blood was found on Wilson's gun, on the squad car's interior and on the officer's uniform, according to a U.S. law enforcement official and a second source with knowledge of the forensics presented to the grand jury. This finding could lend credibility to Wilson's account that he was fearful for his life after a struggle with Brown in the police car. Another witness, Tiffany Mitchell, has said she saw Wilson and Brown "tussling through the window" of the police cruiser.
