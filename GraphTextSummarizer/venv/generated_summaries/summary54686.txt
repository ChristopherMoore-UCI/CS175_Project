According to West, Keller works with a company that refurbishes and sells computers. SWAT and other teams deployed tear gas into the hillside structure in an effort to smoke out suspect Peter Keller, said Sgt. Clues to Keller's whereabouts came during the processing of the crime scene at his house, authorities said. One photo was enhanced and it aided in the search for Keller, who authorities said had been building the bunker for at least eight years. The sheriff's office earlier this week obtained an arrest warrant for Keller, stipulating two counts of first-degree murder and first-degree arson.
