That scam tampered with the way computers access the Web by sending Internet traffic to websites that people didn't intend to visit. So, as a backup, the FBI turned on its own computers to make sure infected machines still would have Internet access. That means machines infected with the DNSChanger malware -- or that have traces of that malicious computer program left on their computers -- no longer can access the Internet as expected. Google, Facebook and the U.S. government have created tools to help people notice if their machines have the DNSChanger malware. The FBI eventually shut down the computers that were used to reroute Internet traffic.
