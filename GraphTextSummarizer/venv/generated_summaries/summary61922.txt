-- Football Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor was indicted Wednesday on charges of rape and endangering the welfare of a child, stemming from an alleged sexual rendezvous with a 16-year-old in May, a suburban New York prosecutor's office said. The girl texted an uncle after she returned to New York City the next day, and the uncle notified the New York City police, prompting the arrest of Taylor and the alleged pimp, St. Lawrence said. Taylor, 51, was arrested in a Ramapo, New York, Holiday Inn room on May 6, a few hours after the alleged rape took place, authorities said at the time. It also alleges that Taylor paid the minor $300 in exchange for performing sexual acts, the release says. Taylor's attorney, Arthur Aidala, told reporters after the bail hearing that the former National Football League star "is denying and preparing to fight each and every one of those charges."
