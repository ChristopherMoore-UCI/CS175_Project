-- Born into grinding poverty and with a degenerative eye condition which left her almost totally blind, Terezinha Guilhermina first became aware of her athletic abilities when fleeing a school bully in her home city of Betim in Brazil. " Her ability came to the notice of Brazilian Paralympic officials and she was selected to compete in the 2004 Games in Athens, over the distances of 400, 800 and 1500m. Categorized as T11 for athletes who have no functional vision, Guilhermina was able to run with a guide, but the athlete nominated to run with her proved of little use. " First prize Guilhermina started taking part in local road races with the aim of making money to fund her activities and buy basic foodstuffs. The pair looked set for victory when Soares de Santana fell in the finishing straight, pulling down Guilhermina in full flight. In defeat, Guilhermina had made the headlines and highlighted the fine line between success and failure in disability sport.
