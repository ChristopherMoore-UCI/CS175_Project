While Annan's mission hopes to bring all sides to the table, the Syrian government and opposition cannot risk the continuing escalation of violence. It is more productive in the long term, therefore, that it uses the hiatus provided by Annan to peacefully mobilize the masses inside Damascus and Aleppo, publish a manifesto that gains purchase from minority Syrians that sectarian violence will not rise in a post-Assad Syria, and bring on board the major religious, tribal and business figures inside country. Failure to do the hard work at the grass-roots level inside Syria while demanding Western military support would be both naÃ¯ve and dangerous. The answers to the conflict in Syria do not come from outside intervention, but from inside Syria's opposition movement. The lesson of this last year is that the al-Assad regime will meet opposition violence with a disproportionate response and fight to the death.
