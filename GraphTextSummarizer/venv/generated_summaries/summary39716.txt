Mack is seeking reinstatement and compensation for his termination, plus mandatory tolerance training for employees, Chaudhry said. Whole Foods works with its employees to accommodate special requests and has an open-door policy, Lowery said, adding the company has many Muslim employees in the Philadelphia and Mid-Atlantic regions. He was terminated in February 2011 for absenteeism, said his lawyer, Amara Chaudhry, with the Philadelphia chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Mack added he was also selected to meet Whole Foods Market co-founder and CEO John Mackey. " "It's well known that Whole Foods values and celebrates diversity," Lowery said, adding, "We have a zero-tolerance discrimination policy, zero tolerance."
