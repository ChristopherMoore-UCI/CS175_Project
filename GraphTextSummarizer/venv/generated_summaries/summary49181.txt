The government, which pledged to set up such a mechanism during Obama's visit, says it hopes the committee will include representatives from other political parties and groups representing political prisoners. Asked whether he would visit political prisoners around Myanmar, Bo Kyi of AAPP said he would rather "see my colleagues outside, not in the jails." -- The Myanmar government, which has freed hundreds of detainees in recent years, is setting up a committee to look into releasing political prisoners after long refusing to admit they were being held in the Southeast Asian country's jails. The new committee will try to determine the the number of political prisoners being held in Myanmar, Ye Htut said, noting that the government had received different estimates from different organizations. But he added that "we have to wait and see until more political prisoners are released." Hundreds believed to still be in prison Aung San Suu Kyi spent many years under house arrest before authorities released her in 2011.
