Among the specific charges, 12 of the defendants, including former Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla, are accused of 108 counts of human rights violations in several South American countries. Another former Argentinian dictator, Gen. Reynaldo Benito Bignone, is among another group of defendants being charged with 35 specific cases of abuse under Operation Condor. The defendants are Argentinean except for one Uruguayan, former Maj. Juan Cordeiro Piacentini. Videla is already serving a life sentence for human rights abuses during his tenure. Bignone also was previously convicted of human rights abuses in another trial and is serving a 25-year sentence.
