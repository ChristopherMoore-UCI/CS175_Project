Amge's birthday was celebrated at a party in Nagpur with cake and guests from her hometown as well as Guinness representatives from London. -- Standing just over 2 feet tall, Jyoti Amge of Nagpur, India, was confirmed Friday as the world's shortest living woman. Amge, wearing a purple sari and celebratory henna, stood proudly next to a copy of the 2012 Guinness record book and her official certificate, which was almost as big as Amge herself. It's like an added birthday present," Guinness quoted Amge as saying. Guinness World Records, known as the global authority on record-breaking -- albeit odd -- achievements, flew to India on Amge's 18th birthday to take final measurements and confirm the new record.
