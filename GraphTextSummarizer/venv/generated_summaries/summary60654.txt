Hunter said he still won't reveal the source of his claim that at least 10 terror suspects have been caught, but that it came from "folks that are on the ground" and not Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson or any other appointees of President Barack Obama. "The question is, is the administration parsing language when they say no actual ISIS fighters -- meaning guys in black pajamas with black flags and AK-47s -- have gotten across the border?" "I should have been more careful talking about ISIS, as opposed to terrorist Turks or terrorist Syrians," Hunter told CNN after an event in his district. Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who made headlines this week by claiming that Border Patrol officers had told him at least 10 ISIS terror suspects had been captured crossing the border, backtracked Friday on his comments about their affiliation. Men affiliated with terrorist organizations have crossed the United States' southern border and the Department of Homeland Security is splitting hairs by arguing otherwise, a House Republican is saying.
