A hurricane warning was issued for coastal North Carolina from Little River Inlet north to the Virginia border, including the Pamlico, Albemarle and Currituck sounds, the National Hurricane Center said. Rainfall amounts of 6 to 10 inches, with isolated maximums of 15 inches, were expected over portions of eastern North Carolina and in the Mid-Atlantic states along the path. "Everybody should take this very seriously," said North Carolina Gov. Beverly Perdue, who declared a state of emergency in counties east of Interstate 95. It will parallel the Florida, Georgia and South Carolina coasts Friday as it approaches a Saturday landfall in North Carolina. "I didn't really want to take my chances," said Janeen Wall, who left her vacation spot in Carolina Beach, North Carolina, to make it back to Richmond, Virginia.
