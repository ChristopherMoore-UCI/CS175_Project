Some very cute images of pit bulls wearing flower crowns started popping up on Facebook this weekend after the Sean Casey Animal Rescue in New York posted them. Gamand and Sean Casey Animal Rescue staff members credit the images with increasing pit bull adoptions since the postings. They are the brainchild of New York-based photographer Sophie Gamand, who is partnering with shelters in New York to create pit bull portraits that make you say "awwww." Pit bulls may not be the first dogs everyone thinks of when it comes to cute, cuddly canines. With "Flower Power: Pit Bulls of the Revolution," Gamand says, she hopes to "challenge the way we look at pit bulls" by giving them a softer image.
