"The pressure generated by this publicity was too much for Garcia to bear, resulting in his surrender and return to the United States," George Venizelos, FBI assistant director in charge of the New York field office, said in a statement. -- A man suspected of killing a young New York mother and her toddler in 2010 was arrested in Nicaragua one day after making the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. Garcia voluntarily agreed to return to the United States and was arrested in New York Friday after the FBI sent a plane to transport him, the statement said. The FBI said that under the guise of an invitation to dinner in Central Islip, New York, Garcia coerced Argueta and her 2-year-old son into the woods. The FBI said a romantic entanglement and gang rivalries lay at the heart of slayings.
