The upside is, this classically creepy, unironic tale of loss and vengeance, based on Susan Hill's popular 1983 novel of the same name, pays fair homage to the kind of fare that has long been the specialty of the recently revived British company Hammer Films, where Christopher Lee once reigned as Count Dracula and Peter Cushing personified Baron Frankenstein. The horror-loving audience who wants to be scared silly, on the other hand, ought to know that, TV ads featuring night-vision footage of freaked out preview patrons to the contrary, this is a movie of quiet spookiness rather than loud BOO!s. The downside is, "The Woman in Black" devotes an awful lot of time to the sight of Daniel Radcliffe, playing a sad, frock-coated lawyer named Arthur Kipps, creeping anxiously through that haunted house, clutching a candle and an axe, getting nowhere.
