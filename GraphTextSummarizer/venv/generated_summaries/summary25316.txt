Other versions of the models will go on display at Madame Tussauds' attractions in Amsterdam and New York, and in Blackpool, in northern England. In each city, "Kate" will be shown in a different outfit: A lilac Alexander McQueen gown worn on the couple's U.S. tour in New York, a black lace Temperley London dress worn to a film premiere in Amsterdam, and a Jenny Packham gown worn at a charity dinner in Blackpool. "I can't see the difference between them and the real people." Madame Tussaud was born Marie Grosholtz in France in 1761, and learned to sculpt wax as a teenager -- her early subjects included Voltaire and Benjamin Franklin -- and went on to become a favorite of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. We want to come and have our photo taken with her," said Madame Tussauds spokeswoman Liz Edwards. During the French Revolution, she was imprisoned, and later commissioned to create death masks of many of those put to death on the guillotine.
