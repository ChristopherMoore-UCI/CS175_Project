There are many examples in recent years of fatal factory fires in Bangladesh, the most glaring being the spring 2013 collapse of a nine-story building that housed five garment factories. Such factories -- making products for a number of Western retailers -- play a big part in Bangladesh's economy, with ready-made garments alone making up 80% of the country's $24 billion in annual exports. At least 13 people are dead and many workers still missing Saturday evening after a fire broke out inside a factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh -- the latest such deadly blaze in the south Asian nation. Past factory fires have led to emotional rhetoric from officials, calls for action and, in some cases, criminal charges. A short time earlier, Dhaka police chief Asaduzzaman Mia told reporters about the efforts to find others who were in the five-story building.
