Perhaps this explains, at least in part, why 75% to 80% of adults with hearing loss do not get hearing aids, according to a recent study done by Virginia Ramachandran, a senior staff audiologist in the Division of Audiology of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. "People don't always perceive that they need (hearing aids), because hearing loss comes on gradually. Older people do need them, but they have an advantage over children with hearing loss. Only 19 states require that health benefits plans in their states pay for hearing aids; most cover children only, according to the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. Children don't have that experience, and untreated hearing loss will severely hurt their development.
