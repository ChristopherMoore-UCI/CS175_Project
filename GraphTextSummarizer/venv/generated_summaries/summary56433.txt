The Taliban -- who have battled U.S. and NATO troops as well as Afghan government forces since the 2001 invasion after the September 11 attacks -- issued a statement after Sunday's killings describing U.S. troops as "sick-minded American savages." The news came as U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta visited with troops at a base in Afghanistan, calling Sunday's killings -- as well as the accidental burning of Qurans by U.S. troops last month and the deadly riots that resulted -- "deeply troubling. Afghanistan's parliament has demanded a public trial for the suspect, but U.S. officials said they will handle the investigation and prosecution themselves. Military officials said the materials had been seized from Afghan prisoners because they contained extremist messages. "And that tells me that you have gained a great deal of respect and trust with the Afghan people, and that's extremely important if we are to exceed in this mission of transitioning all of the areas in Afghanistan to Afghan control, governance and security."
