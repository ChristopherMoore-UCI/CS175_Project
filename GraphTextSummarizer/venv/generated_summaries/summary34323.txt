Violence in Chihuahua is due to struggles between rival drug cartels over lucrative smuggling routes, as well as police operations against the cartels. One of the most high-profile women to take such an assignment is 20-year-old Marisol Valles Garcia, a student who became police chief of Praxedis G. Guerrero, also in the state of Chihuahua. Garcia was one of a handful of women who have taken leadership roles in police departments in cities and towns where men have stayed away because of fear. -- One of a small number of women who have filled a void by becoming police chiefs in violence-torn Mexico was gunned down Monday, authorities said. Gunmen attacked her as she drove to work by herself, authorities said.
