-- Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. has checked out of the Mayo Clinic, where he was being treated for bipolar depression, and is now back in Washington with his family, his chief of staff said Friday. A day after visiting Jackson at the Mayo Clinic last month, longtime friend and former U.S. Rep. Patrick Kennedy said he suspected that "stress in (Jackson's) life, particularly because he's under investigation," may have set off his depression. The 47-year-old Jackson had not been on Capitol Hill since late May. His office said in early June that he was suffering from a "medical condition," and -- after two other updates -- last month the Mayo Clinic released a statement indicating that Jackson was being treated for bipolar depression. The congressman's father -- the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a well-known civil rights leader -- told The Huffington Post last month that when he visited his son in Washington in June, he learned the junior Jackson hadn't slept for three days. "Many of us have genetic predisposition to cancer, heart disease or, in this case, mental illness, but they often get triggered by environmental factors," said Kennedy, the son of the late Sen. Edward Kennedy.
