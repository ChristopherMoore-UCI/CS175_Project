There was a commotion of people around the airport as gun battles still raged nearby, while thick plumes of black smoke drifted high into the sky as what smelled like aviation fuel burned. The eyewitness, who asked not to be named, said some of the assailants were disguised as airport security workers, something that was later corroborated by Sindh Security Unit's (SSU) Mohammed Waqar. He said others were dressed in black as airport security force commandos. The attackers were trying to cut through barbed wire to get into the airport when they were spotted by Airport Security Force personnel (ASF). By contrast, we witnessed a disheveled group of airport workers leaving the building shortly after, their clothes soiled and torn.
