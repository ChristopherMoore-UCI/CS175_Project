Police Chief Cathy Lanier praised the speed and cooperation by various law enforcement agencies that responded. " Latest developments The pair provided an eyewitness account of a suspect they described as a tall black man accused by authorities of opening fire at the heavily secured Navy yard along the Anacostia River, not far from the U.S. Capitol and just blocks from where baseball's Washington Nationals play. "I was listening to music, but I heard four rapid bangsâ€”bang, bang, bang, bang." Then office fire wardens came in shouting for everyone to get out as fast as possible, and "that's when we started moving," she told CNN affiliate WJLA. The first responders found "one of the worst things we've seen" in Washington," according to Lanier.
