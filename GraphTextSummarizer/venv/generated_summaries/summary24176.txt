According to the non-partisan Immigration Policy Institute, proponents of the bill "overlook two salient points: crime rates have already been falling in Arizona for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants, and a century's worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native-born. Similarly, statistics show that rate for most major crimes in Los Angeles also has fallen in recent years. In contrast, Espinosa said, there's no evidence linking high crime rates with illegal immigration, as some U.S. politicians have contended. Others make the case, however, that illegal immigration and high crime are strongly linked.
