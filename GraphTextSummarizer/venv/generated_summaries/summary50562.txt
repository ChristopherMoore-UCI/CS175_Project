Most of Lubitz's training took place at the Lufthansa flight training center in Germany. Lubitz had been with Germanwings, a budget airline owned by Lufthansa, since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time, the airline's media office said. On the surface, Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz seemed, in the words of those who had known him, normal, capable, even fun. Montabaur, in western Germany, is where Lubitz pursued his love of flying from a young age. At a club on the outskirts of town, pilots who knew Lubitz said they were shocked to hear what investigators said.
