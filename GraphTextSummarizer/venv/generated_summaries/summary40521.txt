" LZ Granderson: Boy Scouts feel a mother's wrath A 2000 U.S. Supreme Court decision found that a New Jersey law requiring the national organization to readmit an openly gay Scout Master infringed the organization's First Amendment right of expressive association and that it had a constitutional right to oppose homosexuality in its ranks. -- Jennifer Tyrrell, an Ohio den leader dismissed by her local Boy Scout troop for being a lesbian, said she's disappointed her 7-year-old son is no longer participating in the Scouts. " "We recognize that there will be a range of views on this topic, and Scouting's policy is not meant as a social commentary outside of our program," Boy Scouts of America spokesman Deron Smith said. He added that the decision was not meant to approve or condemn the Scouts' view on homosexuality. "He's no longer a Boy Scout," Tyrrell said Wednesday of removing her son, Cruz, from the group.
