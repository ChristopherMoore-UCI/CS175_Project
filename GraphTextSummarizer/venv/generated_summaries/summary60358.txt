According to Los Angeles police, Lam tended to use public transportation. Teika Steins, manager of a hostel in Toronto, Canada, said Lam stayed a week there in early December. In fact, the hotel is just a few blocks away from the infamous Skid Row district in downtown Los Angeles, but 16 miles from the beaches of Santa Monica, eight miles from Hollywood's Walk of Fame and 12 miles from glamorous streets of Beverly Hills that are prominently featured on the Cecil's website. Two days after the grisly discovery, the case of the Los Angeles hotel water tank corpse is a mystery with many unanswered questions. Lam checked into the Cecil Hotel five days earlier, January 26, on her way to Santa Cruz, California, according to police in her hometown of Vancouver, British Columbia.
