"We presume that it will be divided into sections that will show you how much of different types of foods you should be eating," said Elizabeth Cohen, CNN senior medical correspondent, about the plate image. The USDA said in a statement this week that the new food icon would be "part of a comprehensive nutrition communication initiative that provides consumers with easy-to-understand recommendations, a new website with expanded information, and other tools and resources." " The original version is the widely recognized pyramid that shows a hierarchy of food groups. The new image, expected to be unveiled Thursday, is meant to help remind Americans to make healthy food choices. Foods to be consumed in some moderation, like fats, dairy products and meats, were toward the top of the icon.
