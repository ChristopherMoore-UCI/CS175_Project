Opinion: Sports bar Biden vs. seminar Ryan Overall, this debate's most striking characteristic was the age gap between candidates. Let's give Ryan credit where credit is due. But in the final analysis there's not much Ryan or anyone else can do to counteract the damage caused by Romney's original comment. Biden is sharply critical of disparaging comments made by Mitt Romney and Ryan about Americans who, for one reason or another, do not pay income tax. In joking about Biden's propensity for verbal gaffes, Ryan is suggesting that Romney mangled his words when referring to the 47%.
