"We know that these munitions are leaking cancer-causing materials and endangering sea life," said marine ecologist James Porter, associate dean of the Odum School of Ecology at the University of Georgia, who recently completed a research trip to Vieques. The U.S. Navy has allocated an estimated $350 million in recent years to clean up areas of Vieques where unexploded bombs could come into contact with residents or tourists, said Christopher Penny, head of the U.S Navy's Vieques Restoration Project. "Any country that has a coastline and has ever had war is going to be a place where you can find this problem," said Porter, who warns that removing underwater munitions takes careful planning. James Porter measures a 2,000-pound Navy bomb in the waters off the Caribbean island of Vieques. Vieques is one of many ocean sites around the world affected by abandoned ordnances, said scientists and military officials.
