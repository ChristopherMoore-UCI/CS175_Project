"We canceled two roundtrip flights between Anchorage and Bethel, and Anchorage and Nome after an advisory of low visibility,"  Alaska Airlines  spokeswoman Halley Knigge said. Winds blew the ash cloud across the Bering Sea and into western Alaska, Freymueller said. Alaska Airlines was uncertain if additional flights would be canceled, but said it's monitoring the situation. A volcano in Russia led to the cancellation of flights in Alaska over the weekend. Ash from Russia's Shiveluch volcano was the culprit behind the flight disruptions Saturday,  said Jeff Freymueller, a scientist at  the Alaska Volcano Observatory.
