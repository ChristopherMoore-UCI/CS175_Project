-- Two mentally disabled women were strapped with explosives Friday and sent into busy Baghdad markets, where they were blown up by remote control Iraqi soldiers secure the scene of a bombing Friday at a popular pet market in central Baghdad. An Atta aide said that people referred to the bomber at central Baghdad's al-Ghazl market as the "crazy woman" and that the bomber at a second market had an unspecified birth disability. The second blast happened about a half-hour later in the New Baghdad neighborhood pet market, killing 29 people and wounding 67. The violence marked the bloodiest series of attacks in Baghdad since August, breaking a brief stretch of relative calm as attacks and deaths dropped after the 2007 increase in U.S. troop strength called the surge.
