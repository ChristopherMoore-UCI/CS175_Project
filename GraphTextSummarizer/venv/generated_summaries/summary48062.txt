The transfer moratorium means laboratories around the world can no longer depend on the CDC to help them diagnose unusual diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus, said Michael Shaw, deputy director of the CDC's office of infectious diseases. Multiple improprieties -- including transporting dangerous materials in Ziploc bags and sending a live sample of bird flu to a low-security lab -- prompted CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden last week to instruct his highest-security labs to stop transferring out biological materials. The moratorium will be removed lab by lab as each one can prove that it can operate safely again, and some of the CDC labs might be able to transport materials in a few days, but others might not not be fully operational for months, Shaw said. The lab mishaps at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are having "broad impacts," compromising care for patients with diseases like tuberculosis and chikungunya and potentially slowing work overseas on Ebola and MERS, according to a CDC official. "The CDC is one of the only places that can diagnose these diseases," Shaw said.
