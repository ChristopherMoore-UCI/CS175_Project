The department predicted the system would move Friday northward across the coast of Oman, then weaken gradually before emerging Saturday in the northwest Arabian Sea headed toward the coast of Pakistan. Fourteen families marooned Thursday by high tides were evacuated by helicopter to higher ground, said Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff Adm. Nauman Bashir. The Pakistan navy secured its ships near the threatened areas, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (Operations) Vice Adm. Abass Raza told reporters in Islamabad. "All the assets of Pakistan navy are safe and necessary precautionary measures have been taken to ensure their safety in case cyclone Phet hits the coastal areas of country," he said. In a posting at 11:30 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) on its website, the department said Phet was centered about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) southwest of Karachi, Pakistan, and 350 kilometers (217 miles) south-southeast of Sur, in Oman.
