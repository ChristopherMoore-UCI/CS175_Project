-- When Tony Blair heard British aid worker David Haines mention the former prime minister prior to his beheading, it strengthened his resolve to fight ISIS, he said Sunday. Blair did not expand his remarks on Haines or offer thoughts on aid worker Alan Henning, who appeared in the video of Haines' execution, but he said ISIS' treatment of its hostages shows why it's so important to win the fight against the group. Asked why some British citizens had opted to join ISIS, Blair said it wasn't just a British problem but a European one. Before his execution this month, Haines directed a message at British Prime Minister David Cameron, saying, "You entered voluntarily into a coalition with the United States against the Islamic State, just as your predecessor, Tony Blair, did, following a trend amongst our British Prime Ministers who can't find the courage to say no to the Americans." In his Sunday interview, Blair said he felt President Barack Obama is "absolutely right to take on ISIS and build the broadest possible coalition." He said, however, that aerial campaigns won't be enough and ISIS will need to be fought "on the ground," but it's unclear whether the Iraqi and Kurdish fighters already battling ISIS will be sufficient or if they'll need to be supplemented.
