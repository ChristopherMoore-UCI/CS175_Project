Still, Kepnes said he believes that more Americans going abroad will become inevitable sooner or later. "Countries are travel cultures when they put more of an emphasis on leisure time, and Americans tend to choose money over leisure time." Also, as Kepnes pointed out, time is money for some Americans. Many Americans follow the same pattern: work hard in high school, go to college, accrue a load of debt and get a job right away to work it off, Arndt said. "Americans are going to have to speak more languages and be more culturally savvy," Kepnes said.
