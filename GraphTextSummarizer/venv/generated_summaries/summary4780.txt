Issa responded that tea party groups that came under extra scrutiny could be considered political enemies of the president and that he had yet to see hard evidence that liberal groups were targeted. Asked repeatedly whether they knew of anyone at the IRS with political motives to obstruct applications for tax-exempt status by conservative groups, the pair told the panel "no." Issa himself asked the question early on in the committee's third hearing on the issue, as did others from both parties amid bitter exchanges that focused attention on the political squabbling instead of the targeting cited by George's report. In the memo Cummings made public Tuesday, IRS employees who identified themselves as Republicans, Democrats and independents said there was no political motivation or outside influence involved in the agency's handling of tax-exempt requests from groups with possible or likely political affiliations. Under tax law and IRS regulations, groups that primarily engage in political activity are ineligible for tax-exempt status. Conservative group takes IRS, top Obama officials to court Republicans made a point Thursday of singling out White House spokesman Jay Carney for criticism, noting he previously said that the targeting involved rogue IRS employees in Cincinnati.
