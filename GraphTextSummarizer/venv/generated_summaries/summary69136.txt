" A perfect illustration of Vonn's supremacy came at the venue that starts the weekend as Lake Louise, and ends it as Lake Lindsey. " Vonn, a four-time Alpine World Cup champion, lobbied the FIS to race the men at Lake Louise as it is one of the few meets in the skiing calendar where males and females compete on the same slopes. -- She's laid down the law in female skiing for the past five years, now Lindsey Vonn is pondering legal action in her quest to test herself against the men. "I don't see Lindsey giving up anytime soon, that's for sure, she'll try another avenue," said 1992 Olympic champion Kerrin Lee-Gartner, who thinks Vonn would have finished around 20th had her wish to race the men at Lake Louise been granted. Vonn was also on the podium at the most recent meeting in St. Moritz and is third in the overall standings as she strives for a fifth career Alpine World Cup title.
