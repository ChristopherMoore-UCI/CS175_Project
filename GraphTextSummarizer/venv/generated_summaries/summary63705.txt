â€¢ CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said earthquakes can trigger other seismic activity, but added that those four aforementioned events were too far apart in both time and distance to be connected. Bottom Line: While earthquakes can, and do, trigger other seismic events, the recent earthquakes in Haiti, Chile, Japan and Taiwan are not thought by experts to be connected. "There is evidence to suggest that earthquakes in one area can trigger seismic activity within a few hundred miles," they write. Dr. Kurt Frankel of the Georgia Institute of Technology, who specializes in active tectonics, says that earthquakes are sporadic and unpredictable in nature. However, large quakes measuring 8.0 and higher occur only about once a year on average.
