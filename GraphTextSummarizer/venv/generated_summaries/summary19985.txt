Many of the evacuees were taken to Puerto Montt, a port city in southern Chile about 200 kilometers (124 miles) north of Chaiten. Overnight, authorities armed with a court order evacuated the last of the holdouts -- many of whom had sought to remain to care for their cattle -- among the approximately 5,000 residents inside the 30-kilometer (18-mile) exclusion zone, said Carmen Fernandez, director of Chile's Office of Emergency. But, she said, children, older people and people with allergies or asthma are at highest risk and should make extra efforts to avoid it. The small city is on the Corcovado Gulf, in southern Chile. Chile contains a large number of active volcanoes, including Llaima, which erupted in January, sending lava and smoke down a snow-covered mountain.
