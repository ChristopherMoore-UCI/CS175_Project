Elke Govertsen and Paul Donaldson Missoula, Missouri Married seven years Sex with Paul had stopped being fun, says Elke, 35. "What good is success if you're unhappy?" Knowing how much her sons missed their father, Elke encouraged Paul to spend what time he had at home with the boys. "In the middle of it, I'd make to-do lists in my head or interrupt to ask, 'Did you let the dog out?'" Five years after their 2004 marriage, Elke and Paul found they could go weeks without being intimate -- something the couple, who had been inseparable since meeting in their 20s as camp counselors, would have once found unimaginable. During that first session, the sex therapist pointed out that the pair had fallen into a trap common to many couples with young children. During that time, Paul was home for only a few days every two weeks, leaving Elke to juggle her job as the publisher of a regional women's magazine and caring for their two sons, Boone, eight, and Dimitri, six.
