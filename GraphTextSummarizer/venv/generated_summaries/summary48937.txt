The Moore Space (4040 NE 2nd Avenue) is a vast gallery that showcases cutting edge art, while the fa√ßade of the Living Room Building (4000 Miami Avenue) includes an open-air recreation of a gigantic living room. -- When most people think of Miami, they think of South Beach, with its glorious sands, glamorous people and gorgeous Art Deco buildings. The Art Deco Welcome Center (1001 Ocean Drive) is a good place to start, and no tour of the area would be complete without seeing the Marlin, Delano, National and Kent hotels in Collins Avenue, and the Crescent, Colony and Waldorf Towers hotels on Ocean Drive. Once you're done with the Deco, stroll among the boutiques and cafes of Lincoln Road, Washington Avenue and Ocean Drive. In recent years, Miami has become something of a center for contemporary art.
