-- An attorney for convicted Washington-area sniper John Allen Muhammad, who is scheduled to be executed November 10, will seek clemency from Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine on October 22. Kaine told CNN affiliate WTOP Radio during its "Ask the Governor" program last month that he couldn't imagine a circumstance under which he would grant clemency. Under Virginia law, condemned prisoners can choose to die by electric chair or by lethal injection. During a three-week period in October 2002, police say, Muhammad and young accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo shot 13 people, killing 10. Muhammad is to be executed for the murder of Dean Harold Meyers at a Manassas, Virginia, gas station.
