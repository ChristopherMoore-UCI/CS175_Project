-- A "once-in-a-lifetime" exhibition of paintings and drawings by Renaissance master Leonardo da Vinci opened in London Wednesday. The show, "Leonardo da Vinci: Da Vinci used geometry to refine proportions and adhered to prevalent ideals of beauty in his work, said Syson. It was an important period for da Vinci, says Syson, and the exhibition charts his evolution as a painter and thinker. "I think this is maybe a once-in-a-lifetime experience," said Luke Syson, curator of Italian painting before 1500 for The National Gallery.
