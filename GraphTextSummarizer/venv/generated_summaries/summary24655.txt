France was hit with three days of terror after three suspects killed 17 civilians in multiple attacks last week. "They are hoping that the attacks in Paris by a group which included a self-professed ISIS follower will inspire other attacks in the West," CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. In an internal memo, NYPD employees were told to "remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol," especially in light of the attacks in France last week. On Sunday, an update to an old ISIS video was released by an unidentified person or organization, adding scenes from the France terror attack. The New York City Police Department  and other law enforcement personnel responded to a threat from ISIS after someone re-released a September 2014 message that tells followers to "rise up and kill intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians."
