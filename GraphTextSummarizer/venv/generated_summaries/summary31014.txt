The bus was returning from a camp in Michigan, said Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard. Most of those on board were teenagers, according to Indianapolis Fire Department spokeswoman Rita Burris. Indianapolis police spokesman Michael Hewitt said two passengers were airlifted from the crash, nine were treated and released at the scene of the accident and others were taken to local hospitals. A total of eight remained in two hospitals as of Sunday night. "I saw bodies everywhere, kids in shock and disbelief," said John Murphy, who had stopped along the northern Indianapolis road where the bus crashed.
