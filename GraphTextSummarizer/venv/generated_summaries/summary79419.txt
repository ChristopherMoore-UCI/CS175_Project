Airbnb apologizes: 'We have really screwed things up' Research potential guests Sites like CouchSurfing and the Hospitality Club allow hosts to screen potential guests through their profiles, which often read like personal ads, complete with a picture, offering a more intimate sense of who they are. Like Airbnb, HomeAway operates as a marketplace, but communications and financial transactions occur between the guest and host off site, with hosts paying only for their listing. Currently, communication between Airbnb users occurs on its platform until a reservation has been paid for, after which hosts can contact guests via phone or e-mail. This is another way for hosts to do a gut check against potential guests. The Hospitality Club, which has 670,000 members in 200 countries, goes a step further by requiring guests to provide passport numbers so hosts can verify them.
