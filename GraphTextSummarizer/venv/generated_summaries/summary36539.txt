Nigeria has seen a rash of killings and kidnappings blamed on criminal groups or the Islamist militant group Boko Haram. The company is based in Abuja and is involved in many major road construction projects in northern Nigeria. Human Rights Watch says Boko Haram -- whose name means "Western education is sacrilege" -- has killed more than 2,800 people in an escalating campaign to impose strict Islamic law on largely Muslim northern Nigeria.
