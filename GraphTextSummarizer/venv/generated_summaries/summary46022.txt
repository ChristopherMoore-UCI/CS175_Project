The former Playboy model and current "The View" co-host revealed on Wednesday's show that she and singer/actor Wahlberg are getting hitched. -- What are the odds that Jenny McCarthy and Donnie Wahlberg will give us the '90s wedding of our dreams? Wahlberg popped the question last weekend with help from McCarthy's 11-year-old son, Evan, and on Wednesday joined his bride-to-be on "The View." McCarthy's marriage to director John Asher ended in 2005, and Wahlberg's nine-year marriage to Kim Fey ended in 2008. The couple began dating publicly last summer, and in November the TV personality said that she was starting to view marriage as a possibility.
