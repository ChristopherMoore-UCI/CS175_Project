"Natural disasters in Japan, unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, plus the sharp rise in oil prices have slashed industry profit expectations to $4 billion this year," the association's Director General and CEO Giovanni Bisignani said in a statement released Monday. Monday's revision denotes a plunge in profit expectations of 54%. -- Airline industry profits will fall worldwide in 2011, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), thanks to rising fuel prices, political unrest and natural disasters. Profits from Middle East carriers will drop from $900 million in 2010 to $100 million in 2011, the group said. They're forecast to bring in $2.1 billion in profits for the year.
