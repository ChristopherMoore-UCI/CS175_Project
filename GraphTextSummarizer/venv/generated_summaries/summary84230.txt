The Police Service of Northern Ireland said "at least 10 gunshots" were fired at police lines in the nationalist Brompton Park area of Belfast's Ardoyne district at 12.30 a.m. Friday. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr, the officer in charge of the policing operation in Belfast, condemned the attacks on police. The march passed without a major incident, but there was tension between pro-Irish and pro-British groups as they staged rival demonstrations. The police also said several vehicles were set on fire and pushed at police lines. Officers were also attacked with pipe bombs during the disorder, police said.
