That Census Bureau survey was the first to differentiate between those who graduated from high school and those who obtained a GED, Fry said. The equivalency degree, called the General Educational Development (GED) credential, "is widely regarded as the best 'second chance' pathway to college, vocational training and military service for adults who do not graduate from high school," the center said on its website. The Pew analysis also found that in 2008, Latino adults with a GED had a higher unemployment rate than those with a high school diploma -- 9 percent versus 7 percent. About 41 percent of Latinos 20 and older in the United States do not have a regular high school diploma, compared with 23 percent of black adults and 14 percent of white adults, Pew said. About 52 percent of foreign-born Latino adults are high school dropouts, compared with 25 percent of the native born, Pew said.
