IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei has given all the representatives until Friday to say whether they will sign the agreement, which ElBaradei described as "a balanced approach to the problem." Soltanieh would not elaborate on the draft agreement until it is finalized, but he told CNN that Iran plans to continue its uranium enrichment program at its Bushehr nuclear power plant. The delegates hammered out the details of a tentative deal reached in early October which calls for low-enriched uranium produced in Iran to be sent abroad for further enrichment and then returned for use in medical research and treatment. "In principle we have in fact accepted this offer for this Tehran ... reactor in spite of the fact that we are capable of producing the fuel," Ali Asghar Soltanieh told CNN's Matthew Chance in Vienna. The Obama administration is working on a substantial sanctions package against Iran in case current diplomatic efforts to curb its nuclear program fail, top officials told Congress earlier this month. But many in the West believe Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons capabilities.
