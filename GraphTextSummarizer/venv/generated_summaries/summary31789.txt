The United States and several of its allies, particularly France, began calling for military action against Syrian government forces after an August 21 attack outside Damascus that they said involved the use of chemical weapons against civilians. Syria's government denies unleashing chemical weapons, and Russia said Syrian rebel forces may have been behind the August 21 attack. Syria has agreed to give up its arsenal of chemical weapons under international pressure and delivered an inventory of its poison gas stocks to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons over the weekend. "They say they will quit the work at the OPCW in The Hague if Russia does not back the resolution based on Chapter VII at the U.N. Security Council." Lavrov said the Americans "are interested in proving their superiority, and this is absolutely not the objective that drives us -- to solve the problem of chemical weapons in Syria. Veteran weapons inspectors have said securing and destroying the Syrian stockpile could take huge numbers of people, including hundreds of inspectors and thousands of troops to provide security.
