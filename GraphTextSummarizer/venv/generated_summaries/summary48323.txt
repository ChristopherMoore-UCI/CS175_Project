A youth player for Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala was shot dead in Russia's North Caucasus in the early hours of Sunday morning. The attack took place in Dagestan, a region of Russia that has recently become the focus of Islamist insurgency. I hope the law-enforcement bodies will efficiently detect the murderers, who will receive just punishment. "Despite of the efforts to destabilize the situation, we`ll keep on living and working for the only purpose -- peaceful Dagestan." For years, Anzhi's leading players lived and trained in Moscow and only went to Dagestan for home games. Over recent years, Anzhi competed for the Russian Premier League title and attracted star players like Samuel Eto'o, Willian, and Roberto Carlos.
