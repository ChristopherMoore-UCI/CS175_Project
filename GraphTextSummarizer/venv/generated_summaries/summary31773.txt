In the women's race, another track superstar, Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia, also found the step up to the marathon testing as she finished third behind Kenyan pair Edna Kiplagat and Florence Kiplagat. -- World record-holder Wilson Kipsang completed a Kenyan double at the London Marathon Sunday as home hope Mo Farah disappointed on his debut over the 42km distance. Two-time world champion Edna Kiplagat sprinted clear at the finish to win in two hours 20 minutes and 21 seconds with Dibaba coming home 14 seconds down after her mishap. Tsegaye Kebede, last year's winner, took third, just ahead of fellow Ethiopian Ayele Abshero. Dibaba lost ground to them after dropping a water bottle at a drinks station and was never able to get on terms.
