-- Indian police fired on pro-independence protesters in Indian-administered Kashmir Monday, killing four people and wounding 16 others, a senior police officer said. The deaths bring to 69 the number of people killed in 87 days of violence, as demonstrators stage large protests and block highways in marches calling for independence for the region. Thousands of people shouting anti-Indian slogans later blocked the highway. The Muslim-majority Kashmir has seen some of the worst unrest ever against Indian rule since June 11, when a teenager was killed in Srinagar by a tear gas shell. Indian-administered Kashmir has been in the throes of separatist violence for the past 20 years, leaving -- according to the official count -- 43,000 people dead.
