That leaves two high-profile issues with rulings still to be announced: -- Same-sex marriage: A pair of appeals testing whether gays and lesbian couples have a fundamental constitutional right to wed. -- Voting rights: The future of the Voting Rights Act, and continued federal oversight of elections in states with a past history of discrimination. But a "standing" ruling would likely nullify everything, perhaps forcing both sides to start all over again in the lower courts, and limiting the reach of gay marriage to perhaps only a few California counties. Obama now supports gay marriage, and has refused to defend the 1996 federal law. It seems pretty clear where this is going, with a much broader recognition of same-sex marriage, and so the justices don't want to call that into question when the country is headed in that direction." A DIG would be likely to mean lower court rulings striking down Proposition 8 would hold, allowing California gay and lesbian couples to marry if they chose.
