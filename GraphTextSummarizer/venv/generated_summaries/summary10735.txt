Photographer Maxine Helfman didn't foresee the current outcry around civil rights in America back in 2012, when she began shooting portraits in the style of the old Flemish master painters -- using only black models. She draws inspiration for her art photography from painters like the Flemish masters and contemporary photographers like Carrie Mae Weems and Seydou Keita. Images from another series depict black women in black face paint dressed as geishas. Flemish portraits of heroes, villains Helfman enjoys provoking the audience by placing her subjects in unexpected situations -- many of them involving clothing and culture. Light plays across their faces, white collars and billowing black vestments in a manner familiar to followers of the Dutch and Flemish masters.
