Some protesters also launched a hunger strike, which has been joined by Potosi Province Governor Felix Gonzalez and other officials as well as union leaders. Protesters also say the government hasn't invested enough in their area and have made demands such as better roads and the construction of a modern airport. The leftist Morales, who is indigenous, relied on a broad base of support among indigenous people and the poor -- nearly always one and the same in Bolivia -- for his election victory. Presidential spokesman Ivan Canelas said Tuesday the government has no intention of mounting a military operation to end the blockade and urged protesters to come to the negotiating table. About 6,000 of the 16,000 residents in Potosi, in southwestern Bolivia, have mounted the blockade.
