-- Attention minions of Colonel Meow: We regretfully announce that at some terrible hour on Wednesday - Colonel Meow Time - Colonel Meow, dear leader, feline overlord, and supreme dictator of the Colonel Meow Empire, merged with the infinite. But Colonel Meow also had a gentle side, which sort of reads like my profile on Christian Mingle. Colonel Meow suddenly became ill and was hospitalized with heart problems. Who soon became known simply as "Slave Beast." Colonel Meow's true rise to power began when Avey and her husband, Eric Rosario, began posting images of him on Instagram. You see, whereas Grumpy Cat generally looked bothered and forlorn, Colonel Meow was proud, plotting and evil, as though he might actually murder a small human just for sport.
