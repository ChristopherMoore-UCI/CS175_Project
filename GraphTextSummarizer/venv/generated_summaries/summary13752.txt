This was not only the first hot-air balloon to cross the Atlantic, but was the largest ever flown at 2.3 million cubic feet capacity, reaching speeds in excess of 130 miles per hour (209 km/h). His help in the initial funding of charity projects helped that organization to raise over Â£100 million ($200 million), through campaigns such as Comic Relief and many other charities. Branson formed Virgin Atlantic Airways in 1984, and it is now the second largest British long haul international airline and operates a fleet of Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 aircraft to locations including New York, Hong Kong, Johannesburg and Tokyo. This was followed a year later by the epic hot air balloon crossing of the same ocean in "Virgin Atlantic Flyer." In 1986 his boat, "Virgin Atlantic Challenger II" rekindled the spirit of the Blue Riband by crossing the Atlantic Ocean in the fastest ever recorded time.
