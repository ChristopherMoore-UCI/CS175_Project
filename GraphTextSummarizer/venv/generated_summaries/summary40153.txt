Wardaddy, gunner Boyd Swan (an outstanding Shia LaBeouf), loader Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and driver Trini Garcia (Michael PeÃ±a) have tilted their moral compass to view murder as different from killing the enemy. Tank warfare in the final days of World War II sounds like primo escapism for action freaks. "Fury," written and directed with exacting skill and aching heart by David Ayer ("End of Watch"), doesn't let us off easy with video game violence. Ayer captures the buried feelings of men in combat with piercing immediacy. They don't even see the blood on their hands until the arrival of Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman), a rookie driver unprepared for combat.
