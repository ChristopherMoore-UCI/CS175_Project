The Israeli ambassador to Jordan has returned to Amman a day after security concerns pushed officials to send much of the embassy staff home early, an Israeli foreign ministry spokeswoman said Friday. Staffers typically travel between Amman and Israel every Friday and Saturday, but they were sent home a day early this week after last week's ransacking of the Israeli Embassy in Cairo by protesters and plans for anti-Israel protests this week in Amman. Those who organize the gatherings refer to themselves as the jama'at al-Kalouti, which means "the group of the Kalouti,"  named after the mosque near the Israeli Embassy in western Amman. Egyptians have been angry about the killing last month of five Egyptian police officers by Israeli soldiers when Israel went after militants who had attacked civilians near the Israeli-Egyptian border. Also, protesters against Jordan's ties with Israel have been gathering every Thursday outside an Amman mosque for more than a year.
