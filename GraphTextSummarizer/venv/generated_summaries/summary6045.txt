"We knew it was going to be hugely successful," admits Nikki Rocco, Universal's president of distribution, who says family business was "phenomenal" and made up "the bulk of business" In fact, Despicable Me 2, which features the voice work of Steve Carrell and Kristen Wiig, led the box office to the best July 4th weekend of all time. Over the extended 4th of July weekend, a lot of Americans lit up the grill and spent time with family. The film, which stars Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer, joins Cowboys and Aliens and Wild Wild West as films that attempted (unsuccessfully) to turn the western genre into widely-appealing, popcorn-munching spectacles. Like that film, Despicable Me 2 earned an "A" CinemaScore grade from audiences.
