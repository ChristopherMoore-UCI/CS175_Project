In the developed world, colossal investment in power stations, pylons and other infrastructure over the last century has guaranteed inexpensive electrical supply for all from the grid -- and he says there's therefore currently little demand for this kind of personal power station. It seemed to be splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. You can take sunlight and water, drop this thing in, and simply split hydrogen and oxygen. On either side, the silicone strip is coated with inexpensive metallic compounds -- a cobalt phosphate catalyst that spurs the creation of oxygen gas, and a nickel-zinc alloy that does the same for hydrogen. That, or combine hydrogen with CO2 to produce the type of liquid fuels we're more familiar with -- gasoline or diesel -- a process which has seen big advances in recent years.
