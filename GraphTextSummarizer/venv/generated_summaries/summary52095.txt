Every element of Kate's wedding to Prince William last year -- from the cake to the trees in the church -- were either dreamed up by the couple or approved by them. Palace staff provide day-to-day support but William has taken the lead, with backup from his father, Prince Charles, and grandmother, Queen Elizabeth. The prince made sure the palace gave Kate the support she needed and this year she got her own assistant private secretary, Rebecca Deacon. St James's Palace, which looks after after the duke, duchess and Prince Harry, has deliberately taken a corporate approach to Kate's role. When a senior royal source earlier this month told CNN that Kate had "achieved her objectives," it was no surprise that he used the language of boardrooms.
