Najah Dawaji, a U.S.-based Libyan pro-freedom activist, said she was with three key members of Libya's Transitional National Council when they first learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi, Libya, on Thursday. The United States is deeply concerned about the well-being of Eman al-Obeidy, according to a State Department source, and worked closely with officials in Europe and Libya to get her safely out of the country. " Al-Obeidy was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Libya. When told by the UNHCR that she was protected under refugee status, Qatari agents said, "We don't have an agreement with the U.N.," according to al-Obeidy. She said she was beaten and handcuffed, then forced onto a military plane to Libya.
