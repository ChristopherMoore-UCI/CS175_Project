President Barack Obama offered a bullish assessment of his war on Islamic terrorists in Syria and Iraq on Monday, even as he acknowledged small gains by ISIS would mean the U.S. engagement there will be prolonged. Obama flew to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, near Trenton, to offer his thanks to U.S. military personnel, many of whom have served in combat zones. The Obama administration initially said 9,800 troops would remain in Afghanistan next year, but earlier this month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the number would include up to 1,000 additional troops. The pair shook hands and spoke for more than a minute on the military tarmac where Air Force One landed on Monday afternoon, before proceeding together to the airplane hanger where Obama delivered his address. " In New Jersey Obama was greeted by Republican Gov. Chris Christie, a vocal critic of Obama who has still maintained a amiable relationship with the President.
