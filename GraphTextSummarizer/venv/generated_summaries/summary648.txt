Previously, victims of revenge porn had limited recourse when photos taken with consent were posted online. Up to 80% of revenge porn victims had taken the photos of themselves, according to a recent survey by the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative.

A person could sue the ex who uploaded the images or the site hosting them for invasion of privacy, but it didn't constitute harassment under California state laws. The first few cases will show how effective the new legislation is in curbing revenge porn.
