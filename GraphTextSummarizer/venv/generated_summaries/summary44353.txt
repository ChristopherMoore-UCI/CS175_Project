But Ribery has shaken off a muscular problem to play, along with Dutchman Arjen Robben, who clinched the victory over United with a stunning late volley at Old Trafford and claimed a hat-trick in the rout of Hannover. -- Lyon coach Claude Puel is confident that his team can cause an upset in their European Champions League semifinal first leg against German giants Bayern Munich. " Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery, who faced Lyon many times during his career in the French league, said his current club would be foolish to underestimate Puel's side. "We shouldn't allow ourselves to think about the final." Bayern will be without captain Mark van Bommel and defender Holger Badstuber, who are both suspended after picking up yellow cards in the quarterfinal victory over Manchester United. "The Germans are always dangerous in big matches and Bayern just knocked out Manchester United," said Puel.
