Our children should not be treated as collateral damage in failed educational experiments, and school districts and the federal government must abandon the discriminatory education reform agenda that supports the aggressive use of school closures and charter school expansion. Landrieu: Charter schools: Let every child have access Instead of the old segregationists in the business of denying opportunities to students of color, so-called education "reformers" today are producing the same outcomes through the policies of school closures and literally turning education into a business. Entitled "Death by a Thousand Cuts: Racism, School Closures, and Public School Sabotage," the report provides a searing look at the national pattern of school districts setting our schools up to fail through a combination of the following policies: high-stakes, testing-based accountability systems, enrollment policies that concentrate the most disadvantaged students in a few schools without providing the needed resources and siphoning public funds by promoting and favoring charter schools. With increased school closures and the expansion of charter schools in New Orleans, the city's Recovery School District has only five traditional public schools left and is on its way to being the nation's first all-charter school district. But 60 years later, a new playbook of discriminatory education policies continues to keep schools separate and unequal, with countless children of color on the outside looking in.
