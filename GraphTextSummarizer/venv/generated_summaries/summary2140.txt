Last year Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and CEO of News International's parent company News Corp., said the current free access business model favored by most content providers was flawed. -- News International announced plans Friday to charge for access to The Times and The Sunday Times Web sites starting in June. The publisher said both British newspapers will launch new Web sites in early May and offer a free trial period to registered customers. Starting in June, each site will charge £1 ($1.48) for a day's access or £2 ($2.96) for a week's subscription, News International said. Subscribers will have access to both sites, News International said.
