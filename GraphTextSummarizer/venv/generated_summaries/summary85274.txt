Even as he cheered the result, Saleh said the real power in Egypt still lies with the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which took power after the ouster of longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak. The generals said the new president would set a date for parliamentary elections and would have the power to appoint government officials, name ambassadors to foreign countries and grant pardons --  but the junta will keep legislative power and the budget in its hands until new lawmakers are elected. "He doesn't have the power, SCAF has the power." Egypt's electoral commission declared Morsi the country's president-elect Sunday after a runoff with Ahmed Shafik, a former air force general who served as Mubarak's last prime minister. Israel has reacted cautiously to the elections, issuing a statement Sunday that it "appreciates the democratic process in Egypt and respects the results of the presidential elections. Despite his previous fierce criticism of Israel -- including calling Israeli leaders "vampires" and "killers" -- Morsi pledged Sunday night that Egypt "will preserve all national and international agreements" under his leadership.
