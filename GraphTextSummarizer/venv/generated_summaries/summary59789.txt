"I think generally speaking for the last several years we've been in a pretty good place from a performance standpoint," said study co-author Dean Headley, an associate professor of marketing at Wichita State University. The statistical study of U.S. airlines, co-authored by aviation and marketing professors, has been conducted since 1991. On-time performance receives the most weight in the formula, followed by denied boardings, mishandled baggage and customer complaints. On-time performance for U.S. airlines dropped in 2013 from 2012, with 78.4% of arrivals on time in 2013, compared with 81.8% in 2012. Industry performance improved in two of the four areas considered, with fewer denied boardings and customer complaints in 2013 than 2012.
