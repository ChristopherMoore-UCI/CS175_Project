The winning penalty was scored by Ivory Coast goalkeeper Boubacar Barry after he had saved the preceding effort from his Ghana counterpart Razak Braimah. Further chances in the second half and during added times were again limited as both teams appeared to settle for the lottery of penalty kicks. It was almost a carbon copy of the 1992 final when the Ivorians beat Ghana on spot kicks after a goalless draw and extra time. The 35-year-old Barry, who replaced the injured Sylvain Ghobouo for the final, had been beset by cramp during the lengthy shootout, but mustered the energy to fire his kick past the unfortunate Braimah to spark wild celebrations by his team. The triumph is the second in three AFCON finals for Ivory Coast coach Herve Renard, who led Zambia to the 2012 title, ironically with Ivory Coast as the victims after a penalty shootout.
