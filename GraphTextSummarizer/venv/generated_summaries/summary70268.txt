Sochi dachas have also become increasingly in demand from the ultra-rich so-called oligarchs who divided up much of the Russian economy among themselves with the downfall of the Soviet Union. With Armenians accounting for 20% of the city's population, and close proximity to Georgia, Sochi offers an impressive sampling of cuisine beyond the dill and sour cream of traditional Russian fare. Now, the once feared horsemen who secured the frontier for Russian tsars have joined forces with police patrolling Sochi. In the years since, the destination has become a summering spot for a succession of Russian politicos -- all the way up to President Putin, who has two dachas in Sochi. Sochi overlaps with a UNESCO World Heritage Site Olympics visitors can enter the Caucasian Biosphere Reserve, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that partially overlaps with Sochi National Park in the Western Caucasus.
