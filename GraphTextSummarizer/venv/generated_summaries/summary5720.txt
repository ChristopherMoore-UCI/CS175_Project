Coup worsens Obama's Egypt policy headache In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, a group with a deeply anti-Western, anti-American ideology, won the elections. The Obama administration has been so timid, so eager to stay out of the fray, that a few weeks before the verdict against the pro-democracy activists, Secretary of State John Kerry passed up the opportunity to take a stand for the workers, and for democracy, by quietly waiving the human rights preconditions of U.S. aid to Egypt and thus allowing $1.3 billion in aid to go forward. But once the dictator fell, America should have made a much stronger case for the fundamental principles of liberal democracy. Granted, the uprisings also targeted strong American allies, such as Egypt's now-deposed president, Hosni Mubarak. Occasionally, American officials spoke out, as when the ambassador to Egypt, Anne Patterson, told a small group in Alexandria that "democracy needs a healthy and active civil society."
