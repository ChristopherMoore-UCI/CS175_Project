The United Nations and human rights groups have called on the Bangladeshi authorities to let in refugees fleeing the violence in Rakhine, citing reports that border guards had turned back boats carrying people from Myanmar. The unrest in the western coastal area of Myanmar, which borders Bangladesh, has left 21 people dead and thousands seeking shelter in refugee camps, Myanmar state TV reported Tuesday evening. The U.N. envoy to Myanmar arrived Wednesday in the Southeast Asian country's western state of Rakhine, where sectarian violence in recent days has killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Vijay Nambiar, the special adviser for Myanmar to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, is in Rakhine for talks with local officials, said Aye Win, the U.N. national information officer in the country. Anger over the case fueled an attack by about 300 local people on a bus in the Taungup area of Rakhine, killing 10 Muslim passengers on June 3, according to the New Light of Myanmar, a government-run newspaper.
