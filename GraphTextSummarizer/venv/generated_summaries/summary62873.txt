After the drill ended, North Korean state-run media reported why the North did not react militarily: "The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) did not feel any need to retaliate against every despicable military provocation like one taking revenge after facing a blow," KCNA reported North Korean military officials as saying Monday. " North Korean military officials also said the United States and South Korea perpetuated military provocation, "far from drawing a lesson from the disgraceful defeat they suffered" from the Yeonpyeong shelling, according to KCNA. During the drill, fighter jets took to the sky in preparation for possible North Korean retaliation, according to the South Korean defense ministry. After once threatening the exercise could spur a war, North Korean military leaders said retaliation wasn't necessary but issued a stern warning to South Korea and the United States, according to the state-run Korean Central News Agency. Seoul had no official reactions to two proposals -- one to set up a hotline between South and North Korean military leaders and another to have a commission to settle simmering disputes before they flared into full-on military confrontations -- that Richardson said North Korean leaders were receptive to.
