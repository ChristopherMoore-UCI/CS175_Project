-- A day after a plane crash outside the Russian city of Yaroslavl killed dozens of Russian and international hockey players, hundreds of residents and supporters gathered Thursday at the arena where the Yaroslavl Lokomotiv hockey club played to commemorate those lost. Russian TV showed mountains of flowers, scarves, flags and other items bearing the team's insignia being laid in front of the stadium in Yaroslavl, a city 155 miles northeast of Moscow. Speaking from a crisis center set up in Yaroslavl to deal with the crash aftermath, he said that at the moment 16 Russian air carriers are using 57 aircraft of this type. And Alexander Medvedev, president of the league, said in a radio interview that "all the KHL clubs without exception called the league and said they are willing to send their best players to Yaroslavl." Galimov and crew member Alexander Sizov, the other survivor, were flown to Moscow for treatment in leading Moscow trauma clinics, state media reported.
