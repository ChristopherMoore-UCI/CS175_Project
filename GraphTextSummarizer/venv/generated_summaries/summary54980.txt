"While the Committee has subpoenaed documents that address what senior officials were told about controversial gunwalking tactics during Operation Fast and Furious, the Justice Department pointedly refuses to provide them or to deny senior officials were given information in the course of the Operation indicating the existence of reckless tactics," a spokesman for Issa said Wedneday. In the letter, Cole repeated Holder's previous admissions that "Operation Fast and Furious" was fundamentally flawed as a solution to gun trafficking at the Mexican border. The partisan impasse over potential contempt proceedings against Attorney General Eric Holder continues following a lengthy letter from the deputy attorney general, and a blunt response from the House Oversight Committee chairman. The latest volley started with a 13-page letter from Holder's deputy, James Cole, to committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-California, arguing against contempt. After months of congressional investigations, the Justice Department had acknowledged that its agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, made a serious tactical error in allowing guns to be purchased by straw buyers and then smuggled across the border to drug cartels.
