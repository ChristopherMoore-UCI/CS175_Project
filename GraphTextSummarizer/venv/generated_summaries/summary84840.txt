Victims mostly suffered blows to the head, fractured limbs and internal injuries, said provincial health minister Anibal Gomez. -- Four people died, two are missing and 110 were injured when a tornado struck Thursday afternoon in northern Argentina, near the border with Paraguay, the state-run Telam news agency reported Friday. Pozo del Tigre residents with damaged homes were housed in schools, a church property and a children's park, according to Telam. About 70 to 80 percent of the town of 10,000 people was left without electricity and cell phone service, Telam said. Killed in the tornado were a 1-year-old child, two women ages 19 and 28, and a person 87-years-old, Telam said.
