" Husband of pregnant woman wants her off life support Unknowns about the fetus Machado saw her daughter no more than five hours before she fell unconscious on the kitchen floor at her home. Munoz, 33, has been brain dead since her husband, Erick Munoz, discovered her unconscious at home on November 26, Machado said. We both knew that we both didn't want to be on life support." Even if she had signed such a document, though, Texas law would override her wishes because she is pregnant. "I can't imagine their intent would be for someone so young in pregnancy, at 14 weeks, to have them on life support until mid-May," Machado said. And state law here says you cannot withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient," J.R. Labbe, vice president of communications and community affairs for JPS Health Network, said.
