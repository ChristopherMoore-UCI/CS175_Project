But on the other, we're so wildly inconsistent with airport safety protocol, how could someone look at a "No Snow Globe" sign and not laugh? And if you can answer that, maybe you can explain why we are given plastic knives and forks to eat with in airport restaurants, but metal knives and forks are handed to us in first class? Billions of taxpayer dollars invested to make us safe, and the TSA is on the lookout for big hair. Why bother making them walk through metal detectors at all if they're not going to be fondled or checked for shoe bombs like the rest of us? Over the years, Transportation Security Administration officials have taken away my deodorant, my toothpaste, even my nose hair trimmer in the name of safety.
