Tell us in the comments whether you think salads can count as "man food." Salads offer breathers between manly meals. -- Real men eat salads. Right now, in my fridge, I have five bottles of hot sauce, a jar of Cheez Whiz and half a pack of hot dogs. For those of you who aren't familiar with this gender normative term, "man food" is food that you'd imagine a lumberjack or a cowboy or a Viking would eat.
