That project would almost certainly need to be put on hold; it seems unlikely that Lionsgate would be willing to delay production on "Catching Fire" until after Jennifer Lawrence finished shooting the "X-Men: First Class" sequel next spring, especially since they didn't do it for Ross. Many complained that the weakest part of "Hunger Games" was the romance between Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence, no relation), and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), and the romantic angle is far more front-and-center for "Catching Fire." Miller, by contrast, has practically no first-hand experience with CG-effects-heavy action scenes, and "Catching Fire" features more exotic locations that would likely call for extensive green-screen and effects work. The choice for the replacement of "Hunger Games'" Gary Ross -- who bowed out of the "Catching Fire" gig last week, citing the tight production schedule -- are pretty stark. Lawrence has extensive experience with visual effects-driven action sequences from his first two films, 2005â€²s supernatural thriller "Constantine" and 2007â€²s post-apocalyptic thriller "I Am Legend" -- which shares a similarly bleak tone to "Catching Fire." Multiple reports have surfaced on the web today that filmmakers Francis Lawrence and Bennett Miller are the final two contenders for the director of "The Hunger Games" sequel "Catching Fire."
