Manny Pacquiao is a member of a coalition in the Philippines that is in political opposition to the president and it seems to me as a foreigner, that this is nothing more than a political vendetta. But Arum says the allegations amount to a "political vendetta" against Pacquiao, who is a member of congress in the Philippines, and will be ironed out shortly. "The assessment is based on fights he had in the United States and in every one of those fights -- four fights in the two years in question -- we withheld 30% of the amounts we paid him and paid those amounts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)," Arum explained. " Pacquiao's most immediate focus in the aftermath of his victory over Rios earlier this month has been to defend himself amid accusations that he owes $50 million in unpaid taxes in his home country the Philippines. "Once that credit it given to him they'll find there is no further tax liability in the Philippines.
