Magistrate Judge Stephanie K. Bowman issued the ruling at a detention hearing in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. An Ohio federal judge on Friday ordered Christopher Lee Cornell, charged with planning a bomb-and-shoot attack on the U.S. Capitol, held in jail without bond. An FBI agent said Cornell, 20, planned to set off pipe bombs at the U.S. Capitol to put lawmakers and employees in panicked flight and then gun them down with an assault rifle as they ran across his path and that of an accomplice. Cornell had researched bomb-making instructions and by Wednesday, agents said, had bought two M-15 rifles with 600 rounds of ammunition. Agents said they arrested Cornell on Wednesday before he could put his plot into action.
