-- The day after the biggest murder trial in recent Chinese history, the country's state media ran stories about the defendant, Gu Kailai, the high-powered wife of deposed Chinese politician Bo Xilai, but kept headlines off the front page. Chinese authorities have said that Gu and her son had "conflicts" with Heywood "over economic interests" and that she was motivated to kill the Briton because of fears for her son's safety. Before the allegations in the case came to light, Bo was considered to be a strong contender for entry to the Politburo Standing Committee, the nine-member team that steers Chinese policy. One user on Sina Weibo, the Chinese microblogging site, referred to Bo, the former Communist Party chief of Chongqing, and his wife, Gu as "B&G." The user wrote: "B&G case is under strict censorship in China thus not seen on media, all we can see is the standard CCTV version. " The Shakespearean-like saga involving Gu and Bo has become one of the most sensational Chinese political scandals in recent memory.
