When I think of Fern and Salwa, I remember women who were so courageous that they took on the Sadrists to create women's centers in southern Iraq. And I remember Marla Ruzicka, who traveled in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq to advocate for innocent victims of conflict. She is an inspiration for many of us to continue our work -- to fight for access and demand for humanitarian space and conflict resolution. And it is not limited to the Middle East or ISIS strongholds -- it first came to international attention in Somalia in the late 1990s, and became of true global note in the early 2000s in Iraq and Afghanistan as the blurred lines between civilian, military, aid workers, journalists, security actors and intelligence created a justification for extremist and terror groups to pursue anyone. When I remember Fern Holland and Salwa Oumashi, dear friends of mine who shared my passion for women's rights in the southern governorates of Iraq, I don't remember the gunmen that killed them.
