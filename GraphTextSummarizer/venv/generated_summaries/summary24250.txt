Rossetti: I think the point of my illustrations is to show, in a gentle and nonaggressive way, that there is still a lot of oppressive control over women's personal choices and identities, and expose a problem of representation toward women, people of color, people with disabilities, (LGBT concerns) and so on. The drawings feature images of women and girls with commentary on topics including weight, hair, clothes and sexuality. "I love what you have to say and I think it's commendable that you are so careful with translations and so sensitive to/aware of using positive language." Rosetti's project is one of several that are reimagining how women are seen, and how they see themselves. Rosetti: I think they obviously define how I feel about many things, especially concerning the representation of people. For example, my mother who has white hair, and I think it's gorgeous, but still many people tell her to dye it.
