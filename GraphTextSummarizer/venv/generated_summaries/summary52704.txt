All health insurance plans will now have to cover preventative health care and at least nine other kinds of care, including hospitalization, outpatient care, emergency services, mental health and substance abuse care, maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs, lab tests, rehab, and pediatric care. South Carolina ranks near the bottom in the nation when it comes to access to care and health outcomes, according to the latest edition of America's Health Rankings. And that's good news for health care insurance companies. Young and fit people like Zanardelli, 31, and Foster, 28, have to buy into the system to support the law's mandate that all people must have health insurance next year. Zanardelli and Foster have health insurance now, but it's pricey and "it covers nothing," Zanardelli said.
