In a hilarious duet of "Endless Love," Stefani did the Lionel Richie part and Shelton subbed for Diana Ross. -- It's become a popular segment on his show, and Jimmy Fallon's latest lip-sync battle featured "The Voice" coaches Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton. That was followed by Fallon's version of Ellie Goulding's "Burn," and Stefani ended the round with "Call Me Maybe" by Carly Rae Jepsen. Shelton kicked it off with Taco's '80s hit "Puttin' on the Ritz," including some faux tap dancing. The trio seemed evenly matched until Stefani and Shelton took it to a new level.
