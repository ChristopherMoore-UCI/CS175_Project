It pains me greatly that my country did not learn from Vietnam that it should never again to waste its children on wars of choice, but instead use civilized nonviolent methods of conflict resolution. They want to know about rules of war: "Are there rules about taking pictures with dead bodies?" When I see these pictures, I am not shocked. The idea of having "rules of war" assumes that there is a proper and civilized way to conduct warfare. If we are going to talk about rules of war, it doesn't make sense to start with the soldiers and Marines who have been put into that situation. Instead, if we're going to talk about rules of war, we have to start with the powerful people who chose to put those soldiers there.
