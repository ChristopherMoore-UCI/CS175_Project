According to the report, the 15 council members fall into three categories: those countries that support Palestinian membership, those that can't support it at this time (for whom abstention was envisaged in the event of a vote), and those countries that say the requirements were not met and couldn't vote for recommendation. According to the charter, countries seeking membership must be "peace-loving," "accept the obligations" of the U.N. charter, and "willing and able to carry out" those obligations. The report, written by a special Security Council committee and obtained by CNN, was the result of seven weeks of meetings. It details myriad disagreements between the council members on whether Palestine fulfills the requirements set forth in the U.N. charter for members countries. U.N. diplomats say that the Palestinians' next step may become more clear after that meeting.
