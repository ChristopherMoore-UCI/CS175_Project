-- A federal air marshal was arrested Thursday morning at Nashville International Airport after being caught taking multiple upskirt pictures of female passengers boarding a plane, police said. A witness spotted 28-year-old Adam Bartsch, who was on duty, taking pictures with his cell phone underneath women's dresses, police said. In an e-mail to CNN, Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz said the flight, to Tampa, Florida, was not delayed by the incident. Airport police removed Bartsch from the flight and took him into custody. The witness grabbed Bartsch's phone and notified a Southwest Airlines flight attendant, a police report said.
