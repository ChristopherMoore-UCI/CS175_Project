" Forstall was an influential figure at Apple for years who oversaw the development of the company's mobile operating system and was at one point seen as a possible successor to Steve Jobs. At least one former Apple exec wasn't surprised or sad to hear the news that iOS chief Scott Forstall is leaving the company. "I think Apple is in a great space, it has great products and there are amazing people at the company, and those people actually have a chance to have a firm footing now and continue the legacy Steve left," he said. Several reports since then have suggested that Forstall didn't get along well with some other key players on the team and angered CEO Tim Cook by refusing to apologize for Apple's maps application. Tony Fadell, Apple's former top hardware designer and the man considered to be the brains behind the iPod, told the BBC in a recent interview that Forstall "got what he deserved."
