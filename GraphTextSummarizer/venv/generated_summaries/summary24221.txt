When CNN asked about her motivation to be an incredible performer, she explained: "It is in Chinese blood to always try your best...and no matter what happens today, for example, if your back gives out or your foot is in pain or your toe is bleeding, no matter what happens you always give the audience a perfect show." San Francisco Ballet artistic director, Helgi Tomasson, saw this desire and determination in Tan at an international ballet competition in France and immediately stole her from Stuttgart Ballet in Germany that had offered her a scholarship. Poise, character and determination led to Tan becoming San Francisco Ballet's first Chinese principal dancer. "She wanted me to fulfill her dream," Tan told CNN's Talk Asia. Her mother who had wanted to be a ballerina saw that her daughter's physique, looks and determination fitted perfectly into a ballerina's profile and encouraged Tan to become one. At age 11, Tan began her rigorous training at Shanghai Dance School and graduated four years later.
