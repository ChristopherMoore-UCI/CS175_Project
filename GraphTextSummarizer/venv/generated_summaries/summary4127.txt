Robinson's report, "Hollywood's Race/Ethnicity And Gender-Based Casting: Prospects For A Title VII Lawsuit," found that the majority of roles that do not specify a race or ethnicity are played by white actors, which tends to limit black actors to stereotypical roles. O'Neil claims that Hollywood has improved in its recognition of black actors, but the Academy's failure to nominate 2006's "Dreamgirls" for best picture, for example, is a sign that Oscar voters simply don't understand such films culturally. Although awarding Oscars to 11 black actors is "stingy," O'Neil said, "you have to compare that to the number of quality films that gave good roles to actors." That's the problem, said Russell Robinson, a professor of law at the University of California - Los Angeles, who wrote a 2006 report about unfair race-based casting in Hollywood. In the past, black actors didn't have much of choice when it came to playing stereotypical parts, said John Forbes, executive director of the Black Hollywood Education and Resource Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting films featuring black actors. With the arrival of Poitier to the film industry in the 1950s, Hollywood seemed to change its perspective of black actors.
