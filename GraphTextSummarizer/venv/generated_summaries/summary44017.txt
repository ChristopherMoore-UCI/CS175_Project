-- Sandy Hook Elementary School shooter Adam Lanza may have called a radio show nearly a year before his rampage, drawing parallels between a Connecticut chimpanzee that mauled a woman in 2009 and a "teenage mall shooter or something like that," according to a report published Thursday in the New York Daily News. CNN cannot confirm that the recorded voice is Lanza's, but if it is his, it could provide previously unknown insight into the mind of the 20-year-old, who killed 26 people at the Newtown, Connecticut, school before killing himself as police closed in. Criminologist Casey Jordan, a professor of justice and law administration at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, said she sees parallels between this call and Lanza's later rampage. "This is (him) saying, 'Hey listen, there is going to be another shooting, there is going to be another outbreak of violence,'" clinical psychologist Jeff Gardere told CNN, assuming the voice is that of Lanza. While saying such conversation on a program called AnarchyRadio might not stand to most, Gardere said psychologists like himself might spot "red flags" like the caller's "very robotic" and controlled voice and his referring to "society" and "humans acting out, not to mention the mention of mall shootings.
