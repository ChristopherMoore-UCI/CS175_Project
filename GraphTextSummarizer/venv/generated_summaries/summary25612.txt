Lisa Oz, 48, has a major career in her own right, having authored three best-selling books, including "Us: Transforming Ourselves and the Relationships that Matter Most." Dr. Oz sees that book as partly directed at him. I met Dr. Oz in 2003 as his first guest on 'Second Opinion' -- a medical series he and his wife, Lisa, created for the Discovery Channel. "As we toast to a new year and encourage readers to take the first step toward a happier, healthier life, who better to help us get on the right path than my dear friend and America's doctor, Dr. Oz." And while America's doctor may have a great bedside manner, the cover interview reveals it's the pillow talk with his own wife that needs some work. I adore Dr. Oz," Oprah Winfrey tells PEOPLE exclusively. In another Oprah first, the media mogul has chosen a man to join her on the cover of her "O" magazine: Dr. Mehmet Oz.
