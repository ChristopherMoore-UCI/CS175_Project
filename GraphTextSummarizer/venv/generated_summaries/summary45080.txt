Davos works best in two very clear situations: When there is a full-scale raging fire, and the big economic players come together and thrash it out (the Middle East, the Great Recession, and the eurozone crises spring to mind); or when serious tectonic shifts are going on in economies and societies. What this theme recognizes is that during five years of crises massive changes have taken place simultaneously: The ubiquitous Internet has forged its way into previously closed societies; social media has exploded; there has been a revolution in communication; new, powerful economies have emerged; and there has been a fundamental shift in economic power towards the east. They must then question the role of government, social media, traditional media, and business in all of this. The question is whether the people coming to Davos can set their own little agendas aside for a few days, sit down, and really think about the kind of world we are facing now that the long overdue recovery is taking hold. In a further break from tradition, it may also actually make sense (assuming one can boil it down to useable English!).
