-- A prominent Muslim civil liberties group held a small rally Friday outside New York police headquarters, continuing its call for the resignation of Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and other reforms within the department. " Muslim activists say "The Third Jihad," a documentary about radical Islam, vilifies the American-Muslim community and teaches police officers to suspect Muslims as terrorists. "They were not telling the truth about their involvement in the propaganda film against Muslims," said Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, adding that New York "deserves people they trust who do not discriminate against people. In a statement released last week, Kelly acknowledged that he had been interviewed for the film five years ago by a filmmaker and, "while it never became part of the department's curriculum, and was not authorized for any training," the film had been screened "for an extended period in 2010" in a room where officers were on break from training. The Council on American-Islamic Relations wants Kelly to step down because of his participation in a film that they say paints all Muslims as terrorists.
