-- Four people, including two children, were killed after a reservoir broke and flooded three villages in western Hungary with toxic red mud, officials said Tuesday. At least a million cubic meters of red mud have spilled so far, the government said, affecting the villages of Kolontar, Devecser and Somlovasarhely. The reservoir burst in the town of Kolontar on Monday afternoon, the government said Tuesday. The toxic sludge -- a waste product from aluminum production -- could potentially endanger two major rivers, the Danube and the Raba, the government said. The government has declared a state of emergency in three counties, the State Secretariat of Governmental Communications said.
