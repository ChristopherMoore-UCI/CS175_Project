-- South Africa fought back after Sachin Tendulkar's 99th international century to claim an unlikely three-wicket win over World Cup co-hosts India Saturday. Jacques Kallis, Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers all scored half centuries to keep them in the hunt before Faf du Plessis and JP Duminy plundered late runs. Meanwhile, England off-spinner Graeme Swann has been fined 10 per cent of his match fee for his conduct in his side's shock World Cup defeat to Bangladesh Friday. But 13 were still needed off the final over by seamer Ashish Nehra with Robin Peterson on strike and du Plessis at the other end. Tendulkar has scored 48 one-day international tons to add to his record 51 Test match centuries.
