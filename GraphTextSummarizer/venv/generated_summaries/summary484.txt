Yeganeh, who first opened his shop in 1984, closed the store six years ago, but kept the lease to pursue franchise opportunities and a line of frozen soups with the Original SoupMan brand. Yeganeh and his Soup Kitchen International first rose to fame after he was caricatured in the long-running NBC-TV show "Seinfeld" as the "Soup Nazi," a cranky and demanding soup-stand cook who bellowed "No soup for you!" And I can't wait for that first bowl of soup," said Packer, who chose chicken vegetable. Seinfeld, whose title character was banned during the "Soup Nazi" episode, declined to comment on the store's reopening. According to the "Seinfeld" Web site, Yeganeh was at first unhappy with the publicity from the "Soup Nazi" episode and was quoted as saying he threatened to "smack" comedian Jerry Seinfeld's face.
