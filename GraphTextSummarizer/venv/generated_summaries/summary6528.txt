"Our reality is that we have large crops, large parcels of crops," said Cesar Aquino, the head of Paraguay's antidrug agency. Paraguay produces more than half of the 10,000 metric tons marijuana grown in all of South America, the United Nations says. In South America, Paraguay ( 5,900 metric tons) easily outproduced Colombia, Brazil, the Caribbean region (notably St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Jamaica) and Central America (notably Guatemala), the World Drug Report said. While reports of the war on drugs in Mexico are common and well-documented, the fact that tiny, landlocked Paraguay is No. 2 in the world may surprise some. And two of those countries -- Brazil and Argentina -- report an increase in marijuana use due to the ready availability of the crop coming from Paraguay.
