In addition to the cancellations of long haul flights -- flights involving long distances, such as international ones -- Air France said more than a quarter of its remaining scheduled flights are not expected to get off the ground Tuesday. -- Passengers traveling on Air France may face more delays as the airline prepares to cancel more flights due to a strike by aviation workers, a statement on the airline's website said Tuesday. " Beatrice Lestic, a general coordinator for the transportation unions in France, said that 60% of pilots were on strike Tuesday, and she expects the number to increase Wednesday. Lestic says Air France employees are against proposed legislation that would require workers to provide a 48-hour notice before they strike. Workers, including pilots and flight attendants, have called for a four-day strike to protest a draft law that they say will curtail their right to strike.
