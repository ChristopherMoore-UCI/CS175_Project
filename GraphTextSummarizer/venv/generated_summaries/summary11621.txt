Last year Froome finished second to Team Sky teammate Bradley Wiggins as he became the first British rider to win overall honors in the famous three-week race. His Australian teammate Richie Porte is also tipped to fulfill the major supporting role that Froome himself played for Wiggins last year. -- If the Tour de France founder Henri Desgrange could have magically transported himself forward to the100th edition and discovered that the hot favorite was Kenyan-born Briton Chris Froome, with not a French contender in sight, then he might have abandoned the idea altogether. Mapping Le Tour, published in conjunction with the centenary race, chronicles the history of the race in images and route maps of each year, plus a stage-by-stage preview of the 2013 edition. Despite a raft of doping scandals -- this year's Tour is the first since Lance Armstrong confessed to cheating and was stripped of his seven titles -- and the tragic deaths of leading riders such as Tommy Simpson and Fabio Casartelli -- its popularity as the greatest free sporting spectacle in the world has endured.
