Climate change is a chance for all of us to add a chapter to the story of American triumph and human progress. Some leaders who stand up to meet the challenge may fall, but they can be sure that their sacrifice will light the world with more energy, more mobility and more freedom and ensure a healthier planet. We share an unwavering belief that the United States must lead the world on climate change and seize opportunities for unity, growth and progress. The other will receive this award in recognition of the stand he took when he broke with his party and sacrificed his political career to support responsible action to combat climate change. Our knowledge of the causes and dangers of climate change has increased even as our ignorance of its ramifications has unfolded.
