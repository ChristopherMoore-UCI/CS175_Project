For example, political quotas that seek to increase the percentage of women candidates in elections also need to make sure that women and men's names on candidate lists are randomly distributed -- otherwise the traditional "minority" -- women -- end up at the bottom. After more women came in through the quota, they started allocating funds to things that mattered more to women, like drinking water. Mandatory quotas have to be put in place to get more women into business and politics. But over time a wider variety of women moved into these roles, as companies learned how to expand their search for female candidates. But a 30% quota to tap into the full pool of women engineering graduates can lead to measures that address short-term recruiting as well as understand and root out longer term barriers, setting up the path towards parity.
