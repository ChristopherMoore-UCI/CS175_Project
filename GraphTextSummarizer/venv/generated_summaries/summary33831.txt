Suu Kyi, 66, won by a landslide the last time Myanmar held multiparty elections, in 1990, but the junta ignored the results and placed her under house arrest. -- Opposition leader and Nobel peace prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi won a seat in Myanmar's parliament Sunday, her party said, a momentous victory following a decades-long fight for democracy. Released in November 2010, Suu Kyi was allowed to crisscross the country to rally support for the NLD for Sunday's race. Others said the number of seats won by the NLD is less critical than what the vote says about Myanmar's future. Sunday, Win, the NLD spokesman, said the party had received more than 50 reports of voting irregularities.
