The decision came during a two-day IOC Executive Board meeting in Berlin, at which board members also decided to propose golf and rugby for inclusion in the 2016 Olympic Games. "They have global appeal, a geographically diverse line-up of top iconic athletes and an ethic that stresses fair play." Softball and baseball were considered for inclusion in the 2016 Games along with squash, karate, roller sports, golf and rugby, but the board decided to consider only the last two. "I can only rejoice about the decision of inclusion of women's boxing," IOC President Jacques Rogge told reporters. When the IOC dropped baseball and softball from the 2012 Olympic program several years ago, it said it would consider adding new sports that had a clean reputation and a wide appeal.
