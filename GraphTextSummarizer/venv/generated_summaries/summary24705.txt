" Gangidine campaigns in her swing state for the president pretty much nonstop, but she paused long enough to post a photo of the starry-eyed creature -- known as The Bird, H.R.H. (Her Royal Highness) -- on the Pet Lovers for Obama Facebook page. A dog named Teddy Roosevelt abandoned his namesake's political party to wear a navy Obama shirt. -- Tina Gangidine is so passionate about President Barack Obama, even her pet lovebird campaigned for him. But this virtual campaign by Obama for America to encourage people to "like" its Facebook page, post photos of their pets and recruit friends is taking the presidential love of pets to a whole new level. It got more "likes" and thoughtful comments than almost anything else she's ever posted, and that includes the Twitter feed and Facebook pages she runs for her neighborhood's Obama campaign.
