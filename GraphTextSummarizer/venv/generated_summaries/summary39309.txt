At some point during a planned two-month canoe trek in the Lake Matagami area, a bear attacked Lavoie's campsite, eating his food and ruining his equipment, police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe said. Rescuers in a helicopter finally spotted Lavoie on Wednesday, but they could not safely land at that spot, Coulombe said. It was Lavoie's German shepherd who scared the bear away on the day of the attack, but the dog did not survive the ordeal, McInnis said. -- If Marco Lavoie had not been rescued when he was, the Quebec man probably would have perished within 48 hours. Had he spent another day or two in the elements, he would have starved to death, police spokesman Ronald McInnis said.
