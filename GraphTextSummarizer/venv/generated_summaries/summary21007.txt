Matthew Cordle, 22, appeared in a Columbus, Ohio as he told Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge David Fais that he wanted to change his original plea, entered on September 11, from not guilty to guilty. Cordle made headlines after a video was posted to YouTube on September 3 in which he confessed to driving while drunk and killing 61-year-old Vincent Canzani. Canzani was driving a Jeep when he was struck by a wrong-way driver on Interstate 670 near Columbus, according to the Columbus Dispatch. In the video, he promised he would plead guilty and "take full responsibility for everything I've done to Vincent and his family." Cordle also told Fais that he has not drunk alcohol since the night of the accident, and he attended a two-week alcohol rehabilitation program.
