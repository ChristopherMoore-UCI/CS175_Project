-- A court in Pakistan has banned former President Pervez Musharraf from politics for life. Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. The first relates to claims he did not do enough to protect the life of Benazir Bhutto -- the first woman to be elected prime minister of Pakistan -- before she was assassinated in 2007, weeks before an election in which she hoped to return to office. Musharraf is also accused of ordering his troops to kill Nawab Akbar Bugti, a popular tribal leader, in the volatile province of Balochistan, in 2006. Musharraf can pursue an appeal in the Peshawar court or take it to the country's Supreme Court.
