Several FFDOs contacted by CNN said DHS has made getting recurrent training onerous for pilots, limiting the number and sizes of classes. Pilots also must pay for their own hotels and food during training -- "our own time and our own dime," said one pilot -- placing a further burden on them. FFDOs are commercial pilots who volunteer to undergo training so they can carry weapons to protect their aircraft. Karn said the budget for the program has not increased since 2003, effectively capping the number of armed pilots. They undergo initial training at federal law enforcement training academies and must re-qualify with firearms every six months, and undergo a two-day recurrent training every three to five years.
