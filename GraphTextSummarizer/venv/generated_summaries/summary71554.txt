" Obama's Africa visit Obama left the United States on Wednesday for a trip to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania -- his second visit to sub-Saharan Africa since taking office. -- U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday called on countries throughout the world to decriminalize homosexuality, a day after the U.S. Supreme Court handed a major victory to proponents of same-sex marriage. Every group of people has a right to its own views, Obama said, and that diversity should be respected, "but when it comes to how the state treats people -- how the law treats people -- I believe that everybody has to be treated equal." "Regardless of race, regardless of religion, regardless of gender, regardless of sexual orientation ... people should be treated equally, and that's a principle that I think applies universally," Obama said. He had read Mandela's writings and speeches, and understood "that this was somebody who believed in that basic principle I just talked about -- treating people equally -- and was willing to sacrifice his life for that belief." Mandela "is a personal hero" and "a hero for the world," Obama said.
