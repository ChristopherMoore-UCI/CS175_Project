Parents should be heavily advised to keep guns out of their houses and out of the hands of kids. In too many neighborhoods in America -- not just in big cities -- parents who don't allow guns in their homes are apprehensive, even frightened, by their kids playing at homes where they are kept. But just as clearly, we need to change our culture of guns. Citizens have a right to bear arms, but guns are dangerous, too. They are far too popular among people who shouldn't have access to guns in the first place.
