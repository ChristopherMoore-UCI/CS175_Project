First Air flight 6560 was lost about 12:40 p.m. Saturday, about 10 minutes after its last reported communication with controllers, the airline reported. The jet, operated by Ontario-based carrier First Air, went down about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the airport on Saturday, First Air Vice President Chris Ferris told reporters Sunday. Boeing offered its "deepest sympathies" to the families of the victims and said Canadian investigators have asked it to provide technical assistance for the investigation. His voice cracked as he thanked Canadian troops for assisting in rescue efforts. "The Transportation Safety Board is conducting an investigation, and First Air is cooperating fully."
