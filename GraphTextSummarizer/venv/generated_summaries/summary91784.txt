-- Republican Joni Ernst has won the race for Iowa's U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin, defeating Democratic challenger Bruce Braley, according to a CNN projection. At the same debate, Braley argued Ernst would side with the far right wing of the GOP Congress. Ernst was a little-known Iowa state senator when she burst on the national political scene during the GOP primary, declaring in a TV ad that if elected she would cut pork spending in Washington the way she castrated pigs growing up on an Iowa farm. He described Grassley, who is in line to chair the Judiciary Committee if the GOP takes over the Senate, "as a farmer from Iowa who never went to law school." The popular Harkin campaigned for Braley but couldn't make up for several gaffes and missteps the four-term lawmaker made during the campaign that surprised and disappointed his supporters in Iowa and Washington.
