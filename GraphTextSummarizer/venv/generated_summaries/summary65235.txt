" Overnight leader Graeme McDowell, who had been at the head of affairs since the first day, saw his chances disappear with a final round 73 to end in a tie for third with American Rickie Fowler and Hiroshi Iwata of Japan. U.S. Open champion Martin Kaymer was another in the mix, but he found the water on the 18th with his second shot and made a double bogey seven to finish in a tie for sixth on eight under with England's Ian Poulter and Thorbjorn Olesen of Norway. A pumped up Watson was not to be denied and a 20-foot birdie putt was enough for him to secure his seventh career victory and third of 2014, including the Masters at Augusta. "It was such a tough bunker shot you are not really thinking about making it, but I told my caddie it's been a wild day, a wild couple of holes, but if we can make this it changes everything and it went in like a putt. -- Bubba Watson secured his first World Golf Championship title and first win outside of the United States Sunday --
