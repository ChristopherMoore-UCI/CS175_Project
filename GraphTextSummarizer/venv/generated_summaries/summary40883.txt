Just maybe all the debates about the ugly side of football -- concussions, brain injuries, depression and suicides-- have done some good, after all. At a time of year when most football fans are consumed by trade rumors and free agency moves, several other high-profile players have decided to hang up their cleats. Unlike Willis, Worilds hadn't been plagued by injuries, at least not yet. " His teammate, Pro Bowl linebacker Patrick Willis, made the decision to walk away last week, and you can't help but think his decision might have influenced Borland. And while many sports fans are in shock that any guy lucky enough to play in the NFL would just walk away from fame and wealth, it sounds to me like Willis has his priorities right.
