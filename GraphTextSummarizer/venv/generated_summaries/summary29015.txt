While South African meats could boost customer satisfaction in restaurants and food businesses, Tomazos says the key to success in the UAE is adapting. "With trade growth of an average of 22% year to year from 2009, and actually, in 2013 to 2014, we recorded an increase of 37%." And it's not just South African businesses operating from the region. Demand for South African food is booming in an unlikely place: the United Arab Emirates. "It's a very exciting region to be in and to showcase your brands," says South African owner Johnny Tomazos. Popular South African burger chain Steers is also setting up shop in the region, offering burgers on the manmade Yas Island -- a popular location for tourists and thrill-seekers.
