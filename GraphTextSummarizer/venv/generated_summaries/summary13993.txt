It was Hoylake's first British Open for 39 years and a lot graft had gone into making this, the second oldest golf course in England, fit to stage it. After record crowds made the pilgrimage to this corner of the Wirral Peninsula in 2006 to watch Hoylake's first major for 39 years, it was stamped as "The People's Open." Just 142,036 were present at Muirfield in Scotland last year, an undoubtedly beautiful golf course but one that elicits a different pitch to Hoylake. At 22 this is Mark Budd's third Open championship but his first visit to Hoylake. True Tiger Woods complained about fans' use of mobile phones during his first round, but perhaps that could be attributed to thousands of people's enthusiasm to see the man who took the title eight years ago.
