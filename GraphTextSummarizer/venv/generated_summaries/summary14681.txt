Here are six things to know to get up to speed on the case: On August 9, 18-year-old Michael Brown and his friend Dorian Johnson were walking in the middle of a residential street when a white officer, Darren Wilson, pulled up and told them to get out of the road. By contrast, a Wilson family friend identified as "Josie" told local radio station KTFK that Brown started a physical altercation with the officer. Only on a few nights has the situation turned violent, with some protesters hurling bottles or rocks at officers while police, dressed in riot gear, threw tear gas canisters. But that doesn't explain why Wilson continued shooting, including at least one shot to Brown's head. "Michael just bum rushes him, and just shoves him back into his car, punches him in the face and then of course Darren grabs for his gun and Michael grabs the gun," Josie said.
