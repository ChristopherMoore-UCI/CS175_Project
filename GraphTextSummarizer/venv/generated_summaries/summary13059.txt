From the end of last year, it's been tempting passengers with lower fares, sacrificing profit per seat for "bums on seats. This is by far the biggest crisis the industry has ever faced," BA chief executive Willie Walsh told CNN's Richard Quest. Walsh said British Airways' woes were inextricably linked to the downturn in the global economy and that there had been no sign of any "green shoots" of recovery. Walsh said the tough trading conditions hadn't killed off its plans for a merger with Spanish airline Iberia. BA's premium passenger numbers fell 13 percent in the second half of last year, in line with the industry average.
