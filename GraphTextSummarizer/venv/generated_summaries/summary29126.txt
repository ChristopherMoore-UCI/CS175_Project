-- Sudan threatened to withdraw from peace talks with rebels in the western Darfur region unless an agreement was struck by Thursday. Al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in the western Darfur region, said he would not deal with rebels bearing arms after the talks ended in Doha, Qatar. "If we reach an agreement tomorrow then God be praised but if we don't then we will withdraw our negotiating team," President Omar al-Bashir said at a rally Wednesday in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state. The Darfur conflict is separate from the North-South divide, but independence for the South could help embolden rebels in Darfur. "These (rebel) movements are enjoying the negotiation process and their residency in foreign hotels while the people of Darfur are suffering the flames of war," al-Bashir said.
