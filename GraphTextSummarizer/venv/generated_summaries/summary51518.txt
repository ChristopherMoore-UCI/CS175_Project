Juan Mata netted the only goal in the 86th minute before the game erupted from its previous lethargy as United defender Rafael da Silva was sent off for kicking out at fellow Brazilian David Luiz. -- Manchester United's post-title hangover continued on Sunday after a 1-0 defeat that kept Chelsea in pole position for England's third Champions League place next season. "If we can win we will be there, but Tottenham are a good team and it will be a final for the top four," said manager Rafael Benitez, who has guided Chelsea to two wins over United since taking charge in December. It was United's first red card this season, and means Rafael will miss the rest of the Premier League campaign with an automatic three-game ban. Everton's chances of playing in Europe's second-tier tournament next season suffered a blow in Sunday's 0-0 draw with Merseyside rivals Liverpool.
