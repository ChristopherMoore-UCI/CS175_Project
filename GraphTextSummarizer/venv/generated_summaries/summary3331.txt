The alleged crime occurred in Mosman, a wealthy suburb about eight kilometers (five miles) from Sydney where many well-connected people, sports stars and celebrities live, resident and Australian news reporter Dave Kirwan told CNN. "The offender in this matter has been identified, and it's been confirmed that he traveled to the United States," New South Wales police commissioner Andrew Scipione told reporters. Australian police did not name the man arrested, noting that he hasn't been formally charged. "The information that I have is that the suspect was surprised" to be arrested, said Assistant Commissioner David Hudson. -- A 50-year-old man accused of strapping a suspected explosive device around the neck of an 18-year-old woman near Sydney, Australia, earlier this month was arrested Monday more than 9,000 miles away, Australian law enforcement officials said.
