There are a number of events in and around Anchorage leading up to the Iditarod start, such as the Mushers' Banquet, various Iditarod educational seminars featuring mushers and race officials, and even a competing annual festival and parade in Anchorage, the Fur Rondy. On the first Saturday of March, thousands of Iditarod enthusiasts line Anchorage's historic Fourth Avenue to participate in the celebratory send-off. This year, Iditarod spectators had to brave near-record snowfall in Anchorage just to get a glimpse of their favorite teams -- howling at top of their lungs in anxious anticipation of their turn at the starting point. Following a Saturday ceremonial start, mushers quickly regroup their dog teams and reorganize trail necessities for the following day's "official start" of the race in Willow, Alaska, 79 miles north of Anchorage. Dubbed the "Last Great Race" by organizers, the Iditarod sled dog trail in Alaska is legendary.
