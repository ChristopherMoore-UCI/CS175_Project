Paul could rock GOP race in Iowa Fox News anchor Bret Baier kicked off the second hour of debate by asking Paul if his non-interventionist position toward Iran means that if he got the nomination he'd be running to the left of President Obama. If Iowa voters were impressed by Perry's performance, his rapid improvement as a debater may just come in time to make a difference on January 3. Most recently, Romney's campaign sent Iowa Republicans a mailer featuring a half-page picture of Gingrich seated next to liberal Democrat Nancy Pelosi. But if Bachmann still feels the need to proclaim her seriousness at this point in the race, Iowa voters may have similar concerns. She had the sharpest attack lines of the night against frontrunner Gingrich: "You don't need to be within the technical definition of being a lobbyist to still be influence-peddling with senior Republicans in Washington, D.C., to get them to do your bidding."
