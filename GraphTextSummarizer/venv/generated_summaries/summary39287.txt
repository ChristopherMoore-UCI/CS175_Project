"I am 60 years old and I gave a lot to this country, but this tough situation is like a message asking me to leave my country," said Kiyour Kizarab, the male head of a Christian family whose house was targeted Thursday in central Baghdad. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Baghdad and Mosul Christians have headed to other destinations in Iraq, including the Kurdish region and the Nineveh Plains, which have a strong Christian presence. There were two explosions in the east, in New Baghdad; two in Yarmouk; six in the central Baghdad district of Karrada; two in the southern region of Dora; and one each in al-Saydia and Al-Ameriya, the official said. The assaults mirrored the early-morning bombings of Christian homes in Baghdad on November 10. One of the deadliest attacks came October 31, when militants stormed the Sayidat al-Nejat Cathedral, or Our Lady of Salvation Church, in Baghdad.
