-- A hostage-taking incident in Toulouse, France, ended with shots fired, the gunman wounded and the last two remaining hostages freed, police union spokesman Christophe Crepin said Wednesday. The incident ended after the man emerged from the bank with a hostage and attempted to shoot police officers, Crepin said.

In March, police cornered Mohammed Merah, who was wanted in the killing of seven people. He has two injuries -- one in the left hand and the other in the right thigh -- which, Valet said, indicate that police sought to neutralize him to protect the hostages, rather than trying to kill him.
