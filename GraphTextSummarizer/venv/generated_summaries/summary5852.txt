"While we support other systems, we think it's best for Android users and developers to stick with Android's existing ratings." Apple, too, has outlined its app review guidelines in extensive detail, but has not publicly commented on the CTIA app rating issue. In the Android Market, Google assigns content ratings that range from "Everyone" to "Low Maturity" to "High Maturity," but provides no details on the specific content that inspired its ratings. The ratings, which would be controlled by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (which also controls computer and videogame maturity ratings) would range from "Everyone" to "Adults Only." The CTIA's guidelines aim to score smartphone and tablet apps on a five-point scale based on their violence and sexual content. In an effort to streamline and simplify the maturity ratings of software in mobile app stores, CTIA, the international wireless industry association, yesterday proposed a ratings system that store owners could voluntarily adopt.
