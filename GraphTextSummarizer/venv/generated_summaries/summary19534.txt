Based in Udaipur, Animal Aid Unlimited is home to a number of dogs, cows, donkeys and pigs. Claire Abrams from the animal welfare group, Animal Aid Unlimited, says staff from the charity rushed to the scene in the city of Udaipur, Rajasthan, after receiving a phone call from a passerby. The charity provides emergency assistance and shelter to street animals, responding to calls made to their dedicated helpline. The rescuers spent hours massaging a large amount of vegetable oil into his body to loosen the tar, avoiding the use of kerosene because of its harsh effects on skin. A five-month-old dog that fell into hot tar spilled around a construction site in northern India was eventually saved by a four-hour rescue operation.
