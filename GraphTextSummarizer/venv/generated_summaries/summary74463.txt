Adele, who's already won two Grammys, is nominated for six new awards, including for record of the year, song of the year and best short form music video for "Rolling In The Deep;" album of the year and best pop vocal album for 21; and best pop solo performance for "Someone Like You. " Along with a "welcome back" to Adele, the 54th annual Grammys will include a "goodbye" performance by singer Glen Campbell. -- Adele's vocal cords have healed from surgery in November, allowing the 23-year-old British songstress to perform on the Grammys stage next month, she and the Recording Academy confirmed Tuesday. "I'm immensely proud to have been asked to perform at this year's Grammy Awards," Adele said in the official news release. Campbell, 75, launched his "Goodbye Tour" last year after revealing he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.
