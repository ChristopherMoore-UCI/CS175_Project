Schumacher has had two operations to relieve pressure on his brain and to remove haematomas at Grenoble Hospital, France. " His friend and fellow racing driver, Felipe Massa, says he is optimistic Schumacher will recover after visiting him in hospital last month. The 32-year-old, who won eight grands prix with Ferrari, came agonizingly close to winning the drivers' title in 2008 only to be defeated by Lewis Hamilton in the final race. " Schumacher, who won five consecutive titles with Ferrari between 2000-04, also claimed two drivers' championships at Benetton in 1994 and 1995. Formula One legend Michael Schumacher remains in a medically induced coma, according to his agent, while one of his former teammates is "praying" for his recovery.
