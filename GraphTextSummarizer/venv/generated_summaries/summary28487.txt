-- An Egyptian court ordered authorities Tuesday to destroy tunnels between the country and Gaza -- the latest sign of a crackdown on underground smuggling networks. "The weapons that are smuggled to Gaza are mostly Grad missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, and recently during the Libyan revolution, advanced shoulder-held anti-tank missiles came through," Menai said. " Ibrahim Menai, who reportedly owns several of the smuggling tunnels that connect Sinai with Gaza, said Bedouin smugglers got weapons from Sudan by sea on small fishing boats and by land through rugged mountain terrain. There are hundreds of underground tunnels -- big and small -- in the vast Sinai Desert area. In December, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called on Egypt to crack down on arms smuggling through the tunnels, saying they were being used to send weapons from Libya and Sudan to militants in Gaza.
