Having fled Iran following the June demonstrations, Valadbaygi set up the site in November -- his latest attempt to beat what he says are government hackers and offer news and views about the unrest in Iran. With international media operating under restrictions in Iran, independent journalists using blogs and social networking sites have become an important source of information. Valadbaygi, who says he was expelled in 2008 from Amirkabir University in Tehran because of his political views, took part in the June protests and distributed underground newspapers as an independent demonstrator, rather than a supporter of opposition leader Mir Hossein Moussavi. -- From a small apartment in Toronto, Iranian exile Saeed Valadbaygi is trying to bring news from his country to the world. During the deadly street demonstrations in Tehran on December 27, Valadbaygi said his web site had 17 million hits in two days.
