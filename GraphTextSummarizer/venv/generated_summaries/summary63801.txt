"Oyster" is a throwback to old-time variety shows, and in it, Shore plays the emcee and straight man trying to corral wildcards like Andy Dick and Tom Green during the AVN Awards weekend in Las Vegas. Former Charlie Sheen goddess Bree Olson, Ron Jeremy, Dave Navarro, Bobby Lee and Amber Lancaster also make appearances. Plus, I like having different girlfriends in different places that I travel." If Shore, 43, were to settle down, he says a Sharon Osbourne type is his ideal. From an early age, Shore was around lady-loving, hard-partying legends like Sam Kinison and Richard Pryor. His latest project is a comedy special, "Vegas is My Oyster," airing on Showtime now.
