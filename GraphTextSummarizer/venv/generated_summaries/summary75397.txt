In fact, an October 2013 warrant for Dos Santos' arrest was issued as part of an investigation into French citizens who had gone to Syria to take part in ISIS jihad there, the prosecutor's office said. The Paris prosecutor's office on Wednesday identified Mickael Dos Santos, a convert to Islam from the Paris suburb of Champigny-sur-Marne who was well-known to French anti-terror authorities before the ISIS video release. Not one, but two French citizens have been connected to beheadings in a recent ISIS video, both of them 22-year-old men who went to Syria to join the group, authorities said Wednesday. The ranks of ISIS -- the extremist group calling itself the Islamic State that's taken over vast swaths of Syria and Iraq -- have swelled with volunteers coming from outside the region, including from the West. Last week, a United Nations panel stated what many consider obvious:  ISIS has committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria.
