-- Forensic experts exhumed the remains of former Chilean President Salvador Allende on Monday as part of an investigation into whether he killed himself or was assassinated during a 1973 military coup, the medical branch of the country's Justice Ministry said. At a nearby laboratory, an international team of experts in archaeology, anthropology, forensics, pathology and ballistics had already begun taking X-ray images of the remains Monday morning, Chile's Legal Medical Service said in a statement. Politicians stood solemnly beside the Allende family's crypt at a Santiago cemetery Monday as investigators wearing white gloves carried his remains in a flag-draped casket, images from CNN Chile showed. Allende's daughter, Sen. Isabel Allende, told CNN Chile her family believed the official account of what caused her father's death. A statement posted on her website Monday said the family was "reaffirming what we have said all these years, our conviction is that President Allende made the decision to die ... in defense of the mandate that was given to him by the people.
