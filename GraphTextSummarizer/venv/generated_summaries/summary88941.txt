Attorney Geoffrey Fieger told reporters that he retained Macomb County Medical Examiner Daniel Spitz to conduct his own investigation. He said the report disproves a claim by police that there had been a tussle between officers and the girl's grandmother, Mertilla Jones, inside their house. Fieger has sued the city on behalf of Jones' family, saying that police need to be held accountable. Fieger said Spitz's findings were contradictory to the official Wayne County medical examiner's report that the bullet struck the child in the neck. Fieger showed reporters a computer-generated diagram of the shooting, based on Spitz's medical report and a video that Fieger said he has seen.
