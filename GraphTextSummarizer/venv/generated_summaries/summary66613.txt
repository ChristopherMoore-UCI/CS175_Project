-- Journalist Michael Hastings, known for his 2010 profile of Gen. Stanley McChrystal that led to the officer's abrupt retirement, died in a car accident in Los Angeles on Tuesday. "Michael was a great, fearless journalist with an incredible instinct for the story, and a gift for finding ways to make his readers care about anything he covered from wars to politicians," BuzzFeed Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith said in a statement. In his profile, Hastings quoted McChrystal and his staff criticizing and mocking key administration officials. Hastings wrote that an unnamed aide to McChrystal mocked Vice President Joe Biden. "He wrote stories that would otherwise have gone unwritten, and without him there are great stories that will go untold." Hastings was also a contributor to Rolling Stone, and it was his profile in that magazine about McChrystal that led to the the general leaving his position.
