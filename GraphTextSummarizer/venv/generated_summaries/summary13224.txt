Much of Nixon's tapes about Watergate have long been made public, but on Thursday, the library released additional White House recordings from February 1973 to March 1973, plus some from early April 1973, director Timothy Naftali said. One memo is written January 17, 1973, by current anchor and former Nixon aide Diane Sawyer, who says she understands that a decision is forthcoming on the "fate" of Donald Johnson as administrator of Veterans Affairs (now Veterans Administration). About 2,500 pages of formerly classified national security records have also been made public, and some of them have been posted on the library's website (www.nixonlibrary.gov), including one about covert actions in Chile and another about an understanding with British Prime Minister Edward Heath on the use of British bases and U.S. nuclear weapons. The latest release of White House tapes from the Richard Nixon Presidential Library shows how Watergate increasingly consumed Nixon as his second term was getting underway, the library's director said Thursday. "Watergate is truly heating up for the administration by the end of this particular release of tapes, in March of 1973, and you can see it taking more of the president's time," said Naftali, who was a Cold War and presidential historian before joining the National Archives, which runs the Nixon library.
