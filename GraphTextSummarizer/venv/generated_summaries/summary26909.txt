" Another affirmation comes from Salinger scholar Kenneth Slawenski, author of "J.D. Salinger: A Life," who talked with BuzzFeed. "While I do quibble with the ethics (or lack of ethics) in posting the Salinger stories, they look to be true transcripts of the originals and match my own copies," Slawenski told BuzzFeed in an e-mail. "I've never read "The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls": It's part of a collection of Salinger material at the Princeton University library and available only to scholars who are supervised as they read," he said in the online edition of the paper. -- Literary circles were abuzz after three previously unpublished short stories by American author J.D. Salinger showed up on the Internet this week. " But several reports point to a September auction on eBay of "Three Stories UNPUBLISHED JD Salinger (catcher in the rye) First Edition" which went for about $110, as the source of the online material.
