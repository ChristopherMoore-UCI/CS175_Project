City drew level on points with table toppers Chelsea, who will be eager to put daylight between themselves and the defending champions against Stoke City, Monday. The Spaniard broke the deadlock for City -- who are missing key strikers Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko --when his shot deflected off Scott Dan and past Palace keeper Julian Peroni. "I'm very frustrated," summed up Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, whose side are third in the table and seven points off the leaders. Their north of England neighbors and rivals, Manchester United, had to settle for a point from their away trip to Aston Villa. United had been on a six-match winning streak and would have expected more from their trip to Villa Park where they had not lost in 18 matches.
