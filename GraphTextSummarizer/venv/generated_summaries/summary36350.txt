Richard Percy Jones, known in film and television as Dick Jones, was 87. In addition to voicing the script, Jones also wore a puppet costume and acted out scenes to help Disney animators draw the cartoon. Disney Studios named Jones a "Disney Legend" in 2000 in recognition of his work on the iconic film. Cowboy film legend Hoot Gibson discovered the child while appearing in a rodeo in Jones' hometown, according to his Disney biography. "At the time, 'Pinocchio' was just a job," Jones said at the time of induction.
