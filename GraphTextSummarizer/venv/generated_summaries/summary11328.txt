Ferrari fined as Alonso denies Massa Alonso, who moved to within 34 points of Hamilton with his second victory of the season, has better history at the venue -- though he failed to finish last year after starting from pole, with Hamilton the victor for McLaren. "My first meeting when I arrive at the Hungaroring circuit will be with all the marshals and medical staff who did such a very good job of carefully getting me out of the cockpit," he told the F1 website on Wednesday. He finished second in the opening race of 2010 in Bahrain behind Alonso, and then repeated that result in Germany last weekend in controversial circumstances as he appeared to allow his teammate to pass him after receiving instructions on his radio. The Brazilian was ruled out for the rest of the season, but has returned this year alongside new teammate Fernando Alonso. " The 29-year-old was a close runner-up in the 2008 world championship to this year's leader Lewis Hamilton, but has had only two podium finishes on his return to the Italian team.
