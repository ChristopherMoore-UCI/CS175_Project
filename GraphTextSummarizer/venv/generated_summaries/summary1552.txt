The Iraq War ended in December, and veterans and other citizens throughout the country have begun clamoring for local parades to celebrate the return of our Iraq veterans -- yet only one city in the nation, St. Louis, has held one. With new veterans facing 12% unemployment last year, an epidemic of suicides, and the legacy costs of war, we not only need this country's unreserved support -- we need its sacrifice. In New York, which this week hosted a ticker-tape parade for the New York Giants after they won the Super Bowl, Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said he will hold off on a celebration for Iraq veterans, as the Department of Defense has suggested, because he agrees the time is not right. For example, San Francisco has created a 311 line that connects veterans with local services to give them resources beyond what the Veterans Administration can provide alone. Less than 1% of this country has served in Iraq or Afghanistan, and this has created a civil-military divide that has alienated and isolated this generation of veterans.
