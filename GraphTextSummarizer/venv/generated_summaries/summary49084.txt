Were it not for the tragedies of 9/11 and Iraq, perhaps the thing Cheney would be remembered for was that he was the second vice president to shoot a man, albeit Cheney's was in a hunting accident and Harry Whittington, thank God, survived. The good folks at Vox have compiled a damning indictment of Cheney's deep dishonesty about Iraq. Instead, he ignored the problem, the Cheney terror task force never met, and the warnings about an impending terrorist attack were ignored. From there, it was off to the races, as Cheney did and said anything to drag America into a war with Iraq. But here's the thing: Even after Cheney shot him in the face, there's no indication he ever apologized to Harry Whittington.
