Earlier this week, Yemen's Interior Ministry called for tightened security and warned that al Qaeda might be planning attacks and suicide bombings. CNN's David Simpson wrote from Atlanta, Hakim Almasmari reported from Yemen and Hamdi Alkshali reported from Atlanta -- Militants killed 18 soldiers and eight police officers in south Yemen Friday morning, security officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility but officials at the Defense Ministry and in Shabwa said think al Qaeda was behind the violence. "Though no one has claimed responsibility, the planning, timing and weapons used in the Shabwa attacks give us a strong indication that al Qaeda stands behind todays attacks," a Defense Ministry official said on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media.
