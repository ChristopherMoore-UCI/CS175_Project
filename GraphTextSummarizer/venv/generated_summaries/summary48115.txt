-- Civil rights leaders marking the 47th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech Saturday scorned a nearby Glenn Beck-led rally, saying it came with no message and with a presumption that King's famous discourse can be used as a conservative platform. Civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson told CNN that Beck was mimicking King and "humiliating the tradition." Beck said the site of his rally was appropriate to reflect on the legacy of King, "the man who stood down on those stairs and gave his life for everyone's right to have a dream." "They may have the Mall," countered Sharpton, "but we have the message. Other well-known public figures spoke, including National Urban League President and CEO Marc Morial, who said, "We will not stand silent as some seek to hijack, as some seek to distort and contort, as some seek to bamboozle and confuse the vision of Dr. King's dream. Following the rally, Sharpton linked arms with fellow marchers and walked three miles to the site of the future Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial, just a few blocks from the Lincoln Memorial. Beck, who has a program on Fox News as well as several radio programs, was criticized for holding his event -- which he called "Restoring Honor" -- where King delivered his speech August 28, 1963.
