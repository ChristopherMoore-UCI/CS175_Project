-- Severe weather took only about five minutes to knock out windows and rip signs and awnings off buildings in downtown Bridgeport, Connecticut, Thursday afternoon, eyewitness Beth Bowman reported. The damage from the brief but powerful storm included uprooted trees and overturned U.S. postal boxes, she said. It reported wind damage that included "extensive tree damage." Weather data showed winds up to 75 mph, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. The Bridgeport Police Department said the storm caused significant damage.
