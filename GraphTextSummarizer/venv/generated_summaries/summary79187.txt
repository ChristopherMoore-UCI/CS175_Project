The contentious issue of gun control was put in the spotlight Saturday when one of the 13 wounded in the attack was involuntarily committed to a county mental services unit after he made threats against a Tea Party member at a town hall event in Tucson. On Sunday, the funeral for Dorwan Stoddard took place in Tucson. "The congresswoman continues to do well," University Medical Center in Tucson said in a statement Sunday. "I said something to the effect that although gun rights and laws are not necessarily the primary focus of the Tucson Tea Party, our community needs to be given the opportunity to allow some time to pass and people to heal before we start this type of political dialogue." "I was asked to give my thoughts on gun control laws and perhaps the passage of new laws," Humphries said of the incident.
