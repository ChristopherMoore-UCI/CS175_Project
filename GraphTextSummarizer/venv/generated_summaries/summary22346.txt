-- World number one Rafael Nadal will return to Davis Cup action for the first time since 2009 next month, when he leads Spain in its world group first-round clash against Belgium. The tie, which takes place in the Belgian town of Charleroi from March 4-6, will also be Nadal's first competitive match since he sustained a wrist injury in his Australian Open quarterfinal loss to compatriot David Ferrer. But Roddick, 28 -- who is the second best all-time player in U.S. Davis Cup history with 31 singles wins -- now looks likely to make his comeback in the event when the Americans travel to Santiago in March. The Mallorcan was named in the Spanish squad alongside world number 6 Ferrer, number nine Fernando Verdasco and 41-ranked Feliciano Lopez by team captain Albert Costa at a press conference in Alicante on Friday. For his first tie in charge of the U.S., Courier also named John Isner, Sam Querrey and doubles specialists Bob and Mike Bryan.
