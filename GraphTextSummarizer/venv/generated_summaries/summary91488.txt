While monsoon rains typically sweep across the subcontinent in early June, they usually do not reach the capital city of New Delhi and other regions in northern India until early July. -- Dozens of flights were delayed at India's New Delhi airport Monday after lizards, birds and jackals strayed on to a runway to seek refuge from the monsoon rains. Kids play cricket through a downpour in New Delhi as monsoon rains came early to the area this week. But the operation delayed several flights and shut down the runway for some time, airport spokesman Arun Arora said. In the past, animals on the runway have disrupted flights at the airport -- particularly during the monsoon season, Satyanarayan said.
