Equatorial Guinea will host Africa's top football tournament between January 17 and February 18 after striking a deal to replace Morocco. Morocco had cited fears over Ebola, the deadly disease sweeping across parts of Africa, as the reason to postpone the event until 2016. CAF, the Confederation of African Football, announced the decision on Friday following Morocco's refusal to host the tournament. CAF rejected that proposition and expelled Morocco following its refusal to host the competition. During qualifying for the 2012 World Cup, Equatorial Guinea forfeited two games for the same offense.
