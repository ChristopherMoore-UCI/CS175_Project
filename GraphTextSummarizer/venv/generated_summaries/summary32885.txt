Tourists are rediscovering the Crescent City in all its charms and debauchery (because face it, a late-night walk down the blaring carnival of Bourbon Street is still one of the highlights for many visitors), and all the numbers that city and state leaders count on are trending up. The year before Katrina was a record-breaker, with 10 million visitors and almost $5 billion coming to town. And everything they like and love about New Orleans is just like it was before Katrina." At the Convention and Visitors Bureau, Kelly Schulz is paid to be upbeat, but she insists it's not just a sales pitch when she says, "Everything in New Orleans that was broken during Katrina is being fixed now; not only back to where it was before, but even better. " She tells me that convention planners from other states who swore they would never come back are now calling her for help with reservations.
