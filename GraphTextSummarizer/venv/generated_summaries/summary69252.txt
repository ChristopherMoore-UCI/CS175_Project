But few understand how the low-profile Parliament affects the lives of EU citizens. Recent EU laws which have affected citizens directly include the "roaming directive" which restricted the charges mobile phone companies can impose on customers for calls in countries other than their own. EU directives have helped initiate the era of cut-price air travel. Germany, with a population of 82 million, the biggest among EU states, will have 99 members. If they then vote Yes and all remaining EU states ratify the treaty, then the Parliament will be increased from 736 to 751 members on a different distribution formula.
