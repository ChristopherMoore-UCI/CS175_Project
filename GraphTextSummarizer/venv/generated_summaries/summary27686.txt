-- An Arizona judge agreed Wednesday with defense attorneys that prosecutors in the manslaughter trial of self-help author James Ray improperly withheld evidence, but he decided not to grant a defense motion for a mistrial. Defense attorneys filed a motion Monday accusing prosecutors of intentionally withholding a report from environmental expert Richard Haddow, which suggests that the faulty design of the sweat lodge caused or contributed to the deaths. Because they are receiving Haddow's report several weeks into the trial, and because that testimony could have had a profound impact on their strategy, defense attorneys argue that the judge has no choice but to grant a mistrial. "At issue is a report, or an e-mail, drafted by an environmental engineer that states two relevant factors," defense attorney Luis Li told Judge Warren Darrow during Wednesday's hearing. Many had attended previous James Ray International seminars.
