If Gadhafi doesn't comply, the U.N. resolution will be imposed through military action, the president said. Ambassador Susan Rice told CNN's "Situation Room" that the "U.S. is ready to act" and that Gadhafi "should be under no illusions that if he doesn't act immediately he will face swift and sure consequences, including military action." Earlier Friday, talk emerged in Europe of speedy military action against Gadhafi's regime. Explosions could also be heard in the city, which has been a stronghold for rebels opposing Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. One day after the approval of a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to protect civilians, U.S. President Barack Obama warned Gadhafi to pull back from several besieged cities -- or face military consequences.
