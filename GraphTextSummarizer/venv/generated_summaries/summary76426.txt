Demand for 4D is reaching a fever pitch, says Dr. Junus Kahn, founder of Carbitex, which produces the materials used by the Self-Assembly Lab, as well as supplying them to major business clients. "More materials, more energy sources," Tibbits says are the current priorities. Harvard's Dr. Jennifer Lewis is leading a wide-ranging exploration of 4D printing, which recently received a grant from the US military, along with two other research institutions. "If you have products that know how to mould and assemble based on energy, it takes out the menial labor that has forced manufacturers to relocate abroad where it's cheaper." Kahn believes transport is the fastest-progressing sector for the concept, and expects automotive examples to be on the market as early as 2016. Tibbits' team produce composite materials that react in predictable ways when exposed to external stimulus such as water.
