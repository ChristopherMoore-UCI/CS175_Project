Jett Travolta had a developmental disability that his parents have linked to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder of the artery walls that most commonly occurs in young children, and that can lead to heart disease. An autopsy was conducted Monday in the Bahamas on the body of the couple's son, Jett Travolta. The family's doctor observed the autopsy, Wilchcombe told CNN's "Larry King Live" on Monday. The autopsy results have not been released, but employees of the funeral home that handled the remains said "seizure" was listed as the cause of death on the death certificate, celebrity Web site TMZ reported. They left the Bahamas late Monday night, said Obie Wilchcombe, a member of the Bahamian parliament.
