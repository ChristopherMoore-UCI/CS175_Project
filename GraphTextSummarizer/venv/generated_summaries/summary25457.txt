The Flickr crowd is crazy for it, and Adobe has responded by improving Photoshop's Merge to HDR tool, which helps you create HDR images. Wired.com was shown demos of new tools in Photoshop CS5 -- such as the new Content Aware Fill and HDR tools -- that we expect will amaze and please photographers with the tools' ability to bend pixels with absolute precision. The HDR presets shipping with Photoshop range from the cartoonish to the fairly realistic, and should satisfy all but the pickiest of HDR enthusiasts. Another bit of Photoshop trickery that's become popular lately is high dynamic range imaging, or HDR. This year marks the 20th anniversary of Photoshop's arrival, and there are certainly several "wow" features in Photoshop CS5 which achieve a level of technological advancement most of us couldn't have even dreamed of twenty years ago.
