United he stands: The real Alex Ferguson The match was won thanks to an own-goal by former United defender Wes Brown just before halftime, and kept United in second place in the table -- five points behind local rivals Manchester City, who battled to a 3-2 win at Queens Park Rangers in the late kickoff. Referee Lee Mason awarded the visitors a penalty in the 68th minute when his linesman Jake Collin flagged that young United defender Phil Jones had handled the ball, but then overturned the decision. -- Alex Ferguson has endured many highs and lows in his 25 years at Manchester United, so perhaps it was fitting that Saturday's much-anticipated anniversary celebration featured some of both extremes. However, Manchester City showed that United have a real challenge to add to Ferguson's long list of trophies after coming from behind the first time in the league this season to beat a QPR side that has already defeated Chelsea. Midfielder Frank Lampard scored his sixth goal this campaign to leave the home side in the bottom three, with defender Terry starting after being rested for the 1-1 European draw with Belgian side Genk on Tuesday.
