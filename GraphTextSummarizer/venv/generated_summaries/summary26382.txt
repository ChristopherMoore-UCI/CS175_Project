Four of the cars involved in the crash were carrying the chemical -- a highly toxic and flammable substance called vinyl chloride -- which leaked from at least one tank car into Mantua Creek, New Jersey emergency and environmental officials said. Federal safety officials will look at maintenance histories for the track and bridge and conduct standard drug and alcohol testing of the crew. Other cars were in the creek, partially sunken amid rising smoke. Some 71 patients with respiratory issues and scratchy throats went to Underwood-Memorial Hospital, officials said. Officials said some posts had failed before the work.
