Jane's Information Group, the British-based defense publications and military intelligence company, shows the Georgian military would be trying to hold off a force more than 20 times its size. The Tbilisi government has been seeking western armaments but has been told by Washington that forces must be able to use the old weapons proficiently before they get new ones, Jane's reported. The sharp end of the Georgian air force consists of seven aging Su-25 ground attack fighters and seven attack helicopters, according to Jane's. It has about 7,000 tanks, 7,000 infantry fighting vehicles and armored personnel carriers and thousands of pieces of artillery, Jane's reports. Georgia has been trying to form a professional military force and by the end of next year expected to have only a small number of conscripts in its main force, Jane's said.
