"Maybe the conservative 'safe pair of hands' approach of European sides like England, Russia and Spain is becoming out of date," argues Karlsen. "There's no coincidence that some of the biggest European club sides are in the hands of Latin American coaches," added Karlsen, referring to Manchester City's Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini, Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone and fellow Argentines Marcelo Bielsa, who has just taken charge at Marseille, and Mauricio Pochettino, recently appointed by Tottenham Hotspur "I particularly find the work Jorge Sampaoli -- and Bielsa previously -- have done with Chile highly impressive." Karlsen believes this tournament has highlighted the need for national football federations, as well as managers, to continually evolve if they want to stay ahead.

"But managers like Germany's Joachim Low and Sampaoli prove that a national team job is as suitable as a club job for sophisticated technical concepts.
