"The Frontier Touring Company regret to advise that the Kings Of Leon tour has been postponed from March 2011 to November 2011 to allow drummer Nathan Followill to recover from surgery for a torn right labrum and bicep," Frontier's website said. It's gotten out of hand," guitarist Caleb Followill told CNN in a statement. "Sorry to all the fans in Australia and South Africa," Followill tweeted. The Kings of Leon has achieved tremendous success in recent years, scoring a multi-platinum album and several hit singles with their 2008 album "Only by the Night." It came at the end of that record cycle, and we were over promoting (the song)," Caleb Followill said.
