-- Venezuela will nationalize the exploration and mining of gold and recall $11 billion in gold reserves from foreign banks, President Hugo Chavez said Wednesday. Chavez detailed the gold reserves plan hours after announcing that he planned to issue a decree that will permit the takeover of a gold-rich area in southern Venezuela, according to AVN. Chavez said that the nationalization was necessary "because in that area there is anarchy, there are mafias, smugglers." Venezuela has as much as $12 billion in gold reserves, Chavez said, and "we cannot permit them to keep taking that from us." Roger Noriega, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state, urged Venezuelans to rally "to oppose the looting of the nation's savings" in a blog post on the website of the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank. Venezuelan leaders did not specify when they would begin bringing back gold reserves.
