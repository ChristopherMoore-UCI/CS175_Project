The justices announced Monday they would review a federal law giving that special right to those like young Menachem Zivotofsky, who were born in Jerusalem. Divided into East Jerusalem (populated mostly by Muslims) and West Jerusalem (populated mostly by Jews), the city spans over 48 square miles (124 square kilometers), with about 775,000 people. Just three weeks before Menachem was born, the U.S. Congress gave American citizens born in Jerusalem the individual discretion to ask that Israel be listed on passports and consular reports, where it says "Place of Birth." Jerusalem is Israel's largest city, and the nation calls it its capital, though that is not recognized by the United Nations and most of the world community. The couple and their two oldest children were born in the United States, but the family migrated to West Jerusalem more than a dozen years ago, and in 2002 the youngest, Menachem Binyamin, was born.
