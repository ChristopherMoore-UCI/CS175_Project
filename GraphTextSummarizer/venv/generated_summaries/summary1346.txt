The border city has become a symbol of the brutal realities of the nation's drug war, which has claimed about 43,000 lives since President Felipe Calderon declared a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. The ambulance traveled to Juarez from the city of Nuevo Casas Grandes, about 170 miles away, police said. Crime rates in Juarez have declined since last year, with the daily homicide rate dropping from about eight in 2010 to six in 2011. Juarez, one of Mexico's most violent cities, shares a border with El Paso, Texas. Among the attacks Wednesday, gunmen ambushed an ambulance that was transporting two dialysis patients to a hospital in Juarez, police said.
