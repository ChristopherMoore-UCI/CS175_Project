While most of the travel is legitimate, "senior U.S. counterterror officials have told the committee they are very concerned about individuals they have not identified who have fallen in with al-Shabaab during trips to Somalia, who could return to the U.S. undetected." "With a large group of Muslim-Americans willing to die as 'martyrs' and a strong operational partnership with al Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and in Yemen, al-Shabaab now has more capability than ever to strike the U.S. homeland," according to King. -- Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-affiliated militant group in Somalia, has recruited more than 40 Muslim-Americans and 20 Canadians, U.S. Rep. Peter King said Wednesday as he opened a third congressional hearing on Muslim-American radicalization. " "As many as two dozen Muslim-Americans with al-Shabaab -- who in many cases were trained by top al Qaeda leaders -- remain unaccounted for," King's transcript said. But, King also mentioned "radicalized converts like al-Shabaab commander Omar Hammami, who was raised a Baptist in Alabama, and who has repeatedly threatened the U.S. homeland." The committee has learned at least 15 of the Americans and three Canadians "are believed to have been killed fighting with al-Shabaab, according to King's transcript.
