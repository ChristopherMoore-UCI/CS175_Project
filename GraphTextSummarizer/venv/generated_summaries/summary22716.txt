I also co-host on SiriusXM NFL Radio and do color commentary in Nashville for Titans preseason games with my old teammate and friend, Heisman trophy winner Eddie George, who has already received his MBA. The majority of financial woes come from untrustworthy financial advisers, family members, poor business deals, second homes and other low-return investments like restaurants, bars, nightclubs and music studios I have been fortunate to have received terrible financial advice only once causing me to take a loss. The NFL offers business, entrepreneurship and other educational workshops. It was extremely important for me to be a student of my finances, business and other interests outside football. I would estimate that 60% of the NFL players I've known over my 11-year career have had some type of money issue.
