"We found some body parts, which we have decided not to count as a whole for now," said Musa Ecweru, the minister for disaster preparedness. The chances of finding survivors were fading as heavy rain pounded the area, leaving rescuers focusing on recovery efforts, the Red Cross spokeswoman said. The earth is very delicate and heavy machinery may cause more landslides," Ntabadde said. The Red Cross, United Nations and World Food Program are helping provide food, water and other essentials, such as blankets, to the displaced, officials said. A select few attended the service, because of the risk of more landslides, Ecweru said.
