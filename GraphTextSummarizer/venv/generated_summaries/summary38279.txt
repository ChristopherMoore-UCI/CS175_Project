Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October after a rash of kidnappings Kenyan authorities blamed on Al-Shabaab, which has ties to al Qaeda and is considered a terrorist group by the United States. The African Union-backed AMISOM force, meanwhile, is trying to consolidate power for Somalia's weak transitional federal government in Mogadishu, where Al-Shabaab is especially active in its battle against that government. -- The leaders of Kenya, Somalia and Uganda held a closed-door meeting in Nairobi Wednesday, reaffirming their commitment to military operations against the Islamic militant group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. However, military officials remain confident they will be able to disable the group in southern Somalia. Kenyan forces are ultimately seeking to take the Somali port city of Kismayo, described by the United Nations as a key stronghold and source of cash for Al-Shabaab.
