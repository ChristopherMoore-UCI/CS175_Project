-- After their heroics last Monday against hated city rivals Manchester United, Manchester City went one step closer to securing their first league title in four decades after beating Newcastle United 2-0. And it looked like Newcastle United was about to hand Manchester United advantage in the title fight as coach Alan Pardew's side held City at bay for the first 70 minutes. Before the game both Manchester teams were on 83 points, with City ahead on goal difference, the closest title race in Premier League history. That proved to be rock bottom as City eventually fought their way back to become Premier League regulars. " Later on Sunday Manchester United took on Swansea City at a subdued Old Trafford knowing that defeat would virtually hand City the title.
