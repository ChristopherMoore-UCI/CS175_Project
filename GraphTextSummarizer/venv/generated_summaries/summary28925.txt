Fonda and her father, Henry Fonda, co-starred in 1981's "On Golden Pond," for which they both won Oscars. The actress also said that she believes that what her father didn't communicate directly to her, he did through the films whose values he held dear, such as "Twelve Angry Men," "Young Abe Lincoln," "The Wrong Man," and "The Grapes of Wrath." Fonda also told Morgan that she knows her dad would have been pleased to know that she married Ted Turner. -- Jane Fonda told Piers Morgan that Michael Jackson's 1981 visit to her California ranch inspired him to purchase what was to become Neverland Ranch. "I found out after my dad died that he was fascinated by Ted Turner," said Fonda. " Fonda told Morgan that she doesn't like the notion that Jackson's 2009 death was a "Hollywood clichÃ©," but that "it's hard to imagine that someone that was as tormented as he was, you know, could have sort of lived a long and peaceful and natural life."
