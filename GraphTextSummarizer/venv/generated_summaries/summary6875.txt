-- Malky Mackay was "relieved of his duties" as manager of Cardiff City Friday just 11 days after being told by the English Premier League club's Malaysian owner Vincent Tan he must resign or be sacked. The defeat left Cardiff in 16th place, one point above the relegation zone and the new manager -- former Manchester United star Ole Gunnar Solksjaer is the early favorite -- will be judged on their ability to avoid the drop. Mackay was appointed by Tan in the summer of 2011, a year after the Malaysian took control and success came on the pitch with an appearance in the 2012 English League Cup final at Wembley. The departure of Mackay was widely expected after his very public falling out with billionaire businessman Tan, who has had a controlling share in the Welsh club since 2010. Tan sent Mackay an email on December 16, with the resign or be sacked ultimatum.
