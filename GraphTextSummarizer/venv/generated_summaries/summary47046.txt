The same Washington leaders who were eager to aid Mubarak, and now Morsy, were also once the loudest voices for supporting Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi. You would think these protesters represent an Egypt more favorable or in line with American interests. There are multiple examples of our government aiding and abetting despotic regimes in ways that ultimately work against American interests. Before America supported the Muslim Brotherhood, we supported Morsy's predecessor, Hosni Mubarak. That same month, Secretary of State John Kerry met with Morsy and pledged $250 million in additional aid to Egypt.
