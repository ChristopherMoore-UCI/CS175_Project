-- If our children's children should die from Ebola here in the United States, President Obama would be to blame. I guess when you have people hating President Obama they'll believe just about anything bad said about him, even if it's ridiculous.

Opinion: Get proactive about screening for Ebola How can President Obama's response be characterized as negligent when his administration began directing resourcesâ€”including more than $21 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development -- to areas hit with the virus within days of the first Ebola diagnosis? After a while I stopped reading, convinced that if President Obama found a cure for cancer, these would be the people who would blame him for putting doctors out of work.
