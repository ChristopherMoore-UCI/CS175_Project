Major notes how Prince William in particular has helped modernize the family's image: "People are very happy with the way he has risen to the challenges he faced and I think even more than that, they see him as a very human individual and I think that is very important." William is a search and rescue pilot for the Royal Air Force and must decide soon if he wants to stay on in the service for another three years. The former British Prime Minister, Sir John Major, has credited the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, William and Catherine, with reinvigorating interest in the British monarchy. Major told CNN: "People see that iconic figures -- whom they see only at a distance and they perhaps never meet -- have the same emotions, same feelings, the same cares, the same loves that they have in their own lives. So I think he is well aware of the responsibilities that lie ahead but there's a greater freedom these days for members of the Royal Family to pursue their own lives than perhaps there has been sometimes in the past and in the case of Prince William, he's pursuing that in terms of his military career," Major said. " Major also acted as a guardian for Prince William's interests after his mother died and maintains close links with the monarchy.
