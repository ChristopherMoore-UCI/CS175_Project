Bread lines attacked, rights groups says Syrian forces have bombed and fired near 10 bakeries in Aleppo province, killing dozens and maiming others, Human Rights Watch said Thursday. Syrian state media said military forces attacked "armed terrorist groups" Thursday in various provinces, including  Aleppo. Morsy's support of the Syrian opposition reflects his solidarity with the people who took to the streets during the Arab Spring, the popular label for the democratic movements that swept across the Middle East and North Africa last year. State media reported that Tunisian Foreign Minister Rafiq Abdul Salam urged other nations to help Jordan, which is under a heavy financial burden because of the influx of Syrian refugees fleeing the conflict. "Day after day, Aleppo residents line up to get bread for their families, and instead get shrapnel piercing their bodies from government bombs and shells," said Ole Solvang, a researcher at Human Rights Watch, who has just returned from Aleppo.
