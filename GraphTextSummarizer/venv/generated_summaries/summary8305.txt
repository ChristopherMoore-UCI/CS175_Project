North Carolina community remembers Zahra Baker "The life and death of Zahra Baker profoundly impacted those who came to know this brave young lady through her tragic story," said District Attorney James Gaither Jr., whose district includes the section of central North Carolina where the crime occurred and whose office confirmed the finding about Zahra's skull. Elisa Baker was arrested the next day on several charges unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, including writing worthless checks. -- Zahra Baker had been an international symbol of strength and hope: A freckle-faced girl who lost part of her left leg at age 5 and her hearing while being treated for cancer, she kept smiling and fighting through it all. That's when her stepmother, Elisa Baker, told police in Hickory, North Carolina, that the girl, then 10, was killed and dismembered, according to search warrants. A prosthetic leg thought to belong to the missing girl was found in a brushy area off a North Carolina road in late October 2010.
