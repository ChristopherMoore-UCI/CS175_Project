"I think it was the whole package that evoked Greedo, but particularly the eyes and the underslung mouth," said Jonathan Armbruster, biological sciences professor and curator of fishes at the Auburn University Museum of Natural History. "As a 7-year-old kid, I watched "Star Wars" in the theater, and it was a life-changing experience for me," said Armbruster. Greedo became the object of controversy when Lucasfilm re-released the original Star Wars trilogy in 1997. But you can call him Greedo, in honor of the bounty hunter from "Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope." You might remember him from the cantina scene on Mos Eisley, where he was killed by Han Solo while attempting to collect on a debt for Jabba the Hutt.
