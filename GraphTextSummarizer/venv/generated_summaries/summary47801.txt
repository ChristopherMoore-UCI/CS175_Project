A DNA sample taken from Melbourne schoolteacher Leigh Olver, great-grandson of Kelly's sister, was instrumental. The skull "had been taken from the Old Melbourne Gaol in December 1978 where it had been on display next to the death mask of Ned Kelly. Kelly is an integral part of Australian cultural history, with his defiance of the oppressive British authority of the time striking a chord for many Australians. "Consultations will commence shortly with Ned Kelly's family and other parties involved, regarding the appropriate future resting place for Ned Kelly's remains." Australian artist Sidney Nolan made Ned Kelly the subject of a series of paintings.
