Certainly, given the security challenges that Japan faces, both within Asia -- in the form of territorial issues with China and with an unpredictable North Korea -- and further afield, it seems essential that Japan sharpens and strengthens its defense posture and plays a more proactive international role. More specifically, one of the 15 scenarios presented by the Japanese government in its push toward a more proactive defense posture was allowing the use of weapons in overseas rescue missions of Japanese citizens. The crisis will be seen as underscoring the impact of instability thousands of miles from its shores, and therefore the need for Japan to adopt a sharper, more proactive security posture even beyond East Asia. A more assertive policy will expose Japan to more conflict and heighten its exposure to terrorism -- no small shift to handle in a remarkably safe country that for decades has turned its back on military conflict. But as much as anything, the debate over security -- and this week's tragic hostage situation -- are a reminder that Japan may increasingly find itself and its citizens in the firing line.
