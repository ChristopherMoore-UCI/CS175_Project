The goalkeeper saved a spot-kick by striker Carlos Tevez to earn "La Celeste" a clash with Peru, who beat Colombia 2-0 after extra-time in Cordoba earlier on Saturday. Higuain could have won it in extra-time but hit the post with only Muslera in his way, and the goalkeeper took center stage in the shootout when he saved Argentina's third attempt from substitute Tevez. -- Uruguay hero Fernando Muslera was delighted after his team stunned hosts Argentina in a penalty shootout to reach the semifinals of the Copa America tournament, despite having a player sent off. In Sunday's quarterfinals, defending champions Brazil take on Paraguay in La Plata and Chile play Venezuela in San Juan. Uruguay shocked the home crowd in Santa Fe when Diego Perez scored in the fifth minute after goalkeeper Sergio Romero dived to block Martin Caceres' header from a free-kick by Diego Forlan.
