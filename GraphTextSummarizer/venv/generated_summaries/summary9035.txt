This action follows the abduction of Israeli teens Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel as they were on their way home from school June 13; the three were found dead on Monday in a West Bank field. But his father said Thursday he was still waiting to hear from Israeli authorities when the body would be handed over to the family. The clashes expanded and continued through midnight in the Palestinian neighborhood, with a large amount of Israeli forces on hand. Some protesters attacked two Palestinians whom they mistook for undercover Israeli police, The Jerusalem Post reported. The cousin passionately suggested: "The Israeli police and Israeli government should do the same as they have done in Hebron: Demolish and blow the settler houses who have done this crime."
