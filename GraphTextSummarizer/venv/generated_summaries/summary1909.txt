This complicated pas de deux with Tomei's reporter is performed on the campaign side by grizzled veteran campaign manager Paul Zara (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and hotshot young press secretary Stephen Meyers (Ryan Gosling). At one point the 30-year-old Myers brags that he's worked on more campaigns than most people have by the time they're 40, but Hoffman's Zara and equally seasoned rival campaign manager Tom Duffy (Paul Giamatti) in turn play Myers like a violin, proving that "The X-Files" was right: He leads in the polls and the delegate count, but anything can happen in the week before the primary and a potential spoiler/kingmaker waits in the wings in the form of North Carolina Sen. Thompson (Jeffrey Wright). Gosling's Myers is playing with the big boys and navigating the often ethically muddy waters of presidential politics is not for the faint of heart. So while trying to win Ohio, both Morris and his rival are at the same time clandestinely courting Thompson's favors, with New York Times reporter Ida Horowicz
