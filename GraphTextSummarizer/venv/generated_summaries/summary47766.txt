The big cat spotted in the woods east of Paris isn't a tiger after all, French authorities said Friday, citing analysis of the beast's tracks. Witnesses first reported the feline Thursday in an area not from Disneyland Paris. Just what kind of feline the French are dealing with remains a bit of a mystery, so police in the Seine-et-Marne department cautioned residents to continue to take care when walking and to avoid wooded areas. "I think it's more afraid than dangerous," Caroline Dos Santos said Friday. But an official with the National Board of Wildlife and Hunting, Eric Hansen, told CNN affiliate BFM that the cat, whatever it is, poses no danger to people.
