The entertainment was a curtain raiser for this week's Abu Dhabi Golf Championship where McIlroy and Mickelson will tee off against fellow top-10 players Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia. -- If a rain dance brings relief for one kind of drought then golfer Rory McIlroy might just be hoping a few traditional dance steps in Abu Dhabi might satisfy his thirst for another major title in 2014. " Mickelson has his own targets in mind as he begins his new season in Abu Dhabi. "Any major championship win would make the year special and memorable," Mickelson told reporters in Abu Dhabi. The $2.7m prize pot attracts some of golf's big names to open their season under the desert sun of Abu Dhabi but the game's biggest cat Tiger Woods is not in attendance this year and the world No. 1 has yet to open his campaign.
