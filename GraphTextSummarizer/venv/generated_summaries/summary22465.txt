They were eventually killed, said Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Afghan interior ministry. The assault on the five-story building, which is under construction, began with two suicide bombers blowing themselves up, said Kabul police official Hashtmat Stanikzai. -- Taliban fighters armed with guns and explosives clashed with security forces after taking over a building near the airport in the Afghan capital on Monday. Last month, a suicide car bombing on a coalition convoy in central Kabul killed at least 12 people, six of them American and six Afghan. Insurgents have carried out frequent attacks on security forces across Afghanistan in recent months amid a spring offensive by the Taliban.
