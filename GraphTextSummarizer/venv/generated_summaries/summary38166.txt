The car was driven by a suicide bomber who detonated explosives after police ordered him to stop his car, said Nissar Ahmad Abdulrahimzai, deputy police chief of Paktika province. "Today's appalling attack during Ramadan -- an occasion that should observed in a spirit of peace and compassion -- should be condemned in the strongest possible terms and the perpetrators must be held accountable," UNAMA head Jan Kubis said. Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayoub Salang said 42 people were killed and more than 30 others were wounded in the attack in the Urgon district of Paktika province. Abdulrahimzai said he feared the death toll would rise and there is at least one government official reporting more deaths. Meanwhile, in the capital, Kabul, the Taliban claimed responsibility for an attack early Tuesday on a vehicle used by presidential palace employees.
