The killing of Laurens County Deputy Kyle Dinkheller was captured on the deputy's dash camera just outside Dublin, Georgia. Andrew Brannan, 66, who is scheduled to be put to death this week for the murder of a 22-year-old Georgia sheriff's deputy in 1998, is hoping his sentence will be found uniquely unconstitutional. Brannan is seen in the video confronting Dinkheller after being pulled over for driving almost 100 miles per hour in his pickup. Dinkheller and Brannan are shot and wounded in the battle. But Brannan is able to advance on the deputy, and off camera, you hear the deputy scream before Brannan repeatedly shoots Dinkheller and then flees the scene.
