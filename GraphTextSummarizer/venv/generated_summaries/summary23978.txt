Army Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III replaced Gen. Raymond T. Odierno as commander of U.S. Forces-Iraq in the changeover, held at one of the many palaces of late Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein -- whose regime was ousted from power in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. -- U.S. Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Robert Gates helped usher in the next chapter for the United States in Iraq on Wednesday, presiding over a ceremony launching a new military operation designed to train, assist and advise the Iraqis. When asked Wednesday if the United States is still at war in Iraq, Gates responded, "No, we're not." Odierno said a democratic Iraq "can become an engine for peace and stability" in the Middle East. The U.S. combat mission in Iraq officially ended at 5 p.m. ET Tuesday.
