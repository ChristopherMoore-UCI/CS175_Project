Joseph Brooks, 73, was facing charges on 11 alleged rapes and sex assaults, New York Police Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. -- The man who composed the pop hit "You Light Up My Life" ended his own life Sunday, New York police said. The bruised body of swimsuit designer Sylvie Cachay, 33, was found at a chic New York hotel last December, police said. Brooks' son, Nicholas Brooks, was charged in January with the murder of his ex-girlfriend, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's office. The Oscar-winning songwriter was found dead on a couch in his Manhattan home by a friend with whom he was supposed to have lunch at 12:30 p.m. Sunday, Browne said.
