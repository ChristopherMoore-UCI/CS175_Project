Luke Foreman's Staples High School in Westport, Connecticut, tied the Guinness World Record this year for most sets of twins in a grade at 16. Connecticut's Greenwich High School hopes to beat the world record with 18 pair of twins in its class of 2016. "I was kind of stunned," Nancy Lanzoni, mother of twins Ben and Willy, said when she learned the Greenwich High School boasts a total 62 sets of twins in four grades. "I've noticed there are more twins and triplets," John Dodig, principal of Staples High School, says. A dramatic rise in multiple-child pregnancies has left many schools with record-smashing numbers of twins and triplets.
