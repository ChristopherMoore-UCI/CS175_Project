The boy's death aggravated U.S. State Department efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families have already begun the process to adopt a Russian child before Moscow in December passed a law banning adoptions of Russian children by Americans. Medical Examiner Lloyd White wrote to his colleagues in Ector County, "Based on the findings at this point, I suggest laceration of small bowel mesentry due to blunt trauma to (the) abdomen as the cause of death. Russia concerned over adopted boy's cause of death "They stated that (Max) was displaying behaviors such as banging his head on the bathtub, throwing himself down, holding his breath and clawing himself," wrote investigator Sondra Woolf. I'll leave the manner of death up to you pending investigation. That law bans adoptions by Americans ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents.
