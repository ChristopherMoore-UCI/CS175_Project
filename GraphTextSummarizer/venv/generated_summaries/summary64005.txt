A few days ago, Facebook allegedly kicked famous author Salman Rushdie off of its social network, and then asked him to change his posted name to Ahmed if he wanted to return. He added: "Seriously, what is the point of forcing Salman Rushdie to go by Ahmed Rushdie? Supporters of democratic protests in the Middle East and elsewhere have criticized Facebook and other social networks like Google+ for their real-name policies, saying they prevent people from organizing against authoritarian governments that could use a network like Facebook to crack down. "Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way," Facebook's terms of service document says. How does this benefit the social Web?" Rushdie taunted Facebook on Twitter before the site relented and reposted his page.
