And while Friday he wanted to talk about the release of Iraq War documents he said showed "compelling evidence of war crimes" committed by U.S.-led coalition and Iraqi government forces, Assange faces both professional and personal challenges. -- Julian Assange considers himself the "lightning rod" for WikiLeaks, which has been beset by internal strife over the past several months. WiiLeaks' new spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said the material WikiLeaks publishes is far more important than the organization or Assange, and it has tried to convey that. Assange, who is mercurial in interviews, answered CNN's questions Friday about strife within WikiLeaks, but repeatedly declined to answer questions about the rape and molestation investigation and what the allegations may mean to the organization. He told CNN that Assange's personality was distracting from the group's original mission: to publish small leaks, not just huge, splashy ones like the Afghan War Diary.
