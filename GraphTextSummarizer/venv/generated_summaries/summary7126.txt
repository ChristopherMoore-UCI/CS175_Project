"This approval represents a technological advance in the manufacturing of an influenza vaccine," said Karen Midthun, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. It has already been used in vaccines approved for other infectious diseases. The new product, Flublok, which is available in limited supplies for the current season, is different from other flu vaccines, because it isn't made using eggs or an influenza virus, the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday. -- As flu season rages across the United States, federal regulators say they have approved a new kind of vaccine for the virus. Most human antibodies that fight flu infection are directed against hemagglutinin, the FDA said.
