South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is one of the GOP's brightest stars, a 42-year-old Indian-American, a dynamo fundraiser and a favorite of national Republicans eager to showcase diversity in their ranks. Haley's road to re-election this November has looked smooth of late, thanks to Obamacare's unpopularity in South Carolina, a shrinking unemployment rate and the cautious approach of her Democratic challenger, state Sen. Vincent Sheheen. " "We appreciate Mr. Ervin's desire for public service, but a trial lawyer and former Democratic lawmakerâ€Ž who wants to raise taxes and embrace Obamacare should probably be running as a Democrat," said Haley spokesman Rob Godfrey. Questioning Haley's commitment Ervin served one term in the South Carolina legislature 30 years ago as a Democrat, and ran for a seat again in 2005 as a Republican, but lost. " Katon Dawson, a former South Carolina GOP chairman, said Ervin and his wife "have been very successful in the legal business."
