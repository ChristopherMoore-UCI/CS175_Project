"President Obama is at it again today with another dishonest attack meant to distract from his own record of failure," Romney campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg told CNN. Last week Portman said he met with Romney campaign staffers during three meetings while in Boston to headline a couple of fund-raisers for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Gergen: Facts don't support Obama's claims "We have not found any serious economic study that says Governor Romney's economic plan would actually create jobs until today," Obama said. On Sunday, Obama's senior campaign adviser David Axelrod told CNN's "State of the Union" such limited disclosure only raised more questions about Romney's finances.
