For tourists who want to stay on the Salar itself, there are several hotels made from salt bricks -- beds, chairs and cocktail bars included. But mining salt is no longer the only way to survive in this cold, arid corner of southwestern Bolivia. Tourists used to arrive and they wouldn't buy anything, so we thought, 'How can we improve things?"' said Fermin Villca, who now sells ashtrays and llama figurines carved from salt stone. "People want to test it's really made of salt by licking the walls," said Raul Garcia, a workmen building a new salt hotel, as he crammed coca leaves into mouth. Uyuni tourism director Ovidio Copa expects twice as many tourists to be visiting the Salar within five years as word of its otherworldly beauty gets out.
