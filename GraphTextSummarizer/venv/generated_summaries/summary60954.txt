Bary was returned to Ohio from Florida late last year, and as a 17-year-old, she was placed in the custody of Franklin County Children Services while other issues in the case were being settled. -- A runaway who said her father threatened to kill her for converting to Christianity from Islam has been granted permanent residency in the United States, her lawyer told CNN on Tuesday. Rifqa Bary, 18, who was an undocumented immigrant until recently, left her family in Columbus, Ohio, in July 2009 and took refuge in the home of a minister in Orlando, Florida. "I can confirm that she got her legal permanent residency status, and in five years she can actually become a citizen," said Kort Gatterdam, Bary's attorney. A report by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement cleared Bary's parents of any criminal wrongdoing.
