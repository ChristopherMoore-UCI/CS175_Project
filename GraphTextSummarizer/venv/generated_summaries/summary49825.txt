Since summer orientation in 2012, Stock, Duffin and another freshman, Kathryn Hendley, had become friends with Jackie. "It was from Haven Monahan ... and it looked like Haven had written, 'You should read this, I've never read anything nicer in my life,' with a page worth -- an essay -- that Jackie had written about me," Duffin said. He said he was happy when Jackie told friends that an upperclassman in her chemistry class asked her on a date. Duffin and Stock said they were never contacted by the magazine; instead, the writer portrayed them through Jackie's eyes. In its apology, Rolling Stone said of Jackie, "Our trust in her was misplaced."
