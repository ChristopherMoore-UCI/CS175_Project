Dressed like a wide range of characters from the film, about 200 attendees of Seattle Lebowski Fest watched the movie yet again, bowled, drank the film's signature white Russians and quoted each other their favorite lines. "There's a certain community thing that goes on when you hang out and watch your favorite film," said Lebowski Fest co-founder Scott Shuffitt. Rachel Life, who dressed as Maude Lebowski, the film's eccentric artist and love interest for the Dude, said the fest brings a sense of community. Winners of the Seattle Lebowski Fest best-costume prizes pose at a bowling alley. "We realized we are not alone with our obsession for this movie, and we thought, 'Hey man, let's have a party in a bowling alley for "The Big Lebowski" ' and never thought anything would come of it, and here we are eight years later doing it all over the country." Since then, Lebowski Fest has been held 25 times in the United States and overseas.
