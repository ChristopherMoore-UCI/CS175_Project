EW: Channing Tatum is in talks to play a very famous X-Man Current franchise steersman Bryan Singer has told French magazine Cine Premiere that he'd like to fit Gambit and Nightcrawler into 2016â€²s "X-Men: Apocalypse." "Days of Future Past" promises to fit more X-Men into an "X-Men" movie than any "X-Men" movie ever before. Now series producer Lauren Shuler Donner has kinda-sorta-completely confirmed that Gambit will be joining the franchise...and that he'll be played by Channing Tatum. EW: 'X-Men' - Could Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique get the next spin-off film? Shuler Donner doesn't specifically say how Tatum would join the franchise, nor does she even come close to mentioning how Tatum's Gambit will be different from Taylor Kitsch's Gambit in that movie that never happened.
