For the first time since the 2008 presidential race, Hillary Clinton made a foray back into the thorny world of campaign politics on Saturday, appearing at a rally for Terry McAuliffe, the longtime Clinton confidante now running for governor of Virginia. Cuccinelli spent Saturday rallying the conservative base with Mike Huckabee in central Virginia. As much as Clinton was the story here, time and again she served as a character witness for McAuliffe, whom Republicans have relentlessly attacked as a carnival barker and Washington insider. "They operate in what I called the evidence-free-zone, with ideology trumping everything else," she said, before listing the consequences of the shutdown, such as furloughed workers and "children thrown out of Head Start." Clinton also made sure to highlight Republican efforts to enforce stricter abortion regulations in Virginia. No one in Virginia is surprised that his campaign deployed Clinton at this late stage of the game, an effort to stir up scads of press attention and drown out the cash-strapped Cuccinelli, who is not even airing television ads in the crucial northern Virginia media market this weekend, two ad-buying sources told CNN.
