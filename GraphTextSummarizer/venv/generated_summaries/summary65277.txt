Six Drivers, a 4-year-old colt, threw his rider and ran into a crowd of horses running in the opposite direction, New York Racing Associating spokesman Eric Wing told CNN. -- Routine training exercises turned deadly Saturday morning when two racehorses collided at Belmont Park in New York, killing both animals and injuring one rider, officials told CNN. "This was a freakish tragedy that happens very, very rarely, but it makes it no less unfortunate," Wing told CNN. Belmont Park is the site of the Belmont Stakes, the annual final race of the Triple Crown. Six Drivers crashed into Caixa Eletronica, a multiple-stakes-winning thoroughbred, killing both horses and injuring Caixa Eletronica's rider, Carlos Castro, who was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation, according to a racing association press release.
