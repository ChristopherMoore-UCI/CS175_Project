"This criminal enterprise used the streets of New York City as one giant showroom for stealing cars," New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. The operation specialized in the theft of Toyota and Lexus SUVs and other automobiles -- Toyota Venzas, Highlanders, Sequoias and Lexus RX 350s, GX 460s and GX 470s -- as well as other high-end makes, including Acuras, his office said. The cars and SUVs were then loaded into shipping containers and transported to Africa with forged titles and vehicle identification numbers. -- Authorities have busted a luxury-vehicle theft ring that took orders from clients in Africa and then stole the cars from New York. A local broker in Africa would relay the order to the theft crew boss, specifying what was to be stolen by model, year, color and accessory package.
