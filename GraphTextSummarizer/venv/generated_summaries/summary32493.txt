The two vessels foundered about 4 nautical miles off Samos, Tenta said, adding that authorities did not yet know their nationalities. Thirty-six survivors have been rescued from the Aegean Sea, and the search is continuing, Katherine Tenta of the Greek coast guard told CNN by phone. Thousands of migrants from Africa and the Middle East pack into often unsafe boats to get into the European Union through Greece, Italy, Malta and other coastal states. Tenta said the coast guard towed the vessels -- a 10-meter long boat and a smaller vessel -- to Samos. The numbers have increased since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings triggered unrest across North Africa and civil war in Syria.
