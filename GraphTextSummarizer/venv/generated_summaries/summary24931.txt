-- It was a Friday night in June 2007 when 22-year-old college student Kelly Nolan left her home to meet friends at a bar in Madison, Wisconsin. Kelly Nolan's body was found two weeks after she disappeared after a night out with friends. Police won't confirm it, but the witness claims that he and Nolan walked out of the bar together because another male bar patron had been harassing Nolan, Paras said. The two walked out, but then Nolan asked Paras' employee to wait for her to use the bathroom. Tom Paras, owner of Amy's Cafe, a bar in the State Street area, said an employee met Nolan at another nearby watering hole called the Lava Lounge.
