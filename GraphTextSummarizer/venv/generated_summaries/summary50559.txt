Edin Dzeko added another in the 89th minute and Micah Richards made it five in injury time. In the other FA Cup ties played Sunday, Manchester City thrashed Nott's County 5-0 in their FA Cup fourth round replay match at Eastlands. The goal denied Wolves the chance to move off the bottom of the table, while a point lifts West Brom one point above Wigan in 17th place. But City weren't finished and further goals were added by Carlos Tevez -- who rounded Nelson in the Notts County goal before sliding the ball home -- in the 84th minute. Sunday's only English Premier League match saw the Midlands derby between West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers finish in a 1-1 draw.
