Seventy-five percent of the patients who were treated with PLX4032 had already received multiple treatments of other cancer drugs, all of which had failed. New drug inhibits BRAF, the main driver of mutation in over 50 percent of melanomas. Peter Hirth, CEO of the drug's maker Plexxikon explained that it is because PLX4032 is such a highly selective compound that "doctors can adjust the dosage to really shut down tumors," whereas other cancer treatment drugs are frequently limited from working to their full potential because patients cannot tolerate their toxicity levels. We haven't seen a major breakthrough in this disease in the last 40 years," said Professor Alexander Eggermont, President of the European Cancer Organization.
