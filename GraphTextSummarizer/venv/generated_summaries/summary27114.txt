Murray has installed tennis courts which are resplendent in the purple and green colors of Wimbledon -- where he will begin the defense of his title next week. The pair chose the names of the rooms -- they went for famous Scots such as the inventor of penicillin Alexander Fleming, actor Sean Connery and former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. Set close to where Murray learned his trade on the local courts, the 15-bedroom Cromlix -- set in 34-acres of lush Scottish countryside -- is his new venture. -- Tennis star Andy Murray is used to serving on a daily basis -- but he's taken it in a whole new direction with his latest venture. Until last week, Murray had won 19 consecutive matches on grass before suffering a shock defeat at Queen's Club by 35-year-old Czech Radek Stepanek.
