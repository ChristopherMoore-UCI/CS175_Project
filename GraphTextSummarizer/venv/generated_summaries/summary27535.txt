Now in its 20th year, The Lucille Ball Festival of Comedy draws diehard Lucy fans and comedy enthusiasts from countries as far away as Australia, Britain, Canada and Japan to tour the Lucy-Desi museum and Desilu Playhouse, two of the attractions at the Center. "We want Jamestown to be the Cooperstown of comedy," Gunderson said, though she acknowledges pitching Jamestown as a host city for the hall of fame as opposed to some better-known, bigger cities like Chicago or New York will likely be met with some laughter. Especially this year, "we've really tried to stay true to (Lucy's) vision with as much comedy as we can pack into a weekend," said Journey Gunderson, executive director of the Lucy Ball Desi Arnaz Center for Comedy. -- Donning her signature red updo and red lipstick and polka-dotted dress, 915 Lucy Ricardo look-alikes gathered in Jamestown, New York, on Saturday, setting a record for the most Lucys in one place at one time. Lucy Fest has always been a weekend to celebrate Lucy's contributions to comedy on what would have been her birthday.
