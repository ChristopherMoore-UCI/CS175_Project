Controllers lost contact with Columbia at 8:59 a.m. ET, about 15 minutes before it had been expected to land at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida.

Friday, NASA marks the anniversary with tributes to the crew of Columbia and 10 other astronauts lost in the space agency's two previous fatal accidents -- the 1986 explosion that destroyed Columbia's sister ship Challenger, and the launch pad fire that killed Apollo 1's three-man crew in 1967. Space shuttle Columbia part found in east Texas "Some of them, you knew instantly what they were," said Belinda Gay, one of those searchers.
