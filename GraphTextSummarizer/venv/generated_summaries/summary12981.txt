There were also goals for Mikel Arteta and Thierry Henry to complete a 7-1 victory to move Arsene Wenger's men up to fifth place ahead of Newcastle who entertain Aston Villa on Sunday and Liverpool who take on Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield on Monday. Second-half strikes from Matt Jarvis (46th minute) and Kevin Doyle in the 71st minute cancelled out debutant Bobby Zamora's first-half goal. Wolverhampton Wanderers, meanwhile, move up to 17th place thanks to a 2-1 win against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road. Norwich City move up to ninth place after a 2-0 win against Bolton at Carrow Road. Arsenal banged in seven goals against Blackburn Rovers at the Emirates Stadium to banish the disappointment of drawing away to Bolton Wanderers on Wednesday.
