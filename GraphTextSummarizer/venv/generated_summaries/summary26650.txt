Jack White, "Blunderbuss" -- 56,000 The onetime White Stripes frontman, who earned his first chart-topping week ever last week, dropped by 59 percent after last week's debut, still giving him 194,000 total in two weeks. It seems his late-in-the-game pop-oriented material, like Ryan Tedder tune "So Good" and Taylor Swift collaboration "Both of Us" (which debuts at number 8 on this week's Hot Digital Songs chart), helped lift the album's fortunes in the weeks leading to its release. Her current single "Good Girl" has climbed up to No. 8 on the country songs chart, and follow-up "Blown Away," which she performed on the Idol stage last week, kicks off its run at No. 22 on the Hot Digital Songs chart. Last week, it had sold roughly 8.9 million copies; now, it's rounding out on 9 million. B.o.B., "Strange Clouds" -- 76,000 The Atlanta rapper's sophomore album sold slightly fewer copies than his 2010 debut "B.o.B Presents: The Adventures Of Bobby Ray," which started at number one with sales of 84,000 and ended up selling about 597,000 copies total.
