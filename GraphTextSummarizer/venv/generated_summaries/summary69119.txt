The Turkish military bombed PKK rebel targets Saturday in northern Iraq in response to clashes that left at least 15 Turkish troops dead, the PKK and the military said Sunday. The Turkish military said the air operation was conducted on the PKK's "hiding positions" in the Avasin-Basyan area of northern Iraq near the border with Turkey. On Tuesday, the Turkish government is scheduled to vote on whether to extend the authority of the Turkish military to launch attacks on PKK positions in northern Iraq. But the PKK continues to operate in the Qandil Mountains in northern Iraq bordering Turkey and Iran. In February, Turkish military ground forces launched a weeklong offensive against the rebels in northern Iraq.
