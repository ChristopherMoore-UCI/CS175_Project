Sanchez has more than 400,000 followers on Twitter, but with limited access to the Internet in Cuba, she said she had been forced to communicate with the public by sending cell phone text messages that are uploaded to the social messaging service. -- Cuban dissident blogger Yoani Sanchez visited the White House on Wednesday, a milestone in her being allowed to travel outside the communist island. Sanchez said she was surprised to be able to travel, especially because some Cubans still face restrictions on leaving the country. While other government critics have left the country under the new law, Sanchez is the highest-profile figure in the dissident community to test the easing of restrictions. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden described Sanchez, a winner of the State Department's International Women of Courage Award, as "a respected advocate for the freedom of information." "The United States looks forward to the day when all Cubans will have the opportunity to express themselves in public without fear and we will continue to support policies that encourage the free flow of information to, from and within Cuba," Hayden said.
