-- It is twilight at Dodger Stadium, and a small army of U.S. Census workers has gathered in the vast empty parking lot. "We have noticed, with the economy the way it is, the caliber of person we have recruited for this census is remarkably better than we have seen in the past," said James Christie, director of operations for the the U.S. census' Western region. Their mission this spring evening is to find and count the tens of thousands of homeless people who call Los Angeles home. She has a doctorate in African history from Temple University. "I am very happy to have this job," said the 28-year-old Los Angeles native.
