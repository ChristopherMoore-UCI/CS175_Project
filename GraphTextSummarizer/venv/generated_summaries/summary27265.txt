The verdict makes Lee Seok-ki -- a member of South Korea's left-wing United Progressive Party -- the country's first sitting lawmaker to be convicted of treason since the 1980s. It said a strong penalty was inevitable because Lee's plot "posed substantial and clear threats to the existence of Korea and order of liberal democracy. The court was told that Lee thought that the heightened tensions could lead to war between the North and South, and he allegedly directed members of the group to attack major national facilities in the event of such a conflict. " Under South Korean criminal law, a crime of rebellion can be committed when more than two people gather to conspire treason. Lee was found guilty of leading a secret group of 130 members with alleged links to North Korea.
