On Saturday, there were more than 260 freeway crashes in Los Angeles County and unincorporated areas because of the rain, said California Highway Patrol Officer Ed Jacobs. About 5,000 customers lost power in southern California, said Steve Conroy of Southern California Edison, but noted that is a small percentage of the company's 5.4 million customers. The storms could be the strongest to hit southern California since January 2005, he said, when up to 32 inches of rain came in a five-day period. As of Sunday afternoon, the California Emergency Management Agency was reporting localized flooding across the state, prompting road closings in San Luis Obispo, Fresno, Tulare, Amador, Venture County, Kern County and Humboldt County. "It's going to be an all-day onslaught," said CNN Meteorologist Reynolds Wolf.
