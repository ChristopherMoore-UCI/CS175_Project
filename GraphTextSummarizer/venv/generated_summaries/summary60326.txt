He remains the club's most successful striker in European competition with 43 goals to his name, 70 in total following his time with Juventus Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson once joked that Inzaghi "must have been born offside," testament to the Italian's predatory instincts in front of goal. "AC Milan wishes to communicate that coach Clarence Seedorf has been sacked, and the first team has been entrusted to Pippo Inzaghi until June 30, 2016," said a Milan statement. Beaten in the second round of the European Champions League by Atletico Madrid last season, Milan has already begun preparations for next season, signing Paris Saint-Germain defender Alex last week on a two-year deal. Inzaghi's joy is his former teammate Clarence Seedorf's misery with the Dutchman dismissed after Milan finished eighth last season, ruling the club out of European football for the first time in 16 years. After arriving at Milan in 2001 following a move from Turin, Inzaghi won the 2003 Champions League and helped the Rossoneri repeat the triumph four years later by scoring both goals in the 2-1 win over Liverpool.
