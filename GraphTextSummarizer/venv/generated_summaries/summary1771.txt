On Friday, current Dartmouth students interrupted a welcome show for recently admitted students by chanting about aspects of student life they found troubling, such as issues around homophobia and sexual assault on campus. The online postings appeared on BoredAtBaker.com, a Dartmouth-exclusive forum where students post about happenings on campus, according to student Dani Valdes, 22. The decision to cancel classes was prompted by a series of threatening and abusive online posts that targeted the students who protested at the welcome show, a letter sent to Dartmouth students and faculty said. The alternative programming included a large meeting of faculty, a discussion facilitated by a social justice and diversity consultant, a community gathering, lunch and smaller 'teach-in' discussions led by Dartmouth faculty and staff. Although student protesters expected campus-wide reaction, they say were not anticipating the level of hostility they experienced.
