-- Pilot Peter Hertzak, a cosmetic surgeon, took off on a solo flight from Slidell Municipal Airport in Slidell, Louisiana, last Friday in his twin-engine Cessna 421C en route to Sarasota, Florida. When asked if the NTSB had any reason to believe the incident could have been a suicide, NTSB spokesman Eric Alleyne told CNN that was "beyond the scope of my investigation." Hertzak filed instrument flight rules and departed around 6:45 a.m. local time, the NTSB said. About 20 minutes later, the airplane began to "deviate from the air traffic control assigned altitude and route." According to the NTSB, the military pilots reported the airplane was "circling in a left hand turn at a high altitude, low airspeed and the windows were partially frosted over."
