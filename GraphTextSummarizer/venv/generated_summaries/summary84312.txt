The term -- white Hispanic -- emerged from the controversy over the fatal February 26 shooting of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Rather than just refer to Zimmerman as Hispanic and be done with it, they created the hybrid term white Hispanic. Are we now going to refer to people as white Hispanics and black Hispanics? Over the years, Americans have become familiar with terms such as "white" and "Hispanic" and even -- on government forms -- the more specific "non-Hispanic white." So they turned to the term white Hispanic.
