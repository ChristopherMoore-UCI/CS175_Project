One of the largest development will see property firm Mack Urban turn a collection of parking lots in the city's South Park district into 1,500 new apartments. " Greenland expects to spend up to a billion dollars on building the Metropolis and expects that projects like theirs -- along with planned infrastructure improvements like the LA streetcar project currently in build -- will make downtown living the next trend in Los Angeles. -- Los Angeles may have become famous for many things over the years -- Hollywood and the Oscars to name but two -- but downtown living is not one of them. The company intends to invest up to $750 million in South Park, enticed by the proximity of the nearby LA Live complex which includes the Staples Center -- home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, the Nokia Theatre, and several hotels, restaurants and bars. "What's driving investment and development here in South Park has really been the continuation of a massive investment that AEG (Anschutz Entertainment Group) made beginning with the development of the arena here in downtown," said Keller, in reference to the Staples Center.
