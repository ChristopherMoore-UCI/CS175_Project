" For King, Easter teaches us that death does not have the last word; that invisible forces are more real than the shadows that we currently inhabit; and that the darkness of Good Friday may be necessary but will eventually pass away. On April 27, 1957, Dr. King delivered an Easter sermon titled, "Questions that Easter Answers." "It says to us," King preached, "that love is the most durable power in the world" and is stronger "than all of the military giants, all of the nations that base their way on military power." For them, this holiest of days announces that death does not have the final word and that eternal life awaits those who would just believe. His sacrifice, along with countless others, helped usher in a new chapter in American life -- one that prepared the way for the election of our nation's first African-American president.
