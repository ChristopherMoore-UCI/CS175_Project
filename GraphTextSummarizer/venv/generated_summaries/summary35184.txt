-- Prosecutors say a 25-year-old Army private accused of aiding the nation's enemies through the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history "craved" notoriety. Morrow also said Manning helped WikiLeaks edit the cockpit video from a U.S. helicopter gunship attack that killed about a dozen people in Iraq, including two Reuters photojournalists, in 2007. Manning then started selecting information to reveal, believing that it would be better if it were public, Coombs said. The government said it contained classified information that Manning downloaded, and that forensic analysts would testify how they traced it back to him. Morrow said disclosures such as the video and other documents WikiLeaks released represented "potentially actionable information for targeting U.S. forces."
