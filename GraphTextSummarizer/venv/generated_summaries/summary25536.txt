Death sentence in Connecticut home invasion Home invasion victim's lengthy ordeal Dr. William Petit Jr. and photographer Christine Paluf were married Sunday, Petit's father told CNN in a telephone interview. In the 2007 incident, two men entered the Petit home, beat and tied up William Petit and forced Jennifer Hawke-Petit to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000. The foundation was established after Petit's first wife and their two daughters were killed in the family's home in Cheshire, Connecticut. The sole survivor of a 2007 Connecticut home invasion has remarried, his father said Tuesday.
