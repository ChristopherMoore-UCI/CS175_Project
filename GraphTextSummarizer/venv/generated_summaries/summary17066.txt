Facebook said it will continue to work with law enforcement and others in the industry to prevent future attacks. "As soon as we discovered the presence of the malware, we remediated all infected machines, informed law enforcement and began a significant investigation that continues to this day," Facebook Security said in the post. Facebook, the largest social network in the world, is the latest high-profile site to be hacked this year. The string of hacks have primarily exploited vulnerabilities in the programming language Java, which is installed on most computers by default. Twitter said that user names, encrypted passwords and e-mail addresses for as many as 250,000 users were potentially grabbed by the hackers. Apple turned off Java by default for its OS X users as a precaution.
