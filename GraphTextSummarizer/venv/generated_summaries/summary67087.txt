Shourd was released in 2010, and Bauer and Fattal were freed last year after 781 days in captivity and a trial for espionage that Bauer said was based on "ridiculous lies." Shourd, Bauer and a third hiker -- Josh Fattal -- were arrested after straying across the unmarked border between Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran in July 2009. Sarah Shourd and Shane Bauer married Saturday near the ocean, surrounded by some 200 family and friends, Ben Rosenfeld, a San Francisco attorney, said in a statement. "Friends and family assumed roles at their wedding, in the same spirit of community which suffuses Sarah and Shane's everyday lives, and which characterized the tireless broad support they received throughout their ordeal. Bauer proposed during their time in prison, fashioning an engagement ring from a thread of one of his shirts.
