Among jihadists, ISIS is no longer the pariah it once was and, whether we like it or not, this is a direct result of coalition planes dropping coalition bombs on jihadists in Syria. And it is not only al Qaeda affiliates that have made overtures to Syria's warring jihadists. Moving forward, it is imperative that the West -- the United States in particular -- rolls back its military involvement in Iraq and Syria and ups the ante in terms of its humanitarian and diplomatic efforts; the coalition must stop playing into the "Crusader" paradigm. Clearly, ISIS and al Qaeda are no longer as irreconcilable as many might have imagined back when the self-declared "caliphate" was inaugurated in June. Indeed, were ISIS and al Qaeda to cooperate in the pursuit of their often identical goal, the threat would be profoundly more difficult to resolve.
