Supermodel Gisele Bundchen struts her stuff a final time Bundchen was the highest-paid model in 2014, according to Forbes magazine, with a total $47 million in contracts. It's obvious that Tom Brady's love for his wife, model Gisele Bundchen, will never go out of fashion. Bundchen walked the runway for the last time Wednesday, and the New England Patriots quarterback wasn't just there to support her in person, he expressed his emotions to the world on Facebook. Based on an interview she did with Brazil's Estado de S. Paulo newspaper, sounds like more quality time with Brady and their children. Today after 20 years in the industry, it is a privilege to be doing my last fashion show by choice and yet still be working in other facets of the business," the Brazilian-born model wrote on Instagram.
