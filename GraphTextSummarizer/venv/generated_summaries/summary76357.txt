"There are a number of things we would like to see North Korea do in improving relations with South Korea first and foremost before we see other steps on other issues," Toner said. It was not known exactly when Jun would leave North Korea, but Toner said he would not be traveling with King. "We welcome North Korea's decision to release Eddie Jun," said State Department spokesman Mark Toner. -- A U.S. team led by envoy Robert King left North Korea on Saturday after winning the release of an American citizen who had been detained there, state media reported. He added that King was able to visit Jun on Thursday, and that it was the Swedish Embassy, which represents U.S. interests in North Korea, that confirmed the impending release to the American government Friday.
