-- Australia's Samantha Stosur produced one of the biggest shocks in U.S. Open final history, beating Serena Williams in straight sets at Flushing Meadows to secure her first Grand Slam success. "A code violation for expressing my opinion?, we're in America -- you're unattractive inside" Stosur then broke serve to take a 4-3 lead and broke Williams again to clinch a famous victory -- becoming the first Australian women's winner at Flushing Meadows since Margaret Court in 1973. But Stosur, whose only previous Grand Slam final appearance came last year when she lost the French Open to Francesca Schiavone, did not read the script, dominating the opening set against the 13-time Grand Slam champion, who had reached this stage without dropping a set in the tournament. " Stosur's victory means she joins Li Na and Petra Kvitova as first time Grand Slam winners this year. But Stosur never allowed the American, who was cheered on by a patriotic New York crowd on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, to settle -- claiming a spectacular  6-2 6-3 triumph in 73 minutes, as Williams lost her cool following a contentious umpiring decision.
