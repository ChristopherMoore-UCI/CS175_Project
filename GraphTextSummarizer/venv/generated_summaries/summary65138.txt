The Arena Fonte Nova is due to host three matches in the eight-nation Confederations Cup, considered a warmup for the 2014 World Cup also in Brazil, with the first to be played on June 20. But stadium administrators now face major repairs after a triangular tear appeared in one section of the roof on Monday as it buckled under the weight of rain water. The Confederations Cup pits continental champions against each other, with world champions Spain among the teams joining hosts Brazil. The arena, in the north-east city of Salvador, was the third purpose-built stadium to be inaugurated ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. -- Brazil's preparations for a major international soccer tournament have been hit by "human error" and heavy rain, which caused the roof of Salvador's host stadium to partially collapse.
