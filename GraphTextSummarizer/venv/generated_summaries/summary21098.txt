Von Brunn is accused of entering the museum in the afternoon and shooting Johns with a rifle, said Chief Cathy Lanier of the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department. "Your Constitution guarantees me a speedy and fair trial," he said from his wheelchair to U.S. District Judge Reginald Walton. -- James von Brunn, who was accused of killing a security guard at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in June, died Wednesday morning at a hospital in North Carolina, his attorney said. Before being moved, von Brunn was undergoing mental competency tests at a prison facility in Butner, North Carolina. A federal grand jury indicted von Brunn in July on murder charges in the death of Stephen Tyrone Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, the Justice Department said.
