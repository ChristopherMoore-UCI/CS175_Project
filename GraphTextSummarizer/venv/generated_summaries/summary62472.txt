" •"The Dark Knight Rises," while well-received, is not earning the same amount of feverishly strong word-of-mouth that propelled "The Dark Knight" into the box office stratosphere.

Two new openers are hitting theaters — sci-fi comedy "The Watch" and dance sequel "Step Up Revolution" — but they won't be any match for the second weekend of "The Dark Knight Rises." The studio had largely kept any images of alien invasion out of their advertising after John Carter and "Battleship's" back-to-back flops, which had studios hesitant to associate themselves with intergalactic creatures.
