"We are thrilled to work with Leftfield Pictures on this exciting and challenging new game show that combines the two elements that make 'Pawn Stars' an absolute fan favorite â€” history and the fun, family-dynamic between the Harrison's and Chumlee," said History's senior vp of programming Frontain Bryant in a statement. "This show gives viewers the chance to go head-to-head with the man who knows a little bit about everything, Rick Harrison, and take home treasurable items from the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawnshop." In each episode, contestants will compete against each other and the "Pawn Stars" cast in rounds of trivia questions that escalate in difficulty. History is set to announce "Pawnography," a game show version of its long-running hit "Pawn Stars." " EW: 'Pawn Stars' gets Cajun spin-off on History
