-- Giant jellyfish descend on the Sea of Japan, causing untold devastation to coastal villages and leaving a trail of destruction and human misery behind. The giant jellyfish are one of about 200 species of coastal jellyfish or large jellyfish that exist around the world. A diver attaches a sensor to a Nomura's jellyfish off the coast of northern Japan in October 2005. Monty Graham, a marine biologist at Alabama's Dauphin Island Sea Lab, said the jellyfish grow to an enormous size as they are transported by ocean currents. Fishermen often use expensive mazelike nets that stretch for hundreds of kilometers.
