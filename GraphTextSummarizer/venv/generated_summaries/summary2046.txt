Right now, second most dangerous is breast cancer for women and prostate cancer for men; and third is colorectal cancer for both men and women. This is unlikely to change by 2030, the researchers say, except for colorectal cancer, which is expected to be surpassed by thyroid, melanoma and uterine cancers in total number of cases. "The decrease in colorectal cancer, falling from the top four incidence and top two in deaths, seems to be primarily the result of advances in colorectal cancer screening," the report authors write. "And that's, of course, one of the biggest risk factors for cancer: Age." Lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers are currently the most common in the United States. And while thyroid cancer has a 98% five-year survival rate, only 6% of pancreatic cancer patients are alive five years after diagnosis.
