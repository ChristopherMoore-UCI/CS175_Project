CNN: Were you surprised to hear that "The House on Mango Street" was the list of banned books in Arizona? -- Chicana author Sandra Cisneros is perhaps best-known for her 1984 coming of age novel, "The House on Mango Street," a story about a young Latina who leaves behind her barrio for a chance at a better life. Cisneros: I'm read essays, poetry, fiction, art books and more all at the same time! California-based artist Ester Hernandez, known for her depiction of Latina and Chicana women through prints and pastels, represented the unique and colorful characters, all based on Cisneros' neighbors.
