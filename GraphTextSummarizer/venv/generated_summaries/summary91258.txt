In a 6-1 vote Tuesday night, members of the Coatesville Area School District board accepted the resignation of Superintendent Richard Como and high school Athletic Director Jim Donato, said the attorney, James Ellison. -- A Pennsylvania school board voted to accept the resignations of two school officials who have been accused of sending each other a series of racist and sexist text messages on district phones, the board's attorney said. The school board is working with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission to provide sensitivity training to faculty and staff members in the district, and guidance counselors and mental health specialists are on hand to assist students and staff, the district's acting superintendent, Angelo Romaniello, said in an open letter to the community Monday. "The racist and sexist language expressed by the two men was sickening and obviously unacceptable," board President J. Neil Campbell said in a written statement. The board does not believe any other school district employees were involved in the incident, according to the board statement.
