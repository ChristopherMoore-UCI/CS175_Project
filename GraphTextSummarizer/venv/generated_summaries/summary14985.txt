"There is no reason to believe there is any further danger to the communities or that there are any other suspects," Illinois State Police Lt. Col. Todd Kilby said Wednesday. Smith, last known to live in Morgan County, Illinois, forced his way through the back door of an apartment and shot six people inside with a shotgun, police said. Witnesses gave police a description of the vehicle in which the attacker fled, and police found Smith in an undisclosed location at about 7:15 a.m., Kilby said. The incident disrupted the village of about 290 people and surrounding communities, with area schools closing for the day, according to police in nearby Winchester. -- Five people were killed and a 6-year-old girl was taken to a hospital after a shooting in a tiny western Illinois village early Wednesday
