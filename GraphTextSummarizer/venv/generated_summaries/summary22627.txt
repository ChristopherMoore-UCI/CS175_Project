"This is an example of another successful prosecution that resulted from outstanding partnerships between the Muslim community and law enforcement," said Richard McFeely, FBI special agent in charge, in a Justice Department statement. During recorded conversations that followed with the source and later an undercover FBI agent, Martinez identified the recruiting station as a target and "spoke about his anger toward America, his belief that Muslims were being unjustly targeted and killed by the American military, and his desire to commit jihad to send a message that American soldiers would be killed unless the country stopped its 'war' against Islam," federal prosecutors said. Martinez was arrested in December 2010 after attempting to detonate an inert device supplied to him by an undercover FBI agent, authorities said. Together we are working to stop those that have perverted the Islamic faith into something it is not." Martinez's attorney argued in a December 2010 hearing that federal authorities set his client up in a sting operation. But Rod Rosenstein, the U.S. attorney in Baltimore, said at the time federal authorities "don't initiate these investigations unless there is a credible allegation that the defendant himself (has) already expressed an intent to cause harm.
