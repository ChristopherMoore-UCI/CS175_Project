But for one diehard UK football fan, his disillusionment with his beloved club is so great he is offering his support to the highest bidder on eBay. "With selling history and tradition the latest trend within football, I have decided to get on the bandwagon," writes lifelong Cardiff City fan Ben Dudley on his eBay page. "They said the color red is marketable in Asia, they think Asian fans and Malaysian fans won't care about Cardiff in a blue shirt but if they play in red at home they will suddenly take Cardiff as their team instead of Real Madrid or Barcelona. "Fans aren't really the priority in football anymore; it is all about money and trying to make money from TV deals. So much so that Dudley is willing to trade his dedication to the Bluebirds' cause to whoever stumps up the most cash in the internet auction, whether it is Premier League champions Manchester City or lowly Ross County in the far north of Scotland. It will look silly, a stadium of blue seats, fans in blue shirts and a team playing in red."
