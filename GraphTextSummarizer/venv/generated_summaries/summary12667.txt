Busquets free for Champions League final This current Barcelona side is being widely touted as the greatest to ever grace club football. Professor Simon Chadwick, author of the report, said: "Manchester United versus Barcelona is the dream final as far as most football fans are concerned. And with only German champions Borussia Dortmund sandwiched between Barcelona (79,000) and Manchester United (75,000) in Europe's average home attendance table, it means demand for final tickets is almost unprecedented. " Chadwick added: "Forbes magazine last year listed Manchester United as the most valuable sports brand on the planet, while Barcelona claimed eighth spot in the league table. Manchester United, the champions of England, face Barcelona, the champions of Spain, at London's famous Wembley Stadium for the right to be crowned Europe's best.
