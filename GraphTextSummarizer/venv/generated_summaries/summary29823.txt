Defense attorneys are mounting an insanity defense for  Brian Mitchell, 57, hoping to prove that mental illness clouded his mind to such a  degree that he did not understand that his actions were wrong when he abducted  and held Smart. For a time, Brian did change, said Tim Mitchell, though  his relationships with family members were often strained and laced with  suspicion. In spite of Barzee's agreement to testify, prosecutors in  Mitchell's federal trial did not call her to the stand, and she instead began  her testimony for the defense Thursday afternoon in a Salt Lake  City courtroom. Once, Tim Mitchell recalled, Brian constructed a hot-air balloon from  cloth and sent it flying; it landed squarely on top of their home and set the  roof on fire. -- When Wanda Barzee shared her story of an abusive marriage in a church-sponsored  counseling session in 1985, Brian David Mitchell took her hand to comfort her.
