On top of his leading role in Kenya Red Cross, he is also the vice president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, a position he holds since his election in November last year. He has established response centers and increased the number of available emergency vehicles with specialized equipment for advanced life support -- run out of Nairobi, the organization controls 53 ambulances, with another 75 arriving in June, and also leases emergency vehicles to counties that can't afford to purchase their own. As the head of Kenya Red Cross, he is on the front line of emergency response when disaster strikes in the country -- and this was no exception. " During Gullet's tenure in Kenya Red Cross, the disaster response organization has grown from an underfunded society to one which now operates with more than $23 million in assets. Community support is paramount in emergency situations, and during Westgate Gullet says that he couldn't have asked for a better response.
