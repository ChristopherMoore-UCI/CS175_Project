-- Pakistan's Foreign Ministry summoned the U.S. ambassador Friday to protest a drone strike as the death toll from that attack rose to 44, Pakistani intelligence officials said. Two intelligence officials said the drone fired two missiles on a jirga meeting in North Waziristan, one of the seven districts of Pakistan's volatile tribal region bordering Afghanistan. Foreign Secretary Salman Bashir summoned Ambassador Cameron Munter to make a "strong protest" regarding the Thursday drone strike in Pakistan's remote tribal area, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The attack also unleashed tribal fury, with regional elders vowing revenge on the United States for the strike. Tribal elders from the region where the drone strike happened vowed to take revenge on America, saying they will unleash their family members as suicide bombers because of the drone strike.
