" "Every day we are talking to women about the issues we all care about -- empowering women at work and at home, creating good paying jobs, building the economy, increasing workplace flexibility, addressing workplace discrimination and modernizing job training," said GOP spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski. Women have provided Democrats a boost in recent elections, including in 2012, when 55% voted for Obama in that year's presidential contest. -- Democrats were making an election-year pitch to women on Friday, mindful of their past advantage among the voting bloc and hoping to convince enough women to cast ballots for their candidates in November's mid-term contests. But as Obama's poll numbers have slid, so, too, has his support among women. The most recent CNN survey of Obama's popularity showed 55% of women disapproved of how Obama is handling his job -- the same percentage that voted for him in 2012.
