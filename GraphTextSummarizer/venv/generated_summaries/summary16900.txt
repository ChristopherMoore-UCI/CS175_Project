The latest incidents of shots fired at police come after New York police Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu were gunned down in their patrol car on December 20. Two Los Angeles police officers were shot at Sunday night while they drove their patrol car in the southern part of the city, police said. LAPD Detective Megan Aguilar told CNN that investigators have "nothing to indicate that there's a nexus" between the shooting and recent nationwide protests against police brutality that have fueled animosity toward police. And there was a second incident over the weekend in which police were fired at, this one in Florida on Sunday morning. On Monday, police reopened access to streets inside a six-block perimeter they set up overnight.
