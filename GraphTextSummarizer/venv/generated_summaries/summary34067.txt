Death threats The killing of the Copenhagen Zoo's Marius opened wide divisions between animal lovers and zoo officials concerned about maintaining the genetic diversity of giraffes in the program. Jyllands Park Zoo said Thursday it may also have to "euthanize" one of its male giraffes -- coincidentally, also named Marius -- if a female is brought in to breed. "Our giraffes are part of an international breeding program, which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes," he said. When giraffes breed as well as they do now, then you will inevitably run into so-called surplus problems now and then. Just days after the Copenhagen Zoo killed a male giraffe named Marius to avoid inbreeding, another zoo said it might follow suit.
