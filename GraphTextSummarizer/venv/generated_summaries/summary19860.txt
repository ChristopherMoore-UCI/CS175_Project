You know, I will wake up in the morning, and I won't be able to see my daddy.'" Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson were initially kept in an SUV outside of the emergency room after they followed the ambulance carrying their father to the hospital, Trent Jackson said. Trent Jackson, who drove Katherine Jackson to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where doctors were trying to revive her son, said Murray did not have a conversation with Paris Jackson, the 12-year-old daughter, as he told police. Murray never spoke to Michael Jackson's mother at the emergency room, contrary to his statement to police, Trent Jackson said. "Perfect storm" of drugs killed Jackson, sleep expert says Jackson family members were upset that jurors may sympathize with Murray because of perceived compassion for the children that day, Jackson told CNN.
