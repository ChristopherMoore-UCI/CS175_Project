-- Two years ago, Carlo Ratti, the head of MIT's Senseable City Lab, decided to find out what happened when city residents disposed of trash. " Ratti, a civil engineer and architect, spoke at the TED2011 conference in Long Beach, California, in March and was interviewed by CNN. As computer technology has advanced in past decades, cities have been transformed into digital networks that can be analyzed and activated to improve urban living, Ratti said. "When you have all these traces of trash moving around," said Ratti, "you can ask yourself how can we make the system more efficient. Among other projects he has worked on was the "Digital Water Pavilion," a building built for an expo in Zaragoza, Spain, with exterior and internal walls produced by flowing water controlled by a computerized system.
