The report, from the Global Campaign for Education based in South Africa, ranked countries on factors including access to basic education, teacher-to-student ratio and educational provision for girls. The campaign is calling on world leaders meeting at the Millennium Development Goals summit in New York this week to make funding for education a priority to meet a target of universal access to basic schooling by 2015. The campaign said greater access to education can also result in significant health improvements. "The report shows that delivering education for all is highly achievable and brings other poverty dividends -- such as reducing HIV deaths by 7 million and doubling child survival by 50 percent -- if mothers are educated." -- A new report released Monday lists Somalia, Eritrea and Haiti among the world's worst places to be a school child because of poor access to education.
