After the failures of cap and trade and the United Nations climate treaty, nuclear energy could be a place where left and right find common ground on energy. Some people believe that we can solve climate change by reducing global energy demand and switching to solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. As much as we might instinctively prefer renewable energy sources like solar and wind to meet this energy demand, last year solar provided a mere 0.1 percent of America's electricity, while wind provided just 3.5 percent -- and that is after at least $34 billion was funneled into clean energy projects from the Obama stimulus package. Meanwhile, 19% of U.S. electricity comes from nuclear power plants; that number rises to 60% among clean energy sources. We need all the help we can get from renewable energy, but it's a risky bet that wind and solar alone will be able to provide 100% of America's energy, let alone meet a global energy demand three times the size it is today.
