Hermann's appointment as the school's athletic director came more than a month after a video of a Rutgers coach hurling basketballs and yelling homophobic slurs prompted the coach's firing, the resignation of the school's athletic director and sharp criticism from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. I intend to take that passion and hard-earned experience into my leadership role as athletic director of Rutgers University." Rutgers University President Robert l. Barchi said Monday that he stands by the school's choice. Word that Rutgers picked Hermann to turn around the school's athletic program after an abuse scandal came as a surprise to Kim Obiala, one of the players who said she wrote the letter about her coaching in 1997. Another allegation from Hermann's past came up at a news conference after Rutgers announced her hiring. "It was recorded nearly 20 years ago and I simply did not recall the video tape until I saw it in media reports." Obiala told CNN that she and her former teammates aren't trying to create problems for Hermann.
