Watch a Bosnia concentration camp survivor describe the torture and rape she witnessed » About 5,200 people out of the 8,000 executed at Srebrenica have been identified with the help of ICMP, but new mass graves continue to be found and more remains are delivered to the facility in Lukavac to be matched. Mass graves were dug up and the bodies moved sometimes again and again, to hide evidence as the Serbs retreated amid the NATO bombing that followed Srebrenica and led to the end of the war. The bones are from more than 8,000 men and boys slaughtered in 1995 during the Bosnian war at Srebrenica in the worst massacre in Europe since World War II. The killers -- Serbs seeking to drive out Bosnian Muslims in a policy of "ethnic cleansing" -- executed the region's fighting-age males, then used bulldozers to dump them into mass graves.
