Former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo told reporters that talks between Nkunda and Congo's government are progressing. Fighting broke out in eastern Congo at the end of August between government forces and Nkunda's rebels. The rebel leader has also urged the Congo government to find ways to protect minority groups in the country, Obasanjo said. Nkunda says his forces are fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from Hutu militants who escaped to Congo. Nakunda "has made demands that I do not consider outrageous and demands that the government of Congo can meet," said Obasanjo.
