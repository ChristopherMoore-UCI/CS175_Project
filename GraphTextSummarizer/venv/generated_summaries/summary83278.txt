It said that Syrian forces in Damascus had publicly executed at least 10 people in one town, and that residents were unable to reach the bodies because "regime forces have been firing at anything that moves," the LCC said. A spokesman for the ministry said Bouthaina Shaaban, al-Assad's political and media adviser, will meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi. "To promote the political solution to the Syria problem, China has always actively balanced its work between the Syrian government and the opposition to urge Syria to put to practice (former Arab League and U.N. envoy Kofi) Annan's suggestions and advice by the U.N. Security Council -- immediately cease fire and all violent actions, protect civilians and resolve the crisis through talks," the spokesman said. At least 70 people were killed Tuesday, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria opposition group said. While the war rages on, Syrian rebels claimed one of their biggest achievements yet Monday -- the shooting down of a military jet.
