One caveat: there are no strollers allowed so be prepared to carry younger kids or distract them by throwing pennies into the countless underground pools along the guided path. -- Traveling with young children is an imperfect art. It's an apt metaphor for modern American family life, especially when you're planning spring break on the road with young children.
