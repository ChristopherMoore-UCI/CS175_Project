It's "a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" to head off development on the swath of land in south-central New Mexico that has "unique Pre-American, New Mexican, and American history," the monument's official website says. The Bureau of Land Management operates 19 national monuments across nine Western states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Washington. Carney cited an independent study that found the monument could generate $7.4 million "in new economic activity annually from new visitors and business opportunities, while preserving access for sportsmen, ranchers and recreational users." The monument is apparently smaller than what some in New Mexico had sought. The United States has 77 other national monuments, according to the organization National Park Advocates, which operates nationalparkstraveler.com.
