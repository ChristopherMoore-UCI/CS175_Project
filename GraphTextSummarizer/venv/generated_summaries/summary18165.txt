However, "people's safety is our number one concern, so we want to stress how important it is for the public to stay off these levees as we continue to assess the risk," said Omaha Corps District Commander Col. Bob Ruch. The second breach was located just south of Atchison, in Holt County, Missouri, said Holt County clerk Kathy Kunkel. -- Two Missouri River levees broke Monday along the swollen Missouri River near the Iowa-Missouri border, a local official and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said. The break was in Atchison County, Missouri, just south of Hamburg, Iowa, it said. The National Weather Service warned that flooding could affect Interstate 29 and the town of Hamburg.
