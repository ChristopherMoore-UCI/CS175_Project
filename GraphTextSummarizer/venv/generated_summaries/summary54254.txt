Ejiofor was nominated for a best actor Oscar for his performance as Solomon Northup, the protagonist of last year's best picture. The Marvel movie, slated for release in 2016, finally landed Benedict Cumberbatch as the mysterious title character. Of course, there's still a long time between now and November 4, 2016, "Strange's" proposed release date, and negotiations with Cumberbatch were rumored for months before being confirmed. If Ejiofor does join the cast, he'll be reunited with Cumberbatch, who was one of his co-stars in "12 Years a Slave." Now it appears that Oscar-nominated actor Chiwetel Ejiofor may be joining the cast, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
