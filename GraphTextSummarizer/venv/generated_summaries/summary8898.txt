The church will be filled with members of every faith from greater Boston. In the year that has followed the bombing, Temple Israel of Boston was honored to host Imam Suhaib Webb of the Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center for a special service celebrating the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. As we remember the lives taken a year ago in Boston, we also mourn and pray for the victims and their families in Kansas. If the goal of the tragedy in Boston or the most recent act of despicable violence in Kansas is to sow fear and to divide us against one another, then our own lived experience is a testament to their failure. One of us is a pastor and the other a rabbi of congregations in and near Boston.
