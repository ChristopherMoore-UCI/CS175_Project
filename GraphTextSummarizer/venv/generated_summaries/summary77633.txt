Another way to grab fans' attention is food, and Robert Rodriguez's upcoming "Machete" had a taco stand set up on Thursday night, along with an outdoor screening of new footage. This year, there is a scavenger hunt of sorts on Twitter, where attentive fans can gain access to special events inside the arcade, which reveal secrets of the film, among other things. In a surprise on Thursday night, some audience members to the panel for "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" --- in which star Michael Cera arrived in a Captain America costume --- were given the chance to see the entire movie early at a nearby theater. "Green Lantern" starring Ryan Reynolds, and the next two Marvel Comics adaptations, "Thor" and "Captain America: The First Avenger" still have their Hall H presentations coming up over the weekend. "We tried to take risks and make something interesting, and also make something that is worth this amount of money," said the Hornet himself, Seth Rogen, gesturing towards the cars.
