A possible tornado caused "major damage" to a mobile home park near Opelika, Alabama, with homes and vehicles demolished, the weather service said, citing an emergency manager in Lee County. In North Carolina, an apparent tornado in Davidson County south of Winston-Salem damaged "multiple structures," but there were no reports of injuries, according to state emergency management spokeswoman Julia Jarema. Four people were injured in Mississippi, but their injuries were not critical, according to National Weather Service reports. Downed trees, damaged homes and buildings, and power outages were reported across north, central and west Alabama and Georgia, including in metro Atlanta, from high winds and possible twisters.
