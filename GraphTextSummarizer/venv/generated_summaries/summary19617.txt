-- Soccer star Lionel Messi and his father testified in a Barcelona court Friday in a preliminary hearing over allegations they defrauded Spanish tax authorities of more than $5 million. Inside the court, Messi's father testified that he was in charge of the finances, and any blame would be his, and Lionel Messi was not involved, according to a prosecutor who talked to an ad hoc pool of Spanish journalists, Linan said. Messi, a four-time world player of the year, arrived later and video images of the scene showed a crowd gathered to cheer on, and seek autographs from, the star who's helped FC Barcelona stay atop the Spanish league standings this season. Prosecutors proposed that both Messi and his father would plead guilty to tax evasion in the hearing, and would likely be fined about $10 million and receive a one-year sentence, which would not require time in prison because they have no prior convictions, the spokesman said. "We have always fulfilled all our tax obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take care of clarifying this situation," Messi posted on his Facebook page last June.
