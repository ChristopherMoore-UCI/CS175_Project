Walker's ex-cop character, Brian O'Conner, was central to five of the first six "Fast & Furious" stories, and his death left the future of the next film in doubt. That's what "Fast & Furious" actor Vin Diesel told fans Sunday night about the franchise's seventh installment. The movie had been scheduled for a July 2014 release, but production was put on hold following Walker's sudden death. Walker, 40, and the rest of the "Fast & Furious" cast were on a short break for Thanksgiving when he stepped into a red 2005 Porsche Carerra GT for a short ride around a Santa Clarita, California, business park. Investigators believe the car, driven by Walker's friend, was speeding when it clipped a light pole and was engulfed in flames, killing both men.
