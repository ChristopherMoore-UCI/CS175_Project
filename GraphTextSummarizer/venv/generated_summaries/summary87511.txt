Now 47, Yates "has not been seen or been a part of any portion of society for the last 11 years," Parnham said Thursday. "It is a recommendation of the doctors that she be permitted to attend, and of course she wants to," attorney George Parnham said. During her first trial in 2002, jurors heard taped interviews in which Yates said that she thought Satan was sending her messages and that she was sending her children -- Noah, 7; John, 5; Paul, 3; Luke, 2; and Mary, 6 months -- to heaven and sparing them from hell when she killed them on June 20, 2001. "Mental illness is the culprit" in the deaths, Parnham told CNN affiliate KPRC this week. Parnham argued Yates was suffering from a "full-blown psychosis."
