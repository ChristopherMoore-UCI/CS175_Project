Eight years ago, Nyirumbe started the school in Gulu to help poor young girls and women caught in the middle of the decades-long Ugandan civil war. But Sister Rosemary Nyirumbe sees pop-tops as a way to help hundreds of women in Gulu, Uganda, start a new life. It also provides free medical care and teaches the mothers valuable life skills, such as sewing, cooking and cleaning. " Donations for Nyirumbe's school can be made through the Rural Hospital Relief Fund. "It raised a lot of awareness about what we're doing, because after that, it exposed me to many people in the world," she said.
