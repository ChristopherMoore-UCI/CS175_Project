Boxing legend Muhammad Ali is back at home following several days in the hospital, a family spokesman said Friday. Bob Gunnell said Ali is looking forward to gathering with family and friends to watch a college basketball game Saturday between the Duke Blue Devils and his hometown team, the Louisville Cardinals. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory over Sonny Liston. Ali, who has Parkinson's disease and received follow-up care for a urinary tract infection this week at an undisclosed hospital, was released as expected Friday, the day before his 73rd birthday. Shortly thereafter, he changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam.
