-- After rumblings across the financial markets in the last few months, art dealers from around the world have gathered in London for the city's premier contemporary art fair Frieze in hopes of shifting an estimated $350 million USD (according to art insurers Hiscox) worth of art. And established, historical art is often a surer outlay for those looking to invest in art as a tangible asset, Adam explained, though she stressed that investors are different from collectors, who buy art in theory because they love it. But while the art fair world is highly competitive, Siddall stressed that Frieze Masters will be different from more traditional fairs of arts and antiquities, such as Masterpiece in London and TEFAF in Maastricht, the Netherlands. "I think London has traditionally been the international center for historical arts and a big center of that market, which is why it makes sense for us to have (Frieze Masters)," she said. "The fact of it is that the art fair world is highly competitive and it's actually overcrowded," said Georgina Adam, art market Editor-at-Large for the Art Newspaper.
