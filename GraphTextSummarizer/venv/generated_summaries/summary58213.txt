European Union officials in Kosovo have said that anyone with concrete evidence of war crimes or organized crime should come forward. Last month, European authorities charged in a report that executives who control Kosovo may have stolen organs when the Kosovo Liberation Army was fighting Serbian forces in the late 1990s. Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thaci called it "a political accusation based on no facts or proof" and "pure fabrication." The report said Thaci, a former leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, was the "boss" of a prominent faction in the militia that "apparently wrested control" of "illicit criminal enterprises" from rivals across the border in Albania. The offenses listed by Interpol: crimes against life and health, people smuggling, trafficking and illegal immigration.
