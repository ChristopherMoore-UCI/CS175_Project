And on Saturday, Palm Bay police announced on the department's Facebook page that McCarty was being charged with two counts of murder in connection with her children's deaths. All three of that woman's children were unresponsive when officers encountered them Friday evening, including a 7-year-old girl who was reported dead soon thereafter, according to the Palm Bay police department. Their mother, identified by police as Jessica Lacey McCarty, didn't comply to officers' request that she drop her knife. McCarty's boyfriend -- the father of one of the children -- placed his own call to police seconds later, after arriving home to the grim scene. After initially being taken to a hospital after suffering what police called "non-life threatening injuries," McCarty was moved to the Brevard County Detention Center, where she's being held without bond.
