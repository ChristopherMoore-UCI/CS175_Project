Bigger fishes can swim away from the deluge of fresh water, but smaller coral reef fish may suffer the same fate as the corals they live around, says Brodie. The whole of the inner-shore reef lagoon filled with river water," says Jon Brodie, Principle Researcher for the James Cook University's Australian Center for Tropical Freshwater Research. Other marine species can actually benefit from floods. The mix of nutrients, sediment and pesticides from agricultural run-off, plus currently unknown amounts of trace metals from flooded mines, will likely have an immediately devastating impact on corals and sea grasses, says Brodie. The immediate death of corals and sea grass is expected, which could then have a devastating affect on other marine creatures like dugongs that feed on sea grass.
