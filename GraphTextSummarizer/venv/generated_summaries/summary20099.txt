Kerviel, a former employee of French bank Societe Generale, went on trial in June on charges of forgery, breach of trust and unauthorized computer use. Kerviel had pleaded guilty to the charge of computer abuse, but Metzner had asked jurors in his closing arguments to acquit his client of the charges of breach of trust and forgery. Trader Jerome Kerviel was found guilty of all charges Tuesday for betting 50 billion euros ($61 billion) of a French bank's money without its knowledge. Societe Generale, which said it discovered the losses in January 2008, said that at no time were supervisors aware of Kerviel's alleged unlawful activities. Metzner previously told CNN that Kerviel's behavior was strongly influenced by the environment at Societe Generale.
