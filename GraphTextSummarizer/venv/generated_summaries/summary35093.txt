"Government is not the solution to our problem," President Ronald Reagan said, "Government is the problem." It is not surprising that the conservative movement flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, two decades that witnessed a sharp decline in public trust of government institutions. Even the most routine budgeting decisions turn into high-stakes showdowns with threats of default and government shutdowns. The result is that the key agencies of government are steadily weakened. A CNN/ORC poll recently found that only 15% of the public trusts government to do what is right always or most of the time, a notable decline from the 25% level in September 2010.
