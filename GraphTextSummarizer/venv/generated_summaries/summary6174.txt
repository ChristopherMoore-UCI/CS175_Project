-- A plane carrying U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords departed Houston on Wednesday headed for Florida, where she is scheduled to attend the Friday launch of the space shuttle Endeavour, commanded by her husband, Mark Kelly. According to a senior administration official, President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters Malia and Sasha will also watch the launch in person.; " Earlier this month, CNN's Sanjay Gupta visited Giffords' medical team in Tucson, including Dr. Peter Rhee, the trauma chief at University Medical Center, where she was first treated. Giffords will not make a statement or meet with the media while she is at Kennedy Space Center, officials said. Her staffers put a picture taken from the plane on Twitter, saying she "is looking forward to some time away" from TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston.
