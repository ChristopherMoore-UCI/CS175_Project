"The Arns family hopes that this awakening of international solidarity will continue beyond the tragedy imposed by nature, always in defense of full dignity to people," Flavio Arns said. Her nephew, Brazilian Sen. Flavio Arns, told the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency that her death came after she finished a speech at a church. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is among dignitaries who will attend Arns' wake Friday in Brazil, according to the Children's Pastoral Web site. For her work in Haiti, Arns earned comparisons to India's Mother Teresa, according to local media. Brazilians were shocked at the loss of Arns, who founded a well-known charity in Haiti called Children's Pastoral.
