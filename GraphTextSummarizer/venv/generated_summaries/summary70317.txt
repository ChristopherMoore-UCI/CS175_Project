Traditionally, several months separate the commercial launch of new cell network infrastructure and the release of phones that use it. Last week, Verizon added nine new towns to its 4G map and expanded coverage in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, New Orleans and Philadelphia. For a conference in February, a prototype version of the new LG phone was picked to demonstrate an Internet calling service from Verizon that is expected to debut next year. But AT&T said in January that LTE phones would launch sometime in the second half of the year. That's the same price as HTC's ThunderBolt, which was the first 4G phone on Verizon, and $50 less than the Droid Charge from Samsung Electronics, which also came out this month.
