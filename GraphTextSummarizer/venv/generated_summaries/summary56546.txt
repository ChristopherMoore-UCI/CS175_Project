-- Secret Service investigators interviewed Omar Gonzalez twice, well before he scaled a White House fence with a large knife in his pocket, determining both times that they didn't have enough reason to keep him, a law enforcement official told CNN on Tuesday. Gonzaelez, a 42-year-old Iraq war veteran who apparently suffers from PTSD, hopped the north fence late last Friday and sprinted just inside the north portico White House doors before being stopped, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary has said. The discovery of the map led Secret Service investigators to ask Gonzalez standard protective intelligence questions and then let him go after determining that he did not pose a threat to the President, according to the law enforcement official. Just over a month later, on August 25, Secret Service agents stopped Gonzalez outside the White House's South Lawn after noticing he was carrying a camping hatchet. Once again, Secret Service investigators talked to Gonzalez at the agency's Washington field office.
