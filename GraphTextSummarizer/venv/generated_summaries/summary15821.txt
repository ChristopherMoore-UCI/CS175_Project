The seemingly never-ending search for the remains of missing Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa hit another dead end Tuesday when soil results taken from the grounds of a home in Michigan showed no evidence that human remains were buried on the property. Vanished Hoffa still fascinates after almost 40 years Berlin said the "timeline doesn't really add up" because the tipster said he went to the house to repay a bookie -- who didn't live at that address until years after Hoffa disappeared. "Every couple of years this happens, and all you guys come out here and we have to relive it." Hoffa was one of the most powerful union leaders at a time when unions wielded enormous political sway. He was there ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Anthony Giacalone and Genovese crime family figure Anthony Provenzano, who was also a chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey. " Urban lore long suggested that Hoffa was buried around the end zone at the former Giants Stadium in New Jersey.
