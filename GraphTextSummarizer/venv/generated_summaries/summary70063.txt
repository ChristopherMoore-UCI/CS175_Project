"I believe Roger thinks in his mind he can win anything," said Bollettieri, who also helped develop grand slam champions such as Jim Courier, Monica Seles, and Mary Pierce. " Much has been made of the impact Ivan Lendl has had on Murray since becoming his coach in December 2011, but Bollettieri suggested Paul Annacone, who began working with Federer in August 2010, also deserves credit for persuading the four-time Laureus World Sportsman of the Year to adopt a more aggressive approach. While labeling Federer as "beyond description," Bollettieri stressed that Murray's gritty performance in the Wimbledon final bodes well for the future. " Australian tennis coach Pete McCraw, who has also worked with Bollettieri, is equally encouraging about Murray's future. "I believe Roger is the best player to have ever played the game," American tennis coach Nick Bollettieri told CNN.
