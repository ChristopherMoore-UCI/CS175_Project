-- Penn State's Board of Trustees on Friday authorized the school to offer settlements to some of the men who say former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky abused them. The settlement offers apply to a number of people who have made claims against Penn State arising from the Sandusky case, the board said. "Today's action is yet another important step toward the resolution of claims from Sandusky's victims," Penn State President Rodney Erickson said in a statement. The sex abuse scandal led to the 2011 firing of Penn State's head football coach, Joe Paterno, and the ouster of the university's longtime president, Graham Spanier.
