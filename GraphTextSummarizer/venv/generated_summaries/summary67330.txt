" Shackleford held off Kentucky Derby winner Animal Kingdom in the Preakness Stakes in May. It was an astonishing win in a race billed earlier as a rematch between rival horses Shackleford and Animal Kingdom, both of which had been competing to win a second leg of the Triple Crown. " said Ruler on Ice jockey Jose Valdivia, his voice breaking with happy emotion. "We always had a lot of confidence in this colt and we can't be more thrilled with the outcome," said Ruler on Ice owner George Hall. Animal Kingdom nearly tossed his jockey at the start and fell behind early, while Shackleford came out of the gate strong and held the lead for much of the race.
