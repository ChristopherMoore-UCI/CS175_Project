Though soccer reigns in most Latin American countries, it is baseball that rules in Venezuela, which routinely feeds players to major league teams in the United States. "Government, please do something because Venezuela is crumbling with so much insecurity while you say that Venezuela is safe," Venezuelan baseball player Jose Castillo wrote on his Twitter account. Those dangers have led many American teams to abandon their baseball academies in Venezuela, said Arturo Marcano, a lawyer and sports columnist who co-authored a book about the recruitment of players from Venezuela. As Venezuela's economy has stagnated in recent years, crimes such as kidnapping and murder have risen. When major league teams noticed the talent sitting in places like the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, they increased their investment in the region.
