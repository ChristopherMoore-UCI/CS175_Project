I called my good friend Joanne Gabbin from Furious Flower Poetry Center to have her come with me to Doc's to cook. Everyone came to Doc's place, which was great fun. We often attended readings, but the first time she absolutely caught my attention was at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. It wasn't all that cold, but Maya and others had fur coats on. -- I must have met Doc, as we called Maya Angelou, way before I remember.
