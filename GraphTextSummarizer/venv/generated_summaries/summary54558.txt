Theoretically, once Jarvis and other neuroscientists fully understand this genetic blueprint, they can alter it and, in the process, make it easier to learn new languages and possibly even repair brain damage. By casting her economist's eyes on the issue, Oster has forced the old turf-guarders to reevaluate their approaches to AIDS in Africa and come up with new solutions. Jarvis has been studying songbirds' brains for insight into human linguistics, and his research has led to a startling discovery: Birds use two distinct neural pathways to learn songs -- one in the front of the brain and one in the back. The VW drives itself thanks to state-of-the-art road-finding and obstacle-avoidance software, along with radar systems, video screens, and laser range finders. Pardis Sabeti, biological anthropologist Pulling a typical all-nighter in med school, Pardis Sabeti achieved a not-so-typical feat -- she confirmed the effects of genetics on the evolution of human diseases.
