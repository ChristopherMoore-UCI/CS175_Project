Ben LaBrecque received several mailings and phone calls from the Romney campaign. In addition to multiple mailings from the Romney campaign, the vice president of sales and marketing at the Institute for Environmental Education also received several survey calls. Romney may have blitzed the state with mailings and phone calls. The glossy fliers with images of Romney and quotes from people supporting him didn't win over Republican Fred Ashfar. Mailings, robocalls, phone surveys, doorknob hangers, mass e-mails, texts -- it's next to impossible to find a registered Republican or independent voter in the Granite State who hasn't received several of each.
