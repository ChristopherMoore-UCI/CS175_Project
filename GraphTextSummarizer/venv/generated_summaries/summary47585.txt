"Most of the Democrats' loss of support has come among younger Americans," said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. -- As Congress comes back after a two-week recess, a national poll indicates the honeymoon may be over for congressional Democrats, although they maintain a decided advantage over the GOP. That's down eight points from February, but it's 25 points higher than the 37 percent who feel the Republicans in Congress are doing enough to reach out to Democrats and the president. Democrats won back control of both houses of Congress in the 2006 elections, and increased their majorities in November's elections. "The increase in overall views of Congress is due mostly to Democrats," Holland said.
