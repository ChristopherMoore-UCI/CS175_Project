"We do not have containment on the lines that could affect structures, and we have downed power lines," Cal Fire spokeswoman Joann Cartoscelli said, explaining why the evacuations will continue through the night. The Applegate Fire -- centered in Placer County, about 40 miles northeast up Interstate 80 from Sacramento -- had burned 420 acres and was 20% contained as of late Thursday afternoon, according to Cal Fire's website. The blaze has also affected I-80, which had one lane open eastbound in the hardest hit area as of late Thursday afternoon. According to Cal Fire, more than 1,200 personnel are devoted to fighting the blaze. Five homes in the small community of Applegate have been destroyed, and many more are at risk.
