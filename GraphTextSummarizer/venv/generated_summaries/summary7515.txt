-- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said Monday she had to hold her tongue when a male labor leader made comments about her post-pregnancy weight shortly after she began her career in Congress. She has faced some criticism in recent weeks for not naming the individuals who have made such comments, as some of them have come from colleagues on Capitol Hill, she has said. While promoting her book, "Off the Sidelines," the Democratic senator from New York has been vocal lately about remarks she and other women hear about their physical appearances. "I've just had a baby, I've just been appointed [to the Senate], I have a lot to learn, so much on my plate, and this man basically says to me, 'You're too fat to be elected statewide,'" she said on HuffPost Live, a webcast. "A statement about a woman's looks -- positive or negative -- can be very undermining to her credibility," Gillibrand said Monday.
