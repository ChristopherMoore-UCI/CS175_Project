-- Happy Taylor Swift album release day! 'Red,' from 2012, was her 'Purple Rain,' a sprawling I-am-the-cosmos epic with disco banjos and piano ballads and dubstep drops. Rolling Stone's Rob Sheffield writes in his review that "Swift has already written enough great songs for two or three careers. Billboard's Jem Aswad declared the album "Swift's best work -- a sophisticated pop tour de force that deserves to be as popular commercially as with Robyn-worshipping bloggers; an album that finds Swift meeting Katy (Perry) and Miley (Cyrus) and Pink on their home turf and staring them down. With her first purely pop album, Swift is winning raves.
