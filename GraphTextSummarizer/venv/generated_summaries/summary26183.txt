Soon after the photos came out, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took legal action against Closer -- which was fined by a French court and ordered not to distribute the edition in print or online. The magazine, Chi, said Tuesday that it will print "extraordinary images of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their dream holiday in the Caribbean" in the issue coming out Wednesday. The highest-profile example came in September 2012, when the French magazine Closer ran photographs of Catherine privately sunbathing topless while on a holiday with William in France. St. James's Palace -- which represents Catherine, her husband, Prince William, and his brother, Harry -- responded with dismay. British and U.S. media -- including People, like CNN a division of Time Warner -- reported that the royal couple recently vacationed on the secluded Caribbean isle of Mustique.
