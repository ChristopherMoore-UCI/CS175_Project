Consider what the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, the former Chicago, Illinois, pastor whose relationship with Barack Obama became an issue in the presidential election, recently told the Virginia newspaper, the Daily Press, when asked if he speaks to Obama.

The alleged assailant is James von Brunn, a Holocaust denier who created an anti-Semitic Web site.
