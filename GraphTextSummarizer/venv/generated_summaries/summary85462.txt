Riders lined up at the roller coaster just after Six Flags Over Texas opened at 10:30 a.m., and long lines were still there by evening, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. -- The Texas Giant roller coaster reopened Saturday with improved safety measures and long lines of eager riders, nearly two months after a woman plunged to her death while on the ride. Texas state officials have approved the reopening of the ride, the statement said, adding that it had undergone extensive testing. " Park officials said in a statement Tuesday that an investigation at the Arlington, Texas, park revealed that there had been no mechanical failure on the ride, but it declined to release more information because of pending litigation. "You can tell they're being extra-careful," one rider told WFAA of park officials Saturday.
