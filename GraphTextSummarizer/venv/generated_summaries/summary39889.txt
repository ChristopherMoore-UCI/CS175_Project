"It is truly a painful day for the Pennsylvania Game Commission," said department spokesman Jerry Feaser. Authorities detained Christopher Lynn Johnson, 27, early Friday, and were in the processing of bringing charges against him in the case, according to Adams County District Attorney Shawn Wagner. David L. Grove, 31, was fatally shot in Freedom Township near Gettysburg, according to State Police Commissioner Col. Frank Pawlowski. Grove was a "bright, highly educated conservation officer" who graduated from Pennsylvania State University with a degree in wildlife and fisheries science, he said. Johnson sustained a gunshot wound and was receiving treatment at a nearby hospital, Pawlowski said.
