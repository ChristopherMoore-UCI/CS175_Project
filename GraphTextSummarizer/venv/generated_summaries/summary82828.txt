One of the poorest football teams in Spain's top division, Madrid club Rayo Vallecano, has promised to help Carmen Martinez Ayuso find a new apartment after she was evicted by her landlord. "I know that there are lots of cases like hers," Rayo coach Paco Jemez told reporters. Ayuso's story grabbed the attention of the club with fans holding aloft a banner which read "Rayo against evictions" in a recent league match. Rayo has an annual budget of around $8.6 million -- a total which is incomparable to that of its big city neighbor Real Madrid which has a cool $720 million at its disposal. According to statistics published by the Bank of Spain, 1,218 evictions took place between January and June 2014 -- an increase of 17% from the same period in the previous year.
