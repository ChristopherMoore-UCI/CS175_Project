Out to dinner with their best friends (Ari Graynor and Eric Christian Olsen), they talk about what they're going to order by lapsing into showbiz World War II Chuhmin accents (clearly a favorite routine of theirs), which allows them to tweak each other's foibles -- like who's going to do more mooching off the other's plate -- while keeping the interaction light. "Celeste and Jesse Forever" throws us that curveball early on, and it establishes the movie as a romantic comedy powered by a question as novel and provocative as the one that drove "When Harry Met Sally": Can a man and woman be friends? Even when Celeste and Jesse start dating other people, they are still hooked on each other -- and maybe that's what they need to let go of. "Celeste and Jesse Forever" bounces along with nimble invention, from a photo montage that colors in an entire romantic history to the hilarious scene in which Celeste, increasingly jealous, gets caught going through Jesse's garbage can. The question here is more along the lines of: Can a man and woman who were more than friends realize they still might be?
