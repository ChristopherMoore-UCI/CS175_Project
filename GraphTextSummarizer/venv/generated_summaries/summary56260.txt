-- Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah has stirred up controversy ahead of a rare visit to Britain which begins Monday, accusing British authorities of ignoring intelligence that could have prevented the 2005 London bombings King Abdullah accused Britain of not doing enough to fight international terrorism. In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation that aired on Monday, the Saudi king said Britain failed to act on information provided by Saudi security services ahead of the suicide bombings on London's transport network in July 2005, that killed 52 people and injured more than 770. British Foreign Secretary David Miliband pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi Arabian counterpart in London Monday, but the Foreign Office insisted it was for personal reasons and not a snub. King Abdullah's arrival in London on Monday will mark the first state visit by a Saudi monarch in 20 years. However, he went on to say that Britain was among a number of countries that were not taking the issue of global terrorism seriously.
