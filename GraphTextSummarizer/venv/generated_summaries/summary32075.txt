" The couple had many friends, both on St. Maarten and at home in South Carolina. She was just like a sister." Michael, who was 53, and Thelma, 57, loved St. Maarten, Todd said. The defendants, who face a possible life sentence in prison if convicted, are accused of stabbing the South Carolina couple to death in a crime that has made headlines in the Caribbean and across America. Stein said violent crimes like this are exceedingly rare. The suspects, who have been identified by their initials, are J.J.W, who was arrested on St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands; J.C.M, who is 17; and M.K.J., 28, who Stein said confessed to his involvement in the killings.
