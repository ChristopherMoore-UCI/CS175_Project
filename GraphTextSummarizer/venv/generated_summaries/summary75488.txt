The UK's Times newspaper quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying that Russian authorities would waive the need for visa applicants to produce a letter of invitation in the case of ticket holders. -- English football fans hoping to travel to Moscow for this month's Champions League final between Manchester United and Chelsea face spiraling costs and an anxious wait for visas amid a simmering diplomatic row between the UK and Russia. "The Russians have shown great flexibility and hopefully within the next 48 hours we will be announcing a more simplified procedure for visas to make it easier for fans to get to Moscow," Gaillard told the UK's Press Association. But with officially allocated tickets expected to be snapped up by season ticket holders and loyalty scheme members, many more fans are expected to travel to Moscow independently. Meanwhile, UK sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe urged fans to be on their best behavior in Moscow, warning that trouble could derail England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup.
