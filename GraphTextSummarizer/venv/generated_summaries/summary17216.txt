"Mr. Mitchell was talking with Ms. Smart about having babies to the point where Ms. Smart actually picked out a name in case that happened," Whitehead testified. -- Elizabeth Smart stormed out of the courtroom Wednesday during the trial of Brian Mitchell, charged with kidnapping the Utah teenager in 2002, CNN affiliate KSTU reported. Whitehead testified about Mitchell's desire to bear children with Smart, KSTU reported. On Tuesday, KSTU posted a picture of Mitchell on its website, showing him wearing an oxygen mask and sitting on a stretcher as he was being loaded into an ambulance. Mitchell, as usual, had begun singing when he was led into the courtroom Tuesday: "O Holy Night," KSTU reported.
