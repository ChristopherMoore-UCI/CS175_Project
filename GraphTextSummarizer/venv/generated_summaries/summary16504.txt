"If it can't be you, these are precisely the people that you would want to see win the lottery," said Stephen Martino, director of the Maryland Lottery, announcing Tuesday that the holders of the ticket purchased in Maryland had come forward. The winners in Maryland are a woman in her 20s, a man in his 40s, and a woman in her 50s, Martino said. This was the first time the three had bought lottery tickets together. When they came to claim their portion of the jackpot, all were "modest" and "humbled," Martino said. One wants to take a backpacking trip through Europe with her brother; another wants to pay for his daughters' college educations and buy his sister a house; the third wants to tour Italy's wine country, Martino said.
