Sutherland said he is starting to see results, with government officials using the term "mainstream Muslims" in meetings. Sutherland's nine-page paper says the government should be careful not to demonize all Muslims or the Islamic faith or depict the United States as being at war with Islam.

Some argue that "war" is too grandiose and adds legitimacy to the other side, because there are two legitimate sides to wars.
