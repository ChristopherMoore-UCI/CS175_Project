Now Marvel is ready to update the character with a more modern looking outfit that includes a red and black jacket with yellow accents and tight black pants. It follows on the heels of DC Comics' fashionable new take on Batgirl earlier this year (like CNN, DC Comics is a Time Warner company). Editor Nick Lowe told USA Today, "Spider-Man isn't really a detective -- he swings around looking for trouble, whereas Jess needs to go and figure stuff out and dig things up, and you can't really do that head to toe in spandex very well. Matthew Sturges had a very good question: "New Spider-Woman costume is good, but she still has no pockets. I hate super hero costumes with glasses," @feemcbee said.
