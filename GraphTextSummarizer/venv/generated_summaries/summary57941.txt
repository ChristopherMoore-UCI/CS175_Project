Each soldier was awarded $850,000 in noneconomic damages and $6.25 million in punitive damages. "KBR did safe, professional and exceptional work in Iraq under difficult circumstances -- and multiple U.S. Army officers testified under oath that KBR communicated openly and honestly about potential health risks." -- Defense contractor KBR was negligent in exposing National Guard soldiers to toxic chemicals at a water plant in Iraq, a federal jury in Portland, Oregon, found Friday. The lawsuit was filed by a dozen National Guard soldiers, who accused the defense contractor of "knowingly" exposing them to the carcinogen hexavalent chromium while providing security to civilian workers at the Qarmat Ali water facility in 2003. While the jury found KBR negligent in the case, it did not find that the contractor committed fraud.
