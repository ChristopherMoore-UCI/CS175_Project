Ali Khan, stationed at military headquarters in the garrison town of Rawalpindi for the past two years, has been in custody for the past two days over alleged links to the militant group Hizb ut-Tahrir, said spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas. Senior U.S. officials also suspect that some in Pakistan helped bin Laden live there. Lask week, Pakistan's intelligence agency detained several people who gave information to the United States before the raid in Abbottabad that killed Osama bin Laden. Washington has complained that Pakistan has not done enough to fight al Qaeda and other militants. Khan's detainment comes as Pakistan's ties to the United States have been strained over strategy in combating terrorism.
