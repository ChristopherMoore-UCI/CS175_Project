By making the business class service available on flights between New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport starting in summer 2014 and New York's Kennedy Airport and San Francisco International Airport starting in fall 2014, the airline is hoping to woo business class customers from traditional carriers on those lucrative New York routes. JetBlue's first "Mint" flight will depart Kennedy Airport for Los Angeles on June 15, 2014 at 9:30 a.m. Fares are now on sale for $499 one-way from New York to Los Angeles for travel between June 15 and June 18, 2014. We believe Mint is better than other airlines' first and business class service, and with fares that make it accessible to everyone, we think Mint will become the obvious choice for customers flying across the country. Fully-flat beds, private suites, dual power outlets with USB ports, amenity kits and Saxon+Parole-designed tapas menu are part of JetBlue's new premium "Mint" seating, the airline announced Monday. Coach customers will also see some improvements: The new Airbus A321 aircraft will offer free Wi-Fi and in-seat power outlets for all customers and increased audio and television programing in coach seating.
