On Friday, police officials said that Gray should have received medical care at the site of his arrest and at other times as he was transported to a police station. Fredericka Gray, the twin sister of Freddie Gray, made a statement: "My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence? Protesters angry over the death of Freddie Gray got into physical altercations with police Saturday night in downtown Baltimore near the city's famed baseball stadium. At City Hall, speakers demanded justice for the Gray family and an end to what they called police brutality against black suspects. The skirmishes followed a planned demonstration over how police handled the arrest of Gray, a 25-year-old Baltimore man who suffered a spinal injury at some point after he was detained by police on April 12.
