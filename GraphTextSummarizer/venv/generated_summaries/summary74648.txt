Now, days later, as investigators continue to search through what the Worcester County District Attorney's Office describes as the home's "deplorable conditions (such as) massive insect infestation, mounds of used diapers and feces," a picture is beginning to emerge of the family that lived inside. Rivera also "presumably" did not know about the ones that had died, at least according to the account Murray has told authorities, Halpern said. 'Prisoner of her own fear' Halpern said that while his client's explanation "is not based in reality," the situation  Murray came to be in was the result of fear, not malice. Whether based in reality or not, Halpern said Murray was "a prisoner of her own fear" and suggested it was that fear that explains the three infants found dead in her home. Murray lived in the now-condemned single family home with her longtime boyfriend, Ray Rivera, and the couple's children.
