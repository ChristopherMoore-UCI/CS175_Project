The stakes are high, yet the contest is a combination of Louisiana dynasty (as in incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, whose wobble dance this month is a viral hit) vs. three term Republican congressman Bill Cassidy (a physician who has focused his message on President Barack Obama's record) vs. conservative tea party candidate Rob Maness, a retired Air Force colonel (running with the Sarah Palin seal of approval). So the answer to the question of who controls the Senate could actually have to wait for Louisiana voters to figure it out. In Georgia, a libertarian could force the Senate race there to a run-off in January -- a month later than Louisiana's December date. -- Under almost any circumstance, Louisiana politics are hot and spicy. In Louisiana — which is also hosting the comeback campaign of ex Gov Edwin Edwards, a Democrat, now running for a House seat, and Republican Rep. Vance McAllister, an incumbent running for re-election after being caught on a surveillance camera kissing a married female staffer — the Senate race is par for the course.
