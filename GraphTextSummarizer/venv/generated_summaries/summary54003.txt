Andrew Dawson has nice hands, and he knows it. Cole and Dawson also created short videos with the patients so that people can see what they are like in real life, in addition to Dawson's portrayal. It's a collaboration between Dawson and neuroscientist Dr. Jonathan Cole, and supported by the Wellcome Trust. Besides "The Articulate Hand," he's also created and performed "Space Panorama," which depicts the Apollo 11 moon landing with Dawson's hands alone, and a hand-based dance performance called "Quatre Mains." You have more bones in hands and feet than you have in whole of the rest of your body.
