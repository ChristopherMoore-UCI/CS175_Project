Barzee said she helped Mitchell in his meticulous preparation for Smart's abduction, from setting up the bucket that the girl was to use as her bathroom to setting up the tent in which the girl was to be raped. Mitchell told her prior to the Smart abduction "that I needed to take seven wives into my heart and home," Barzee said, adding that the news upset her greatly. "I was told that no matter how difficult I found the load to bear, I needed to follow the law or suffer eternal consequences," said Wanda Barzee about her husband, Brian Mitchell. Mitchell used the revelations to explain his heavy drinking, his engaging in oral sex with Smart and his demand that she "demonstrate sexual activity" in front of Smart, said Mitchell. One such attempt involved a fellow church member named Kelly who was eight months pregnant with another man's child, said Barzee, who added that she agreed to Kelly becoming another wife to Mitchell.
