It was Djokovic's third triumph at Indian Wells having won there in 2008 and 2011 and his first tournament victory of the year. Pennetta, 32, had already seen off top seed Li Na of China as well as former U.S. Open champion Samantha Stosur. The 17-time grand slam champion had begun in imperious fashion, racing through the first set as Djokovic struggled for rhythm and consistency. But Federer, defiant until the last, took the first three points to move to 0-40 on the Djokovic serve. With both players having given everything, it was Djokovic who made the first significant breakthrough, moving into a 5-1 lead.
