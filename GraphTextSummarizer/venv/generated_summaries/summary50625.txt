Frost was treated and released, and Trembley was being held for observation on Saturday night. -- A Cessna collided with a parachute at a small airport in Polk County, Florida, on Saturday. Officials said the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration were notified and responded to the scene. On the pilot's third time up, one wing became tangled in the strings of the parachute that held 49-year-old John Frost, officials said. Sharon Trembley was doing what are called "touch and goes" with the Cessna, a maneuver in which the plane touches the ground and ascends again.
