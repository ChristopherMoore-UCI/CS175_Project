Sunni extremist groups such al Qaeda have been targeting the minority in Nineveh province in recent months, police said. Iraq has seen a sharp increase in tension between its Shiite and Sunni populations since April, when security forces raided a site used by Sunni protesters to demonstrate against the Shiite-led government. At least 34 people died and 122 were wounded Monday in the series of car-bomb and roadside explosions across Baghdad, police officials said. Dozens have died in Iraq in explosions primarily targeting amusement parks where families and children typically go to celebrate the Islamic holiday of Eid Al-Adha, according to police. In the northern town of Muwafakiya, a car bomb killed 17 people and wounded at least 66 in a refugee compound, police said.
