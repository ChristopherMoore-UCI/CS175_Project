Watch Blagojevich fire back at critics Â» Blagojevich said one of the reasons the House voted to impeach him because he wanted to expand health care benefits to Illinois residents. " Currie added, "The totality of the evidence shows that Gov. Blagojevich has forfeited his right to hold office. The committee's report said it found the government's allegations against Blagojevich "shocking" and believes the information in the federal complaint "is sufficiently credible to demonstrate an abuse of office" that was "inconsistent with the governor's constitutional oath." The report said Blagojevich did not need to be found guilty of a crime for the House to impeach him. " Ilinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich says his impeachment was politically driven. Burris, former attorney general for Illinois, is not accused of engaging in "pay-to-play" politics with Blagojevich.
