A state-run Chinese newspaper expressed relief Monday that senior Japanese officials had dismissed the country's air force chief after he denied Japan's aggression before and during World War II. Two former Japanese prime ministers have apologized for Japanese aggression before and during World War II. Yet China has long accused of elements within Japan of trying to whitewash the Japanese atrocities committed before and during World War II. Several Japanese leaders have apologized in recent years for past Japanese aggression. "I would like to also express our deep condolences to the victims inside and outside of Japan during World War II."
