-- Major League Baseball player Ryan Braun has been suspended without pay for the rest of the 2013 season for violating the league's drug policy, Commissioner Bud Selig announced Monday. The Brewers have 65 games remaining this season, so Braun's punishment amounts to a 65-game suspension. An ESPN report last month named Braun as one of 20 players facing suspension due to a scandal involving performance-enhancing drugs. Major league players can appeal any possible suspensions, as Braun did in 2012. Michael Weiner, the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association, said he was pleased by Braun's admission.
