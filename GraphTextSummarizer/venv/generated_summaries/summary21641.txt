In a move that is antagonizing North Korea and irking China, South Korea commenced a major naval exercise in the Yellow Sea Thursday, the largest since 46 South Korean sailors died in March in the sinking of a warship. " Deadly North Korean strikes in past years -- a commando raid on the South Korean presidential mansion in 1968; terrorist bombings in 1983 and 1987; and naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 -- all used the element of surprise, an element that would be difficult to spring on the large, alert force South Korea is fielding for the maneuvers. Meanwhile, China, which has refused to condemn North Korea over the alleged torpedo attack and which remains Pyongyang's closest strategic ally, is reportedly carrying out air defense drills on its Yellow Sea coast across from the Korean peninsula. Given North Korea's decrepit military, experts say the chances of a naval attack on well-prepared South Korean forces are small. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.
