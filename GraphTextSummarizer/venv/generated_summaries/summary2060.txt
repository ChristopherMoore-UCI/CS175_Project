Atletico won last season's Copa del Rey after beating Real 2-1 in a final which was also littered with cynical fouls and gamesmaship. The hosts took the lead late in the first half through Sergio Busquets, with defender Inigo Martinez sent off immediately after, with the visitors furious that Barcelona defender Javier Mascherano had avoided both a potential red card and the concession of a penalty when hauling back Carlos Vela moments earlier. "That was the worst Barcelona display I have seen in the last six years," the Dutchman told British television channel Sky Sports. Cate's comments come a fortnight before the four-time European champions take on English Premier League side Manchester City in the Last 16 of the Champions League. They also come in the wake of last month's resignation of president Sandro Rosell, who stepped down because of a legal wrangle over the transfer of Neymar last June.
