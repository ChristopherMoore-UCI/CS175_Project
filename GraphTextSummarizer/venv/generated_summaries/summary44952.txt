And AMC has announced that "Breaking Bad" fans can look forward to a new series, "Better Call Saul," which will be a spinoff featuring criminal lawyer Saul Goodman. The series star Bryan Cranston seemed to drop a major hint in an interview with CNN's Ashleigh Banfield Thursday. Asked by Banfield if his character, Walter White, died or not, Cranston said, "Hey, you never saw bags zip up or anything. Cranston has remained busy since the series ended, most recently starring in the summer film "Godzilla." He may have been teasing, but that remark revived hopes for countless fans who still are mourning the loss of the character and the acclaimed series.
