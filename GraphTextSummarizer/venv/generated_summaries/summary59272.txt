Hanlon enjoyed listening to Puddle of Mudd, Will Smith and Cherice's favorite band, Nickelback, while her daughter grew to love Pink Floyd and Melissa Etheridge. Hanlon recalls Cherice's last gift to her. One of Cherice's peers at a church counseling group broke the news to Hanlon in 2008: Hanlon set aside her disappointment that Cherice hadn't confided in her and called the police. As Rambold's case traversed the court system -- during which the teacher confessed to repeatedly raping the girl in his home, car and office in 2007 -- Hanlon came home one day to find Cherice in Hanlon's bed, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
