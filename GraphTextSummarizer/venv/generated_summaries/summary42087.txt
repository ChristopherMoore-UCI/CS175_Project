But Gaga went into Twitter overdrive Sunday, accusing Hilton of stalking her, after one of her followers alerted her that he was at Gaga's apartment building in New York. Hilton, who lives in Los Angeles, announced last week that he is moving to New York as he raises his new son, born via a surrogate in February. On Friday, Gaga, who is in the midst of a comeback following a serious tear to her right hip, cryptically referenced a text from Hilton that appeared to make light of her injury. And while Gaga vowed "I've been quiet for a long time, not this time," Hilton appeared to be getting the last word. "If her fans want to send a message of support to Lady GaGa, they should buy her music," he wrote, a thinly veiled reference to Gaga's new single being declared a flop by several media outlets.
