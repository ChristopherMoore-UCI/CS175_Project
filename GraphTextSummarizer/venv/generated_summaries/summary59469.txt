Ihsanoglu, speaking on Turkish television, continued in the same vein, noting he liked Erdogan's leadership and admired his work as prime minister. Thirdly, Erdogan has also modernized Turkish society by lifting the headscarf ban in universities and public, liberating religious women. And, looking at the figures, it seems naive to question how Erdogan continues to dominate Turkish politics. Erdogan has won a record three terms as prime minister and polls show he's likely to win Sunday's presidential elections. Before Erdogan was elected mayor of Istanbul in 1994, there were frequent water cuts, garbage piled through the streets and air pollution.
