North Korea's statement Tuesday says that Shin's revelation shows that last year's human rights resolution that the U.N. General Assembly passed criticizing North Korea "was no more than a false document cooked up on the basis of false 'testimonies' made by human scum. In an opinion article he wrote for CNN Digital last year, Shin noted that North Korea had made repeated personal attacks against him. " Advocates have said any inaccuracies in Shin's story shouldn't undermine the staggering suffering he and other survivors of North Korea's prison camps have helped bring to light. The government news agency called Shin a swindler who "styled himself a 'survivor' in the 'concentration camp of political offenders' that does not exist in (North Korea) no more than a sheer lie and a fiction. And the chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry into North Korea noted that Shin was one of hundreds of witnesses, adding that his testimony consisted of only two paragraphs in a 400-page report.
