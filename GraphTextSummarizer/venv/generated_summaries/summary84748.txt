"He tried to fix some of her concerns, but as I've advised many couples in this area, including Mr. Armstrong, these shows have a way of tearing apart a marriage when one spouse takes a certain directions and the other spouse is left kind of supporting the financial part of the marriage." Armstrong, who was defending himself against a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, was financially drained, Richards said. "A reality show takes an average person that has no stardom and throws them into a public spotlight literally within a couple of episodes, and a lot of couples are not prepared for that and this is a very unfortunate consequence." Still, Richards said he does not blame the network for his client's depression and death. " Ronald Richards, who was Russell Armstrong's lawyer, said in an interview Tuesday with A.J. Hammer, host of HLN's "Showbiz Tonight," that the response to the divorce filing was sitting on his desk and had been about to be filed in court. -- The estranged husband of "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" cast member Taylor Armstrong apparently killed himself in his home, according to police and the Los Angeles county coroner's office. Investigators did not find a suicide note near the body of Armstrong, 47, who was pronounced dead at 8:16 p.m. Monday, Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said Tuesday.
