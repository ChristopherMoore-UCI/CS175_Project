" FBI: Russian spies used tickets and hats to try to hide New York activities Edward Lucas, author of "Deception: The Untold Story of East-West Espionage Today," said "Russian espionage in the West is on a bigger scale than it was during the Soviet period. Professor Mark Galeotti, a specialist in transnational organized crime, security affairs and Russia at New York University, said that Russian operations are cranking up against the U.S. and its European allies. Bharara added: "New York City may be more hospitable to Russian businessmen than during the Cold War, but my office and the FBI remain vigilant to the illegal intelligence-gathering activities of other nations." In an affidavit unsealed in federal court on Monday, the Justice Department accused Evgeny Buryakov, also known as "Zhenya," of posing as a Russian banker in Manhattan to funnel economic intelligence to the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. "More than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War, Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy," U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement.
