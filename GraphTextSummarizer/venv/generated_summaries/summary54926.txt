â€¢ War and famine bad, James Franco and spaghetti carbonara good. Sometimes I think being middle-aged isn't about learning a lot of new lessons so much as learning the same old ones again and again. I'm also a great believer in time off for good behavior. But before I start turning into my great-uncle Saul, who never fails to tell me how he could've bought the entire Upper East Side of Manhattan for $225 back in 1936 ("when an ear of corn still tasted like an ear of corn"), let me say this: As much as I miss those days, I'm delighted and relieved to be done with being young. It tends to make incredibly decent, hardworking, middle-class people sort of jumpy, and the next thing you know Kirsten Dunst is playing Marie Antoinette in a Sofia Coppola extravaganza.
