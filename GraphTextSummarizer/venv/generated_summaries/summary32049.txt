"An investigative team has been created and sent to the scene to determine the cause and the exact circumstances of this tragic accident," the Defense Ministry statement said, adding that top military officials were heading to the crash site. -- One person survived the crash of a military plane Tuesday in the mountains of eastern Algeria that left at least 77 others dead, a spokeswoman for the country's Civil Protection office said. The plane was flying from Tamanrasset in southern Algeria to Constantine in the east, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The Hercules C-130 was carrying members of the Algerian air force and their families, according to several media outlets in Algeria. Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika declared a three-day national mourning period and offered his condolences to the families of the victims, the state-run Algerie Presse Service (APS) reported.
