But based on evidence on the ground, Horak cut away the main parachute and deployed his backup, Gold Coast Skydivers owner Leanne Igo said. Instead, Horak's body was found in heavy mud in a swampy wooded area about a mile from the airport in Lumberton, Lamar County Sheriff Danny Rigel said. A skydiving fan since the 1970s, Horak served with the Army Special Forces and was a pilot who also worked for the Veterans Administration as a physician's assistant, Igo said. " Horak was a safety and training advisor appointed by the U.S. Parachute Association, Igo said. Horak's cause of death won't be known until after an autopsy, likely to take place Monday, Rigel said.
