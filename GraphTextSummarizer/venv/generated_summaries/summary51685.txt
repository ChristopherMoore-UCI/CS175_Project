The 24-year-old followed up her silver medal at the 2008 Olympics as she set a new Games record time of 12.67 seconds after comfortably heading off Canada's Angela Whyte and New Zealand's Andrea Miller, who snatched bronze with a dip at the line. The Nigerian sprinter tested positive for a banned stimulant, Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell told reporters in New Delhi. Poonia's gold gave India a first track and field gold since 1952, and only second in Games history, while Harwant Kaur won silver and Seema Antil bronze. Kenyans continued their winning run in the men's steeplechase, which the country has dominated since 1990, with African champion Richard Mateelong claiming a surprise gold from world champion Ezekiel Cheboi and Olympic winner Brimin Kipruto. If Osayomi is disqualified Natasha Mayers of St Vincent and the Grenadines would claim gold, England's Kathryn Endacott would gain silver and Bertille Atangana of Cameroon would collect the bronze medal.
