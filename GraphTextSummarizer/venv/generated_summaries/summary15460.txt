-- Robin Thicke's new album "Paula" is inspired by his estranged wife Paula Patton, but he hasn't seen the woman herself in months. " #AskThicke backfires big time on Robin Thicke Robin Thicke is still trying to get Paula Patton back It seems Thicke has been obsessed ever since with wooing 38-year-old Patton, making public apologies, writing songs like "Get Her Back," and filming an uncomfortably intimate music video that has become the gold standard of over-sharing. Some said the breakup was due to Thicke's rumored infidelity, and while the singer didn't divulge details on Tuesday, he did confess to being dishonest. "She hasn't heard ('Paula')," Thicke said of his estranged wife.
