As part of "The Simpsons'" annual "Treehouse of Horror" Halloween special this year, today's Simpsons will meet the Ullman Simpsons ... and then massacre each other. 'Simpsons' likely killing off Krusty the Clown "We've implied that they were murdered and buried under the house, so this is expanding that thought," producer Al Jean told Entertainment Weekly about the Ullman Simpsons. The old school Simpsons had made tongue-in-cheek cameos on the show throughout the years, but this is the first time the two versions of the same family will interact at length. Compared to the present-day "Simpsons" clan, the Ullman Simpsons are crudely drawn, paler, misshapen, and vocally forgettable. The Ullman Simpsons aren't the only unlikely family the Simpsons will meet this season: As previously reported, this season will feature a "Simpsons"/"Family Guy" mash-up.
