His legal team, however, claims he will not be given fair trial and that he is being pursued because of WikiLeak's exposure of U.S. embassy cables, which leaked "secret details" that embarrassed the U.S. government. Lady Gaga visited WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuador embassy in London and spent five hours with him Monday. The pop star was in London to launch her new perfume, Fame, at Harrods department store in Knightsbridge, close to the Ecuadorian embassy. According to media reports she went to the embassy to see Assange at around 7:00 p.m. and emerged out of the embassy well past midnight. Assange faces extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape and sexual assault made by two women.
