My hope would be that they widen the access to women, and women are more inspired and encouraged to take on those kinds of roles." Portman, who has a degree in psychology from Harvard University, also pointed to the defined gender roles on set: "You don't see female directors of photography, you don't see female technical crew members. Women in cinema Portman, who in 2008 served as the youngest member of the 61st Annual Cannes Film Festival jury, added that she would like to see more female filmmakers and pointed to directors Sarah Polley, Lena Dunham and Sofia Coppola as inspirations. The 32-year-old star of Hollywood blockbuster "Thor: The Dark World," hopes her role as astrophysicist love interest Jane Foster will encourage a new generation of young women to enter the sciences -- much like "Star Wars'" If Portman has her way though, there won't just be more females on film sets -- but in science laboratories as well. Could Portman become the new role model for female scientists, much like Jodie Foster as astrophysicist Ellie Arroway in 1997 film "Contact", or Sigourney Weaver as zoologist Dian Fossey in 1988 drama "Gorillas in the Mist", or even sci-fi hero Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in the "Star Wars" series?
