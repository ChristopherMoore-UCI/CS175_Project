Antin confronted his grandfather, who ended up quitting Facebook entirely -- but it got me thinking about how we expect our family members and friends to treat our exes, and how we expect their family and friends to treat us, whether the breakup was amicable or not. and I had vowed to keep in touch, I hadn't spoken with her since before I found out and wrote that my ex had likely cheated on me with his coworker (and lied about it) and had also lied about an incident early on in our relationship involving his ex-girlfriend. So, as far as keeping up relationships with an ex's family and friends goes, proceed with caution. Antin had an amicable, cold-turkey breakup with his girlfriend of five years, and then found himself morosely following her life in the aftermath via Facebook. A few of my friends were Facebook friends with him before we broke up, and when we split, most of them asked if they should defriend him or not.
