Chinese authorities detained Ai for 81 days last year and later ordered him to pay the 15 million yuan in back taxes they said he owed through his company, Fake Cultural Development Ltd. Ai paid 8.45 million yuan ($1.3 million) late last year so he could contest the charges. Ai told CNN by phone that Chinese tax authorities sent him a note March 27 telling him he will not be given a public trial but a "written hearing." Ai, who was found guilty of tax evasion last year, said he plans to sue the tax authorities. -- Dissident artist Ai Weiwei will not be allowed to publicly appeal a multimillion-dollar tax penalty the Chinese government says he owes, he said Thursday. Ai's family and human rights advocates have said they believe the Chinese government is targeting him for his criticism of the regime.
