Rumors are flying that Lady Gaga and her boyfriend, "Chicago Fire" actor Taylor Kinney, either have made things "official" with a commitment ceremony or are soon to head down the aisle. The talk heated up two weeks ago after actress Sophia Bush shared a photo on Instagram of Kinney wearing a ring on a significant finger. The Daily Star reported this week that Gaga and Kinney gathered friends and family for a small ceremony pledging their devotion to each other. Citing unnamed sources, the publication claims the couple plan to officially wed next year. "We treat each other with a lot of care, and we're good to one another," she said.
