His music, such as the song "Nothing Left to Lose," has received consistent airplay on music TV channels -- which earned him a headlining slot on a VH1-sponsored tour -- and repeated appearances in TV and film. There are certain songs that lend themselves to images. It's worked on weird TV shows where doctors are making out and people getting logs pulled out of their stomachs [laughs]. No one's licensing [Katy Perry's] "I Kissed a Girl" and putting it in shows. Kearney: It's interesting how my music has gained success being accompanied by images.
