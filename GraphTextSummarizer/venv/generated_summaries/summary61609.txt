The government is working to locate and retrieve money obtained and "smuggled" abroad illegally by officials including Mubarak, his sons and former members of his regime, as well as quantify it, Finance Minister Mumtaz Al Saeed said in a news conference. "If the government accepts then the suspect is immediately freed with no trial or penalties." Both the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the Salafi-led Nour Party, which holds a majority of parliament seats, also issued statements opposing the release of former Mubarak officials under the amendment. Prime Minister Kamal Al Ganzoury leads a committee in charge of retrieving the money, believed to be in the billions. The government has not accepted the offers made by the former Mubarak officials, and the issue is still being studied by the government, Al Saeed said after meeting with Al Ganzoury. If the proposed deals are accepted, the prisoners -- including steel tycoon Ahmed Ezz, former tourism minister Zoheir Garana and former housing minister Ahmed Maghraby -- would be freed without penalties or trials.
