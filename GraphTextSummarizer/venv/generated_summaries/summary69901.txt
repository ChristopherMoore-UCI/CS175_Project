The new Chinese market has translated into an emphasis in contrasts of Hong Kong-made films, says film archivist Cheng. "Around 1997, like lots of Hong Kong people, I kind of lost myself," says independent film-maker Chan Wing-chiu. Many Chinese say that now that Hong Kong is part of China, Hong Kong people must learn Putonghua. After 1997, we lost the confidence to be Hong Kong people." "Even the independent scene still needs more real talents -- or at least, real producers to pull together a really good project." Tim Youngs, Hong Kong consultant for Italy's Far East Film Festival, says changing tastes among Hong Kong movie-goers has also affected the industry.
