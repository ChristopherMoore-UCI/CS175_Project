The court documents continue: "Like most Sikhs, Mr. Singh believes that the turban is an inseparable part of his Sikh religious identity and that exposing his "naked" head in public, as Defendants would require upon his enlistment, would be sacrilegious and shameful. When Iknoor Singh requested a religious exemption from the military's grooming policies to enlist as an ROTC cadet in April 2013, his request was first denied on the grounds that his noncompliance would have "an adverse impact on the Army's readiness, unit cohesion, standards, health, safety, or discipline," court documents said. We very much hope that the Army will permit us to enroll Mr. Singh in the program as a full Cadet." " Singh was born and raised in Queens, New York, and has dreams of serving as a military intelligence officer, according to court documents. A sophomore at the Hempstead, New York, university, Singh is a finance major and audits the ROTC military-science coursework as an unenlisted member of the program, according to court documents.
