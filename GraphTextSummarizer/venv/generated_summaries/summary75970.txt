When it has enough power Philae will try to contact the orbiting Rosetta -- for two minutes every 30 minutes. "It's good luck through bad luck," said lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke. O'Rourke explains the sequence: - If enough sunlight falls on the solar panel, Philae will reboot- It then needs more energy to warm the batteries- When the Rosetta team find Philae they will then be able to estimate the point at which enough sunlight falls on the solar panel to expect a transmission from the probe, announcing that it's still alive. Scientists from the European Space Agency (ESA), which is leading a consortium that includes NASA to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun, say there's still a good chance that Philae will revive.
