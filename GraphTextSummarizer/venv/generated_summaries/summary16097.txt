A warrant for Donald Stallworth Jr.'s extradition has been processed by governors' offices in Florida and Alabama and sent to the jail where he is being housed, Florida State Attorney Bill Eddins said. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has said Gonzalez once worked for a car dealership Byrd Billings owned, and court documents state that Gonzalez received financial support from the family for a martial-arts studio he ran. "At this time, he is ready to be transported back to Escambia County, Florida, to face double murder charges and home invasion robbery," the statement said, adding Stallworth would be transported "in the very near future. An attorney representing the Billingses has said that Byrd Billings made a nominal donation to Gonzalez's karate charity. Stallworth's attorney, David White, said last week that his client would plead not guilty.
