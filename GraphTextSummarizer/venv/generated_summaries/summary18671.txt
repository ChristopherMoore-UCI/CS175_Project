Massachusetts State Police photographer Sean Murphy, who leaked pictures of bloody Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has retired, saying Thursday on CNN's "New Day" that he has no regrets. He was one of countless Boston-area residents stunned and angry about a Rolling Stone cover photo of Tsarnaev, taken from one of Tsarnaev's social media accounts, that Murphy and others thought depicted the suspect in a glamorous light. Murphy's retirement comes after a brief suspension, a transfer to a remote overnight patrol job and a negotiated settlement in which he gave up five days of vacation pay, he said Thursday. Thursday, Murphy said he doesn't hold anything against the department. Murphy said Thursday he doesn't know what he'll do next.
