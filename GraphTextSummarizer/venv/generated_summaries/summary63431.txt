Malaga have also been fined â‚¬300,000 ($396,000) but UEFA has released prize money due them from this season's Champions League. -- Champions League contenders Malaga have been handed a season long ban from UEFA club competitions after falling foul of the European governing body's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. The CFCB has given the club until March 31 next year to settle the debts and will impose a further one season ban from UEFA competitions, the Champions League or Europa League, if they fail to do so. The La Liga side will be allowed to continue in this season's Champions League, where they have reached the last 16 stage, but any ban would come into place over any of the next four seasons should they qualify to play in Europe. Malaga are the first high-profile club to be punished under new tougher FFP rules with UEFA's Financial Control Body (CFCB) making their ruling after a hearing Friday in Nyon, Switzerland.
