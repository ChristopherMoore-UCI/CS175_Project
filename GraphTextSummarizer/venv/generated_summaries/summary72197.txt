That is a scary question to ponder when the United States is on the verge of cutting a deal aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, when United Nations nuclear inspectors say Iran is refusing to answer questions about "possible military dimensions" of its nuclear program, and as the United States and the so-called P5+1 negotiating with Iran steadily reduce their demands on Iran's nuclear enrichment. Amid reports that the West is already proposing to allow Iran a level of nuclear enrichment that would have been unthinkable in the recent past, the most recent letter crossed another line, reportedly suggesting a linkage between a nuclear agreement and cooperation between Washington and Tehran in fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. -- President Obama has written yet another letter to Iran's Supreme Leader and, by all accounts, his missives remain unrequited. Iran came to the table as the result of stern economic sanctions steadily enforced by Obama, and he deserves full credit for that. When thinking about ISIS, Syria and Iran, we should remember that even though ISIS is viewed as a threat by both Washington and Tehran, Iran's goal is to fortify Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.
