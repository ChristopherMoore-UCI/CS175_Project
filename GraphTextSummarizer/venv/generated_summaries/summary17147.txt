The people that benefit most from not washing denim are the ones who'll throw down what is for many Americans a monthly salary to buy something they'll never wash, because, quite frankly, they'll probably be worn no more than four times before their next new pair of jeans. Interesting, but somehow I doubt an overnight stay in the freezer is going to silence the filth festival that accumulates on a pair of jeans over the course of wearing them for 30 days straight. If you think it's hard to pull on your jeggings, ladies, try cracking open a pair of jeans that are frozen solid. Have you ever cooked bacon or mucked a stall in a pair of jeans? Many are pre-adapted to survive low temperatures.
