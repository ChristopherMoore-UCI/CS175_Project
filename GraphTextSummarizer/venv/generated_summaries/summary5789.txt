And even as there are still more battles to fight -- to stop hate crimes, allow for adoption laws and end workplace discrimination -- it is significant that the gay community is seen less as a deviant group asking for special rights and more as humans entitled to civil rights, fairness and equality to all. And it was youth -- the "New Black" in the film -- who pushed their parents, their teachers and some of their clergy to understand gay rights as an expansion of civil rights. I followed her in the streets of Baltimore and the leafy suburbs of Prince George's County as she engaged with people from all walks of life about how the push for gay equality was an expansion of civil rights. It feels like their efforts have now allowed this new understanding about who gets civil rights, and also the perception of gay Americans. Over the past three years, I've filmed The New Black, which examines how the black community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the marriage movement and the fight over civil rights.
