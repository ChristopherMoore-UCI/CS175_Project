Brown presided over a syndicated reality TV show based on court case arbitration for 15 years until it was canceled last year. He apparently became upset when he was told the case was not on the afternoon docket, Chief Magistrate Dan Michael said. He announced his candidacy for the Shelby County district attorney post last month. The court staff and judges "were all kind of floored" by Brown's behavior, Michael said. Brown, a former Shelby County criminal judge, was in court to represent a client in a child-support case.
