Though CBO projections have been steeped in a strong tradition of independent, nonpartisan analysis over the office's 40-year history, some say Republicans could appoint a director who would insert his bias as he or she looks at the cost and economic impact of proposed legislation. "Any effort by Republicans to interfere with the professional integrity of the CBO by selecting someone to push their failed 'trickle down' economic theory of tax cuts for the wealthy through dynamic scoring would undermine the credibility of CBO and the entire budget process," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee. RELATED: David Koch is a 'social liberal' but votes with his wallet Greg Mankiw, former chairman of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisors, wrote in a blog post last month that Elmendorf has demonstrated both "competence and impartiality" and "shown himself to be scrupulously nonpartisan" as CBO head. Republicans have vowed to hone in on Obama's signature piece of domestic legislation, which they say will add $131 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years, a stark contrast to the CBO's projections that the 2010 law will reduce the deficit by about $124 billion. But former CBO director and Republican appointee Doug Holtz-Eakin said he believes the "ratio of rhetoric to reality here is extremely high."
