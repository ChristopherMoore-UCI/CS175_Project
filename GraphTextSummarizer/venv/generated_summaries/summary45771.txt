But Mancini suggested any move for the Argentina forward could depend on whether or not his compatriot Carlos Tevez completes a switch to Brazilian outfit Corinthians. " Former Inter Milan boss Mancini moved on to discuss a potential bid for Aguero, who scored 20 league goals for Atletico last season, and he said an offer from the Etihad Stadium side could be imminent. -- Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini has said the English FA Cup winners could move for Atletico Madrid's Sergio Aguero. The Italian coach said on Monday that City had agreed a fee with Corinthians for Tevez, 27, claims which were later denied by the Sao Paulo club. Both Tevez and Aguero were part of Sergio Batista's Argentina squad which was eliminated from the 2011 Copa America on Saturday, beaten on penalties by Uruguay at the quarterfinal stage.
