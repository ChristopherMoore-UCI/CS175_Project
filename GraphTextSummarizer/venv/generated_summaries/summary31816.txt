U.S. officials say the ban on tourism in Cuba is still in place; the overall ban on travel to Cuba can't disappear without congressional changes to the law. The numbers rose after Obama's 2009 easing on some of the restrictions on travel to Cuba, including making it easier for Americans to visit family members there, and a subsequent 2011 announcement allowing for certain types of other trips. "We look forward to the day — hopefully soon — when all Americans have the opportunity to travel to Cuba," said Barney Harford, the CEO of travel booking website Orbitz. But the days of Havana as a glamorous destination for U.S. tourists — as it was before the Cuban revolution ended legal U.S. travel there — aren't returning quite yet. Historic thaw in U.S.-Cuba standoff Americans already travel to Cuba in large numbers — nearly 100,000 per year, according to Cuban government statistics.
