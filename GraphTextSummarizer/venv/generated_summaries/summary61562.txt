Chelsea's first profit of Abramovich era European champion Chelsea had set the early-season pace, but now trail leaders Manchester United by three points after dropping into third place. -- Chelsea captain John Terry is set to return to action quicker than originally suspected after a scan on his injured knee revealed "no significant damaage," the English Premier League giants said Monday. EPL titleholders Manchester City claimed second on Sunday with a 2-1 win at home to Tottenham, coming from behind before substitute Edin Dzeko snatched a late winner. Chelsea's momentum was derailed following claims of racism laid against referee Mark Clattenburg after the controversial home defeat by United on October 28, which was followed by the arrest of a Chelsea fan who made an alleged monkey gesture at a United player in a cup game just days later. The draw, Liverpool's sixth in 11 league matches, left Brendan Rogers' team in 13th place -- 15 points behind bitter rivals United.
