"We all achieved incredible success last season that made history for this great club. Chelsea's Russian owner Roman Abramovich has already bankrolled two big-money signings in recent months, in a bid to improve on a sixth-place Premier League finish last season -- the club's worst position during his eight-year reign. "Roberto's quality was clear for all to see when he galvanized the squad last season and helped the club make history, and the owner and board are very pleased he will be continuing his good work," said Gourlay. "Although he has set the bar very high in the short time he has been in charge, we know that Roberto is the right man to lead Chelsea onto further success." Chelsea has rewarded Roberto di Matteo for guiding the English club to its first European Champions League triumph by appointing him as manager on a permanent basis.
