Last Friday night, at a dinner party set up by Uber as an off-the-record briefing, at Manhattan's exclusive Waverly Inn bistro, Emil Michael, the company's vice president of business, proposed a dastardly scheme to compromise one of Uber's leading media critics. Michael suggested that Uber use its vast collection of consumer data to "dig up dirt" on Sarah Lacey, the founder of the Silicon Valley news site Pando. In The Circle, his brilliant satire of technology companies like Uber, Dave Eggers coined the Orwellian phrase "Sharing is caring" to describe the hypocrisy enveloping Silicon Valley. Everyone, that is, except senior Uber executives themselves. This investigative team might, he said, snoop into the personal and family life of a critic like Lacey who has relentlessly exposed many of Uber's creepiest features -- particularly what she calls  the "asshole" misogyny of its CEO, Travis Kalanick.
