One thing's for sure, Beck said, Ohio voters can expect more campaign stops by the candidates, more phone calls, more political mailings. -- President Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney have targeted Ohio with incessant campaigning, a slew of television ads and nonstop political phone calls. "I feel quite confident this time around that whoever wins Ohio will be the next president of the United States, and I very much suspect that the campaigns agree with that proposition." Beck attributes Romney's comeback to three issues: â€¢ the first presidential debate, which most people believed Romney won. Ohio newspapers ink their 2012 presidential picks "The first debate let people who were looking for reasons to support Romney and made them feel that he was of a presidential caliber," Beck said. The auto bailout has played out well in Ohio (one in eight jobs is connected to the auto industry), and Beck said many blue-collar types would like to support Romney but have trouble relating to him because of his track record of shipping jobs overseas.
