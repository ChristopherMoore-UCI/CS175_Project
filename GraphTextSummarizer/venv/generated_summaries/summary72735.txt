" ANSA says the Russian was the fifth tourist caught carving graffiti on the Colosseum's walls this year. While the Chinese youngster may have escaped with a parental reprimand, as the Colosseum case demonstrates, future scrawlers may soon be paying higher prices for their misdemeanors. "The damage to the monument is notable," site superintendent Mariarosaria Barbera told ANSA. The damage reached a peak in during the 1930s heyday of fascist leader Benito Mussolini, the Guardian newspaper says. A fellow Chinese traveler spotted the the graffiti, reading "Ding Jinhao was here," at the 3,500 year-old Luxor Temple and posted a picture of it on social media.
