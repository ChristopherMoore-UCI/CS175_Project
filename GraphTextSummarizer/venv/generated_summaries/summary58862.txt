DSCC ad: Tillis in Koch brothers' pocket Gohringer notes that LCV did contribute to House Democratic candidates in a couple of House races in Maine and in California where climate change has been a key issue, and that they plan to spend $100,000 on a voter turnout effort to help Democratic candidate Emily Cain in Maine's second congressional district. "There has certainly been a drop off in funding from outside groups which is creating a funding gap," Matt Thornton, the communications director for House Majority PAC, the one super PAC dedicated to raising money on behalf of House Democratic candidates. One labor union, the Service Employees International Union, spent close to $6.5 million in the 2012 election to help House Democratic candidates, but so far, according to an analysis of campaign contributions posted by the Center for Responsive Politics, the SEIU is spending roughly ten times less - $665,000 - on House races this year. In the last midterm election, 2010, when control of the House was up for grabs the group spent over $6 million to help House Democratic candidates. House Democrats are increasingly worried that an avalanche of outside spending by GOP groups will bury them this fall, putting more of their members at risk of losing, and jeopardizing their goal of winning back control of the House in 2016.
