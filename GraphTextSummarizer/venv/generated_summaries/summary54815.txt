After several months of weekly contact with Iranian officials in New York and Tehran, Prosper was invited to Iran in December for talks about Taghavi's case. Prosper acknowledged the case has been a challenge to investigate because of his inability to question people in Iran and the lack of information from the government or Taghavi's Iranian lawyers in Tehran, who don't speak English. After being hired by Taghavi family last September, Prosper said he contacted the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations and was granted a meeting with the ambassador, who eventually put him in touch with Iran's foreign ministry. Prosper left Tehran without being allowed to see Taghavi, but he was taken to visit victims of the 2008 mosque bombing by Tondar in an Iranian effort to show him the threat the regime says it's facing from "terrorist groups" being financed from sources abroad. " Leila Taghavi traveled to Iran last year and was allowed a brief visit with her father in prison.
