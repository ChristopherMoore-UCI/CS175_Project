The blaze Friday destroyed the headquarters complex of Flight 93 National Memorial, dedicated to the 40 passengers and crew who died when Flight 93 crashed outside the town in southwestern Pennsylvania during the deadliest terror attack on U.S. soil. Ken Nacke, whose brother Louis was on Flight 93, helped raise funds for the Flight 93 National Memorial and advised in its planning. Also lost in the fire were a handful of personal items of passengers and crew recovered from the crash site and from families, copies of DVDs of the annual commemoration ceremonies and meetings of the memorial's federal advisory commission, and about 100 "tribute items" to the passengers and crew left by visitors since 2001. Litterst told CNN affiliate WJAC that the buildings had fire alarms but no sprinklers. NPS spokesman Mike Litterst said the fire was being jointly investigated by the National Park Service and Pennsylvania State Police.
