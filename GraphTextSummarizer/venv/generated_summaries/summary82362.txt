The source says the message is that U.S. action can escalate from reviewing to cutting off if need be, but that the Obama administration is prepared to continue to work with Egyptian military officials if they take this in the right direction. Notably, the president said he and his officials "are deeply concerned by the decision of the Egyptian armed forces to remove President Morsy and suspend the Egyptian constitution" without suggesting that there would necessarily be any negative repercussions. The thinking of the president and administration officials, according to a knowledgeable source, is that while the administration is not explicitly supporting the removal of Morsy from power -- it expressly did not support the move -- it is seeking to push the Egyptian military in a direction. The message being conveyed publicly and privately is that Obama accepts that this happened and even sees the potential that it could turn out for the best, given Morsy's autocratic rule. That said, the president is concerned that the military leaders and the acting leader might see the events as an opening to take on Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood through excessive force.
