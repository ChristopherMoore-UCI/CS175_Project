Pulling up the drawbridge to Fortress Europe will only consign more desperate, scared people to death by drowning, with their bodies washing up on the beaches of Southern Europe. Or we could heed the UNHCR's call for European countries to accept more refugees for resettlement. Currently, the number of resettlement places offered by EU countries is pitiful: emergency programs aside, only 5,500 resettlement places are available annually. The answer is not higher walls around Fortress Europe -- it is to provide more safe and legal channels for people to access protection. Developing countries host 86% of the world's refugees, with thousands forced to live in refugee camps for years.
