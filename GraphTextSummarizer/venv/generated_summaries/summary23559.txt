Commandeered devices typically emit a loud tone that's associated with a feature that helps users locate lost or stolen devices. There is no indication the hijackings are the result of any compromise on Apple servers, so that leaves end users to figure out for themselves how to secure their own devices. The mass compromise is a variation on so-called ransomware scams, which initially targeted Windows PC users and earlier this month were found targeting smartphone users running Google's Android OS. The forum accounts provide strong evidence that victims' Apple IDs and passwords have been compromised so that attackers can remotely lock connected devices using Apple's Find My iPhone service. Assuming this technique was at play in the iPhone and iPad locking, affected users who entered a password on what appeared to be Apple's site could have unknowingly provided it to the people behind the attack.
