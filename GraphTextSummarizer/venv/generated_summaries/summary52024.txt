Yet, for those who are college graduates, 86% said college was a good investment for them personally. "We find that for the typical person there's about a $550,000 advantage to going to college in lifetime earnings," said Paul Taylor, one of the study's authors. As compared to those who only graduated high school, college graduates did tend to be more satisfied with their work life and they found their work to be more interesting. Three-quarters of those surveyed said college is no longer affordable for most Americans, according to the study. "But at the end of the day, if you push them and ask is it college or character, people place more importance on character than a college diploma."
