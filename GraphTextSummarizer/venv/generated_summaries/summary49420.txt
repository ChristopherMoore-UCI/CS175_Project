The lack of Accident Investigation Squad presence on the night of the crash meant Webb would probably not be criminally charged. "The New York City Police Department is legally required to investigate traffic accidents if there is a serious injury, but their current policy is not to do so," said a statement from Stevens, who is a plaintiff in the case along with his late wife's estate. " Doctors later estimated that Heyworth was effectively brain dead when her head hit the pavement, so it is unclear why the Accident Investigation Squad inquiry was never started, Stevens said. " Stevens gave the go-ahead for the operation, but despite doctors' efforts, Heyworth died. "That they were right to cancel their investigation since she hadn't actually died?" Three days after Heyworth's death, the Accident Investigation Squad opened an investigation of her case -- an act Stevens says came way too late to collect crucial evidence.
