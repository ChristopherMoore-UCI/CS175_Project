When it comes to versatility, New Orleans musician Aaron Neville knows the ropes. He met displaced New Orleanians all over the country as he toured, and many of them were grateful to be reminded of home. Even though Neville often returns to his hometown to perform, he has not returned to his home in East New Orleans since Katrina. "I just did a gig at the House of Blues (in New Orleans) and it was so noisy," Neville said. He provided a lot of comfort to fans from New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.
