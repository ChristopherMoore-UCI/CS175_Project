The retaliatory move comes more than a week after the United States and European Union increased economic sanctions on Moscow for supporting pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukraine government forces in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, along the border with Russia. Things to know about Russia and sanctions Russian troop increase at Ukraine border raises concerns CNN's Susanna Capelouto and Catherine E. Shoichet reported from Atlanta. Since then, tensions have simmered and flared in Ukraine, with frequent battles between Ukraine government forces and pro-Russia separatists in the eastern part of the country.
