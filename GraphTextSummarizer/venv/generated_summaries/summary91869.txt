Keep in mind that on that now infamous tape, Sterling is also alleged to have said, "There are white Jews and black Jews." It seems Donald Sterling was a giving machine, despite his remarks showing disdain for African-Americans and black Jews. He then goes on to infer black Jews are "less than" white Jews. That's essentially what transpired in Los Angeles between Sterling and the local chapter of the NAACP. To even suggest that somehow a sit-down with Donald Sterling now, when if anyone should have known about his racist past, (it) should have been a local chapter of the NAACP.
