At Tufts University, Massachusetts scientists are pioneering a method of manipulating spider silk to genetically engineer new bone tissue, thus allowing them -- in theory -- to re-grow damaged bones and teeth. "We are playing around with silk from silk worms," one of Kaplan's collaborators, Professor Carole Perry of Nottingham Trent University in the UK, told CNN, "But the bulk of our work is using fusion proteins derived from spider silk." Spider silk is being used in pioneering research to regrow damaged bones and teeth "It's an important step in the process of trying to grow replacement body parts," Professor Christopher Viney of the University of California, Merced -- an expert in the mechanical properties of silk -- told CNN. " Gore-Tex hearts and silk bones -- fashion will never seem quite the same again.
