Watch the reaction as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is named host city for the 2016 Olympics » "He always cries when he talks of his mother, who never saw him become president," said Fabiana Frayssinet, CNN's correspondent in Rio de Janeiro. In fact, Brazil's economic policy has been "pretty much middle of the road, some people would say pretty conservative," said Valente, who added that he has never voted for Lula da Silva. But Lula da Silva acquired a reputation as a public figure by leading a successful strike in São Paulo, Valente told CNN in a telephone interview. For Lula da Silva, Friday's announcement in Copenhagen, Denmark, that Rio de Janeiro will host the 31st Olympiad in 2016 signified a major achievement not only for his hemisphere (no city in South America has ever before hosted the games) but for him -- a former autoworker and union organizer who defied dizzying odds to become president. Like Brazil's president, Rio did not succeed on its first try, having been rejected in an earlier bid -- which inspired planners to be meticulous, Valente said.
