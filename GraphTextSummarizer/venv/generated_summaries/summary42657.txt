He also recited a litany of statistics that many in Okinawa have committed to memory: Seventy-five percent of all U.S. bases in Japan are on Okinawa, an island that makes up less than 1% of Japan's territory, and 20% of the land on the island is taken by U.S. bases. Staging areas in Okinawa allowed U.S. assistance to reach the affected areas faster than aid from many other countries. In statistics from the Marines at Kadena Air Base, U.S. forces spend an annual $1.9 billion in the local economy, constituting as much as 10% of Okinawa's Gross Prefectural Product. Susumu Inamine, mayor of the city of Nago on Okinawa, pointed out Saturday that he was elected on a platform of "no new construction of U.S. facilities" on the island. And according to Article 9 of Japan's Constitution, "land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained," meaning that the U.S. military presence represents Japan's strongest line of defense in the event of an attack.
