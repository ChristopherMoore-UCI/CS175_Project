-- The hour is almost upon us; FIFA will shortly vote on who will host the 2018 and 2022 soccer World Cup finals. The tournament would help to cement soccer's growing popularity in America and build on the gains made when it lasted hosted the tournament in 1994, which broke World Cup attendance records. Its decision to decide the fate of both the 2018 and 2022 bids at the same time has been widely criticized for encouraging vote collusion between bids -- an accusation FIFA deny. The Middle East's first World Cup would also appeal to FIFA's desire for the tournament to have a social legacy long after it has finished. There is a good reason why so many countries fall over themselves to host the FIFA World Cup.
