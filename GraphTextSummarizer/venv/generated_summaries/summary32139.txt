Said one tweet: "Even psychotic liberal Howard Kurtz thinks Keith Ellison was out of line with Sean Hannity." " No sooner did he tell Ellison, "Welcome back, sir," than the congressman took, shall we say, vigorous issue with Hannity's opening. Ellison told me: "I stood up to Sean Hannity because of what the sequester will mean for millions of Americans who have already been forced to work harder while they get by with less. But from the first words out of his mouth, Rep. Keith Ellison came prepared to pick a fight. Ellison began insulting Hannity from the get-go, Hannity pushed back, and the pugilistics were under way.
