Senior administration officials rejected the notion the president's decision to seek congressional authorization undermines decades of entrenched executive branch powers to take military action. After signaling he was on the verge of delivering a strike against Syria, President Barack Obama made a last-minute decision Friday evening to seek congressional authorization before any military action, senior administration officials told reporters Saturday. Congressional leaders, senior administration officials maintained, were supportive of the president's decision to ask for approval from Capitol Hill. But the decision to wait and seek congressional authorization comes with some risk, officials conceded. To bolster their case to members of Congress, White House officials plan to make available classified materials from the administration's intelligence report on the August 21 attack around Damascus.
