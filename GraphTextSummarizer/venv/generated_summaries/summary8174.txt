Close associates Prayuth has named General Prawit Wongsuwan, a former defense minister and former head of the army, as defense minister, and one of his five deputy prime ministers. Critics accused Yingluck of acting as a mouthpiece for her brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was deposed in the last coup in 2006 and is now living in exile. Prayuth seized control of the country on May 22, 2014 after months of unrest destabilized the elected government, led by former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. Prayuth was selected by Thailand's National Legislative Assembly to lead the government in a vote last month. Both are powerful military figures with close ties to Prayuth, and who played a role in the 2006 Thai coup.
