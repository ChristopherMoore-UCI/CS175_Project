Great white sharks are relatively rare in New England, the division statement said, but have been seen feeding near seal colonies. -- The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries has tagged two great white sharks off Cape Cod in an area where shark sightings have been reported, state officials said Sunday. The taggings took place in the waters near Chatham, Massachusetts, two days after Greg Skomal, shark expert for the Division of Marine Fisheries, reported as many as five large sharks were seen near Monomoy Island, a National Wildlife Refuge off the southern elbow of Cape Cod. A great white shark is tagged Saturday off Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Researchers have also tagged great white sharks off the coast of South Africa.
