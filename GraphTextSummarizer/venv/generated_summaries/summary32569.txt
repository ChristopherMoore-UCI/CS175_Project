The remains found last week on the bank of an Illinois river and near a blue barrel are not those of Stacy Peterson, Illinois state police said Wednesday. Many people speculated that the remains, found near the Des Plaines River less than 30 miles from the homes of Peterson and another missing woman, Lisa Stebic, meant one of their disappearances would be solved. Stacy Peterson, 23 when she was last seen in October 2007, was former police officer Drew Peterson's fourth wife. Authorities have said they believe that Lisa Stebic was the victim of foul play and have named Craig Stebic a suspect. Drew Peterson has pleaded not guilty.
