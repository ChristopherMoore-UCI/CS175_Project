During his meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh, Kerry emphasized that any change to defense cooperation will be tied to Vietnam's human rights record, according to State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki. A dangerous dance: China, Vietnam posture in the South China Sea The United States will ease some restrictions on defense sales to Vietnam, the State Department announced Thursday, following a meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Vietnamese counterpart. Asked whether Thursday's announcement, which comes just one day after Kerry met with his Chinese counterpart, was related to the dispute, Psaki was vague. The Vietnamese have been pressing the United States to lift its arms embargo, particularly following aggressive acts by China in the disputed the South China Sea.
