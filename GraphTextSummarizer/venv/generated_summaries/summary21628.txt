Wenger had further bad news for Arsenal fans when he confirmed that skipper Cesc Fabregas had been ruled out of Saturday's FA Cup quarterfinal clash with Premier League leaders Manchester United. -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has launched an attack on European football's governing body UEFA after being charged with improper conduct for his behavior during Tuesday's Champions League defeat by Barcelona. Wenger clashed with referee Massimo Busacca at the end of the English team's 3-1 loss to the Spanish champions in the away leg of their last-16 tie in Europe's top club competition. The exit from the Champions League came just nine days after the Gunners' heartbreaking last-minute English League Cup final loss to Birmingham. "He had a recurrence of his hamstring and will be out for the next game, maybe for the next two games," Wenger said of the Spaniard, who returned from injury to face his boyhood club Barcelona.
