" Butler said Macquarie Dictionary had decided that for the past 20 or 30 years, "misogyny" had taken on wider meaning, particularly in feminist discourse and that with changed usage should come a changed definition. Was Gillard seriously asserting that her opposite number held a pathological hatred of women, as most dictionaries define misogyny? " One female who believes the new definition of misogyny is silly is prominent Australian Financial Review columnist Jennifer Hewett who wrote: "He (Abbott) is now just to be officially accused of exhibiting entrenched prejudice rather than having a "visceral hatred'' of half the world's population. Merriam-Webster associate editor Kory Stamper told The Australian newspaper (itself, experiencing fever at the change of definition): "A quick review of our citational evidence shows that 'misogyny' has been used to refer to a very broad range of behaviors, attitudes, policies, and so on .... no dictionary definition is set in stone.
