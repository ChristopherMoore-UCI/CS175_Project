-- When CNN's Piers Morgan asked actor Matt Damon if he was happy with the way President Barack Obama has been running the country and if Damon was "a fan" of the president, Damon answered "no." Damon and the cast of "The Adjustment Bureau" -- Emily Blunt, John Slattery and Anthony Mackie -- are Thursday evening's guests on "Piers Morgan Tonight." I love making movies." "The Adjustment Bureau" is based on the premise that people have no control over destiny. Damon said he puts most of his free time into the nonpartisan Water.org movement, which is dedicated to getting clean water to people. While he said he is "interested in everyone's opinion" and "interested in people who don't agree with me," when talking politics, that's not his main interest. During the course of their conversation, Damon and Morgan covered Hollywood, politics, fatherhood and much more.
