Authorities traced Blunt to Mexico City, where he was hiding in a $10-a-night hotel, said Commander Lenny DePaul of the New York/New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force. Acting on a tip, authorities found Espinosa about 9 p.m. Tuesday in an apartment six blocks from the jail, said James Plousis, a U.S. marshal for New Jersey. During their escape, Blunt and Espinosa left behind dummies in their jail beds, along with a note naming prison guard Rudolph Zurick. The second of two men who last month pulled off a daring escape from a county jail in New Jersey was taken into custody Wednesday, authorities told CNN. On Tuesday, local and federal authorities captured Jose Espinosa, 20, who broke out of Union County Jail on December 15 along with Blunt.
