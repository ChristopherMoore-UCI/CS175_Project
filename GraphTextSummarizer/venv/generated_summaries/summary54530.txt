I suspect that those Nigerians who believe the relatively popular theory in certain ethnic circles that the rise in Boko Haram attacks are being orchestrated by unknown forces who want President Jonathan out by all means, will vote to keep him in -- just to prove a point to his enemies that their vicious efforts did not work. This response contrasted greatly to the relative apathy which followed what has been described by Amnesty International as Boko Haram's deadliest attack -- the massacre of up to 2,000 mostly women and children in Baga town of northeast Nigeria last week. When more than 200 girls were in April 2014 kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists from their school in Chibok, the international community rallied around Nigeria. Whatever happens at the polls, Nigeria has to at some point face the Boko Haram issue squarely -- even after the international media frenzy around the group's latest attacks has died down, as it surely will. Nevertheless, the ongoing carnage in Nigeria's northeast will definitely be a determining factor in the outcome of the February elections.
