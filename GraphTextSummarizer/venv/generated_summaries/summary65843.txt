It has since stated that several tanks and pipes at the plant are suspected of leaking toxic water. More than two years on from the worst nuclear disaster in a quarter of a century, the situation at Japan's stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant remains toxic, prompting the Japanese government to announce new measures to attempt to deal with radioactive leaks. Last month, TEPCO said one of the storage tanks at the site had leaked 300 tons of toxic water, prompting Japan's nuclear regulator to declare the situation a Level 3 serious incident, its most serious assessment since the 2011 meltdowns. The leaks that have occurred so far have been in a type of storage tank using plastic seals. This month, a sharp spike in radiation levels was detected in some of the pipes and storage tanks -- the highest reading was 1,800 millisieverts per hour at the bottom fringe of the tank.
