BMC Racing, Team Sky and Team Leopard finished second, third and fourth respectively, just four seconds behind Garmin, with HTC-Highroad another second behind in fifth place. Australian Cadel Evans, twice a runner-up in the Tour, lies third overall, just a second behind the Garmin duo, with Briton Geraint Thomas leading a host of riders who are four seconds adrift. -- World champion Thor Hushovd is the new leader of the Tour de France after his Garmin-Cervelo team won Sunday's second stage team time-trial. The 33-year-old Norwegian, a winner of eight Tour stages, as well as twice taking the green points jersey for best sprinter, leads British teammate David Millar in the overall classification after the pair helped Garmin win the 23km stage around Les Essarts in a time of 24 minutes, 48 seconds. Hushovd takes yellow courtesy of finishing above Millar in Saturday's opening stage, where he came home six seconds behind Gilbert in third place.
