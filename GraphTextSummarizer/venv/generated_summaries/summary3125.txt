Last month, the Nabisco cookie brand Oreo and rapper Lil Wayne squared off for the record for the most Facebook likes. The public meltdown has made Sheen a continual trending topic on Twitter and the subject of several YouTube parodies. Sheen, of course, has been all over the news since he publicly disparaged Chuck Lorre, producer of Sheen's successful sitcom "Two and a Half Men" in a bizarre interview with Alex Jones of InfoWars last month. According to a report in Advertising Age, Sheen was able to get his account verified so quickly because Internet startup Ad.ly brokered his account with Twitter. As of this writing, Sheen's Twitter account, @CharlieSheen, has more than 1.3 million followers.
