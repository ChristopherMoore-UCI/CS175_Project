That same year, only 3% of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies were women, according to the National Center for Women & Information Technology. "I challenge women to think about scaling their business and asking for enough funds to cover their projected growth." As conferences like SXSWi bring together thought leaders from all over the world, women here hope these discussions can help close the gender gap in tech fields. This issue was a recurring theme at last week's South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, Texas, where attendees gathered at women's-only parties and panels featured such titles as "Sausagefest: Getting More Women Into New Media & Tech." Laura Kilcrease, sitting in an audience at a panel on women entrepreneurs, jokingly refers to herself as the only female venture capitalist in Austin. With so many people working together to increase opportunities for women in tech, many of the woman CNN interviewed at SXSW said they don't think this conversation will be happening in 10 to 15 years.
