Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia unsealed an indictment Friday accusing 45-year-old Eric C. Opitz of bilking Medicare out of more than $535,000 by claiming he was a dwarf who needed human growth hormone. Opitz was charged with health care fraud, mail fraud and illegal distribution of human growth hormones and anabolic steroids. But for nearly a year, a pharmacy filled the physical trainer and body building consultant's prescriptions for as much as 8 milligrams of growth hormone per day -- 40 times the FDA's recommended maximum dose, according to prosecutors. Authorities arrested Opitz, then released him pending a detention hearing scheduled Friday afternoon, according to Patty Hartman, a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Attorney's Office. If convicted, prosecutors say Opitz faces "substantial" prison time.
