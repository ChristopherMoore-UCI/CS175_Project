Hadfield and his crewmates, U.S. astronaut Tom Marshburn and Russian cosmonaut Roman Romanenko, will oversee the space station until the arrival of the next crew in two weeks, according to NASA. The crew members spent their unexpected extra day in space reviewing undocking and landing procedures as well as working with the remaining crew members on the handover of duties, NASA said. The Soyuz capsule returned Friday night landing in northeast Kazakhstan bringing an American astronaut and two Russian cosmonauts back from a journey to the International Space Station, NASA said. NASA TV planned to broadcast the undocking and landing live. The American expedition commander, Kevin Ford, and Russian Flight Engineers Oleg Novitskiy and Evgeny Tarelkin spent 142 days on the station after launching into space on October 23, 2012.
