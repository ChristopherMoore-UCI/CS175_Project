Amid the confusion over the Boston bombings, other Reddit users focused on two young men with heavy-looking bags, one of whom wore a blue track suit. Users posted links to news sources, information from law enforcement and other official information in an effort to keep people informed in the shooting's aftermath. Founded in 2005, Reddit has become a hugely popular site divided into more than 5,400 communities that have essentially revamped the early Web's bulletin boards, with users posting information, links and thoughts rapidly in real time. -- Months after apologizing for overeager users fingering innocent people as potential suspects in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings, Reddit on Monday shut down a section devoted to chasing down the Washington Navy Yard shooter. In separate subreddit about Washington D.C., a related post, "Active Shooter Washington Navy Yard," continued with Reddit's blessing.
