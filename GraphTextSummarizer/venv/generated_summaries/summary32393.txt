Schwartz told Lohan at a hearing last month that any plea deal would involve jail time. Lohan would return to Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Keith Schwartz's courtroom on March 25 if she is ready to plead guilty or no contest to the felony grand theft charge. Judge Stephanie Sautner, who would hear the case in the event of a trial, would also consider the matter of Lohan's probation violation at the April hearing, Schwartz said. -- Lindsay Lohan must decide by March 23 if she will accept a plea deal that would send her to jail or move closer to a trial in the necklace theft case, a judge told the actress Thursday. Thursday's hearing marked Lohan's ninth court hearing in 10 months.
