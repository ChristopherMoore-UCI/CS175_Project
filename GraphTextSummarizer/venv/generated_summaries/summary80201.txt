"Mr. Lubanga's conviction for the war crimes of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of 15 is an important step forward in realizing the international community's commitment to ensuring that perpetrators of crimes against children in situations of armed conflict are brought to justice," he said. "Child conscription destroys the lives and futures of thousands of children around the world. His was the court's first trial and its first verdict since it was established in 2002 to address crimes of international concern, including genocide and war crimes. Judges convicted Thomas Lubanga of conscripting and enlisting children under age 15 and using them to participate in "hostilities" during a civil war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Kony is accused of using children to kill and mutilate his foes across four African nations, including Uganda and Congo.
