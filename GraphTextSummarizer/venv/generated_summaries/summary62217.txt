Hong Kong authorities confiscated $3.4 million ($26.7 million in Hong Kong currency) worth of ivory found in two shipping containers this week. The last major bust in Hong Kong occurred in 2011, when officials seized a shipment of ivory and rhino horns valued at $2.2 million in Hong Kong dollars. On October 16, Hong Kong officers inspected a container from Tanzania claiming to carry plastic scrap and found $1.7 million worth of ivory. The containers arrived from Tanzania and Kenya, according to Hong Kong customs officials. The illegal goods weighed more than 8,000 pounds, making it one of the biggest seizures of ivory in Hong Kong.
