-- The Missouri man charged in the death of 12-year-old Adriaunna Horton made his first court appearance Monday to answer charges of murder, forceable rape, statutory rape and child kidnapping. Though Bourne initially denied having anything to do with Adriaunna's disappearance, he admitted during questioning that he was the one who picked her up and said he merely asked her about her father, Barton County Deputy Sheriff Vernon Ring said. A state trooper arrested Bobby Bourne at a traffic stop in Golden City that night, driving the same SUV, and arrested him for child kidnapping. Adriaunna was playing with her sisters in a park in Golden City last Monday when two other children saw her climb into a blue SUV. He led investigators to a wooded area where they found the girl's body, which had evidence of sexual assault and strangulation, Ring said.
