In the future, McLeish envisages Carbon Sciences setting up shop next door to large CO2 emitters -- coal, gas-fired plants and oil refineries -- recycling concentrated streams of CO2 discharged from fossil fuel plants. A Californian company is developing a new technique for recycling carbon dioxide, or CO2, and turning it back into fuel. Scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico are exploring the idea of using concentrated solar energy to turn CO2 into fuel. Professor North says recycling CO2 may be more vital for the chemical industries than for fuel production. Carbon Sciences are developing a "breakthrough technology" to make fuel out of waste CO2.
