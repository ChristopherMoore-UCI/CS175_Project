The fallen police were farewelled by grieving family members, politicians and police and military leadership at their home base, Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig City Friday. Last year, it signed a peace agreement with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), the largest rebel group in the region. On Wednesday, Aquino delivered a speech to the nation vowing that the deaths would not derail the deal with the MILF, saying the fallen police had given their lives for the cause of peace. The unit's other target, Filipino bomb maker Abdul Basit Usman, escaped. The statement reiterated the MILF's "full commitment" to the peace process, extended sympathies to the families of the fallen police and announced its own investigation into the incident.
