And there's a harsher penalty for Census Bureau employees who identify individuals filling out the surveys: five years in prison or $250,000 in fines, or both, according to the Census website.

Educational attainment and workforce age are two statistics from the survey that are valuable to the Greater Houston Partnership, a nonprofit geared toward building economic prosperity in Houston. Survey supporters say that isn't much money in the grand scheme of government, but opponents say the survey is needless and unconstitutional.
