President Hugo Chavez has spoken at past January 23 events, but the Venezuelan leader remains in Cuba and has not made any public appearances for more than six weeks since he underwent cancer surgery there. Maduro told the crowd Wednesday that Chavez was "pressing on uphill" as he recovers from cancer surgery in Havana, Cuba. During Chavez's absence in recent weeks, government officials have repeatedly accused political opponents of trying to destabilize the country with a campaign of rumors about the president's health. -- Fierce political rhetoric in Venezuela took a sharp turn Wednesday with a warning from Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told throngs of supporters that opponents were plotting to murder him. Maduro's comments came as Venezuela's opposition was also rallying in Caracas on a day that has important political significance in the South American country, the anniversary of the end of Marcos Perez Jimenez's dictatorship.
