"We ran out of gas in the course of the second half," said Nuremberg coach Michael Wiesinger, a Champions League winner with Bayern in 2001. Leverkusen claimed second place after beating Borussia Monchengladbach 4-2 at home, with Germany winger Sidney Sam netting twice. Schalke's poor start continued with a 2-1 defeat at Hannover, leaving coach Jens Keller under pressure ahead of next week's Champions League qualifier against PAOK Salonika. The European and German league champions triumphed 2-0 at home for a new milestone of 28 top-flight matches without defeat, giving new coach Pep Guardiola a perfect start of three wins from three. Having hit the post early on through Daniel Ginczek, Nuremberg had seemed set for a third successive draw after frustrating the home team in front of a 71,000 sellout crowd, as Raphael Schafer saved David Alaba's first-half penalty and denied several other Bayern efforts.
