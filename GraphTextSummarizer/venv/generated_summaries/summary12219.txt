Jarrin Jackson, who spent most of last year in eastern Afghanistan, said he believes in the counterinsurgency principles pushed by Gen. David Petraeus, who is now director of the CIA. "I said, 'If you know this guy, and this guy is succeeding, and you're both village elders in eastern Afghanistan, why don't you talk to each other?' " "I don't want to downplay the role of taking care of bad guys," said Jackson, who was based in Khost province, a stronghold of the Taliban that has plenty of insurgents. He says the human part of his job -- finding out what villages needed to prosper and keep independent of insurgents -- was a little like living in a small town. The strategy boils down to this: Insurgents rely on the fear and intimidation of local citizens to keep control, so the counterinsurgency focuses on protecting local citizens from the Taliban and rallying them to the Afghan government.
