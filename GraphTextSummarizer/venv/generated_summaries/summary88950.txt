The flood damage to Iowa crops could reach $3 billion, according to the state's agriculture secretary. Iowa Gov. Chet Culver, who toured the area with Bush, said, "we will rebuild this state and this city, and it will be even better and even stronger as a result." "Obviously, to the extent that we can help immediately we want to help, and then plan for recovery," the president said at Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. "Right now, we have about 10 percent of our corn that has either been flooded out or not planted and about 20 percent of our [soy]beans," Bill Northey said Friday on "Iowa Press," a public television show. Despite the acres of flooded farmland in Iowa, "there certainly are folks out there with good crops," Northey said.
