Bay Area Rapid Transit police were called to Oakland's Fruitvale station on January 1 after passengers complained about fights on a train. Mehserle, a former Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer, is accused of shooting 22- year-old Oscar Grant dead on a California train platform on January 1, 2009. Officers pulled several men, including Grant, off the train when it arrived at Fruitvale. "We anticipate that regardless of the verdict reached by the jury, demonstrations could occur in downtown Oakland, and potentially throughout the city," one of the messages said. In January, the transit system agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle the suit.
