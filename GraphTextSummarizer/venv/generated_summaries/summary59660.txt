The slow passing of the bulge of water working its way from north to south along the Mississippi is only the beginning of the end of the siege for Memphis residents, who could be dealing with high water levels into June. However, it is operating as designed and intended," said Memphis District Readiness Branch Chief Steve Barry. Water levels could fall or rise slightly, said CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras. Once past Tennessee, the crest will next target Louisiana and Mississippi, where residents and authorities continued preparations for river levels that could break records set in 1927, when flooding displaced 600,000 people and caused the equivalent of nearly $624 million in damages, according to the National Weather Service. Although the river was cresting, Reichling warned Memphis residents not to assume everything will soon return to normal.
