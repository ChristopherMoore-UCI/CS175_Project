The report paints a picture of "merciless devastation of civilian lives and infrastructure," said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein. "Many have been trapped in conflict zones, forced to shelter in basements, with hardly any drinking water, food, heating, electricity or basic medical supplies," Zeid said in a statement. The estimated number of people killed in eastern Ukraine since April 2014 now exceeds 6,000 "in spite of successive ceasefires," the UN Human Rights Office announced in a statement on Monday. The UN arrived at the new estimated death toll of over 6,000 by tallying 5,809 documented deaths and assessing that many more must have been killed in recent fighting in other areas, particularly Donetsk airport and around Debaltseve. And some are forced to stay against their will, or are simply physically unable to leave," Zeid said.
