A 2008 trip to Pakistan, during which prosecutors allege Naseer received al Qaeda training, was really a trip to visit his ailing mother, Naseer said. Prosecutors accuse Naseer of using email addresses with female names to communicate with al Qaeda in planning the bomb attack. The New York plot originated with a man named Najibullah Zazi, who is believed to have corresponded with the same al Qaeda contact as Naseer. " Naseer is charged with three criminal violations: providing material support to al Qaeda, conspiring to provide material support for al Qaeda, and conspiring to use a destructive device in relation to a crime of violence. Prosecutors also accuse Naseer of using "coded language" in his emails to update al Qaeda on his progress.
