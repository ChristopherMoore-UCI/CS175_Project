United began the second half with more urgency and Danny Welbeck -- who scored two goals in United's league opener last week versus Swansea -- should have done better when Rooney found him inside the box. Chelsea was by this time happy with a point, further shown when Mourinho replaced Kevin de Bruyne with not Mata but defensive midfielder John Obi Mikel. With Chelsea making no secret about its interest in United striker Wayne Rooney, would the Englishman start? He again omitted Chelsea's player of last season, creative midfielder Juan Mata. Rooney, who United repeatedly insist isn't for sale despite the 27-year-old putting in a transfer request at the end of last season, did make the starting 11 and played the full 90 minutes.
