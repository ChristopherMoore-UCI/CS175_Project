A report by the Police Executive Research Forum released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in May said investigators had reviewed 25 cases from January 2010 to October 2012 that involved shots fired by Border Patrol agents who were attacked by rocks. "Even after many fatal shooting incidents involving Border Patrol agents, the agency has refused to release the names of those involved." "He was not committing a crime, nor was he throwing rocks, using a weapon, or in any way threatening U.S. Border Patrol agents or anyone else." In addition to allegations about the October 2012 shooting, Tuesday's lawsuit also alleges that U.S. Border Patrol agents have "systemic problems of abuse. The lawsuit alleges that Border Patrol agents caused 46 deaths nationwide from 2005 to 2014, citing media reports and government data.
