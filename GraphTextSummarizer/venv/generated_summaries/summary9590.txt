-- Major League Baseball issued a policy Tuesday afternoon to protect players from discrimination and harassment based on their sexual orientation. MLB Commissioner Bud Selig and New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman announced the new code of conduct at an All-Star game fan celebration at New York's Javits Center. In April, Schneiderman announced an agreement to reinforce anti-discrimination policies with the National Football League to "promote a culture of inclusion" and help disseminate posters to all 32 teams in the league. "The new policy is not in response to any specific incident," said Andrew Friedman, deputy communications director for Schneiderman. "I commend the commissioner and Major League Baseball for leading the charge for tolerance in professional sports."
