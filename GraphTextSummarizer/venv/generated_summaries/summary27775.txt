Yet as debate rages about the NFL's handling of player discipline, the problem for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell is just the opposite: He seems to have too much power. While NFL player arrests peaked in the mid-2000s, most organizations would not sit back and accept that one in 40 of their employees is arrested each year -- mostly for DUI incidents. One can only guess if as many players would have suffered, or if the NFL would have faced a $950 million payout to players earlier this year, if player training to avoid concussions had been sponsored by the league. Fans may now have a hard time believing any NFL commissioner can be reliably out in front of setting constructive league standards. In all three cases, the players continued to play for NFL teams -- a very different outcome from what Rice is facing.
