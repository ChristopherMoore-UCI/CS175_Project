Jolie said during her acceptance speech that her mother was very supportive of her career, driving her daughter to auditions and waiting for her for hours. While receiving the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award at the 2013 Governors Awards on Saturday, the Academy Award-winning actress paid an emotional tribute to her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died in 2007 of ovarian cancer. "Above all, she was very clear that nothing would mean anything if I didn't live a life of use to others," Jolie said. " During the ceremony, specialized awards are given to honor humanitarian work and motion picture achievements not covered by the Academy Awards ceremony. " Hollywood turned out for the event where Steve Martin, Angela Lansbury and costume designer Piero Tosi also received Oscars honoring their careers.
