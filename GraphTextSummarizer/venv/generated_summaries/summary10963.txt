Cilic will play British fourth seed Andy Murray, who won a late night thriller under the Centre Court lights to beat Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus. -- Lukas Rosol, who beat Rafael Nadal in one of the biggest upsets in Wimbledon history, came crashing down to earth Saturday with a straight sets exit to Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round. Sam Querrey also came up short in a marathon bid to become the third player from the United States into the third round as he lost to 16th seed Marin Cilic in a match taking five hours 31 minutes. " Rosol will return to a second tier Challenger Tour event next week, but Kohlschreiber has earned himself a last 16 clash with American Brian Baker. It was the second longest match in Wimbledon history behind the world record clash between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut in 2010.
