Golf prides itself on the very best dress etiquette, but Poulter has done his best to shake things up a little. "I've got 14 titles (two on the PGA Tour, 12 on the European) to my name and a pretty good Ryder Cup record, so I think that outweighs the business side of things," he said. But Poulter dismisses suggestions he'll be best remembered for his trousers rather than his trophies, insisting that he is simply well prepared for life after sport. Since then the bleach-blonde boy from Stevenage has graced the fairways draped in an eclectic mix of designs and even a soccer shirt -- he is a huge fan of English Premier League team Arsenal. Not many people make the leap from teenage market trader to golf professional, fashion entrepreneur and multi-millionaire.
