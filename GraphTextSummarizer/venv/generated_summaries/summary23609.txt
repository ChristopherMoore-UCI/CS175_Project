-- A mountain lion was killed in a car accident in Milford, Connecticut, on Saturday and authorities say the cat may have been the same one spotted this week in nearby Greenwich. There is no native population of mountain lions in Connecticut, the DEP says, and the eastern mountain lion has been declared extinct by federal authorities. Connecticut DEP says it's possible and even likely that the mountain lion killed early Saturday morning is the same cat that's been roaming around Greenwich this month. The 140-pound male cat is at a DEP facility where his body, along with paw prints and other specimens are being analyzed and tested to determine if it is the same cat seen in Greenwich. Milford is about 40 miles north of Greenwich, which DEP says would have easily been within the cat's roaming range.
