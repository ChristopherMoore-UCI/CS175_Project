This culture of impunity is certainly one of the reasons rape has too often become the weapon of choice for frustrated young men who blame women, increasingly visible in the workplace, for their unemployment, and who hope to regain jobs by frightening women back home through sexual violence. The desire to blame women is fed by a cult of masculinity promoted by corporate and political leaders who serve as role models for the rest of society. It was a demoralizing and toxic experience, but one that is not unknown to women in India who choose to speak out against sexual attacks. While India's legal framework has improved for women over the past 20 years, the people implementing it are mostly male cops and lawyers who live in a deeply patriarchal society. The biggest challenge we face is the attitude of politicians, senior police officials, heads of foundations and even policy makers who view rape as a normal part of society.
