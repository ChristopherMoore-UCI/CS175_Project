-- An out-of-service Bay Area Rapid Transit train struck and killed two workers on a section of track northeast of San Francisco on Saturday afternoon BART workers went on strike for four days in the summer over the same issues. "Our hearts and prayers go out to the families of the two workers who've just been killed on the BART tracks," BART General Manager Grace Crunican said. BART's union workers are currently on strike over a variety of issues, including wages. The BART system normally serves 26 communities, including San Francisco and Oakland.
