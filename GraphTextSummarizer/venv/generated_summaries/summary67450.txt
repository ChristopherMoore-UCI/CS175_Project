-- Washington Wizards player Javaris Crittenton Monday became the second member of the NBA team to plead guilty to a weapons charge following a gun-toting locker-room incident. Crittenton, who is currently listed as inactive on the Wizards' roster and has not played a game all season, agreed with prosecutors that the incident stemmed from an angry exchange with teammate Gilbert Arenas following arguments over a card game. "We commend Mr. Crittenton for accepting responsibility and hope he fully appreciates the gravity of his actions," Phillips said. Prosecutors say Arenas threatened to burn or blow up Crittenton's car when they came to practice the following Monday. "Possessing a firearm unlawfully in the District of Columbia can lead to nothing but trouble and can have serious consequences," said U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips.
