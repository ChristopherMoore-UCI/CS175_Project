Nobody knows how the Marine happened to fall out of the MV-22B Osprey on Monday, 1st Lt. Hector Alejandro, media officer for the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing at Cherry Point, North Carolina, told CNN on Tuesday. Lt. Col. Christian Harshberger with Marine Aircraft Group 26 said the tiltrotor Osprey's cargo bay door remains open during training operations, according to WECT. The aircraft had taken part in a training exercise at the airport in Elizabethtown, Bradley Kinlaw, Bladen County emergency management director, told CNN affiliate WECT. Alejandro said Marines in Ospreys are always supposed to be secured, either by seat belts or tether cables. A crew member noticed the Marine missing about half a mile past White Lake, WECT reported.
