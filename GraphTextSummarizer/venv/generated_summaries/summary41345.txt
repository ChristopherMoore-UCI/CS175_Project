But diplomats say that Russia's conduct in its refusal to condemn Syria, or even negotiate on resolutions in good faith, have reached new lows. Though Western diplomats insist they have not proposed anything approaching military intervention, Russia insists that the Syria crisis should be solved internally. In Russia's view, NATO overstepped the Security Council's mandate in Libya, and they fear a similar mistake being made in Syria. Though China joined Russia in its veto on Syria, and India, Brazil and South Africa abstained, diplomats say that it is Russia that has been taking the lead in opposition to action. They also complain that Churkin has misrepresented to the media the content of closed Security Council meetings.
