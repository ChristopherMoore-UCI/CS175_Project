-- Trying to strike a balance between shedding his isolationist label and defending his nontraditional GOP views on foreign policy, Sen. Rand Paul took another jab Tuesday at his more hawkish colleague, Sen. John McCain. In Paul's remarks at the event, he brought up a Bloomberg/Des Moines Register poll from Iowa, saying that he liked how they framed a question on foreign policy asking whether the U.S. should be quicker to intervene in foreign conflicts "as John McCain suggests" or less interventionist, "as Rand Paul suggests. In a discussion hosted by Paul Gigot, editorial page editor at The Wall Street Journal, Paul argued he's not in favor of a total abandonment of U.S. intervention overseas but was unapologetic in saying he's "one of the least reluctant to go to war. " Paul said he's not staking out an "all or none" approach on U.S. intervention. In turn, McCain blasted Paul for appearing to waver on his views about the fight against ISIS, saying Paul's change in tune weakened his "credibility" and argued he wouldn't be a good commander-in-chief on national security issues.
