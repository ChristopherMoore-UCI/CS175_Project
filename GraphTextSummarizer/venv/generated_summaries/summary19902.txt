"The motive for the abduction and intentions of the suspect towards the child are not known," police said in the suburban Salt Lake City community. After Morley refused to come out, a sheriff's canine went in and bit the suspect on the shoulder and upper right arm, police said. A spokesman for the family told CNN affiliate KSL on Friday afternoon that the girl was OK. Morley is being held in the Salt Lake County Jail and hasn't had a preliminary hearing, said Sgt. Troy Mitchell Morley is suspected of two felonies -- child kidnapping and burglary, the Sandy, Utah, police department said in a written statement.
