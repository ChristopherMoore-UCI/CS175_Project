Last week, police said a human arm, legs, underwear, dark jeans and a size 5Â½ Air Jordan sneakers washed up on the Queens side of the East River, police said. A lawyer for Vanessa Fontaine, mother of Avonte Oquendo, filed an order to show cause in Manhattan Supreme Court Wednesday seeking to overturn the city's denial of her request for the investigative documents on privacy grounds. Avonte's family is searching for answers into how the 14-year-old managed to walk out of his school on October 4, and the manner in which the police conducted the investigation of his disappearance, said the lawyer, David Perecman. -- The New York Police Department has until February 5 to respond a court challenge of its refusal to turn over its files on the October disappearance of an autistic teenager whose remains recently washed up in Queens. A notice of claim is a precursor to a lawsuit, which Perecman said will be filed within the next couple of months.
