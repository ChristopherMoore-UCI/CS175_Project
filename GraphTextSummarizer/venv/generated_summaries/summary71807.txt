I am rooting for the pain to be eased by new lanes, bridges, on ramps, off ramps interchanges and attitude. The only thing worse than the 405 in rush hour during an accident is to throw in construction. The 405 is a time bandit, a concrete thief that steals hours as you take agonizing drives in awful traffic. l live in the San Fernando Valley, but the 405 is a mandatory evil for times when I must head to LAX for CNN trips or vacation. My relatives who are clustered up the 101 Freeway in Solvang and points beyond fortunately have zero reason to drive the 405 to get to my house, But to them, the 405 is a barrier they still must navigate in Encino, like the Alps, or the Straits of Magellan.
