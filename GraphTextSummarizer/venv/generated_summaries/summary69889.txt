"The goal is to empower refugees to speak up for themselves, support each other in solidarity and advocate for the changes that they desperately need because obviously collective bargaining beats solo endeavors." Improving lives In Hong Kong, Rahman lives with his wife in a cramped, one-room apartment that costs HK$2,800 ($360) per month. "Lots of refugees in Hong Kong live in the same conditions," says Mohammadi Rahman, chairman of Refugee Union, a group that advocates for asylum seekers' rights and helps them to find suitable housing in Hong Kong as they wait to learn their fate. Thousands living in limbo Around 6,000 people are currently seeking asylum in Hong Kong according to the territory's Immigration Department. In 2011, after more than three years in Hong Kong, the United Nations recognized Rahman as a refugee. When he arrived in Hong Kong in 2007, he, too, was homeless and slept on the streets for months.
