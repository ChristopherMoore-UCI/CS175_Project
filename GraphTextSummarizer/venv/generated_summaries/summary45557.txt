Trion is also working on migrating players away from overcrowded servers to new servers in an effort to get everyone's wait time to zero. "The fact that there is always something interesting going on in the world and the fact that the world itself can be a dangerous place and a place where there is new danger, new adventure ... gives the game a sense of urgency and banding together with other people adds a whole lot of excitement that only 'Rift' is doing," he said. " The technology is flexible enough to handle the weight of the world without crashing and still be expandable for additional players or additional game features. " Trion servers are broken down by function, unlike other games in which servers are devoted to particular locations in the game. Executive producer Scott Hartsman said the initial idea was not to create a new MMORPG, but to create a new gaming technology that would allow Trion to build games in different ways.
