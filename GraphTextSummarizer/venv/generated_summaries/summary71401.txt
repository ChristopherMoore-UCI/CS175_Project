EW Grade: B-minus CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly Copyright 2009 Entertainment Weekly and Time Inc. "The Time Traveler's Wife," adapted from the 2003 best-seller by Audrey Niffenegger, is one of those gooey romantic mind-benders, like "Ghost" (which I adored) or "The Lake House" (not so much), in which a couple must come to grips with some trippy impediment to their relationship, such as life after death or a hole in the space-time continuum. Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana star as a couple trying to connect in "The Time Traveler's Wife. Henry (Eric Bana) is deeply, and eternally, in love with Clare (Rachel McAdams), and she with him. Bana, so fantastic in "Munich," has always had to work overtime to prove that an actor who looks like the Aussie gym-rat version of Rodin's "The Thinker" can play a gentle, unassuming regular guy.
