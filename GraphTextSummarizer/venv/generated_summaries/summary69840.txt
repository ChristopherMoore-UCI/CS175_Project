"It's been a long time since I won a tournament," Murray told the official ATP Tour website. Murray will stay in China for the ATP World Tour 500 tournament in Beijing and the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 event in Shanghai, hoping to reach the finals for a seventh year in a row. Robredo was also looking for his first title since last year and was disappointed to lose out after having so many chances. Following his 2013 triumph at Wimbledon, Murray had back surgery later that year and has struggled to match those heroics this year. He was claiming his 29th career title, the first since beating Novak Djokovic in last year's Wimbledon final.
