Watch an alarmed Mexico City react with face masks, cancellations Â» WHO has sent experts to Mexico at the request of the country's government, Chan said. "What's concerning about this is, first, that it's likely swine flu; second is that at this time it is spreading from person to person," said New York City health Commissioner Thomas Frieden. Mexico City has closed all of its schools and universities because of the virus, and the country's National Health Council said all Saturday's soccer games would be played without public audiences. By Saturday night, health officials in Mexico said 81 deaths there were "likely linked" to the swine flu. The WHO's Gregory Hartl said the strain of the virus seen in Mexico is worrisome because it has mutated from older strains.
