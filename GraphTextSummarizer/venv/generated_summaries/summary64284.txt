-- One of the prosecutors in the Casey Anthony trial said Wednesday there could be perjury charges against Casey's mother, Cindy Anthony. " Ashton was on HLN's "Dr. Drew" Wednesday evening at 9 p.m. ET. Prosecutors had alleged that Casey Anthony, 25, killed her daughter, Caylee, in 2008 by rendering her unconscious with chloroform, putting duct tape over her nose and mouth so she would suffocate, or a combination of the two acts. Holly Hughes, a criminal defense attorney analyzing the Casey Anthony trial for CNN, said she believes "they've got enough evidence to prove" perjury, but "from a personal, human standpoint, I don't think we're going to see it happen. Cindy Anthony testified that she was responsible for Internet searches on the family's home computer for information about chloroform.
