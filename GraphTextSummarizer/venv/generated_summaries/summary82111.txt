Barack Obama and John McCain. Some children seemed to be in favor of Obama, some for McCain, at least one liked both, and two of them started yelling at each other over which candidate was better. Stampalia said that it was a tie between McCain and Obama, with one child for Ralph Nader. Another one found that McCain "made people do good stuff," but admitted that Obama did the same. This year, Obama won with 57 percent to McCain's 39 percent.
