"The U.N. should be making every effort to support independent Somali media and civil society at this critical time, not comparing journalists to war criminals. CNN regularly works with Somali journalists who are employed by Shabelle Media. Ould-Abdallah's statement "motivates the criminals and warlords who have been committing unpunished crimes against journalists to keep on their merciless war against media," according to Omar Faruk Osman, head of the NUSOJ. The Committee to Protect Journalists lists Somalia as the seventh most deadly nation in the world for journalists, with 11 Somali journalists killed since 2007, including Said Tahlil Ahmed and another this year. "Somali journalists have paid an enormous price to continue reporting on the crisis in Somalia," said Georgette Gagnon, HRW's Africa director.
