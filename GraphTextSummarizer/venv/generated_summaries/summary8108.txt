"With the expansion of news outlets covering the day-to-day minutiae of the campaign and Twitter creating a never-ending news cycle, this campaign has made rapid response and message discipline more important than ever," Miller told CNN. If the video is good enough -- such as the one from 2002 featuring then-Governor Romney describing himself on C-SPAN as having "progressive views" -- count on the clip to surface on cable news. Unlike Romney, GOP spin-doctors say, Santorum needs the free media. Having had quite enough of Romney's silence, the embeds banded together in the quest for some kind of social media justice on Friday. "Romney's advantages with organization and funding mean that he is not as dependent on earned media as is Santorum," former Republican National Committee spokesman Doug Heye said.
