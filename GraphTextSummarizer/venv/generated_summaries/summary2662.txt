The package originated from Yemen -- the source of last week's thwarted bomb plot -- said New York Police Department Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. FBI agents, Port Authority police and U.S. Customs and Border Protection had inspected the package "out of an abundance of caution," New York FBI spokesman Rich Kolko said. TSA Administrator John Pistole met with Yemeni government officials, including Deputy Prime Minister Rashad al-Alimi, representatives from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Interior, and U.S. ambassador Gerald Feierstein, the TSA said. After last week's incident, the TSA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection took immediate steps to enhance measures for screening inbound cargo, including grounding packages originating from Yemen destined for the U.S., the TSA said. At least seven other packages from that batch have been cleared by U.S. officials.
