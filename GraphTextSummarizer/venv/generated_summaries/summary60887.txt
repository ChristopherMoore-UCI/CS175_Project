Assistant District Attorney Amy Hunter said this case was one of the worst invasion of privacy cases she's seen. A TSA official tells CNN that Boykin worked in an administrative capacity and didn't engage in public security screening. Boykin was terminated last year when the investigation began. During the investigation, detectives with the Metro Nashville Police Department in Tennessee also found that the agent, 33-year-old Daniel Boykin, entered the woman's home multiple times, where he took videos, photos and other data. Boykin plead guilty to unlawful photography, aggravated burglary and violation of the computer act, the Nashville District Attorney's Office said.
