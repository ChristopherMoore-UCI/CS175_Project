The constitution would also bring in a bill of rights, allow dual citizenship for Kenyans -- sure to be popular with Kenya's large and loyal diaspora community -- and allow for land reform. -- President Mwai Kibaki proclaimed Thursday a "happy end" as an overwhelming majority of Kenyans voted to adopt a new constitution that is sure to bring big change to the East African country. " U.S. President Barack Obama called the vote a "step forward" for Kenya and its people, in a statement released by the White House Thursday. Many Kenyans were already celebrating before they heard the official results. "We very much welcome reports which indicate that Kenyans were able to vote in a free, fair and peaceful atmosphere," said a statement from the Panel of Eminent African Personalities.
