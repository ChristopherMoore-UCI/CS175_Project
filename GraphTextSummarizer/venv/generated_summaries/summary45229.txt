Florida State has opened a Title IX investigation into the 2012 sexual assault case involving Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis Winston, an attorney for the accuser said Friday. Florida State launched its investigation under the Title IX law, which requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual assault. Florida State remains No. 1 in the polls after a 37-31 win against Oklahoma State last week. Willie Meggs, the Florida state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit, which includes Leon County and Tallahassee, said in November that the investigators did not have probable cause to arrest Winston. Winston could be charged by Florida State for a code of conduct violation against him for sexual misconduct.
