"The passing of the Airmen makes our mission all the more important to carry on so their story is not lost but continues to serve as a legacy of inspiration," said CAF Red Tail administrator LaVone Kay. The group is generally said to consist of anybody who went through the "Tuskegee Experience," the Army Air Corps program established to train African-Americans for the war effort, according to Tuskegee Airmen Inc., a group devoted to the history of the Airmen. In 2011, he had a chance to sit in the P-51 red-tailed Mustang that the CAF Red Tail Squadron takes across the country, the first time he'd sat in the cockpit of a Mustang in decades, CAF Red Tail's newsletter observed back then. "These guys and gals are in their 90s," observed Brad Lang, a leader of the CAF Red Tail Squadron, another organization devoted to spreading the word about the Airmen. Given that trainees went through the program from 1941 to 1949, it's a safe assumption that any survivors are in their 80s or older today -- and like other World War II veterans, their numbers are dwindling.
