"By nature, women are nurturing, and able to multitask and problem solve," says Meryl Weinsaft Cooper, managing director at DeVries Public Relations and co-author (with Kleiman) of "Be You Own Best Publicist." "Women must talk to people that they respect and role models who may be in the type of positions they seek. "Women are too quick to apologize even when they didn't do anything wrong," says Jessica Kleiman, vice president of public relations at Hearst Corporation and co-author of "Be Your Own Best Publicist. Equally as important is finding personal role models -- people whose experiences you can learn from, but who may not be formal mentors. "It is helpful for a woman seeking entry into C-Suite positions to have an advocate in the organization," says Susan Bulkeley Butler, who was the first female partner at management consulting firm Accenture and now serves as the CEO of the Susan Bulkeley Butler Institute for the Development of Women Leaders.
