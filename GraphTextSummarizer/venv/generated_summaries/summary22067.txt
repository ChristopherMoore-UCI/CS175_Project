-- Major international hotel chains are increasingly rolling out thousands of new rooms in Africa's business hotspots, keen to expand their footprint on the continent's burgeoning economies. Yet, despite these hurdles, hotel groups remain very positive about their future in Africa as the continued rise in demand and undersupply in hotel rooms offer strong occupancy rates and high profitability margins in short periods of time. From Lagos and Kigali to Nairobi and Johannesburg, the world's best known hoteliers are targeting Africa's growing urban centers to benefit from a rising number of business travelers and a huge undersupply in available rooms. And whilst both international and intra-regional travel are on the up, partly thanks to Africa's natural resources boom, a shortage of rooms is prompting hoteliers to turn their attention to a continent ignored for decades.
