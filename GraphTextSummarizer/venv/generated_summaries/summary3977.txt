The unusual twin incidents added to service questions about the highly touted plane that experienced a very difficult development and clearly has growing pains, according to safety experts. The battery unit sustained severe fire damage, the safety board said, adding that it had sent two additional investigators to Boston. United Airlines, a Dreamliner operator, inspected its six 787s following the Boston fire as a precaution, but would not comment further. As the first commercial jetliner built mostly from lightweight carbon fiber, the twin-engine Dreamliner has been touted for fuel efficiency in an era of soaring fuel prices. In December, another new 787 operated by United diverted safely to New Orleans after experiencing mechanical problems.
