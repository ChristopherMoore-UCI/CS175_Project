Kroos, who starred during Germany's triumph in Brazil which culminated in a 1-0 win over Argentina in Sunday's final, penned a six-year deal Thursday after his transfer from Bayern Munich was completed in a reported $34 million deal. Baseball's New York Yankees is fourth on the list ($2.5 billion,) with fellow Major League Baseball franchise the Los Angeles Dodgers at six with a total worth of $2 billion. Barca, which recently completed the signing of Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez for a reported $128 million, is valued at $3.2 billion, while 20-time English champion United is worth $2.81 billion. It suggests "Los Blancos" earned $78 million for its victorious European Champions League campaign -- Real beat city rival Atletico Madrid in the final -- contributing to an unrivaled total revenue of $675 million. The only other European football team in the top 10 is Kroos' former club Bayern, which is ranked seventh on $1.85 billion.
