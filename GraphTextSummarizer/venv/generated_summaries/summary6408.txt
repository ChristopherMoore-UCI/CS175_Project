"James Ray cooperated at every step of the way, providing information and witnesses to the authorities showing that no one could have foreseen this accident." As many as 65 visitors, ranging in age from 30 to 60, attended Ray's "Spiritual Warrior" program at the Angel Valley Retreat Center near Sedona in October. -- Self-help guru James Ray was arrested Wednesday after a grand jury indictment charging him with three counts of manslaughter in the deaths of three participants at an Arizona sweat lodge ceremony he organized last year. Ray is charged with the deaths of Kirby Brown, James Shore and Liz Neuman. Brown and Shore were pronounced dead shortly after they arrived at a local hospital, and Neuman died October 17 after being hospitalized since the incident. Ray's attorney, Luis Li, said that the charges were unjust and that Ray would be exonerated in court.
