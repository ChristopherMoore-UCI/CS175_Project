"It is a fantastic opportunity for me to join Lotus F1 team for 2014," Maldonado said in a statement. Pastor Maldonado has been named as Frenchman Romain Grosjean's teammate at the Lotus F1 team after leaving Williams. "It's no secret that I have wanted a change of scene to help push on with my Formula 1 career and Lotus offered the very best opportunity for me to be competitive next season. "I am very happy to have official confirmation that I will be continuing to drive for Lotus next season," said Grosjean, who, like Maldonado, became a father for the first time in 2013. "With Romain and Pastor I believe Lotus will be able to cause quite a few surprises next year."
