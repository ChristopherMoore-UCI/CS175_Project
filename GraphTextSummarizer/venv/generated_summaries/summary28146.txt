A recent episode of Louis C.K.'s hit FX series involved the comedian grappling with the idea of dating an overweight woman, played by actress Sarah Baker. Forbes called the scene "The Year's Most Brutally Honest Seven Minutes Of Television." "As brilliant as the speech is, and as brilliant as Baker's performance is, what makes this work is Louie's willingness to just stand there and take it," Forbes contributor Allen St. John writes. " Writing for the A.V. Club, Libby Hill applauded Louis C.K. for starting the conversation. Writer Dan Weiss explored the episode for The Concourse, noting that "there's zero representation for actual FAs ('fat admirers,' which is admittedly a voyeuristic term; I prefer the classic 'chubby chaser') on TV." "What's despicable about television isn't that it's not depicting enough happily-ever-after fantasies showing underdogs hitting the jackpot -- it's that real life is actually better than these depictions," Weiss writes. " "My interpretation of it was that she's (telling Louie), 'You saying, "You're not fat," is like saying, 'The worst thing a woman can be is fat, so I'm not gonna call you that,' " Baker said.
