Watch more on McCain and computers Â» While wife Cindy McCain has been spotted working her BlackBerry on the campaign trail, the senator -- in one instance that CNN cameras caught -- had to be handed the device by a staffer. Sen. John McCain's senior domestic policy adviser said Tuesday that the BlackBerry mobile e-mail device was a "miracle that John McCain helped create. "If John McCain hadn't said that 'the fundamentals of our economy are strong' on the day of one of our nation's worst financial crises, the claim that he invented the BlackBerry would have been the most preposterous thing said all week," said Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton. Obama, on the other hand, frequently is seen reading e-mails on his BlackBerry. Meanwhile, McCain senior aide Matt McDonald said that the senator "laughed" when he heard the comment.
