-- "Celebrity Apprentice" will stay on the NBC prime-time schedule even if Donald Trump hits the presidential campaign trail, the network's entertainment chairman said Sunday. While he wants Trump to be available to host "Celebrity Apprentice," Greenblatt said, "It is the right and privilege for every American-born citizen in this country to run for the highest office in the land. NBC has enjoyed a ratings bump from the Trump presidential buzz, Greenblatt said. "If he decides to run for president and is unavailable to do the show, we will bring the show back and there will be somebody else sitting at the head of the boardroom table," NBC's Bob Greenblatt said. The show will fill the 8-10 p.m. ET slot on NBC's Sunday night schedule for the 2011-12 season, he said.
