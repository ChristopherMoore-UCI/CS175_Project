Muralitharan had New Zealand top scorer Scott Styris (57) lbw to send the 38,000-crowd at the R. Premadasa stadium into wild scenes of celebration. -- Hosts Sri Lanka are through to their second successive Cricket World Cup final after beating New Zealand by five wickets in Colombo on Tuesday. As well as the significance of a World Cup semifinal, the match also marked the last apperance on home soil for legendary Sri Lankan spin bowler Muttiah Muralitharan. And although Sri Lanka wobbled in their reply, Thilan Samaraweera (23 not out) and Angelo Mathews (14 not out) saw them home with a crucial 35-run stand as the home side made 220-5 off  47.5 overs -- inflicting a sixth semifinal defeat on New Zealand. It was one of Muralitharan's two wickets, with Ajantha Mendis (3-35) and Lasith Malinga (3-55) also successful as New Zealand rarely threatened to post a score big enough to defend.
