The suspected gunman was killed later in the day in a gunfight with police, Visalia California Police Chief Colleen Mestas told CNN. Church members tell police the gunman was a stranger who hadn't been seen at the church before. About 20 minutes after the shooting, police got a call from the suspect, who told them where he was heading, Mestas said. -- A Mormon bishop was shot and killed in Visalia, California, on Sunday, police said.
