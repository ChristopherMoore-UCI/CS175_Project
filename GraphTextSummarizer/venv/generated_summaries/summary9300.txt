Brazil's preparations for the 2014 World Cup suffered a setback Wednesday after a judge asked for the immediate suspension of construction at a host venue for the prestigious soccer tournament due to safety concerns. In August, Brazil's sports minister Aldo Rebelo relayed concerns over delays at five stadiums being built for next year's June 12-July 13 tournament. The stadium is scheduled to host four group stage matches next June. The opening game of the 2014 World Cup will be played in Sao Paulo, with the final set to take place at the world famous Maracana in Rio de Janeiro -- which reopened this year after lengthy renovations. An inspection will be held before work can resume after the judge stated that workers were in danger of "being buried, run over, falling from heights and being hit by material, among other serious risks."
