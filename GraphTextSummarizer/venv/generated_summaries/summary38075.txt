That focus could change, however, if evidence emerges of a policy of widespread retaliatory killings by anti-Gadhafi forces, and if the ICC concludes that Gadhafi's death was a part of that policy. Human Rights Watch has reported evidence of the apparent murder of 53 people, believed to be Gadhafi supporters, in a Sirte hotel that came under the control of anti-Gadhafi fighters. The ICC has indicted Gadhafi, his son Saif al-Islam and the head of the secret police but has so far not focused on the acts of anti-Gadhafi forces. -- Last week, Libya's former leader, Moammar Gadhafi, was killed, apparently by rebel forces. An international commission of inquiry, launched by the U.N. Human Rights Council and headed by former ICC President Philippe Kirsch of Canada, is investigating reports of extrajudicial killings, torture and other crimes in Libya.
