Cindy Anthony and her husband, George, told McGraw they differed on how their granddaughter died, with George Anthony saying he believed Casey had help disposing of Caylee's remains. George Anthony said he suspects his daughter "or someone else that she was with" may have drugged Caylee to put her to sleep so Casey Anthony could "go out and have a good time," resulting in the girl's death. " "I prayed to God for three years to find out what happened to Caylee, and I prayed during the whole trial that God would give me closure and if Casey was responsible for Caylee's death, that Casey would go to jail and be punished," Cindy Anthony said. " Cindy Anthony, Casey's mother, told television host Dr. Phil McGraw that "there is something seriously wrong with my daughter." -- Casey Anthony's acquittal on murder charges was a sign from God that her daughter Caylee's death was an accident, Cindy Anthony said in a television interview aired Wednesday.
