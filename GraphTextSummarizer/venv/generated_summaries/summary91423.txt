I read a few paragraphs from the opening scene, with U.S. 44 winding through cranberry bogs, a billboard coming into view with images of Gov. William Bradford and Elder Brewster, the greeting in boldface letters: Welcome to Plymouth -- America's Hometown, and a black Pilgrim hat that conjured up memories of all those Thanksgiving pageants in grade school when Priscilla said: "Speak for yourself, John." Publishers of textbooks have pretty much dropped the Pilgrims. That leaves little or no room for the Pilgrims and what they did. Let's hear it for the Pilgrims! The Pilgrims did not occupy passenger cabins, however small those cabins might have been back then.
