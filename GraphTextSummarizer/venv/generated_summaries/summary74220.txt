A source from the Interior Ministry told CNN that Zahi Hawass was sentenced in criminal court on Sunday, but in a blog post on his website, Hawass called that "a complete misunderstanding," and wrote that the appeals court issued a decree on Monday that will keep him out of jail and allow him to remain in his position. The sentence was related to a charge that Hawass, acting as secretary general of the SCA, refused to carry out an order to stop the bidding process last year for companies to run a bookstore in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Further, Hawass said, a court in November ruled "that I was innocent, because as the secretary general of the SCA, I was not in charge of legal affairs at the SCA, this was under the control of the Ministry of Culture at that time. He was appointed minister of antiquities affairs in January by then-President Hosni Mubarak, before weeks of civil unrest led to Mubarak's resignation. " However, the plaintiff "brought the case to the court again" claiming to have evidence Hawass was in charge of legal affairs for the council.
