In December, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist ordered an investigation into recent allegations that more than 30 crosses on the school grounds might mark the remains of boys killed at the school during the 1950s and '60s. He says he knew his dad was drinking, but one night, his father told him he was forced by school administrators to fire a gun at other boys. CNN has spoken to five men who attended the Florida School for Boys, and all of them tell similar stories of school administrators forcing the boys to lay face-down on the bed as they swung a long leather strap down upon the boys. It goes back 50 years, to a man CNN is calling "Edward," who claimed to his family that he attended a Florida reform school in Marianna in the early 1960's. MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- "Elizabeth" and "Chris" have never been to Marianna, Florida.
