Other celebrities who have practiced Hinduism include former Beatle George Harrison, author J.D. Salinger and NFL player Ricky Williams. Roberts, in an interview with Elle magazine, says she worships with her husband, cameraman Danny Moder, and their three children, People.com says. "You make these people and you love them and you want them around for a thousand years," she said about her three kids -- 3-year-old Henry and 5-year-old twins Phinnaeus and Hazel. "It's unfortunate that we live in such a panicked, dysmorphic society where women don't even give themselves a chance to see what they'll look like as older persons," she says. Roberts grew up in Georgia, the daughter of Christian parents.
