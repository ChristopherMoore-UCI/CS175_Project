"I love the idea that Wegman isn't thinking about picture books any differently from his adult work, that he's approaching his books for kids with the same kinds of ideas and aesthetic concerns," said author and panel moderator Laurel Snyder. -- When artist William Wegman shows up for events, fans don't only bring books or pictures for him to sign. The follow-up to "Flo & Wendell" features a combination of paintings and photographs, a departure from the images of dogs in costumes and roller skates for which Wegman is perhaps best known. They're the latest in a long line of Wegman's canine muses that have inspired a robust collection of paintings, photographs, films, books and worldwide exhibits. Wegman shared the book festival stage with author-illustrator Chris Gall for a discussion about why animals make such great subjects for books.
