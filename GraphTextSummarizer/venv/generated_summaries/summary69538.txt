Firefighters used foam to extinguish the flames on the tank, Baker said, adding that Greensboro firefighters kept water hoses trained on other tanks in the sprawling complex to keep them cool and prevent the fire from spreading. The blaze started at Colonial Pipeline Company in Greensboro after midnight, said David Douglas, an assistant fire chief in Greensboro. Lightning strikes apparently caused a major fire at a gasoline pipeline company's "tank farm" in North Carolina early Sunday morning, fire officials said. A tank holding about 20,000 barrels of gasoline -- about half that tank's capacity -- caught fire. There were no evacuations, Douglas said.
