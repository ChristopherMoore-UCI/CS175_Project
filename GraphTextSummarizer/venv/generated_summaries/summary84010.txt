Thirty-one people have been killed and more than 7,000 arrested in weeks of political unrest in Bangladesh, as the country's opposition mounts mass protests demanding fresh parliamentary elections. The BNP and its allies boycotted those elections, with BNP leader and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia arguing they would have been rigged by the government, and refusing to participate unless they were conducted under a neutral caretaker administration. Both Zia and Hasina have frequently called for mass protests while in opposition. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), along with 19 allied parties, called for general strikes and a nationwide blockade on road, rail and river transport on January 5, the first anniversary of disputed elections. Industry Minister Amir Hossain Amu, who heads a government committee on law and order, said security forces have detained some 7,015 people in recent weeks, who are still being held.
