Consumer passwords for the Obamacare website have not been reset, HHS officials say, but call center representatives were mistakenly given that incorrect information. The wrong script was read for only a short time -- just this morning." ArsTechnica, a technology new and information website, first reported that people were being told to reset their passwords on Tuesday, October 8. Federal officials blamed higher-than-expected traffic volume for the first day glitches -- on October 1, some 4.7 million people visited HealthCare.gov and 133,000 contacted the call center at 1-800-318-2596. The federal site for the Affordable Care Act has been plagued by technical glitches since it launched on October 1. "A wrong script was provided to call center representatives," one HHS official told CNN.
