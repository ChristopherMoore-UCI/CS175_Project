Reached by phone as she rushed to class Tuesday evening, Kennesaw State University student Jessica Colotl said the decision was "like a big present. On Friday, he filed a petition with Immigration and Customs Enforcement for an extension to stop the removal order, arguing that Colotl's graduation was days away, and asking for time to allow her to put her personal affairs in order. Colotl, who is scheduled to graduate next week with a degree in political science, became a lightning rod in the immigration debate last spring. The petition also cited similar cases across the United States in which the deportations of undocumented students were being deferred. " A spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Danielle Bennett, issued a statement saying the agency "uses discretion on a case-by-case basis, as appropriate, and has the authority to grant a deferral of removal based on the merits of an individual's case and a review of specific facts."
