We all take our shoes off in airports, show IDs to get into office buildings, and are generally treated as though we are constantly in imminent danger from terrorists -- when the truth is that there are few things less likely to kill you. The area within view of the White House is the site for protests, speeches, and innumerable tourists taking photos, all of which we want to maintain. On September 19, Gonzales not only scaled the fence, he ran across the lawn, through the White House's front door (which was unlocked), got past a Secret Service agent stationed at the door, went through the entry hall and into the East Room, and was finally apprehended near the door to the Green Room. During today's hearing, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, argued that anyone scaling the fence and running toward the White House should be shot, which would mean a lot of bullets flying outward toward those tourists. But at a time when we spend billions of dollars every year on what has come to be known as "security theater" -- procedures and practices whose effect is less to make us safe than to give the appearance of security -- this is one thing you'd think they'd be able to get right.
