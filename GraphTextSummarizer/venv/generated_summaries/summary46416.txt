Carlton Berry, 22, was arrested on the day of the shooting and charged with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, but the Harris County district attorney dismissed the charges pending "further investigation," Harris County District Clerk Claire Kennedy said. Foster was arrested in Plano, more than 250 miles north of the scene of the shooting at the North Harris campus of Lone Star College, just outside Houston. The Harris County sheriff has scheduled a news conference for Monday afternoon to talk about why the charges against Berry were dropped. Investigators arrested another man -- 22-year-old Trey Foster -- on Friday, charging him with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, Kennedy said. Harris County officials have said the January 22 shooting apparently stemmed from an argument between two men.
