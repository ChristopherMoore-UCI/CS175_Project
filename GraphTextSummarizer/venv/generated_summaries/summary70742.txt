In many countries, leaders would be delighted to control 53% of the legislature's seats -- the share United Russia will receive after parties that failed to reach the 7% threshold are eliminated. Despite a campaign marred by what international observers described as "procedural violations," "apparent manipulations," and "serious indications of ballot-box stuffing," the governing United Russia party failed to prevent a sharp drop in its vote total. Last year, massive government spending on pensions and public-sector wages boosted incomes by a little more than 4%. But in histories of the decline of the order built by Vladimir Putin in Russia, last Sunday's parliamentary election is bound to feature prominently. Some members of the disaffected third were evidently among the sports fans at a martial arts fight last month who booed and jeered after Putin stepped into the ring to congratulate the winner.
