Water levels at 700-acre Lake Tangipahoa dropped Friday as authorities pumped water from it, meaning a damaged earthen dam may not have to be breached, Mississippi Emergency Management spokesman Brett Carr said. That includes hundreds of thousands without power around the Gulf Coast, including 430,000 Entergy Louisiana customers Friday evening. Officials in Louisiana say two bridges in Tangipahoa Parish have been closed because the river's water level has been too high. Animals have also been impacted -- from the 94 cats and dogs in shelters in Alexandria and another 63 in Haughton, to state authorities waiving restrictions to allow beef cattle to be evacuated from Louisiana to Texas. -- With all sides vowing politicking isn't in order, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got a close-up view Friday of the devastation caused this week by Hurricane Isaac -- days ahead of a visit by his November foe, President Barack Obama.
