Recently, in perhaps the most damning YouTube moment yet in a presidential race, Barack Obama was captured putting domestic politics ahead of foreign policy. This past week, the Obama who supported gay marriage when running for Illinois legislature, then flipped against it as candidate for president, flopped once more to serve his re-election. Obama has become what he came to Washington to change:  He is politics. The Obama running for re-election is for everything and nothing at once, a creature of calculation. Still, we recall the Obama campaign as a crushing force, brilliantly harnessed, riding the tide of history.
