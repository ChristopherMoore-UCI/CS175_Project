After reading a few of the many trending articles about the upcoming "Music Independence Day," I actually spent some time Wednesday afternoon nostalgically searching YouTube for old videos from what many argue were MTV's glory years -- when Nirvana competed for airtime with Eric Clapton and Van Halen and Metallica and R.E.M. and Sir Mix-a-Lot. -- Children of the '80s and '90s fondly remember a time when MTV actually played music videos. However, on Thursday, to celebrate the Fourth of July, MTV and VH1 decided to go with 12 straight hours of music video programming. The very thing I was doing -- instantly calling up videos on YouTube -- is part of the reason why MTV doesn't air them in the first place. MTV's sister network, on the other hand, seemed to be dedicating the bulk of its airtime to emerging indie bands, and I was immediately introduced to a duo called Johnnyswim and their video for "Heart Beats."
