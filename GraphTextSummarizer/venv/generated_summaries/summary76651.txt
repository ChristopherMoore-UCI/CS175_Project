Uyghur diaspora groups, like the World Uyghur Congress, have criticized the Chinese government for the lack of transparency over such events. The arrival of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. The group "advocated extremist religious thoughts, produced explosive devices and guns, and tested explosives several times in a bid to plot terrorist attacks," the report said. Two police officers chasing suspects came under attack late Sunday from people with machetes and explosive devices in Shufu county, near the city of Kashgar, said Tianshan, a news website run by the Xinjiang government. -- Sixteen people have been killed in violence in China's volatile western region of Xinjiang, state media reported Monday.
