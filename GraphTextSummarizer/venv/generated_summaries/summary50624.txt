Ian Poulter, the man known as "Mr Ryder Cup" will be part of the European side after securing a wildcard pick from captain Paul McGinley. McGinley, the European captain, told a news conference that omitting Donald, who boasts an impressive Ryder Cup record, was one of his most difficult tasks. McGinley's team will also have two men making their debuts at the competition with Victor Dubuisson of France and Welshman Jamie Donaldson both having qualified. The U.S. will come face to face with the man who helped inspire the "Miracle of Medinah" once more when it faces Europe at the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. Westwood, who made his Ryder Cup debut in 1997, has won 21 points in 37 matches and has appeared in eight editions of the competition.
