Indiana and Montana have joined the growing list of states with confirmed cases of Enterovirus D68, health officials say. Hospitals are sending samples from patients with severe respiratory illnesses to a state laboratory for testing. Other states, including Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Utah, are also investigating clusters of respiratory illnesses. But this type of enterovirus -- Enterovirus D68 -- appears to be exacerbating breathing problems in children with asthma. Montana has one confirmed case of Enterovirus D68, says Jon Ebelt, a spokesman for the state's public health department.
