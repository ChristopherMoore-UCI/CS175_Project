According to Nancy Schoenberger, co-author of the book "Furious Love: Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, The Marriage of the Century," Taylor developed a taste for jewels from a young age. "Highlights from the Collection of Elizabeth Taylor" is on public display at Christie's, London, on 24, 25 and 26 September, after which it will travel to Los Angeles, Dubai, Geneva, Paris, Hong Kong and finally, New York. Keith Penton, head of the jewelry department at Christie's in London, said that Taylor's taste in jewels was "extraordinarily refined. But it wasn't until Taylor's marriage to film and Broadway producer Mike Todd that her passion for collecting serious jewels took hold, Schoenberger said. Schoenberger believes that when Richard Burton bought Taylor the 33.19-carat Krupp Diamond ring in 1968 -- possibly the star piece in the exhibition at Christie's, estimated to fetch between $2.5 million and $3.5 million -- he was trying to out-do Mike Todd, who had died unexpectedly just over a year into his marriage with Taylor.
