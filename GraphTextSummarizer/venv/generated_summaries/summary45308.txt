In the women's draw, world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki is top seed for the sixth grand slam in a row. Elsewhere, Chinese fifth seed and 2011 French Open champion Li Na faces Kazakhstan's Ksenia Pervak, while three-time grand slam winner and fourth seed Maria Sharapova will play Argentina's Gisela Dulko. Sixth seed Samantha Stosur, who became Australia's first winner of a women's grand slam singles title in 31 years at the 2011 U.S. Open, will play Romania's 60th-ranked Sorana Cirstea. -- Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are used to meeting in grand slam finals, but the dominance of Novak Djokovic in 2011 means the two great rivals will feature in the same half of the draw for the first time in seven years at the Australian Open. Defending champion Djokovic, however, will start out against Italy's 108th-ranked Paolo Lorenzi as he starts a campaign that could see him meet last year's runner-up Andy Murray in the last four.
