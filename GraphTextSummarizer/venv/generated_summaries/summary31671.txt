Kris Jenner is famous because she gave the world Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Rob Kardashian during her marriage to O.J. Simpson's lawyer, the late Robert Kardashian; and Kendall and Kylie Jenner from her now-ending marriage. Former Olympian Bruce Jenner, 64, told People magazine last October that he may be "happier" living separately, but that didn't mean they're would divorce. Kris Jenner, 58, is offering joint custody of their only minor child, 17-year-old Kylie, but she wants to keep all of her earnings since their legal separation on June 1, 2013, according to the court document. Kris Jenner made official what has been speculated for months -- that her marriage to Bruce Jenner is over. The Kardashian family matriarch cited "irreconcilable differences" with her husband of 23 years in a divorce petition filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court Monday.
