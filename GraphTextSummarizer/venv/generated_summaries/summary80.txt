The Red Sox, defeated the Cardinals 6-1 on Wednesday to win their eighth World Series title and cap a wicked good worst-to-first season that delighted a city dealing with the aftermath of the deadly bombings at its signature marathon in April. It's the club's third World Series title in the last 10 seasons -- albeit the first that they've celebrated on their home field since 1918. In April at a remembrance ceremony for the victims of the bombing, it was Ortiz, known as Big Papi, who fired up the crowd. It says 'Boston,' " Ortiz said, standing on the infield as the crowd cheered officers who were on the field. Shane Victorino drove in four runs with a bases-loaded double in the third and an RBI single in the fourth as Boston took the Series four games to two.
