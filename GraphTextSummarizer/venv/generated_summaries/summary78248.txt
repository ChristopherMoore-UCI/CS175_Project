Iran insists that its nuclear program is peaceful, but the world powers fear it has ambitions to build nuclear weapons. World powers and Iran resumed talks Thursday in Vienna, Austria, aimed at reaching a permanent deal on the future of Tehran's nuclear program ahead of a looming deadline. Under the interim deal, Iran cut back on parts of its nuclear program and the six nations reduced economic sanctions. "We have to be hopeful for a deal, otherwise young people will keep leaving Iran," said graphic artist Behnaz. However, the world powers expect a final deal that adds further checks and limitations to Iran's nuclear program.
