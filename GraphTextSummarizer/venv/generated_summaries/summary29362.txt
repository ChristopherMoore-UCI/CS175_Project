Clay courts require a different type of game to grass and hard court surfaces The Roland Garros tournament is currently being contested, with Rafael Nadal looking for his fifth win in a row, and world number two Roger Federer searching for his first ever French Open title. If you look at Nadal, his return of service points of contact are different to other surfaces ... on clay he can sit back. All officially recognized courts have a court pace rating (CPR), which rates the "speed" of the court -- and clay courts are at the bottom. Head of women's tennis at Britain's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), Nigel Sears, told CNN the slippery nature of the clay surface also set it apart from other types of court. But it's not just the bounce and speed of the ball off the clay surface that sets it apart from other courts, and makes the French Open an elusive tournament for some players.
