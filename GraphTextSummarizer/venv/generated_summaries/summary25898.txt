The major critic of Chinese investment in the nation's copper industry has especially targeted foreign companies that mistreat Zambian workers. "I hope other African nations can learn from Banda," said Mutheliso Phiri, 36 . "He was almost like their Gadhafi -- this was their way of revolting against a party they felt has been in power for too long," Phiri said, referring to the ousted Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi. "He's a hardworking man and has done a good job in his past positions." Johnson said Chinese companies are "shrewd and diplomatic investors" and will ensure they accommodate the new government to tap into its resources and expand investments. The 29-year-old Kitwe resident hopes the new president will keep his pledge to provide more jobs.
