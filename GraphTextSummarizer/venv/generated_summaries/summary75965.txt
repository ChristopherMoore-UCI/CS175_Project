-- Wladimir Klitschko dominated his world heavyweight title unification match against Britain's David Haye to clinch a unanimous points decision in their bout Saturday night in Hamburg, Germany. The giant Ukrainian retained his IBF and WBO versions of the title and claimed Haye's WBA crown after a polished display over 12 rounds in the Imtech Arena of Bundesliga side SV Hamburg. The wily, 35-year-old Klitschko, who took his record to 56-3, used his extra weight and reach advantage to good effect as his jab kept his opponent at bay. It was the second defeat of 31-year-old Haye's 27-fight career, most of it at cruiserweight before stepping up a division for his last five fights. He managed to avoid Haye's desperate attempts to bring the fight to a swifter conclusion and scored the only knockdown of the fight in the 11th round, although the Briton was swiftly to his feet after what appeared to be a push.
