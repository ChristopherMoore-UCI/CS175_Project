After maintaining a nice lead, the team put Dompierre in the game and he hit a three-point shot against rival Negaunee High School. For the past two years, the Dompierres, with the support of the Ishpeming School District, have tried to get the rule changed so Dompierre can play during his senior year. Dompierre has played sports with other children in Ishpeming, Michigan, since he was in elementary school. When he got to high school, Dompierre was invited to keep playing. "We didn't know how far he'd go, how many coaches would keep him on the team," said Dean Dompierre, Eric's father.
