-- A U.S. satellite project said Wednesday it has found evidence of additional mass graves in South Kordofan, a day after the Sudanese president called for a unilateral cease-fire in the state. South Kordofan remains a territory of the Sudanese government in the north, but borders South Sudan. The report follows allegations by human rights groups that Sudanese forces have conducted widespread killings in the region this summer. In July, a United Nations report detailed new allegations of violence, including mass graves, in the volatile border state. Nuba fighters helped South Sudan during the civil war with Sudan, which raged for decades and left millions dead.
