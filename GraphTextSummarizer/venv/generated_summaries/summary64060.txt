House Speaker John Boehner warned President Barack Obama in person Friday that signing an executive order overhauling immigration laws would spoil their chances of cooperating on other issues in the future. But the White House said in a readout of the lunch that Obama "reiterated his commitment to taking action on immigration reform in light of the House's inability to pass a comprehensive bill." David Axelrod tweets Obama: Get House to vote on immigration Obama had already repeated his pledge to sign an executive order on immigration in the coming months during a news conference this week -- and Boehner and McConnell separately said doing so would "poison the well" and complicate the White House's chances of getting Congress on board with any of its other goals. Boehner's message came the same day that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said that Obama's "nuclear threat" of an executive order on immigration  would cause the GOP to back away from supporting the type of comprehensive reform that he'd said looked key to the party's survival just two years ago. " Opinion: Obama, GOP, get going on immigration reform Priebus's stance was a departure from an RNC-commissioned "autopsy report" that came in the wake of Obama's re-election in 2012.
