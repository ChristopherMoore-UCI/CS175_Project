Siswosuwano told CNN that several pings were detected emitting a frequency of 37.5 MHZ, leading search team to believe they are getting closer to finding at least one of the black boxes. The sound is very clear, the typical sound of black box ping. The plane's pilot had asked to change course and climb to a higher altitude minutes before contact was lost, Indonesian officials said. "I think we will be able to find the black boxes in a few days, because the location where pings were detected is not very far from the tail," Siswosuwarno said. The vast majority of the people on AirAsia QZ8501 were Indonesian.
