Inter won 5-4 on penalties away at Napoli after the match had finished 0-0, as they continue their unlikely bid to emulate the treble achieved under Jose Mourinho last season. The victory in Turin earns Roma a clash with holders Inter Milan, while Palermo will face AC Milan in the other two-legged last four encounter. -- Mirko Vucinic and Rodrigo Taddei scored second half goals as AS Roma beat Juventus 2-0 in the quarterfinals of the Coppa Italia Thursday night. It was the seventh win in eight matches for Claudio Ranieri's improving side, who have moved up to a challenging third in Serie A behind leaders Milan. But it was a sorry defeat for sliding Juve with a Europa League place for the winners of the domestic cup at stake.
