The breach occurred Friday and targeted user data from subsidiary "SEGA Pass", which is operated by Britain-based SEGA Europe Limited (SEL). -- Hackers have stolen personal information from over 1.2 million customers of the Japanese gaming company SEGA, according to a company statement. SEGA creates games that play on SONY's PlayStation as well as on other gaming systems. SEGA says it shut down service as soon as it confirmed the illegal access and sent affected customers an e-mail apology. SEGA advertises its privacy measures on a banner at the bottom of its website, which reads "ESRB Privacy Certified".
