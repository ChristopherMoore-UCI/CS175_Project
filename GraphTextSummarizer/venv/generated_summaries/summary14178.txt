Phet lashed Pakistan's southwestern coast early Sunday as it approached landfall. The Pakistani navy dispatched helicopters throughout the weekend to alert fishermen near Karachi and parts of Balochistan of the cyclone. Also Saturday, officials safely brought 24 fishing boats and 129 fishermen back to shore, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
