Speakes took over the duties as acting White House press secretary after James Brady, the press secretary, was shot during an assassination attempt on Reagan on March 30,1981. -- Larry Speakes, who served as the acting White House press secretary under President Ronald Reagan, died Friday morning at his home in Cleveland, Mississippi, following a lengthy illness, the Bolivar County coroner said. Speakes went to work in the Nixon White House in May 1974, where he was eventually assigned as press secretary for the special counsel to President Richard Nixon during the Watergate hearings, according to the biography. Just two months into the job, Speakes was named acting press secretary after Brady was shot by John Hinckley Jr. In 1968, he was hired as press secretary to Sen. James Eastland, the then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
