"We have to recognize, in 'The Butler,' in 'Fruitvale,' people (are) standing up and trying to say things," Whitaker said. Oprah Winfrey, who stars as Whitaker's wife in "The Butler," acknowledged possible backlash. Not only do both films tackle issues of civil rights, but they also share a Hollywood connection: Forest Whitaker stars as the main character, Cecil Gaines, in "The Butler" and is an executive producer of "Fruitvale Station." In a conversation with AOL, Winfrey also acknowledged the challenge of getting movie goers to turn out for such heavy fare. " In a CNN story titled "Is 'The Help' heroic or stereotyping?" published in 2011, "The Help" star Octavia Spencer -- who also stars in "Fruitvale Station" -- defended the film that eventually won her an Academy Award for best supporting actress.
