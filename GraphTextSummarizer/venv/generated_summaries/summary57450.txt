President Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calder칩n in Mexico City on Thursday. After a one-on-one interview with President Obama on Wednesday, CNN en Espa침ol's Juan Carlos L칩pez is traveling with Obama to Mexico City and to the Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago. Obama's relationship with Mexico started on shaky ground, although the first foreign leader he met with as president-elect was Mexican President Felipe Calder칩n. It is not clear if Obama will be welcomed in the same way he was by Europe two weeks ago, but so far the signs are positive -- to have a U.S. president saying he is willing to listen to and treat Latin American neighbors as equals is something the region isn't used to. Congress ended a pilot program that allowed Mexican trucks into U.S. territory, as contemplated in the North America Free Trade Agreement; Mexico, in line with the treaty, retaliated by imposing fees on 90 U.S. products.
