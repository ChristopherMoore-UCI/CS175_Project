" Proponents say if Shell finds oil with its Arctic drilling, it could create thousands of  jobs; opponents -- Alaska's Inuit Eskimos and environmentalists -- say an oil spill could pollute the waters and damage the economy. Shell spokesman Curtis Smith said all indications pointed to the Noble Discoverer slipping anchor in soft ground, drifting only 100 yards toward shore. Shell has been forced to postpone drilling, which was scheduled to begin this month, until August by an unexpected thick ice pack.
