It also apologized for a question ESPN anchor Max Bretos asked Wednesday night: "If there is a chink in the armor, where can Lin improve his game?" The network said Sunday that a third reference was made on ESPN Radio New York on Friday. -- ESPN has fired the employee responsible for writing an offensive headline about basketball sensation Jeremy Lin and suspended an anchor who used the same ethnic slur, the sports network said Sunday. Lin addressed the controversy during a news conference Sunday following the Knicks' 104-97 win over the Dallas Mavericks, the defending national champions. "We again apologize, especially to Mr. Lin," ESPN said. Lin, 23, came off the bench earlier this month to guide the Knicks to win after improbable win.
