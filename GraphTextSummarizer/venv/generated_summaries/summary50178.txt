" Gov. Rick Perry renewed a disaster proclamation in effect for all of Texas' 249 counties -- even though major fires are occurring in 13 of them -- to expedite assistance in case of new fires, his office said Sunday in a statement.

But by Sunday night, such warnings were only in effect for parts of Texas and New Mexico.
