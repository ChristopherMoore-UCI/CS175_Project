Taxing capital gains at death could be a step forward if tax rates on capital gains and dividends were cut by enough to prevent an increase in the overall burden on saving. Unfortunately, it would mean increasing taxes on saving and investment, which are key drivers of economic growth, according to various experts. But it turns around and strikes a heavy blow against saving by taxing some capital gains at death and raising the top tax rate on capital gains and dividends. People who earn wages and spend them immediately pay tax only on their wages. Under today's tax system, secondary earners often face high tax rates based on the couple's combined earnings.
