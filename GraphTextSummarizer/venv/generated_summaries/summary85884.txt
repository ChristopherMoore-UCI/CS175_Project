Filner has been in mediation talks on the heels of undergoing intensive two-week behavioral therapy amid multiple allegations that paint him as a serial perpetrator of sexual harassment. The embattled mayor has steadfastly resisted efforts to force him out of office in recent weeks. -- An agreement has been reached with San Diego Mayor Bob Filner after three days of mediation, the city attorney told reporters Wednesday. Filner has rebuffed calls to resign from all nine City Council members and from fellow Democrats, including California's two U.S. senators. His accusers range from a singer at a campaign fundraiser to his former communications director, who called him unfit for office.
