Prosecutors say Martorano killed at the direction of Boston's Winter Hill Gang and Bulger, who is standing trial on 19 murder charges along with racketeering and extortion charges. In another slaying, Bulger sat at the wheel of a car, while another crime associate, Tommy King, sat in the passenger seat, with Martorano behind him, the witness said. Martorano said that Bulger's "plan B" to take the heat off the Winter Hill Gang for King's murder was to kill King's good friend, Buddy Leonard, and put him in King's car to make it look like the two got into a dispute that ended with Leonard's death and King's disappearance. Witness: Heartbroken to know Bulger was FBI informant "My father, the priests, the nuns" taught him to always "defend family and friends," Martorano testified. But when trusted FBI contact John Connolly indicated that Callahan was going to be pressured by the government to testify about the murder, the Winter Hill partners, with Martorano outvoted, decided it was too risky for Callahan to live.
