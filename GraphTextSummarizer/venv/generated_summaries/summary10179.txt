This is why it is extremely important for campaigns to have strong organization to try and pick up new delegates, while making sure they hold on to unpledged delegates who expressed support. Congressional district delegates are elected at the district conventions, while at-large delegates are elected at the state convention. In many caucus states, the first round usually has a nonbinding presidential straw poll and an election of delegates to another local convention. For Paul, this could mean picking up delegates in states that have already held their first round of voting. "Our campaign has continued to follow up and work the delegate selection processes in the states where contests have already been held, and we plan to work hard to collect delegates in upcoming states where the awarding of delegates is proportional," Gary Howard, Paul's national press secretary, said in a statement.
