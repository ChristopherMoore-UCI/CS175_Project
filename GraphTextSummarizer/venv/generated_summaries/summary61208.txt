But, "Empire of the Sun," his semi-autobiographical account of the war years, became his best-known work, and it was made into a film by director Steven Spielberg in 1988. -- British author J.G. Ballard, whose boyhood experience in a World War II internment camp became the novel and film "Empire of the Sun," died Sunday at age 78, his literary agent said. "J.G. Ballard has been a giant on the world literary scene for more than 50 years," Margaret Hanbury said Monday. Ballard's semi-autobiographical "Empire of the Sun" was made into a movie by Steven Spielberg. He began writing science fiction in the 1950s, with his work taking on a strongly psychological, apocalyptic bent in later decades.
