Their recommendations include a  short-term needle exchange program and public awareness campaign focusing on safe sex, needle disposal, addiction services, and HIV testing and treatment. Health officials recommend people who have participated in risky behavior, such as needle sharing and unprotected sex, to be tested for HIV now and again in three months. Gov. Mike Pence issued the order Thursday for Scott County, which has 79 confirmed cases of HIV since mid-December. "Scott County is facing an epidemic of HIV, but this is not a Scott County problem; this is an Indiana problem,"  Pence said in a news release. The declaration requires law enforcement, emergency agencies and health officials to develop a response plan that also includes hospitals and health care providers.
