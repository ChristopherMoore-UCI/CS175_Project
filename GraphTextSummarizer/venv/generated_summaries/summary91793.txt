The hat may have been in poor taste, but it was given to James as a gag gift by his Jewish godfather, attorney Joe Yanny said. As evidence that James is no anti-Semite, Yanny said James lived for nearly a month in an Israeli kibbutz. James is at a treatment facility "to deal with personal issues" in a bid to save his marriage to actress Sandra Bullock, a spokeswoman for James said. "I understand people's desire in newsworthy stories, but I would hope that by now this wasn't such a newsworthy story such that his basic rights and privacy aren't continuously invaded in an improper manner," Yanny told CNN. James has been the target of controversy and publicity since his separation with Bullock soon after she won a best actress Oscar earlier this month.
