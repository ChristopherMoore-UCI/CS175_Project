" Commercial interests Els spends the majority of his time based in Palm Beach, but every winter returns to South Africa to check personally on his private and commercial interests. If the foundation is dear to Els' heart, the fund-raising charity he has set up to tackle autism is a real labor of love. His son Ben was diagnosed with the condition when he was four, and Els set himself the goal of establishing a center of excellence for autism that would be at the cutting edge of research and educational therapy, "something the world has never seen before." With his worldwide fame and influence, Els knows that he is in a position to make a real difference in tackling autism. There are a lot of kids in South Africa, and around the world, that have talent.
