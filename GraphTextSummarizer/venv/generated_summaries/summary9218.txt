Norm Hyde, spokesman for festival host Meadow Event Park, said Federal Aviation Administration inspectors were on site Friday, checking balloons and safety records before the balloons took off. What authorities still do not know is what caused the balloon to drift into power lines, catch fire and crash Friday night. But then there was an explosion, and the basket and balloon separated. -- Officials have now identified all three people killed in the hot air balloon fire and crash at a Virginia festival. Weather conditions are one of the elements investigators are looking at, NTSB air safety investigator Heidi Moats said.
