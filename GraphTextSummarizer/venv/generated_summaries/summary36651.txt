In a gesture of solidarity, Delta employees raised $30 million to purchase it for the airline during tough economic times in 1982. But this place also appeals to nonaviation aficionados, thanks to its collection of stylish luggage and Delta uniforms. For years access to the museum was limited to Delta employees and their friends. Restoring this silver-skinned beauty was a triumph for a handful of retired Delta employees, who took it apart and rebuilt it in the 1990s, returning it to nearly as good as new. Workers carefully took it apart and trucked it nearly a thousand miles to Atlanta, where Delta's Technical Ops Center refurbished it to like-new condition, rewiring it with LED lighting.
