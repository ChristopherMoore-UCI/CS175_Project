The family of boxing legend Muhammad Ali hopes he will be home from the hospital in time for his 73rd birthday on Saturday. Bob Gunnell said Ali is in stable condition and doctors indicated he would be released Friday. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory against Sonny Liston. Ali, who has Parkinson's disease, has been in an undisclosed hospital this week getting follow-up care for a urinary tract infection, a spokesman for the family said Thursday. Shortly thereafter, he changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam.
