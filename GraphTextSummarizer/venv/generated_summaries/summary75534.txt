"I don't think the majority of our customers understand the monikers," AT&T executive Glenn Lurie said in an interview here at CES. -- The International Consumer Electronics Show, the giant gadget convention that wrapped up on Friday, has brought some frustrating news for AT&T or Sprint customers who bought a cutting-edge 4G smartphone last year. AT&T announced eight new LTE products at CES, including smartphones and tablets. At CES last year, Verizon hosted two large news conferences and operated a huge booth to promote the launch of its 4G network. Verizon is on track to have its 4G network match the coverage of its 3G network by next year, a spokeswoman said Friday.
