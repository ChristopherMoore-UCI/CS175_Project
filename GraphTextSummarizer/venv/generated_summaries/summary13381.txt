"Because we are letting radioactive material leak into the environment, we are getting a bad reputation from overseas," protester Mamoru Matsuda said. "We need electricity, but we cannot put lives at risk," said Kentaro Morisawa, a railway worker who took part in the Tokyo protest. In addition, restrictions on various agricultural and fisheries products have devastated Japanese farmers and fishermen since the disaster started, though some of those bans have been lifted in recent weeks. The protests are the latest show of discontent for embattled Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who survived a no-confidence vote in this month. The massive quake on March 11 triggered a nuclear crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, forcing the evacuation of thousands.
