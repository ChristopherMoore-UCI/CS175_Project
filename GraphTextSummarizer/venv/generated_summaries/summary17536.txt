Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, announced December 19 that he would keep the Senate open with a series of pro forma sessions through mid-January. Democrats kept the Senate in session over the holiday season. Democrats are keeping the Senate in session to block President Bush from making any recess appointments. Nearly all the senators left the Capitol for the Christmas holiday nearly a week and a half ago, but only one senator is needed to keep the Senate in session. During congressional recesses, a constitutional mechanism allows the president to fill top government posts for up to one year without Senate confirmation.
