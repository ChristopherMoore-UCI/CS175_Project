Yes, you read that right: Lydie's biological parents gave her up for adoption to her wealthy aunt and uncle, which her uncle later annulled so he and Lydie could marry. Keener will star as a new friend to a divorcée Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, who ends up falling for Keener's ex-husband (James Gandolfini). [Variety] • Lindsay Lohan is in talks for an unspecified role in "Scary Movie 5," to be directed by Malcolm D. Lee (Soul Men).
