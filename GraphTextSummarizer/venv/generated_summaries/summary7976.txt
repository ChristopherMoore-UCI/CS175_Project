" The rhetoric Floyd was referring to isn't confined to the angry words and sometimes violent clashes between police and protesters after Michael Brown was shot to death in Ferguson, Missouri, or the New York death of Eric Garner after police attempted to subdue him, which also spurred national protests, said Fund spokesman Steve Groeninger. The number of law enforcement officers shot to death in the line of duty is up by more than 50% this year, and the leading method of those shootings was ambush-style attack. He added that the Department of Justice is doing its own analysis of officer deaths in 2014 "so we can mitigate risks in the future. It was also published less than two weeks after the December 20 ambush shooting of two New York City police officers. Groeninger said the uptick in ambush-style attacks was "punctuated" by the New York officers' slayings, but there were other targeted attacks against law enforcement in 2014 that concern the Fund.
