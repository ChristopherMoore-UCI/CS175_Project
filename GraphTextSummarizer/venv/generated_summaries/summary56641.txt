-- While most first-person shooter games want players to kill as a means of completing a mission,"Bulletstorm" takes that premise to the next level by having players "kill with skill." Even toward the end of the game, I was still figuring out new combinations of weapons and environment that unlocked more new skillshot points. Players can cash in the points for upgrades to weapons and a special device called the Leash. The new first-person shooter from Epic Games, People Can Fly and Electronic Arts ends up being a campy, over-the-top offering, featuring a new game play style that awards points for killing enemies in unique ways. However, "Bulletstorm," with its "kill with skill" mentality, is a great change of pace in the first-person shooter genre that rewards players for doing something different.
