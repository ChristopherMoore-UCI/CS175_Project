" To be fair, Psaki described the U.S. peace talks with the Taliban -- which Afghan President Hamid Karzai opposes -- as the preliminary step toward long healing process in war-torn Afghanistan and creating "reconciliation" within the country. What has influenced U.S. leaders is the Taliban's announcement that they oppose "the use of Afghan soil to threaten other countries" such as the United States and they support an Afghan peace process, Psaki said. The ability to open a formal line of communication with the Taliban is important to reaching an "end goal" of disassociating the Taliban from al Qaeda and bringing peace to Afghanistan, Psaki said. To advance peace, the Taliban has chosen, Doha, Qatar, to open an office under the name "Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan." In a statement, Karzai said his country wants peace, "but the messages of continuation of fighting, which were sent out during the opening of the Taliban office in Qatar, are completely in contradiction with the peace-wanting spirit of the government of Afghanistan.
