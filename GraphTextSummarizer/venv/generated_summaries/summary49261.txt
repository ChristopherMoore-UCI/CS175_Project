I am tired of seeing images of police officers with snarling dogs threatening a crowd of black protesters and not knowing if it's from the 1960s or last week. When you consider that home ownership has long been the prerequisite for the average American to acquire wealth, there is little wonder why white Americans have 22 times more wealth than blacks. Because of an appraisal system that deemed integrated communities financial risks, less than 2% of those loans went to minorities. I'm tired of unarmed dead black people being put on trial. I am tired of the charlatans who chase the bodies of innocent victims the way sleazy lawyers chase ambulances.
