Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said this weekend on CNN that de Blasio had sparked "intense, anti-police hatred" with his support for protesters. " De Blasio also accused the media of contributing to the atmosphere of tension between police and protesters. And in recent weeks he's pushed for the right of demonstrators to gather to protest the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two unarmed African-American men, at the hands of white police officers. Patrick Lynch, the head of NYPD's police union, also lashed out at de Blasio, saying that there's blood on the hands of those who have supported the protesters and it "starts on the steps of city hall in the office of the mayor." But a startling divide between how white Americans and minorities view the criminal justice system, revealed by a new CNN/ORC poll, underscores the challenge facing both de Blasio and Obama as they struggle to find a solution to broken relationship between the police and the communities they serve.
