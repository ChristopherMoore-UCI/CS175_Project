Britain declared war on Germany after it invaded neutral Belgium on August 4, 1914. But he said the fact that war was now "unthinkable" between the former World War I enemies represented at the ceremony "bears testimony to the power of reconciliation. British Prime Minister David Cameron said in a statement, "A hundred years ago today Britain entered the First World War and we are marking that centenary to honor those who served, to remember those who died, and to ensure that the lessons learnt live with us forever." Dignitaries including King Philippe of Belgium, the French and German Presidents and Britain's Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, addressed those gathered in remembrance Monday. Prince William said the people of Belgium had been among the war's first victims, and their "resistance was as gallant as their suffering was great." Belgium's sacrifice and contribution had been pivotal to eventual victory, the prince said.
