Opinion: What the Internet owes to Roger Ebert Freed largely from the "old media" standard of public impartiality, Ebert mixed it up lustily at times on topics ranging from video games to politics. Remembering Roger Ebert: Tweets pour in Forget the need to continue the long-form journalism that won Ebert a Pulitzer Prize. But in his final years, when cancer had robbed him of his jawbone and whittled away his once ample frame, it was social media, particularly Twitter, that let Ebert not only keep talking, but also interact with his fans, and foes, more freely and personally than ever. But while many Twitter users with a dose of celebrity use the site as a self-promotional megaphone, for Ebert it was a two-way radio. Twitter was where Ebert continued talking about movies, politics, life and the universe the same way he'd once done over mugs of beer at his beloved Chicago ale houses.
