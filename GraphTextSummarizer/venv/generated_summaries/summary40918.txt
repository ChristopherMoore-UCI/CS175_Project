"While we're disappointed a small group of misinformed individuals was able to deny fans what would have been great concerts at SeaWorld, we respect the artists' decisions," Gollattscheck said in an e-mailed statement nearly identical to what was sent to CNN when others canceled last month. "More than 11 million people a year visit SeaWorld parks and most will see a killer whale presentation during their visit," Gollattscheck said. SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck confirmed Adkins' cancellation, which CNN was initially alerted to through Twitter postings Thursday. SeaWorld is working to book replacement acts, Gollattscheck said. Adkins joins a long list of musical acts who have canceled shows that were scheduled as part of SeaWorld's "Bands, Blues & BBQ" in February and March.
