When North Yemen and South Yemen reunited in 1990, Saleh became president of the new country and remained in power for the next 21 years, playing tribal rivalries off one another and remaining an ally of the West despite the lingering presence of al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula in Yemen. Inspired by protests in Tunisia that forced the country's president, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, to relinquish power after 23 years, demonstrations spread across the Middle East and North Africa, eventually toppling the regimes of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. On Wednesday, the 69-year-old ruler signed an agreement in Saudi Arabia transferring executive powers to the country's vice president, Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi. Ali Abdullah Saleh clung to power in Yemen for 33 years, navigating -- and even channeling -- the country's complex tribal power structure. They culminated in mass protests calling for Saleh's resignation despite his promises first to reform the constitution and later assurances that he would step down in 2013 and would not try to transfer power to his son.
