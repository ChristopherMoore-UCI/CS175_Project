The San Mateo County Sheriff's Department was contacted this week by someone saying the stolen cross was tied to a fence post in Half Moon Bay. There have been no arrests or any indication who stole the original cross and how it would up in the San Francisco Bay area. -- A stolen war memorial that was at the center of a prominent legal battle over the display of religious symbols on public land was found this week tied to a fence post near San Francisco. Federal officials said on Thursday the Mojave Cross, removed by vandals from its lonely California desert perch two years ago, was located 500 miles away in Half Moon Bay. After months of subsequent litigation, the National Park Service conveyed a one-acre piece of federal land where the cross stood to the California Veterans of Foreign Wars.
