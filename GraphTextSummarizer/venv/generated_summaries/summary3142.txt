Compounding pharmacists customize medications to fit an individual's needs. And the state pharmacy board took the step of requiring all compounding pharmacies in Massachusetts to sign affidavits stating they are complying with state regulations requiring compounders to mix medications for specific patients. Typically medications are mass-produced by drug manufacturing companies. The cases have been linked to injections of contaminated steroid medication made by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. As drug companies struggle to keep up with orders, or when they stop producing altogether because they're not seeing a profit, these pharmacies can access the raw drug ingredients and provide the medications for patients who are already in midtreatment.
