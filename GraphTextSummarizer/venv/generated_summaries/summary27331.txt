E Pluribus Unum: (EE PLUR-uh-buhs OOH-nuhm): "Out of many, one" Less unique than it sounds, America's original national motto, e pluribus unum, was plagiarized from an ancient recipe for salad dressing. But the term made its first appearance in Virgil's poem "Moretum" to describe salad dressing. Most recently, Arizona Senator John McCain co-opted the phrase to describe campaign finance and influence pedaling because he believes that one doesn't give major milk to a campaign without expecting major cheese in return. Now picture him at a debutante ball, and you'll start to get a sense of someone with persona non grata status.
