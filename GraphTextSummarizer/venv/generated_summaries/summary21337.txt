In a statement issued earlier, BART police said he was "yelling racial slurs and profanity at passengers and challenging customers to fight." He was being held in a jail outside Oakland on Monday evening. -- Police from California's Bay Area Rapid Transit system have begun questioning witnesses to a confrontation that led to a BART police officer shoving an unruly man into a glass window, a top official said Monday. The video showed Gibson being pulled off the train by an officer who put him in an arm grip and forcibly walked him toward the station wall, which is topped by large windows. "We will take our time and we will cover everything that needs to be covered," said Daniel Hartwig, the patrol commander for the BART police force.
