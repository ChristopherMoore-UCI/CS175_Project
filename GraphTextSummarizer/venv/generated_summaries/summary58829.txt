He sent out mailers to Republicans in the district with the message "conservative Republican Eric Cantor is stopping the Obama Reid plan to give illegal aliens amnesty." Dave Brat, an economics professor and former seminary student, pulled off the biggest political upset of the year by ousting the No. 2 House Republican Eric Cantor in a primary challenge on Tuesday night. He told CNN, "My beef with Cantor isn't not a right- or left wing thing." Citing his expertise on economics, Brat said the GOP leader and other top congressional Republicans in Washington had set aside their "free market principles" when they backed the bailout legislation that helped bolster Wall Street banks after the fiscal crisis in 2008. Cantor's team included some veteran Virginia political hands while some of Brat's top campaign staffers hadn't worked on a major campaign before. " Brat, who raised less than $300,000 to the House majority leader's campaign war chest of $5.4 million, said, "It's not about David Brat winning tonight, it's about returning the country to its principles."
