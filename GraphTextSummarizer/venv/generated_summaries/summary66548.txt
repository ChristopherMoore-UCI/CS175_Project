In the application Google states: "Computing centers are located on a ship or ships, anchored in a water body from which energy from natural motion of the water may be captured, and turned into electricity and/or pumping power for cooling pumps to carry heat away. According to a 2005 study by Stanford University consulting professor and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs staff scientist, Jonathan Koomey, the energy consumption of data centers doubled in the period from 2000 to 2005. "One of the reasons Google has data centers around the world is to enhance the user experiences near where many of their users are. Karp believes Google could also benefit from snaring a "green" image if it is able to harness wave motion to power the computers and their cooling systems, in addition to providing a quality service to users. Current data centers are defended by corporate-type security consisting of reception desks and electronically guarded entrances.
