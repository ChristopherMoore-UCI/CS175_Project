Red Cross and hospital workers run to the front of the hospital in Pangkalan Bun, not even certain how many victims are coming. Unfortunately, this little town in Indonesia's central Kalimantan Province has become the focal point for the recovery of bodies and debris from the airliner, which failed to complete its journey from Surabaya, the country's second-biggest city, to Singapore on Sunday. A further six bodies arrived at Sultan Imanuddin hospital throughout Friday. The search, to the south of Pangkalan Bun, is slow going, hampered by rough seas, which complicate the job done by divers. Hospital staff assess gender, height, identifying marks and any clothing.
