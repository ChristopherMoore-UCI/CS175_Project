It was a huge boost for Obama in 2008, but for past Iowa winners such as Mike Huckabee, Pat Buchanan and Paul Tsongas, it didn't lead to winning their respective party's presidential nomination. No GOP candidate should entertain the notion of dropping out of the race based on what happens in Iowa on Tuesday night. Iowa has it all under control, and what happens there, and in New Hampshire, will settle the race once and for all. And that's the No. 1 reason why Michigan, Florida, Nevada and South Carolina threatened or successfully moved their primaries and caucuses: They wanted to matter, and not just accept what Iowa and New Hampshire gave them. I bet former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty regrets dropping out after the Ames, Iowa, straw poll, which Rep. Michele Bachmann won.
