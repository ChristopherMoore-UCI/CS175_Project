Wilmore, meanwhile, will replace Colbert weeknights at 11:30 p.m. on Comedy Central, following "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" at 11 p.m. Wilmore called himself "beyond excited to have this chance to continue my relationships with Comedy Central and the brilliant Jon Stewart. "The series will feature a diverse panel of voices currently underrepresented in comedy and television," Comedy Central said. -- Comedy Central's successor to "The Colbert Report" will be "The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore."
