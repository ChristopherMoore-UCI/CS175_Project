Germany had threatened to block Turkish membership negotiations after more than three weeks of riots in Turkey during which riot police repeatedly attacked anti-government demonstrators with tear gas and pepper spray. The violence rapidly escalated and spread to other Turkish cities, as protesters began building barricades, hurling stones, and eventually throwing fireworks and gas bombs at police. Turkish police detained at least 20 people in Ankara on Tuesday. Earlier this month, the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing the Turkish government for "the disproportionate and excessive use of force by Turkish police to break up peaceful and legitimate protests." The unprecedented violence in Turkey began after riot police repeatedly attacked a group of demonstrators who were protesting against the demolition of a small park in Istanbul.
