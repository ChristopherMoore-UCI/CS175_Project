Dominican lawmaker Danilo Medina declared victory in the nation's presidential elections in a series of Twitter posts Monday, but his closest competitor has yet to concede. In an interview with CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Monday, Medina vowed to address drug trafficking, education and incomes in a country where more than one-third of the population lives in poverty. His closest competitor, former President Hipolito Mejia, had not conceded as of Monday night. Since the end of Mejia's term in 2004, the presidency has been held by Leonel Fernandez, of the centrist Dominican Liberation Party, the same party that Medina belongs to. "Today, thanks to the sovereign decision of the Dominican people, I am the president of all Dominicans," Medina wrote.
