"The proposed merger will result in online video content providers paying higher prices for access to Comcast customers or delivering poorer service to customers who depend on Comcast for broadband access," wrote Netflix Vice President Christopher Libertelli in a letter to Franken. In its second such complaint this week, Netflix told U.S. Sen. Al Franken that Comcast's takeover of Time Warner Cable would give the merged cable behemoth the leverage to extract higher fees from content providers, costs that would ultimately be passed on to consumers. The dispute comes as the Federal Communications Commission is proposing new rules that would allow Internet providers such as Comcast to create a "fast lane" for certain websites and services. That would bolster Comcast's current status as the nation's largest TV, Internet and home phone provider. The company pays Comcast for access to its vast network of U.S. cable subscribers and does not want to absorb any fee hikes imposed by a newly dominant Comcast-TWC.
