Hamas leader Ismail Haniya congratulated Egypt on the release of the soldiers, calling it a "major achievement by the Egyptian military and a reassurance of the Egyptian sovereignty in Sinai," Egy News reported. After the news, Egyptian authorities reopened the Rafah border crossing into Gaza in both directions, Egypt's state-run news agency Egy News reported. The Egyptian army sent dozens of armored vehicles and personnel carriers across the Suez Canal into North Sinai early Monday, the news agency said. The official Egypt State Information Service reported Tuesday that a military operation was planned to secure the soldiers' release but it cited presidential spokesman Omar Amer as saying only that all options were open. The crossing was closed for five days by Egyptian security forces to protest the kidnapping of their fellow soldiers, the official Jordanian news agency Petra said.
