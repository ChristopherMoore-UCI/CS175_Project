The Minnesota Daily editorial board asserts that "while no parent would honestly sell out their children, the U.S has done just that." Dale Brandy, writing in the American Thinker, defines Social Security in terms of a class struggle between the "young 'have-nots'...against the power, wealth, and influence of the older 'haves.' The way to curb Medicare, which after all is merely a big reimbursement machine, is to cut the costs of health care rather than leave old people to chose between medications and their meals. CNN Money: Senior victims lose average of $140,500 to financial abuse Utterly ignored in all these tirades against the old, is the notion that the elderly get much more than young is based merely on public budgets and pays no mind to what happens to the large mountains of private dough. The main losers of these cuts will be Americans older than 65 who collect Social Security and cash in Medicare checks. Taking from the old is justified on the grounds that they take more out of Social Security than they paid in, while the young, who pay for Social Security, will find that the program has gone belly-up by the time they retire.
