In Sunday's other match, Mainz secured a surprise 2-0 home defeat over Stuttgart thanks to goals from debutant strikers Sami Allagui and Morten Rasmussen. -- Germany captain Michael Ballack enjoyed a dream return to the Bundesliga as his Bayer Leverkusen side claimed an impressive 2-0 victory at Borussia Dortmund on Sunday. Ballack, who rejoined first club Leverkusen during the summer after four years at Chelsea, played his part in a superb team performance as Leverkusen showed they will be one of the teams to watch this season. With the first round of matches now complete, Hoffenheim lead the table courtesy of Saturday's stunning 4-1 win over Werder Bremen. Tunisian Allagui opened the scoring in the 26th-minute and Danish international Rasmussen -- who joined on loan from Celtic this week -- added the second two minutes after the interval.
