A high-energy chef and now a TV celebrity who presents "World Caf√© Asia" -- he won an Asian Television Award in 2007 -- Chinn is aware that being flavor of the month on TV is transitory. English boarding school taught him that food could be an awful experience; Wall Street taught him that creativity was more important than money and a stint as a stand-up comedian taught him that you can't always get it right. While finding out the hard way how funny, or not, he was, Chinn was working front-of-house in restaurants, nurturing his love of food. -- Celebrity chef Bobby Chinn has tried his hand at a number of things. Half Chinese, half Egyptian, Chinn's grandmothers were his first introduction to the variety and pleasure that food can bring.
