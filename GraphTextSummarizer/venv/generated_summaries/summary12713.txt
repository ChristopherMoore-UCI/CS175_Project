"21" has continued its amazing run a year after its initial release, selling 3.69 million copies through the sales week that ended July 1, the mid-year point for tracker Nielsen SoundScan. To cap it all off, Adele's 2008 record, "19," finds itself as the tenth-highest selling record so far this year with 539,000 sold, making her the first artist to have two albums in the top 10 since Justin Bieber scored a pair halfway through 2010 with "My World 2.0" at No. 2 and "My World" at No. 9. Whitney Houston's Whitney: The Greatest Hits sold 818,000 to place it at No. 4, while the compilation Now 41 takes the fifth spot with 714,000. If "21" continues to fly off the shelves at this rate, it could be the first record in the SoundScan era to top the year-end charts twice. At the Number 4 spot is Kelly Clarkson's "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" with 3,324,000 sold, while Nicki Minaj's "Starships" comes in at No. 5 with 3,158,000.
