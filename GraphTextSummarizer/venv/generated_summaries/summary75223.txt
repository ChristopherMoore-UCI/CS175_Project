Watch a walk through Amman for everday Jordanians' reactions to the visit Â» Among other things, Benedict hopes Christians and Muslims will join forces in defense of shared values such as the sanctity of human life and the family, which can translate into political efforts in opposition to abortion and homosexuality. Yet the price of admission to that partnership, Benedict XVI believes, is a reform within Islam that would move it in the direction of a greater capacity for pluralism, including the rights of religious minorities, especially Christians, within Islamic societies. " Benedict also argued that much tension between Christians and Muslims is the result of "ideological manipulation of religion, sometimes for political ends," and pointed to what he called "the fundamental contradiction of resorting to violence or exclusion in the name of God. " To date, Benedict XVI's efforts to convince Muslims that he's advancing these arguments as a friend, from a shared space of common religious concern, have brought mixed results. While John Paul II was a bridge-builder, Benedict is determined to walk across those bridges, pushing Islam toward a rejection of extremism and an acceptance of religious freedom -- toward an integration of reason and faith.
