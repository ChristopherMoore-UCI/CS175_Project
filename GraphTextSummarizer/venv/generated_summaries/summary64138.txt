" Crowder speaks to the survivors -- Stewart, Jody Scheckter, Emerson Fittipaldi and others -- who share stories of camaraderie and their battles with the sport's governing body, the FIA, to take safety more seriously. " Improvements eventually came, but it wasn't until the death of Ayrton Senna at Imola in 1994 that safety regulations started to be transformed, says Crowder. Beautifully directed by John Frankenheimer, "Grand Prix" includes some memorable racing scenes from Monaco, Brand's Hatch, Spa-Francorchamps and some terrifying footage around the high-speed oval at Monza. American actor James Garner heads an international cast which includes British world champion Graham Hill and cameos by many of his famous racing contemporaries. Drivers were routinely maimed or killed as safety took a back seat.
