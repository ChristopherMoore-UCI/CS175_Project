At least 30 people were injured, but the Ukraine government has assured UEFA it was taking "all necessary steps" to ensure the safety of around 1.3 million fans expected to watch 16 national teams go head-to-head. She confirmed this was due to concerns over the treatment of former prime minister Tymoshenko, and added: "The EU and president Barroso have sent strong signals of their serious concerns over what is happening in Ukraine." Just weeks before the tournament kicks off, president Jose Manuel Barroso has rejected an invitation to attend the final in Kiev -- citing concerns over the treatment of imprisoned opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko. The attacks cast further doubt over Ukraine's's ability to stage such an event, and UEFA has taken the unprecedented step of raising political concerns with the East European nation. Tymoshenko, a fierce rival of president Victor Yanukovych, is serving a seven-year jail sentence for abuse of office and faces another trial on tax evasion charges.
