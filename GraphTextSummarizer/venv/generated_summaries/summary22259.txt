Japan has long claimed the islets in the sea east of Korea as its territory, but Seoul insists all Korean territory was returned after  independence in 1945. As of 2011, Japan and South Korea were each others' third largest trading partners, according to Korea International Trade Association. "I am especially not happy at the fact that the signing will take place in Japan." Tokyo and Seoul have also been arguing about who has sovereignty over a group of small islands, known as Dokdo in Korea and Takeshima in Japan. Japan occupied Korea for 35 years during the first half of the 20th century, and anti-Japanese sentiment still lingers. "The treaty was inevitable given the current trend in northeast Asia including that of China's growing influence and its ties with North Korea," said Kim Tae-woo, the head of Korean Institute for National Unification.
