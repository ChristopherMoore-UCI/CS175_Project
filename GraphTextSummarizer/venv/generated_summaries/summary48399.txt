The statement came after Bush's son and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told a crowd in Vero Beach on Saturday that his father was expected to be released Monday, according to TCPalm.com. "We are hopeful that he can be discharged this coming week, but we're still taking everything one day at a time," spokesman Jim McGrath said Saturday night. He has also suffered from "a stubborn fever," McGrath said last week. -- After spending more than a month in a Houston hospital, former President George H.W. Bush might get to leave this week. While in the hospital, Bush, 88, has cheered on the Texas A&M and the Houston Texans football teams to victories and enjoyed a special performance by the Oak Ridge Boys via telephone.
