Over the subsequent months, Josh and Sharyn Hakken "did not participate in the system," Hillsborough County, Florida, Sheriff David Gee said late Tuesday, without offering much detail. U.S. diplomatic officials waited with the family at Havana's airport until a plane carrying American law enforcement officials arrived to bring them all back to Florida. The next day, at 6:30 a.m., Patricia Hauser told police that Josh Hakken saw his boys once again -- when he entered her Florida home, tied her up, then sped away with Chase, Cole and the family dog in a silver 2009 Toyota Camry. That's the boat they took south -- leaving their Florida port just ahead of a storm that challenged authorities looking for them. Josh Hakken had purchased that boat from a person, who later tipped off authorities after word got out about the brothers' abduction.
