"In some ironic way, it (his death) got a little bit more attention for the book in the UK," says Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Sussman's U.S. publisher, "as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book." Taylor remembers Sussman riding around London on his motor scooter, with a publicist in tow, on his way to interviews to support his books. (Sussman and I crossed paths briefly at CNN in London, where he worked about 10 years ago.) But Sussman set himself apart by making time for all of the interview requests that came his way, no matter how small the publication. The idea that "The Labyrinth of Osiris" could be his last book is all the more poignant, because reviewers and editors alike say it's his best -- even Sussman agreed.
