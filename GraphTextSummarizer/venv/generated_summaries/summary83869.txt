David Kiely, who works for Sydney-based Macquarie Private Wealth, has become a Web sensation after he was filmed on Australian television admiring pictures on his computer screen of scantily-clad Miranda Kerr. Kiely was opening e-mailed pictures of Kerr while one of his colleagues, Martin Lakos, was being interviewed on Channel 7 news behind him on Tuesday. His employer has said it is investigating the actions of the client investment manager who, according to Australian media reports, is said to be on gardening leave. " A posting of the clip on YouTube had attracted more than 1.3 million hits by Thursday, along with thousands of comments, with many viewers arguing Kiely was unlucky to be caught on TV. -- Supporters of a banker caught looking at photos of a semi-nude model on live TV have launched a Web site in a bid to save his job.
