In the capital, the canals were not overflowing, said American Red Cross spokeswoman Andrea Koppel. -- Health and hospital officials in Haiti braced for the worse Monday, fearing the hurricane that battered the Caribbean nation over the weekend could worsen the cholera outbreak that has killed hundreds of people and hospitalized thousands since it began last month. On Monday, Dr. Toni Eyssallenne of Hospital Bernard Mevs confirmed the first case of cholera -- in a 3-year-old boy -- to originate and manifest entirely in Port-au-Prince. Until now, health officials said that those being treated for cholera in Port-au-Prince all contracted the disease elsewhere. "The quick solution is management," said Environment Minister Jean Marie Claude Germain.
