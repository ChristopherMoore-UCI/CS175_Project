In the southern Abyan province, government forces are gaining ground in the fight against suspected al Qaeda militants. Opposition parties insist they will not be involved in any dialogue with the Saleh regime. Fuad Himyari, the head of prayers in Sanaa's Change Square, called on youth protesters to stand firm, saying the battle against the oppressive regime is coming to an end. "The Gulf power transfer proposal was on the table for months and Saleh refused to sign it," said Ahmed Bahri, head of the political circle for the opposition Haq party. The ruling General People's Congress has been continuously urging dialogue.
