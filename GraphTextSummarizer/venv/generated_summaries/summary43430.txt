"This investigation has identified some extremely dangerous child sexual offenders who believed paying for children to be abused to order was something they could get away with," said Andy Baker, deputy director of the NCA's Child Exploitation and Online Protection command. "A vast and comparatively wealthy overseas customer base has led to organized crime groups exploiting children for financial gain," the NCA said. The British agency cited online conversations in which two of the men convicted under the investigation, Timothy Ford and Thomas Owen, discussed ways to travel to the Philippines to engage in direct abuse of children. The NCA said more than 37,500 pounds ($61,000) had been paid through the crime network in exchange for viewing the abuse of children. Conditions in the Philippines -- such as widespread poverty, an established sex trade, a predominantly English-speaking, technologically-literate population and widespread Internet access -- have made the country vulnerable to such abuse.
