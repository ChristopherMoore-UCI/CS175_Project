With the proliferation of religious freedom state laws, nondiscrimination laws become even more important. "In our expert opinion, the clear evidence ... unmistakably demonstrates that the broad language of the proposed state RFRA will more likely create confusion, conflict, and a wave of litigation that will threaten the clarity of religious liberty rights in Indiana while undermining the state's ability to enforce other compelling interests," the letter, whose signatories included many Indiana law professors, stated. But other state laws mirror the federal law much more closely than the Indiana law does. The Indiana law justifies discrimination in the name of religious freedom, he contends. The key difference in the Indiana law is that it expands the instances where someone can use religious freedom as a defense.
