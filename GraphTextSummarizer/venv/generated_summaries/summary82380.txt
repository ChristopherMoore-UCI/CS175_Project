When I suggested there was plenty of time in the future to uphold grooming and dress, and that surely student years were designed for rebellion, my host gave a "we know what's coming next" tolerant look and, ever so politely, explained there were plenty of other schools for that, and this was a Mormon school for those who wanted to live the Mormon way of life. The student who handed me Mormon literature smiled. I know that Mormon beliefs forbid pre-marital sex, but somehow I imagined that meant no relationships, and by extension, no physical contact. At BYU there is a lot of hand holding (between men and women only), with chaste kisses and long looks. Having probably spent their youth in the minority -- depending on where they grew up -- for many BYU students this was the first time they were in the majority, the norm!
