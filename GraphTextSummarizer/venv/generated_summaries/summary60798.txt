Watch photographer, writer recall RFK's last days Â» Clarke's book is illuminated by his interviews with Kennedy beat writers and audience members, which give his retracing of the campaign's exhaustive travels a striking immediacy. Robert Kennedy's campaign for president lasted 82 days before he died on June 6, 1968. And with Robert Kennedy, questions are all that's left. Given that there's no shortage of material on the man himself -- Arthur Schlesinger's mammoth 1978 "Robert Kennedy and His Times" and Evan Thomas' 2000 biography "Robert Kennedy: His Life" come to mind -- that's a worthy achievement. While Hubert Humphrey preached the "Politics of Joy" in that brutal year -- and Eugene McCarthy simply lectured -- Kennedy answered questions with questions, at his best when he asked as much from his audience as he did from himself.
