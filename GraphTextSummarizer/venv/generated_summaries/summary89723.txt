Another classmate, Steven Cates, told CNN that Loughner "didn't interact socially like other people. Postings attributed to Loughner on websites including MySpace and YouTube show "classic signs of psychosis," one expert told CNN. But by Saturday afternoon, he and his wife returned home to find police waiting for them, neighbor Stephen Woods said. The morning of the shooting, he had argued with his father, Randy Loughner, in the front yard of their Tucson home, Richard Kastigar, the head of the Pima County Sheriff's Department's investigations bureau, told CNN's "John King USA." But an administration official told CNN on Sunday that Loughner had failed a drug test.
