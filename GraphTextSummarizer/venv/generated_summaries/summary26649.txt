Ayyam Gallery has been running Young Collectors Auctions since 2008, aimed at supporting emerging artists and opening the art market to new collectors. As well as taking part in numerous photography exhibitions, Gargash has won awards for her film-making. "We wanted to start something with a relaxed atmosphere, lower estimates and young emerging artists." The auction, held on Tuesday (May 15), featured 75 lots from 63 emerging and established Middle Eastern artists, 10 of them aged 30 or under. They are both among the latest emerging artists to be featured in the Young Collectors Auction run by Ayyam Gallery in Dubai.
