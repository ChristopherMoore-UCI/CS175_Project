-- It is a problem of massive plastic proportions -- a giant floating debris field, composed mostly of bits and pieces of plastic, in the northwest Pacific Ocean, about a thousand miles off the coast of California. They know there are other debris fields in other oceans of the world, but this one is the biggest. "There may be a misapprehension ... that if you got out there and stood on the middle of a deck you'd see nothing but plastic litter from horizon to horizon," said Robert Knox, deputy director for research at the Scripps Institution. What does it do to the food chain, especially the small particles of plastic that may be ingested by smaller organisms at the bottom of the food chain? It's called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and it covers a vast area of hundreds, maybe even thousands, of miles of open ocean.
