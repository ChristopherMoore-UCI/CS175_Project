The flow of aid has hardly kept up with the pace of violence in Syria, with scores or hundreds of people reportedly killed each day. But Tuesday, state-run news agency SANA reported that al-Assad "said Syria welcomes humanitarian operations carried out by the International Committee of the Red Cross on the Syrian ground as long as it works independently and neutrally."

We must ensure that anyone, on any side, who violates international humanitarian law or human rights law is held to account," Ban said. "The humanitarian situation is deteriorating fast."
