If "Je suis Charlie," a slogan adopted in solidarity with the magazine Charlie Hebdo that was attacked in France, is to mean anything, it should be about the choice to stand up in defense of those who believe in a free press, safe schools for boys and girls, and theaters free from suicide attack. A Taliban spokesman claimed the group was responsible for the attack, and said the play was targeted because it was being performed "to insult Islamic values and spread propaganda about our jihad operations, especially on suicide attacks." Indeed, for the past several years -- at least since attacks on Madrid and London -- Westerners have been able to go about their day-to-day business, with little thought to what was taking place thousands of miles away, for this was someone else's horror. They generally occurred in far-flung places and were committed against faraway people: schoolgoers in Peshawar and theatergoers in Kabul. This has been despite the alarming rate at which the death toll has been growing, with Afghans being forced to get accustomed to having their lives punctured by senseless attacks, including the heartbreaking slayings of an Afghan journalist, his wife and two daughters gathered around a dinner table for a holiday celebration as a family.
