The struggles in Europe have been exacerbated by continued gloomy news out of the U.S. Al Goodman reported from Madrid, Irene Chapple from London and Catherine Tymkiw from New York. Clashes between police and demonstrators in central Madrid's Neptuno Square resulted in 28 people being hurt Tuesday, two of them police officers, a police spokesman said. Spain, which has one of the largest economies in Europe, is fighting to bring down its huge deficit, which threatens the stability of the euro, the currency used by hundreds of millions of people across Europe. The package includes a "road map" of 43 proposed laws that will regulate and tweak various sectors of the economy to spur growth in weak areas and to maintain growth in stronger sectors. But Spaniards have taken to the streets to demonstrate against austerity measures, and are expected to do so again after expected new cuts are unveiled.
