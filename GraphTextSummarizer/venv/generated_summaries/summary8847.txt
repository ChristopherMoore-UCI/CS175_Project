The treaty has exposed deep divisions between European Union members -- chiefly Britain and the rest of the bloc. Some European Union nations have balked at ceding further powers to EU authorities and have threatened to walk away. Talks have been fraught and the resulting deal threatens to become one of the most divisive issues the 27-nation European Union has ever faced. Some say this will result in a two-tier European Union. This leaves Britain, under Prime Minister David Cameron, alone among the 27 European Union nations to point-blank refuse to sign.
