"Republicans this time have managed to neutralize their deficiencies in this area so the war on women rhetoric does not resonate so much." Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said Republicans are riding a "perfect storm" in Senate races in red states as they enjoy the knock-on effect of national factors like Ebola and ISIS, which have overshadowed social issues. The attack line -- aimed at painting Republicans as out of sync with women on contraception, abortion and other issues -- isn't resonating like in 2012, when Democrats hurled it at the GOP with a devastating effect. In each of these races, the rhetoric aimed at women is often more focused on pocketbook issues as opposed to the more hot-button subjects of abortion and contraception. Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said women voters may simply not be seeing enough from Democrats to get them out to vote. The so-called war on women that Democrats love to talk about on the campaign trail may be losing some of its luster.
