Attorneys for Knox and Sollecito have in recent weeks sought to undermine their convictions by scrutinizing DNA evidence found on the knife used to kill Kercher and on her bra clasp. Knox and Sollecito were found guilty in 2009 of killing Kercher, Knox's British housemate, two years earlier. Costagliola also sought to pick holes in the testimony of two defense witnesses, convicted child killer Mario Alessi and jailed mafia member Luciano Aviello, who had each given conflicting accounts of who killed Kercher. Addressing the jurors, appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola said: "I hope when you make your decision, you feel a little bit like the parents of Meredith Kercher, a serious, studious girl whose life was taken away by these two kids from good families. Knox's father, Curt, told CNN earlier this month that prosecutors have "no case left," after a review of evidence, and that he hoped to be able to take his daughter home within weeks.
