While Kal Penn joined the real White House, Rob Lowe left the fictional one on "The West Wing" because he didn't think there was a place for his character, Democrat Sam Seaborn, anymore. That's why she's leaving the show -- to move back to New York City, pursue her film career, and live life to the fullest by eating spinach and seeds and popping pills. She's never confirmed it, but when "The O.C." killed off Marissa Cooper in the season finale of season three, most people assumed it was because Mischa Barton wanted to move on. Her publicist claims she's out of there because she wants to spend more time with her newly adopted daughter, and that becoming a mother has "changed [her] desire to work full-time." Amanda Seyfried thinks she's too big for the filming schedule of "Big Love."
