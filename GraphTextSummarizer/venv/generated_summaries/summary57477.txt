That is, until hundreds of photos and some videos were made available to the public that showed exactly what former Abu Ghraib prisoners had described on Arab media, and even worse. -- There is hardly anything in U.S.-Arab relations that screams scandal louder than the torture pictures of Abu Ghraib: The abuse that went on behind these gates hardened Arab opinion against the United States. Before the pictures and videos became public in 2004, horror stories of what was going on inside the notorious Abu Ghraib prison were reported on Arab media in bits and pieces. Arab commentators described the photos as "shameful," the act of U.S. soldiers "barbaric." Those responsible were punished." As soon as the news broke that more torture pictures could be released this year, Arab media rolled the old photos of humiliated Iraqi prisoners.
