Barry Ardolf, 46, repeatedly hacked into his next-door neighbors' Wi-Fi network in 2009, and used it to try and frame them for child pornography, sexual harassment, various kinds of professional misconduct and to send threatening e-mail to politicians, including Vice President Joe Biden. A father of two, Ardolf had turned down a 2-year plea agreement last year to charges related to the Biden e-mail. Then, in May 2009, the Secret Service showed up at Kostolnik's office to ask about several threatening e-mails sent from his Yahoo account, and traced to his IP address, that were addressed to Biden and other politicians. He then e-mailed the same child porn to one of the husband's co-workers, and sent flirtatious e-mail to women in Mr. Kostolnik's office. They also found handwritten notes laying out Ardolf's revenge plans, and a cache of postal mail that Ardolf had apparently stolen from the Kostolniks' mailbox and stashed under his bed.
