But there are youth-serving organizations that can and do play a key role in effecting positive change -- places such as Boys & Girls Clubs, with a long track record of helping young people turn things around, get an education, lead healthy lives and become effective leaders. This powerful call to action reminds us that we can all play a role in helping youth realize their dreams. Urging children and the adults in their lives to "Be Great," these clubs communicate the idea that there is potential for greatness in every child. Ask them to make children a top priority and tell them that you hold them accountable. In partnership with government, schools, community leaders and parents, we can create a network and culture in which everyone embraces the importance of a positive future for our youth.
