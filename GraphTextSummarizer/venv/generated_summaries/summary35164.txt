Between now and Saturday night, we can expect to see continued fighting in eastern Ukraine between the Ukrainian military and separatist forces. It's not clear what will happen in the strategically important town of Debaltseve, where rebel fighters currently have Ukrainian forces almost surrounded after days of fierce fighting. Despite the hopes, some European leaders have voiced skepticism -- after all, a previous peace plan agreed to in September disintegrated amid continued fighting. The Ukrainian forces must pull back their artillery of 100 millimeters or greater caliber by 25 kilometers (15Â½ miles) from the current front line, while the separatists must withdraw their artillery the same distance behind the front line as of September 19. The leaders of Ukraine, Russia, France and Germany have signed up to a peace plan after lengthy talks, raising hopes that the brutal conflict in eastern Ukraine could be brought to a close.
