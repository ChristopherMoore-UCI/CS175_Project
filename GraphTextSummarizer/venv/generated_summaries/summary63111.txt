Along with Lovell, 58, the victims included Donna L. Smith, 54, of Newburgh; James M. Ferrari, 59, of Montrose; and So Kisook Ahn, 35, of Queens. " On NBC's Today show, host Matt Lauer said Lovell was "part of just about every big concert we ever had on our plaza. " "Jim Lovell was so much more than just a victim," Finn Lovell said. Instead, he was one of four New York state residents killed when the train derailed at high speed in a curve in the Bronx. Montgomery told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 that when Lovell didn't respond to two text messages she sent after hearing of the crash, "I knew that he was one of the victims." "I didn't want to believe it," she said.
