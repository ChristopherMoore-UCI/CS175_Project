Maryland authorities said Wednesday that a former state correctional officer has been arrested in connection with a recent spate of shootings, including one on the Intercounty Connector in Maryland and one at Fort Meade, where the National Security Agency office is located. Young is in the hospital and under police guard, though when reporters asked why he was being treated, officials would only say he was arrested without incident. Young worked as a correctional officer at a Jessup facility from 2012 until his resignation in 2014, Maryland Secretary of Public Safety Stephen Moyer said. Surveillance footage captured a Lincoln Town Car at about the same time shots were fired, police said. Officers stopped Hong Young, 35, of Beltsville, Maryland, at around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday.
