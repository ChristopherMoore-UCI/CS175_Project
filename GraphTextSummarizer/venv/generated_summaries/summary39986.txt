It's my experience that negativity only breeds more negativity, and that's where comparison leads. I never really thought much about it until taking on CNN's Fit Nation challenge. If I were to compare myself to my Fit Nation teammates, I would believe I'm falling short. -- In my life, I've often heard that "comparison is the thief of joy." I admit that I have broken down a couple times recently and had a piece of cake or an order of French fries.
