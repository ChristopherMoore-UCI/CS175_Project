-- Six members of Pakistan's paramilitary forces accused of killing an unarmed teenager last week have been turned over to police and will be tried under the country's terrorism act, a police official said Monday. The accused -- members of the Sindh Rangers -- can be seen opening fire on 17-year-old Sarfraz Shah in a chilling video captured by a local television cameraman and broadcast across Pakistan's networks last week. Karachi police official Rafiq Gulsaid Shah pointed a pistol and wanted to steal cash and cell phones. Shah tried to rob people at a park named in honor of slain former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Shah apparently tried to snatch the Rangers' guns, Gul said.
