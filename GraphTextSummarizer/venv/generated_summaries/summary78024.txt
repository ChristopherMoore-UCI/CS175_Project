Rutledge was being booked on probation violation and other felony charges when Foulks had the episode, South Florida's Sun-Sentinel reported, citing detective DeAnna Greenlaw. Officers have seen a lot of the teen since, Greenlaw said, having arrested him "multiple times." But officers have taken a shine to Jamal Rutledge since they arrested him in September in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The juvenile defendant yelled for help, Fort Lauderdale Police Department said in a statement Tuesday. Officer Franklin Foulks was filling out Rutledge's paperwork, as they sat alone in a holding area, where a surveillance camera recorded them.
