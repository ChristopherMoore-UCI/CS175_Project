-- Harvard Business School associate professor Ben Edelman was in the running this week for "Most Disliked Guy on the Internet" -- and all because of $4. Celebrated bartender Ran Duan, who manages the bar inside his parents' Sichuan Garden location, was the one to respond to Edelman's complaint. On Twitter, Edelman had been raked over the coals, with some accusing him of living up to the worst stereotypes about lawyers and Harvard minds. There's now a fundraising campaign to give to those in need with the hope that it'll help counteract the "negative stereotypes of Harvard and HBS (that) were reinforced" with Edelman's dispute. According to Boston.com, the saga began last week when Edelman placed an order at a family-operated Boston-area Chinese restaurant named Sichuan Garden.
