"With Piquet, Prost and Senna, as well as myself and many other drivers, it was very difficult in the late 1980s/early 1990s to win," Mansell said. After Senna unleashed a ruthless surge of speed to burn past future championship winner Niki Lauda and move into second place, the 24-year-old had McLaren's race leader Alain Prost in his sights. " Two weeks after Senna's passing at Imola, Ferrari's Michael Schumacher assumed the mantel of Monte Carlo maestro by claiming the first of his five victories on the Mediterranean coast. Arguably his toughest -- and most fortuitous -- win came in 1992, when the Williams of Mansell had claimed maximum points in the year's first five races and was blazing a trail towards world championship glory. "As a competitor, from the point of view of all or nothing, he ranks up there at the top," fellow world champion and former on-track rival Nigel Mansell told CNN.
