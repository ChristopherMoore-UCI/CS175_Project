The attack on the Bison Express was the second one Friday on commercial shipping vessels in the Gulf of Aden, the Navy said. -- U.S. naval forces hunting pirates off Somalia detained six people this week who appeared to be pursuing a commercial shipping vessel, but soon released them because of a lack of evidence. A Yemeni Coast Guard boat patrols the Gulf of Aden for pirates  who threaten shipping. The Navy said it arrested the six on Friday after responding to a distress call from the Philippines-flagged MV Bison Express in the Gulf of Aden, between Yemen and Somalia. The Navy said on Saturday the six matched the description of suspected pirates aboard a skiff in the area.
