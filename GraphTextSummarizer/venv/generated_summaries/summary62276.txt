As a former ballerina, classically trained at the School of the Boston Ballet, I can assure you that Left Shark -- if he is the student of dance I suspect him to be -- trained for months to get inside the head of his character. But neither the general public nor the media seem to appreciate just how much work goes into an interpretive, character-based dance such as the one Left Shark performed last night, and how easy it is, if you are committed to your craft, to lose yourself in the moment. At 12 I played a mouse in "The Nutcracker" and for months I studied the abrupt movements, barely discernible to the human eye, of other house mice. Who is Left Shark? And this likely explains why, to the untrained eye, it seems like Left Shark was off his mark or forgot the choreography.
