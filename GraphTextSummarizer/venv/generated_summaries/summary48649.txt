Li's brother-in-law Zhao Baozhu told HRIC that hospital staff phoned him and his wife, Li's sister Li Wangling, just after 6 a.m. on June 6 to tell them that Li had committed suicide. He urged other officials to convey the feelings of Hong Kong citizens about Li's death to the Chinese government in Beijing. A memorial service for Li will be held Wednesday evening in central Hong Kong to mark the seventh day after his death. It was started by Hong Kong-based journalist Bei Feng, Chinese economist Xia Yeliang and literary scholar Wu Renhua. In the hours after Li's death, a petition appeared online urging his "suicide" to be investigated by authorities outside Shaoyang province and for the findings to be made public.
