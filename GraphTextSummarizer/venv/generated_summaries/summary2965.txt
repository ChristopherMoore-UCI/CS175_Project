House Republicans finally wised up and recently offered a female agenda of their own right before the August break that would increase job training, incentivize flexible work schedules, provide tax breaks for children and families, and strengthens charter schools. How do our elected officials plan to help create the conditions for more jobs, more money in their wallets and more food on the table? The battle over the female voter will continue through August, with Democrats pointing to the Supreme Court Hobby Lobby decision on female contraception coverage as a threat to women's rights. The Democrats have also tried to push through votes appealing to the middle class on the minimum wage and the gender gap in pay. Voters are unhappy with everyone, which includes President Barack Obama, Democrats and Republicans.
