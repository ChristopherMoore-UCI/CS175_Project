Drive out east -- past the women in burqas who sit on road bumps, holding their children, hoping drivers will slow enough to throw them change -- and you see roads lined with the detritus of America's war here. Outside one mosque -- mixing with other men desperate for a day's worth of casual manual labor -- are five men who months ago had one valuable skill NATO depended upon: they speak English. They are now empty, the sound of their heavy metal doors echoing across deserted tables. At times it seemed there was little America wouldn't do, or try, to meets its often fluid goals in the country. NATO's efforts to keep them on are reported to have involved diesel power stations that cost billions but were barely switched on.
