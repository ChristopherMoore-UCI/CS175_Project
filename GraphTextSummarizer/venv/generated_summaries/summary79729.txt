-- Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, the Republican lawmaker convicted on felony corruption charges in October, officially conceded the Senate race to Democrat Mark Begich on Wednesday. "Given the number of ballots that remain to be counted, it is apparent the election has been decided and Mayor Begich has been elected," Stevens said in a news  release. Stevens, who turned 85 on Tuesday, was convicted in October of filing false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms. I wish Mayor Begich and his family well. " With 100 percent of Alaska's precincts reporting, Begich, the mayor of Anchorage, had roughly 48 percent of the vote, compared with about 47 percent for Stevens, according to CNN's latest tally.
