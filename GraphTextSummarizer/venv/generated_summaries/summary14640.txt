Monet, Renoir, Gaugin, Pissarro, Sisley and many others stood in the freezing cold to capture landscapes of snow and ice. At the same time as that disaster in the West, some of Europe's greatest impressionist painters were enthralled with winter scenes. Core samples of ice from the poles tell us volumes about climate change, natural history and perhaps even the origins of the Earth itself. Although the whites, blues and grays of the winter scenes are often overlooked even by art enthusiasts, who tend to favor the bold colors of spring and summer, the artists themselves were fascinated by the delicate interplay of light on the luminous, frozen surfaces. Maybe the rest of America is tired of this winter's punishing snows, but Fuchs and his colleagues are thrilled.
