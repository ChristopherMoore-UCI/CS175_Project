The PPP, however, is hoping to gain a second term led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the son of assassinated former Prime Minister, and party leader, Benazir Bhutto. Secular and liberal parties such as the Awami National Party (ANP) and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), meanwhile, have borne the brunt of Pakistan Taliban attacks in the run-up to the elections. Many urban voters and parties regard resurgent fundamentalism as one of the biggest threats to Pakistan. Viewed as a religious conservative, his party, Pakistan's second largest, believes it would have won elections in 2008 had the assassination of Bhutto not given a massive boost to the ruling PPP. As a measure of the danger of Pakistani politics, Bhutto Zardari will not be present for the May 11 poll due to security threats, according to Pakistan's Dawn newspaper.
