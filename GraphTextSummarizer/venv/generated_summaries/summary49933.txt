Since he took office, the United States has ramped up the use of pilotless drones to strike at al Qaeda targets in Pakistan, including at least seven strikes since the December 30 attack at FOB Chapman, and approximately 51 others previously in 2009. The official says the attack not only sheds light on the dangerous work CIA officials and contractors do in Afghanistan, but how their footprint is growing. Several CIA officers and contractors were standing on the driver's side of the car, opposite al-Balawi, and others were standing as far as 50 feet away, a U.S. intelligence official said. The suicide bomber who killed seven CIA officers and contractors and a Jordanian intelligence official in Afghanistan was within seconds of being searched by two security contractors when he detonated his explosives, a former intelligence official with knowledge of the incident told CNN on Tuesday. The sedan was waved through the normal security checkpoints to get onto the base, and pulled up just outside a one-story building -- a temporary space that was being used to interrogate people brought onto base.
