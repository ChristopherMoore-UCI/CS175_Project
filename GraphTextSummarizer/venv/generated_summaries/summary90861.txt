Increasing violence against black jockeys forced many to abandon racing and move to northern urban areas, says Drape. For Parker, jockeys like Murphy and Winkfield didn't just change the face of racing -- they paved the way for generations of black American sports stars. When horse racing became an organized sport in the early 19th-Century, black jockeys were already leaders in the saddle. "They were the premier horsemen in the world," says Joe Drape, author of "Black Maestro," which tells the story of champion jockey Jimmy Winkfield. Much like the NBA today, black athletes dominated horse racing for the next three decades, winning 15 of the first 28 Derbies.
