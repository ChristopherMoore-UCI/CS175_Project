Motivate others is exactly what Justine Laymond hopes her story will do: "I have learned that life is too short -- so if you have a dream you just have to go out there and do it. The aim of the competition is to give everyone, regardless of sailing experience, the opportunity to experience the exhilaration of ocean racing. Because I had been in a coma I had to learn how to walk again and when I finally got out of hospital I decided to set myself daily challenges -- to do something different and to push my boundaries and defy the odds," said Laymond, who confessed that to date none of her challenges have been as difficult, or is ever likely to be as challenging as the Clipper race. Indeed, it was far from plain sailing for Laymond's crew on board the "Edinburgh Inspiring Capital" yacht, whose Atlantic Ocean crossing was a grueling affair plagued by tropical storms and rough seas. Laymond decided to get involved in the competition when she heard that the crew representing Edinburgh would have a relay team of transplant patients, surgeons and specialist nurses on its boat to raise awareness for organ transplantation -- something that saved her life six years ago.
