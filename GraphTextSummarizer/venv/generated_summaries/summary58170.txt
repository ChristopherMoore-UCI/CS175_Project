But his 700-page FBI file and informant card show otherwise -- that Bulger provided information on murders, drug deals, armed robberies and criminal fugitives, leading to several arrests. He was on the lam for 16 years after allegedly being tipped off to a 1995 indictment by his rogue handler, former FBI agent John Connolly, who is now behind bars. According to entries in his informant file, Bulger knew he could get away with it and even told his FBI handler he was more likely to be killed by "gangland warfare" than because he was informant since "no one would believe it." Trial opens window on mob world of cold violence, fierce loyalty Documents also expose that Bulger met with more than one FBI agent, including now-disgraced former FBI supervisor John Morris. Bulger ratted on La Cosa Nostra, rival gangs and seemingly anyone -- except those in his small, immediate circle known as the Winter Hill gang.
