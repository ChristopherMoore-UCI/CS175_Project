At this point last year, the violence-plagued city, across the border from El Paso, Texas, had tallied 596 killings, El Universal newspaper said Tuesday, citing figures from the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. When that failed, drug gangs attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities. Authorities also said they are searching for Saul Solis Solis, alias "El Lince," who lost his bid for a congressional seat this month. Reprisals from drug cartels after major arrests have been reported before, but the intensity of the attacks in Michoacan are unprecedented. This week's violence solidifies the cartel as a major and violent player in Mexico's drug wars, said Bruce Bagley, a professor at the University of Miami and an expert on drug trafficking.
