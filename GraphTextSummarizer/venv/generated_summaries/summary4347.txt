The House bill mandates insurance coverage for illegal immigrants and allows illegal immigrants to enroll in the public option and to buy private coverage in the national insurance exchange, but prohibits government subsidies for such private coverage. The Senate plan allows states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in health plans offered in the insurance exchanges. The public option would be a part of an insurance exchange available to people without coverage or unable to afford private coverage. The president says he wants to reform health care in order to slow the growth of costs for families, businesses and the government. It also requires parents to provide health coverage for children up to age 18.
