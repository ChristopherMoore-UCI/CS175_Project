The Iraqi Embassy in Washington did not respond to suggestions that Iraqi officials may have stolen some of the money, but a high-ranking Iraqi official said the inspector general's report has shown that "the United States failed to put in place accountable and transparent financial controls to safeguard Iraqi funds. A Pentagon spokesman contacted by CNN said the investigation found that "all of these funds remained under the control of the government of Iraq at all times." The money came from the sale of Iraqi oil, and was diverted by international sanctions and stored at a Federal Reserve facility in the United States before being shipped to Iraq. "It has not been properly accounted for," said Stuart Bowen, special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction. " Bowen said he did not want to speculate on who the potential criminals might be, then added, "But this money was delivered to Iraqi control, and we have in the past had a number of cases reported to us about interim ministers who did steal." Iraqi officials have told Bowen they may sue to reclaim the lost money, and they may have a case, said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California, the former chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
