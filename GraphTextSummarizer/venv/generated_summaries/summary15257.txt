It also makes sense: Mad Catz has long had the license to release Rock Band peripherals, and large bundles suffer from thin margins and can be expensive to stock. Mad Catz will be offering many different bundles with different combinations of instruments available, and there will be bundles that are exclusive to certain retailers. Giving control of the hardware to a company who knows how to release and ship peripherals makes sense for everyone, and more bundles give retailers a new layer of granularity to stock items based on their needs. Mad Catz is bringing the instruments Mad Catz will be creating all the "Rock Band 3" instruments and bundles; EA will only be distributing the software. We were surprised that new instruments were being released at all, since Activision had noted that they were focusing on software and not hardware in order to cut costs.
