With reality competition shows, you can read the newspaper or leave the room for a minute, come back and still be able to follow along, he added, joking that, during the "Lost" finale, "I had to sit there with a piece of paper ... to keep track of what was going on." One viewer who couldn't wait for longer episodes of "Project Runway" is Laura Kluvo, who blogs about the show. So what is it about elimination shows that draws viewers to the tube for hours at a time, or, in the case of "American Idol" and "So You Think You Can Dance," multiple times a week? The moral of the story: Longer episodes mean more time to explore each of the characters. But it's not just the contestants on reality competition shows like "Project Runway," "American Idol" and "Top Chef" that keep Kluvo glued to the tube for hours. "Because of the structure of competition reality shows, people have an incentive to stick around to the end to see who gets eliminated," said Andy Dehnart, the editor of Reality Blurred.
