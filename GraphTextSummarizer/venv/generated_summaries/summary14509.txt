But on Thursday, HBO CEO Richard Plepler and network Programming President Michael Lombardo assured reporters at the Television Critics Association press tour that "Game of Thrones" will get its fully story. On Thursday, the freshman anthology series earned 12 Emmy nods, including nominations for best drama, best writing and two best actor nods for Season 1 stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The fantasy series is based on George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" book series, and as "Game of Thrones" approaches its fifth season, fans are concerned it'll soon run out of source material. The show's structure presents a new cast of characters and story each season, and while Lombardo didn't have any casting news on Thursday he did drop a major tease for Season 2. "George is an integral part of the creative team, so next season every move is being choreographed very closely with him," Lombardo said.
