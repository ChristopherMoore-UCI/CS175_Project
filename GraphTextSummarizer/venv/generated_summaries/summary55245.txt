"It's not possible, and if I withdraw myself from Grameen Bank, it'll collapse," Yunus said, according to Bangladeshi Finance Minister Abul Mal Abdul Muhith. "Normally the retirement age of a bank's managing director in Bangladesh is 65, and professor Yunus is now 70," Muhith said, adding Yunus could continue as a director. Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina accused Yunus of playing a "trick" to evade taxes and charged last month that microlenders suck "blood from the poor in the name of poverty alleviation." The Bangladeshi government has called on Nobel laureate and microcredit pioneer Muhammad Yunus to retire from the bank he founded nearly three decades ago to help the poor, but he has said no. Muhith said the move had no link to politics, but many analysts said Yunus was still under fire at home for criticizing politicians and trying to form a political party four years ago during an interim, unelected government that was backed by the military.
