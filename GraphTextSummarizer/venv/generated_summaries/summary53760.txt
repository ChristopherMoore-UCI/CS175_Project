"If they continue such operations to kill civilians, international forces will change to a force who is not fighting against terrorists but fighting against Afghan people. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned Tuesday that any future NATO airstrikes that kill civilians will be considered attacks against the Afghan people. The statement came three days after an airstrike killed 14 civilians in southern Afghanistan, according to Afghan officials. "I ask that the Afghan people continue to trust and assist their security forces, so that together we can stop the senseless killing brought upon us by an enemy who wants to exploit the Afghan people through fear and violence." Karzai said Tuesday that the international community has turned the war against terrorism into political objectives. Maj. Gen. John Toolan, head of NATO's International Security Assistance Force command in southwest Afghanistan, pleaded with Afghans to not only forgive, but to also work with coalition forces in hopes of bolstering their security.
