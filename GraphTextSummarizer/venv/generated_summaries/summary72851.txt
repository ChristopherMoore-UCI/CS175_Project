Many clubs have flirted with ruin throwing millions at top flight survival, but not Eibar. "The miracle continues," grins Eibar president Alex Arranzabal soon after its best result of the season -- a 5-2 home win over relegation rivals Almeria. Should Eibar's meteoric rise continue they may well need to tackle similar issues, but such is the inexorable link between club and town, it is unthinkable such roots would be forgotten. " "This is a family -- a football club with soul," Eraso, head of Eibar's Madrid supporters club, told me in one of the numerous tiny bars dotted round its 5,800 capacity Ipurua stadium. Its €18 million budget for the season is paltry in sporting terms; European champions Real Madrid have spending power of around €762 million to draw on this campaign alone.
