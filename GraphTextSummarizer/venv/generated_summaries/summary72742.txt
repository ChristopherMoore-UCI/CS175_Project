The reasoning is basic: Drivers distracted by phone calls are a danger; drivers who send or receive text messages while behind the wheel, or who play games or update social networks on their phones, are as potentially deadly as drunken drivers. In the days before cell phones, if business owners had been asked to allow their employees to install personal phone lines and use the phones whenever they wished, it would have sounded like a joke. If cell phones and personal calls are banned at work, shouldn't employers be expected to provide overtime payment to their employees for work-related calls made, and text messages sent, to them after business hours?) The National Transportation Safety Board has called for a nationwide ban on the use of cell phones by drivers. James Nash, spokesman for a manufacturing firm, said signs are posted telling employees that cell phones are not permitted on the factory floor.
