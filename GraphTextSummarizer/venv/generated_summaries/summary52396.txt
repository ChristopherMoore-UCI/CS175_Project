The phone, which has yet to be officially named, has a screen comprised of a grid of pins, which move up and down to form into Braille shapes and characters whenever an SMS message or email is received. -- For all of their advantages, smartphones still fall a little short for some â€” specifically, for those living with visual impairment. It uses what's called Shape Memory Alloy technology, so as each pin expands, it remembers and contracts back to its original flat shape. While apps like Siri and SayText do offer a good deal of assistance, 2011 TED Fellow Sumit Dagar had an idea for a more effective solution: a smartphone that's specifically designed for people who have trouble seeing. " Dagar, an interaction design graduate of the National Institute of Design (NID), came up with the idea for the phone three years ago.
