Narrated by Rock, the film explores black hair from a multitude of angles, from the booming $9 billion industry it generates to the science behind chemical relaxers that straighten hair. They couldn't figure out why their daughters wanted straight hair, and when Lola, one of his young daughters, asked him why she didn't have good hair, it just "ignited something in me," Rock recalls. -- If you want to get to know the real Chris Rock, you might want to strike up a conversation about hair. Rock, best known for his stand-up comedy and sitcom "Everybody Hates Chris," says he'd been mulling a movie about hair for a long time, but having daughters motivated him to finally get the project started. The comedian spent nearly two years exploring the world of black hair for his documentary "Good Hair," which made its debut at Sundance this year.
