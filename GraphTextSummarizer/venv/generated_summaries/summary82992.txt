" McGwire's admission come as the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating the problem of brain injuries to football players, following heated discussions October 28, when the committee aggressively questioned NFL officials to figure out why the league had done so little to curb this well-known problem. Any government inquiry of this kind draws the familiar charge that politicians should stay out of the business of sports -- even though the NFL and NCAA have in fact responded to congressional pressure by instituting rules to protect players from brain damage. When the Senate held hearings about the exemption in 1958, a number of famous players, including Mickey Mantle and Jackie Robinson, showed up to speak about how the "reserve clause" undermined the rights of players. "When there is not any regulation," said former heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, "it can cause someone to lose their dream, their hopes...." While some issues, such as the recent investigation into the college bowl system, are easy fodder for ridicule, others, such as brain damage to NFL players, show where the government has a legitimate role. It was only in 1998 that Congress finally passed legislation declaring that some rules, such as restrictions on the movement of players from one team to another, were subject to antitrust laws.
