"If students aren't getting tested or aren't talking to their partners about STD status, then knowing what gonorrhea is is kind of irrelevant. If it catches on and students start demanding to see their partner's verified STD status, sex educators hope it will give teens an incentive to get tested if they want to have sex. This past fall, Qpid.me partnered with the Los Angeles Unified School District -- the second largest school system in the country, with more than 660,000 K-12 students -- to teach students as young as seventh grade how to get their STD results, show them to potential partners, and then request to see their potential partners' results before they hook up or have sex. High-tech tools to fight STDs A text message revealing a teenager's positive or negative STD status may well be the latest tool -- albeit a controversial one -- to target the spread of disease among students. Critics of the partnership, however, say Qpid.me comes too close to condoning underage sex and gives an incomplete picture of someone's STD status by excluding certain infections, like HPV and herpes.
