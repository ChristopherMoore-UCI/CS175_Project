Tim Curley, Penn State's former athletic director, and Gary Schultz, a former university vice president who oversaw campus police, have been charged with perjury and failing to report an alleged 2002 sexual assault of a child by former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. " A judge ruled in December that the perjury case against Curley and Schultz will go to trial, following graphic testimony from the prosecution's star witness in the case against Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994. Central to the perjury allegations were responses from Curley and Schultz to the grand jury about what said to them regarding the 2002 incident. In court papers filed Friday, the Pennsylvania attorney general's office provided portions of a transcript of a January 2011 grand jury proceeding in which prosecutors accuse Curley and Schultz of committing perjury during question-and-answer exchanges. " Prosecutors listed the answers given by Curley and Schultz to the grand jury "with the understanding that any or all of these statements will support the charge of perjury, and that it is not required to prove the falsity of every identified statement.
