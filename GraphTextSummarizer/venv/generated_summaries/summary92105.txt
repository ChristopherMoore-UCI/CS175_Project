Costolo offered no clear explanation about why Twitter, which now has some 900 employees and more than 100 million active users, and Google could not come to an agreement over including tweets in Google search results. The corny "spilled milk" joke that fell flat in President Barack Obama's State of the Union address was instantly panned on Twitter, reactions people could analyze in real time, Costolo noted. Instead, Twitter proved to be a key platform for people exchanging information about the controversial Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and similar proposed legislation, Costolo said. Addressing the new censorship policy that Twitter announced last week to much outrage and confusion, Costolo maintained that his company has taken the right approach. Toward the end of the interview, Costolo found time to discuss the 2012 presidential campaign, in which Twitter has played an active role.
