The fabled shower-room scene, in which the naïve, sheltered Carrie White (Chloë Grace Moretz) gets her first period and is shocked into thinking that she's dying, now has an added fillip of cruelty: Chris, the most hateful of the girls, doesn't just pelt Carrie with tampons and shout '' Carrie's telekinetic powers, driven by the rage she represses, allowed De Palma to orchestrate a senior-prom apocalypse that was pure filmmaking mastery. But now we're a lot more accustomed to seeing movie characters mold their destiny through special effects, and since Peirce films the climax in a rather depersonalized, shoot-the-works way, Carrie comes close to seeming like an especially alienated member of the X-Men team. It's all about Carrie's revenge, once she's subjected to the most diabolical practical ''joke'' in movie history. In a neat reversal, Chris and her best friend, the popular but far more empathetic Sue (who feels so guilty about what happened that she gets her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom), are both portrayed against type: Nice-girl Sue is played by Gabriella Wilde, who looks like a vintage snooty princess, whereas the awful Chris is made into a pensive bohemian punk by Portia Doubleday.
