"Now we need to know how this has occurred." A therapy already in use in a number of U.S. hospitals is known as functional electronic stimulation (FES), in which stimulants or electrodes are placed on the skin above the muscles to help chronic spinal cord injury patients move their limbs and, in some cases, walk with assistance. "This stimulation causes changes in the brain and changes in the spinal cord," said Dr. V. Reggie Edgerton, a professor in the Departments of Integrative Biology and Physiology and of Neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. "This does not represent a cure for spinal cord injury," Edgerton said, "but it's something to build on." The project, which is outlined in the latest issue of the medical journal Lancet, was funded by the Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation, which provides money for research on spinal cord injuries. He received continual epidermal stimulation to the lower spinal cord, researchers said, enabling the muscle and joint movements that are required to stand and, with assistance, to step.
