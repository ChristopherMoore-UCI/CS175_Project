Swedish billionaire's son Rausing arrested after wife, Eva, found dead The couple continued to support her "life-long vocation in helping those with drug addiction," Kemeny said, helping to "save" the lives of many other people -- though "tragically, not her own. "The Kemeny family hopes this tribute will be used to draw attention to the tragedy of drug addiction and to generate awareness and financial support for this cause in the future. "Eva would have wanted the memory of her life to be used to benefit others facing similar addiction challenges in their lives," his tribute said. Eva Rausing's body was found last week when police searched the couple's home after her husband was stopped on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, and then arrested on drug charges. Her death, and the details of subsequent events, are a reminder of the distorted reality of drug addiction," the statement said.
