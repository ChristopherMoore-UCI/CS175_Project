"This officer dedicated his life to saving people and that act ultimately cost him his own life," Sheriff Doug Gillespie told CNN affiliate KVVU. -- When a call came in about a stranded hiker, Las Vegas Police Officer David Vanbuskirk hopped onto a helicopter with a rescue crew, and rushed to retrieve the man from a rock ledge. His friends had nicknamed him officer Rambo Dave for his love of the outdoors and the martial arts, CNN affiliate KTNV reported. At Mount Charleston, a helicopter harness attached to Vanbuskirk lowered him toward the hiker -- dangerous terrain made foot rescue impossible. Additional rescue crews scoured the canyon and found Vanbuskirk's body, officials said.
