Krista Dittmeyer, 20, has not been seen since Saturday, when the 14-month-old was found alone in her car, parked in the parking lot of a ski area at Mount Cranmore, New Hampshire, according to Conway, New Hampshire, police spokesman Christopher Perley. A murky pond has been drained and an air search was conducted Monday with no sign of Dittmeyer, Perley said. "We don't have any information that leads us to believe that she's not alive, and we're going to continue to investigate as if we can reunite her with her family," Perley said in a Monday press conference. Police also conducted a thorough search using fire and rescue personnel, New Hampshire Fish and Game staffers and police dogs. Dittmeyer, who lived with roommates in Portland, Maine, had no history of mental illness and no criminal record, Perley said.
