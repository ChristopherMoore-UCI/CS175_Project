Lebanon has always struggled to maintain a balance among its religious and ethnic sects, and the current tensions mirror those in Syria -- in both countries, the Shiite and Alawite Muslim sects (Assad is an Alawite) tend to support the Syrian regime, while support is growing among Sunni Muslims for Syrian rebels. Many in Lebanon believe the recent violence was intentionally stirred up by Syria to distract from the country's own unrest and to prove Assad's claim that a destabilized Syria will lead to chaos in neighboring countries, but there's no real proof of Syrian involvement, according to Phillips. First, the Assad regime remains in firm control of the vast majority of Syria, and northern Lebanon's support for the rebels hasn't reached the point where it would warrant a Syrian or Hezbollah response. In April the Lebanese army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for Tripoli -- the northern epicenter of support for Syrian rebels in Lebanon -- that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in Syria. Since then, Lebanon's two most prominent political blocs have been sharply divided in their attitude toward Syria -- the ruling pro-Syria alliance led by Prime Minister Najib Mikati and a group of anti-Syrian factions led by Saad Hariri, son of the assassinated former prime minister.
