According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States imported $4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from China in 2006. In June, the United States banned five types of fish and shrimp from China because inspectors found traces of cancer-causing chemicals and antibiotics in the products. Twenty-eight people in this village of 400 have died over the last 10 years from cancer -- a rate much higher than the rest of country.
