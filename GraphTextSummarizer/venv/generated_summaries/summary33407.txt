El Paso County District Court records show that Apodaca was arrested 10 days after Gonzalez's killing and charged with attempted theft of property, a second-degree felony. The three men each face one count of capital murder, El Paso police said. Apodaca joined the Army a year ago and worked as a crew member on a Patriot missile launcher, officials at Fort Bliss in El Paso told CNN. Apodaca joined the Army in September 2008, according to a statement from Fort Bliss in El Paso. Cell phone records, witness statements and El Paso Police detectives corroborated this, according to the document.
