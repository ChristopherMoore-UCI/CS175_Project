Having what Wilson refers to as a "constellation of other fears" could also contribute to the phobia of flying; claustrophobia, fear of death and being afraid of turning control over to the pilot could all contribute to the ultimate fear of the not-so-friendly skies. The fear of flying constitutes one of the two most common fears humans grapple with (the other one being fear of public speaking), said Wilson, who served as lead psychologist for American Airlines' first national program for fear of flying. "If it's about someone else, then you have no control, but if you shift your feelings of fear to yourself, then you can do something about it," Wilson said. "They see it, and they imagine what would that be like if it happened to me," said anxiety disorder psychologist R. Reid Wilson. By focusing on the possibility instead of the actual probability of the plane crashing, someone who's vulnerable to such fears can grow even more anxious about flying, he said.
