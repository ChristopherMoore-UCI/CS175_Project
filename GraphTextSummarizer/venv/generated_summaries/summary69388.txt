Some of us believe, with good reasons, that the Republicans are "mad-dogging" Hillary Clinton with the Benghazi hearing to damage not only her presidential prospects, but also to damage President Obama's credibility. For whatever the Benghazi hearings are about, they're not about learning the lessons from this tragedy and improving securities at American embassies and other facilities overseas. The Benghazi hearing, which House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, orchestrated and  planned for months, is a classic "killing two birds with one stone" scenario for Republicans. As Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland and ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said Wednesday after the White House's release of approximately 100 pages of e-mails relating to the attacks in Benghazi: "These documents undercut the reckless accusations by Republicans that the White House scrubbed the Benghazi talking points for political reasons and in fact show just the oppositeâ€”that the primary goal was to protect the FBI's ongoing criminal investigation and our nation's intelligence operations." -- For some Republicans, 2016 is 1992: Hating Hillary Clinton is chic again.
