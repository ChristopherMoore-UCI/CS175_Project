Knee Defender sales soar after plane incident The woman in front of him complained about not being able to recline, and the flight attendant asked him to remove the device, Beach told "the Today Show." Although the Federal Aviation Administration hasn't prohibited use of the device on commercial flights, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines (which also operates the U.S. Airways brand) and Southwest Airlines (which also operates the AirTran brand) all say they ban the $22 device, which prevents the seat in front of the user from reclining. Though he regrets how he handled the recent incident with a fellow passenger who wanted to recline her seat, Colorado businessman James Beach told "the Today Show" that he may use the now-famous Knee Defender device again. " As long as airlines ignore the problem and sell the same space to two people, these disputes will continue, Knee Defender creator Ira Goldman said. The man who got kicked off a United Airlines flight because of a fight over seat reclining says he's sorry about his behavior.
