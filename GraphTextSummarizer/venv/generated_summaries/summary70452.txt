-- The lawyer for comedian Bill Cosby, in response to over a dozen allegations of sexual assault by different women over many years, made this statement on November 16: "Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against Mr. Cosby have resurfaced. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment. There will be no further statement from Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives." While alone with Cosby, they say they were drugged and assaulted, then silenced afterward by Cosby handlers. Let's hope that the media, corporate leaders and our criminal justice system begin to offer compassion and dignity to women (and men) coming forward with allegations of violence and sexual assault.
