-- A deadly tour bus crash in the Southern California mountains left at least eight people dead and dozens injured Sunday A parade of ambulances snaked down a narrow, sloping highway Sunday night, waiting to transport the dozens injured. The incident took place in a mountainous area of State Route 38, between Mentone and Forest Falls, San Bernardino Fire Department spokesman Eric Sherwin said. By late Sunday night, all passengers had been removed from the bus, Sherwin said. Though the early death toll stood at eight, that number is expected to rise, California Highway Patrol Officer Mario Lopez said.
