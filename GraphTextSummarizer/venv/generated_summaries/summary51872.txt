"I just really liked this shirt because I was always raised that way," Rubiano told CNN affiliate KFSM. That's the question residents in Fayetteville, Arkansas, are asking after a junior high student was asked by school administrators to change out of a T-shirt that read "Virginity Rocks" last week. "If a student wore a shirt that said 'Sex Rocks' or 'Smoke More Pot,' they would also have been asked to remove it for the same reason; it would no doubt be disruptive," he wrote in an email to CNN. Eighth-grader Chloe Rubiano of Ramay Junior High said she got the tee at a Christian festival last year; on the back, it continues its abstinence message: "I'm loving my Husband and I haven't even Married Him." Does the word "virginity" evoke discussions of sexuality or religious belief?
