" The rocket was moved to a launch pad in the northeastern portion of Dongchang-ri, a village in northwest North Korea, the South Korean official said. He said the International Atomic Energy Agency needs to consult with North Korea and other parties involved in the multilateral talks, known as the six-party talks. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said Monday his country would "thoroughly retaliate against North Korea" if provoked. -- Just hours after the United States warned that North Korea would achieve nothing with threats or provocations, Pyongyang moved a long-range rocket it plans to test fire to a launch pad Monday, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said. Overshadowing the summit's message of international cooperation was an announcement by North Korea that it plans to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch in mid-April.
