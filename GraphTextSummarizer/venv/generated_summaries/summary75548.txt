Watch Tabb and The Roots of Music program in action Â» Tabb attributes the success in part to the nature of music. The type of music support systems that helped Tabb years ago have been struggling since Hurricane Katrina; musicians scattered after the storm and budget cuts ended many school music programs. "When all you've seen is the drug dealers and the killing, you know, they think that's cool," said Tabb, adding that many young people wind up in trouble because they have nothing else to do. "That's what keeps the kids coming back every day." Since getting underway last year, The Roots of Music has already exceeded Tabb's expectations. Tabb, wearing a gold chain and a baseball cap, doesn't look the part of a typical band teacher.
