-- Haiti's capital awoke to increasing desperation Thursday morning, a day and a half after a devastating earthquake, with covered bodies piling up along streets and modern aspects of life, such as electricity, mostly missing. The Canadian crew planned to leave Wednesday night to make room for other planes on the crowded tarmac. As the sun climbed into the sky Thursday, the din from the park across the street from the hotel quieted, replaced by an occasional car horn and the chattering of residents speaking their rapid-fire French patois. But by Wednesday afternoon, the first small-plane commercial flights started to arrive. Large military cargo aircraft were landing routinely and often Wednesday afternoon.
