According to Kotnik, containers have been used for decades as makeshift residences and market shops in places like Africa, but it's only in the last 10 years that architects have "added value" by creating high concept designs out of them. According to a 2008 UK government report on low-carbon construction, the manufacture of building materials for use in the UK creates 45.2 million tons of CO2 emissions a year, equal to roughly 7% of the country's total emissions. "From Volvo, Puma, Rolex, Nike to Ikea -- loads of big names have been turning shipping containers into shops or spaces that they think will enhance their brand image," says Kotnik. "In some ways I'm surprised it's taken the mainstream architectural community so long to utilize containers in this way -- as their modular, standardized shape lends itself so well for creating interesting buildings," he says. "There are about 400 established architectural projects making use of shipping containers around the world," says Slovenian architect Jure Kotnik, who has written two books on the subject and is curating an international exhibition on "container architecture" currently on display at the AIA in Seattle.
