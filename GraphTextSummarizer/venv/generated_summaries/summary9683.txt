Martin Scorsese: You voted him best director in our Screening Room poll Walking away with 15 percent of your votes, Scorsese's hard-hitting documentary style, quickfire editing, fondness for NYC backdrops and rapport with De Niro make him your top director. Iconic and violent, 1990's "Goodfellas" featured top-drawer performances from Scorsese favorites, De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci, while "Casino" (1995) drew heavily on its predecessor, with a good measure of extra violence and an Oscar-nominated performance from Sharon Stone. " Scorsese is famous for his partnerships with leading actors, most notably Robert De Niro and, more recently, Leonardo DiCaprio. More recently, "The Aviator" paired Scorsese with Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett and John C Reilly. This influence would show up again and again in his student films, and later in "Raging Bull," "Taxi Driver" and "Mean Streets." Despite coming from a poor background and not having access to 8mm cameras like many of his university peers, Scorsese dove into film with a passion and was soon a star pupil.
