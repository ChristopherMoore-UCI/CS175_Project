Solar activity varies in its intensity, but there has been an uptick in solar flares and related episodes in recent years. These shock waves pose no direct threat to humans, but sometimes, on days such as June 13, CMEs can be large enough to disrupt GPS, satellite communications and other atmospheric systems, according to NASA. "Of course, there is no actual correlation between solar flares and Friday the 13th," he said in an e-mail to CNN. " Phillips, who is also production editor for science at NASA, categorized only four Friday the 13ths in the last decade as "high solar activity." Thus, NOAA remains on watch. The disruption of communication systems in the atmosphere is still unlikely, even with the impending solar storms.
