FIFA's top-rated nation scored first half goals through David Villa and Sergio Ramos to deflate France, who were playing their first match since their controversial qualification for South Africa at the expense of Ireland. France did make a good start and Franck Ribery impressed on the right side of midfield, but in the 21st minute David Silva dummied Andres Iniesta's through pass and his Valencia teammate Villa easily beat Hugo Lloris. Domenech's men had to wait until the 80th minute to seriously threaten the Spain goal as Chelsea's Florent Malouda headed against the post after a cross from fellow substitute Djibril Cisse. The vital second goal arrived just before halftime as Real Madrid's Ramos was given too much time and space to cut inside and curl home a shot with his left foot with flicked off Julien Escude and past Lloris. Gokhan Inler's penalty put the hosts in front, but Diego Forlan equalized before further efforts from Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani.
