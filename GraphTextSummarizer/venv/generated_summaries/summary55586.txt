Crews will be able to retrieve the SUV from the 20-foot sinkhole Friday evening, said Barry McNulty, spokesman for We Energies. The sinkhole cut off power to the area, but about 200 businesses and homes should regain electricity Friday night, he said. Pawlik told CNN affiliate WTMJ that he saw a nearby traffic light in the sinkhole and spotted the SUV heading right toward it. The SUV's engine remained running into Friday as police and fire officers decided how to proceed. Treankler suffered only minor cuts and bruises in the incident, which occurred during a storm that brought heavy flooding to the city.
