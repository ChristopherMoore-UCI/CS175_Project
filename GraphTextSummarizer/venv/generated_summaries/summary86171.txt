-- British Prime Minister David Cameron arrived Saturday in Pakistan for talks with President Asif Ali Zardari about building a "strong relationship" between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the prime minister's office said. While visiting with Karzai, Cameron said his country has "a good relationship with Pakistan," the UK's Press Association news agency reported. The Taliban opened a Doha office this month with a promise to renounce international terrorism and commit to peace negotiations, conditions the United States had set before it would support establishing the office as part of peace talks. Cameron arrived from Afghanistan, where he made an unannounced visit Saturday and met with UK troops in Helmand province. Speaking in Kabul at press conference with Karzai, Cameron added that "it's in Pakistan's short-, medium- and long-term interest to have a secure, stable and prosperous Afghanistan with which they have a good and strong relationship."
