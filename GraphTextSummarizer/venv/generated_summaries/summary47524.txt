The film features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran in order to paint Islam as a threat to Western society. "According to Wilders, the truth about Islam must be made known, even if it is painful and unpleasant for certain people," his statement on his party's site said. In addition to inciting discrimination and hatred, Wilders is also charged with offending a group of people, which relates to his comparison of Islam to Nazism. Controversial Dutch lawmaker Geert Wilders appeared in court Wednesday on charges of inciting discrimination and hatred that relate in part to his much-criticized film about Islam. The charges relate to comments Wilders made in a variety of media between 2006 and 2008.
