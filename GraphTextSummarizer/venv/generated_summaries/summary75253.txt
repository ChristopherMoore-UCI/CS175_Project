" Cinzia Angotti, a child protection officer for the U.N. Peacekeeping Mission to Haiti, said workers are trying to identify the children at risk, "the ones who are along without family, and to respond as quickly as possible to the lack of protection of children during this disaster." Groups including Save the Children and World Vision have called for a halt to adoptions, saying that many children who may appear to be orphaned have simply been separated from their families. "We know there have been reports that children left the country without going through the authorization of the prime minister or other authorities," Julie Bergeron, chief of child protection for the United Nations Children's Fund, said Sunday. Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-Louisiana, said that the initial focus of the legislation would be on children orphaned by the January 12 earthquake in Haiti but that in the long term, it also would address other adoption efforts. Last week, the State Department said it was working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Haitian government to process nearly 300 cases of Americans who were waiting to adopt Haitian children. Sen. Kit Bond, R-Missouri said the red tape in Washington shouldn't slow down the adoption process for Haitian children.
