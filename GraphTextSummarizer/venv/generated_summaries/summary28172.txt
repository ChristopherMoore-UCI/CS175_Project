-- A male model suspected of killing a prominent Portuguese journalist in his posh Manhattan hotel room was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation Saturday at New York City's Bellevue Hospital, according to an NYPD law enforcement source. Police say 20-year-old Renato Seabra, a Portuguese model, was in custody Saturday after he was spotted leaving another New York hospital where he received treatment for lacerations to his wrists. Castro's body was found after an acquaintance appeared at the hotel asking to see him, saying she had been in contact with him earlier in the day but was unable to reach him for some time, according to the law enforcement source. Carlos Antonio De Castro, 65, was found dead in his room at the InterContinental Hotel in New York on Friday, according to the source. Castro was most recently a gossip columnist for the Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha.
