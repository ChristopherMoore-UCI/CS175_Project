-- CNN anchor Anderson Cooper played the groom in a surreal wedding scene send-off for Bill Hader's Stefon character on the season finale of "Saturday Night Live." Ben Affleck, host of the last episode of SNL's 38th season, made a cameo appearance, yelling to Meyers: "Follow your heart, bro. Meyers grabbed Stefon, and the couple dashed away, while DJ Baby Bok Choy -- another character from Stefon's reports -- blocked Cooper from following. Meyers and Stefon then reappeared live on the "Weekend Update" set as SNL cast members tossed rice on them. Meyers is taking over NBC's "Late Night" show next year, although he is expected to return to SNL for season 39.
