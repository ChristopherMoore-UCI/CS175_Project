The attacker set off the explosives attached to his body around 8 a.m. after he was noticed by security guards in the neighborhood, said Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry. And in April, Afghan security forces said they repulsed a wave of insurgent attacks in the capital and three other provinces. Afghan authorities don't know what the bomber's intended target was, Seddiqi said. In September, a suicide bomber killed six people and wounded four others near the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). Kabul, where the Afghan government is based and many foreign organizations have heavily guarded headquarters, hasn't been spared from the unrest.
