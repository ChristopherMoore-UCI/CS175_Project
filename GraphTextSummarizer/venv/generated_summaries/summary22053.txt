Kebede will post a daily diary of her life on Instagram showing us mere mortals the events she attends, meetings she's involved in while reflecting on how her roots have shaped the woman she is today. In the fall of 2000, the multi-talented designer and future director Tom Ford handpicked Kebede to walk the catwalk for his autumn/winter Gucci collection.

Returning to her roots Kebede also works tirelessly to put a spotlight on the needs of millions of mothers and newborns in Ethiopia through her philanthropy, The Liya Kebede Foundation, launched in 2005 alongside her appointment as a World Health Organization goodwill ambassador, a role she held until 2011.
