"I cannot recall post-war Soviet leaders working as intensively as I do or as President Dmitry Medvedev does," Putin said. Putin in turn suggested that Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in December, in what would be a straight swap of their roles. Last month, Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party to endorse Putin for president in 2012. -- In his first televised interview since he was launched toward the presidency again, Russia's powerful Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said Monday that his goal of returning to the Kremlin was to "stabilize" and "diversify" the national economy as well as to "strengthen the fundamental basis of the political system and the democratic institutions" of the country. However, Putin said that using his political influence he could have easily adjusted the Russian constitution to allow himself another consecutive run after having served two presidential terms from 2000 to 2008, but chose not to do so and stepped down, paving the way for his hand-picked successor, Dmitry Medvedev.
