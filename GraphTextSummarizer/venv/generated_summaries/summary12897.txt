In the long term, however, research shows that it offers children a poor example of how to solve problems or deal with difficult situations. -- As the director of a leading research center on child abuse, I have seen all too often that what a parent considers legitimate discipline can quickly deteriorate into violence fueled by anger. Although not all children who have been abused are affected the same way, decades of research show that child abuse initiates a cascade of negative social, emotional and health-related outcomes. The word discipline means "to teach," but does spanking really teach children to behave, or does it teach them to solve problems with violence? It would be naÃ¯ve to think that even the most dedicated parents do not sometimes become frustrated with defiant children.
