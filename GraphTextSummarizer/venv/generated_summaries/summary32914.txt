This strike is about teachers unions testing their boundaries with Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. In the other camp, you have teachers unions, whose job it is to protect their members but who now interpret that mandate to mean that they should protect teachers from public demands for greater accountability, higher standards and a better education for our children. The Chicago Teachers Union has never gotten over its resentment for Duncan, who served as Chicago superintendent of schools from 2001 to 2009 and implemented many of the same accountability measures that Bush and Obama embraced. Chicago teachers already earn an average annual salary of $74,236, according to a study by Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. In one camp, you have reformers who believe that all children can learn and that teachers and schools have to be held accountable for making sure that happens.
