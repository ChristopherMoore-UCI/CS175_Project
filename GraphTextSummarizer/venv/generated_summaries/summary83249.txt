Psaki said late last month that the United States is "prepared to send Ambassador King" to North Korea to discuss Bae. Choson Sinbo claims that Bae has been told to expect a visit from Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, as early as this coming Monday. American Kenneth Bae, who is being held in North Korea, has been moved from a hospital to a labor camp, the State Department said on Friday. "We also remain gravely concerned about Mr. Bae's health" and again urge Pyongyang to grant him "special  amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds," she said. The North Korean government accused Bae of planning to bring down the government through religious activities.
