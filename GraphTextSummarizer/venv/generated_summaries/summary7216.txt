The Supreme Court took a critical step toward this, confirming Congress' broad authority to regulate how we conduct federal elections, particularly as politicians in states across the country continue to push new laws that would make it harder for Americans to vote. The court also made it clear that states may not undermine Congress' effort to streamline the voter registration process for federal elections. It increased access to registration by providing one simple, uniform application form that could be used to register for federal elections in any state. -- Now that the Supreme Court has invalidated part of Arizona's voter registration law, states should be thinking twice before introducing laws to make it harder to cast a ballot. It entitled all Americans to register to vote by mail and encouraged voter registration drives.
