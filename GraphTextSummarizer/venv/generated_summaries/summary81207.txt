Heroes Pinches met triple world champion Tweddle at Liverpool Gymnastics Club after family moved north to Cheshire when she was young. So I have dropped back on everything else to commit my life to achieving my goal, which is to get to the Olympics," says Pinches, who helped Britain qualify with fifth placing at the worlds in Tokyo last year -- the team's best performance yet. Pinches has made a good start in her bid to emulate her hero, having been crowned English junior champion in 2007 before representing Britain at the 2011 World Artistic Gymnastic Championships in Tokyo, Japan. " Early days Born in a small town south of Manchester, Pinches' love for gymnastics blossomed at an early age, and she worked her way up to become English champion in 2007 when she was 13. If Pinches needed any extra motivation, it comes with the realization that her first Olympics could also be the only one in her lifetime staged on home soil.
