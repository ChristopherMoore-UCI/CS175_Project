-- Six people were killed in Pakistan on Saturday when Muslim demonstrators set fire to houses in a Christian enclave and fighting broke out, local police said. Pakistani human rights activists in Lahore protest on Saturday the anti-Christian violence in Gojra village. The suspect is a resident of Sargodha, which is 165 kilometers (about 100 miles) northwest of Lahore and has a house in Rawalpindi that has been used to facilitate insurgent acts, police said. Meanwhile, police in Islamabad reported Friday that an al Qaeda member thought to be involved in several attacks was arrested. The Muslims went to the Christian community in Gojra City, 160 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Lahore, and burned 40 to 50 houses.
