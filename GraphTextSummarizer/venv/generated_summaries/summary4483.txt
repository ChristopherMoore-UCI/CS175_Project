Whatever the reasons for the gap, Obama will have to work overtime to maintain numbers of white voters who say they will vote for him while convincing minority voters to turn out to vote, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. "To be more comfortable he should be going above 40 percent (with white voters)," Gillespie said. The racial trends in this year's election are part of a complicated calculus in which a greater number of white Republican voters could offset possibly lower turnout among the Democratic base of minorities and young voters. But Democrats have struggled for the past decade to hold on to white voters during presidential elections, Brownstein said. For weeks, he's hovered around 40% of white voter support - a level that Democratic presidential candidates have struggled with in the recent past and one that analysts believe Barack Obama must maintain in order to win. "Many voters including black voters don't feel Obama performed exceptionally (on the economy)," Neal said.
