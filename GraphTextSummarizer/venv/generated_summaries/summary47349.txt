The idea of being a stay-at-home dad, like Michael Keaton in "Mr. Mom," always appealed to me. It's not like me to pretend to know anything about home improvement, but when it comes to caring for my family while balancing my responsibilities at work, I plan on doing whatever it takes. Available resources and social acceptance for stay-at-home dads have come a long way since "Mr. Mom's" portrayal of them. Unfettered from the restriction of the morning rituals, my productivity was already soaring and I was ahead of schedule. Unlike the characters in "Mr. Mom," my wife and I both need to work.
