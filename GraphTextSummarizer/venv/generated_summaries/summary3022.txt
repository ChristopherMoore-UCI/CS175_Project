In response to the family's statement, the hospital "will allow a lawful transfer of Jahi's body in its current state to another location if the family can arrange such a transfer and Children's can legally do so," wrote hospital attorney Douglas C. Straus in a December 27 letter to Dolan. Family attorney Christopher Dolan told reporters Thursday that Jahi would need to have tracheostomy and gastrostomy tubes put in before she could be moved. Jahi was declared brain dead by doctors at the hospital on December 12, three days after tonsil surgery. "Children's is willing to cooperate in this regard even though Judge Grillo has confirmed that Jahi is deceased and that statutory patient transfer procedures do not apply here," Straus wrote. A judge has concluded that Jahi, who suffered complications after tonsil surgery, is brain dead.
