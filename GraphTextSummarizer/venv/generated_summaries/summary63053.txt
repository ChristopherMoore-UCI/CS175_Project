The full moon, as always, will seem largest when it is near the horizon, as it rises and sets, "but it's really just an optical illusion," said NASA spokesman J.D. Harrington. An alignment of the full moon and the orbital perigee occurs at most once in 1Â½  years, and Harrington says this year's phenomena shouldn't be much different from previous ones. The moon will appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than "lesser full moons we've seen earlier in 2008," NASA says -- provided it is being viewed in a clear sky. On its Web site, NASA notes that "for reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists, low-hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees, buildings and other foreground objects." Every few years, a full moon coincides with the point in the satellite's elliptical orbit that brings it closest to the center of the Earth.
