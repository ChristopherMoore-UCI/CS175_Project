Shakhtar, Ukraine's top club and a regular in the Champions League, now plans on contesting its home matches in the western city of Lviv near the Polish border and will shift its training base to the capital, Kiev, from Donetsk. "We will play all of our home games at the Arena Lviv so far," Shakhtar manager Mircea Lucescu told the club website after Tuesday's win over Dynamo Kiev in Lviv in the Ukrainian Super Cup. Lucescu didn't know when the team would resume home games at the Donbass Arena, which, like the Arena Lviv, staged games during Euro 2012, co-hosted by Ukraine and Poland. Tensions between Russia and Ukraine were already running high but further escalated after MH17 was shot down near Donetsk in eastern Ukraine Thursday. Shakhtar begins its league campaign with a "home" game Sunday against Metalurh Zaporizhya.
