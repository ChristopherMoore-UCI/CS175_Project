-- Video posted to YouTube shows the dramatic moment a food stall exploded at a fireworks festival in Japan on Thursday evening. Police are investigating the cause of the blaze, which local media said was believed to have started when the operator of a food stall that sells "baby kasutera," a popular sponge-cake in Japan, tried to refuel his generator. Sixty people were taken to a number of hospitals, suffering from varying degrees of burns, authorities said. More than 100,000 people had gathered for the annual pyrotechnic display in Fukuchiyama city, said the local chamber of commerce and industry, which organized the event. At one hospital alone, 16 people ages 8 to 85 years were treated for serious burns.
