Speaking from his office in a run-down shopping mall in central Athens, Costas Vaxevanis claimed the list of accounts held by Greeks at an HSBC branch in Geneva encapsulated Greece's deeply corrupt political culture. It refers both to legitimate accounts held by businesspeople and individuals and to others that we believe were used for channeling funds for purposes of tax evasion. The investigative journalist facing trial after embarrassing Greece's political and business elite by publishing the names of 2,000 Greeks with Swiss bank accounts on Monday stuck to his guns saying his list showed "how sick the system is". "We will argue that there was no violation of privacy under Greek law as we didn't publish the amounts held in each account, only the names and professions of the account-holders," Vaxevanis said. Sales of last week's issue quadrupled to 100,000, highlighting Greek anger over the failure of successive governments to crack down on tax evasion by the country's elite.
