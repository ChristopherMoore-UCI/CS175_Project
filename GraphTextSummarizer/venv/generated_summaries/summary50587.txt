Are you best working out at a gym or at home, with free weights or weight machines? This seems to be true whether you're looking for nutritional recommendations, training programs, or even deciding what type of exercise equipment is best. I decided it's my responsibility to learn as much as possible so that I can give myself every opportunity to succeed, but I won't let conflicting information slow me down. The jungle of information should not stop you from pursuing a healthier life. To add to the confusion, much of the information provides conflicting advice.
