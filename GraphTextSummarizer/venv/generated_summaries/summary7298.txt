Needle exchanges have been scientifically shown to reduce new infections. Health leaders worry about the spread of HIV and other diseases such as hepatitis C around the country as the number of illegal prescription drug users has grown. The CDC and state health leaders held a news conference Friday to talk about the new numbers and about the growing threat of the spread of disease from IV drug use, especially in isolated rural areas that have sparse health resources. And this has led to more needle sharing, which spreads infection. The number of new HIV infections in a rural Indiana county has grown, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
