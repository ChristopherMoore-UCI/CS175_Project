Dr. Paul Nassif, in an interview Tuesday by HLN's "Showbiz Tonight," said he couldn't tell if Sheen, who is his friend, was drunk. Sheen and now ex-wife Brooke Mueller were married in Nassif's Beverly Hills home, Nassif said. "Kind of weird, the phone call I received," Dr. Paul Nassif told the Los Angeles Fire Department dispatcher in the recorded call, which was released by the fire department Wednesday. Nassif's wife, Adrienne Maloof-Nassif, appears on "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Nassif is a facial plastic surgeon and is not Sheen's medical doctor, Nassif told HLN.
