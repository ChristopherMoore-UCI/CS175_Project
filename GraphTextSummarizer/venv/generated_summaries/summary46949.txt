The French actor, who brought his smooth, continental charm to such films as "Letters From an Unknown Woman" (1948), "The Happy Time" (1952) and "Three Coins in the Fountain" (1954), died Saturday in his Beverly Hills home, according to French publication Le Point. After the huge success of "Gigi," Jourdan brought his dashing elan to a number of films, including "The Best of Everything" (1959), opposite Joan Crawford; the musical "Can-Can" (1960), with Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine and his "Gigi" co-star Maurice Chevalier; "The V.I.P.s" (1963), opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; and the Gallic romp "Made in Paris" (1966), with Ann-Margret. " With his cosmopolitan currency at its peak, Jourdan was cast by Minnelli to star in the MGM big--budget musical "Gigi" (1958) as a wealthy bon vivant in love with a beautiful courtesan-in-training (Caron). He studied acting at Ecole d'art Dramatique, and his first movie role came in "Le Corsaire" (1939), a French film that was never completed because of World War II. After World War II, Jourdan attracted the attention of famed producer David O. Selznick and was cast in Alfred Hitchcock's "The Paradine Case" (1947), which starred Gregory Peck and Ethel Barrymore.
