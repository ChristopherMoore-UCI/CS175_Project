Nadal may be a two-time champion at Wimbledon but his reputation on grass has taken a battering in recent years. Wawrinka, who won his first grand slam at the 2014 Australian Open, defeated Spain's Feliciano Lopez in straight sets. "I deserve to be here because I'm working hard every day and it's normal to be in the last matches of tournaments and grand slams. I look forward to returning to Wimbledon next year." "I think I was in a bit of a zone out there," he told reporters after setting up a last-eight clash with Canadian eighth seed Milos Raonic, who beat Japan's Kei Nishikori 4-6 6-1 7-6 6-3.
