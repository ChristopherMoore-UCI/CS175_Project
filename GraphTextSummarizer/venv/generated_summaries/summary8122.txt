-- A Connecticut woman who rammed barricades and led police on a chase near the U.S. Capitol last week was carrying a box that contained her driver's license, passport, Social Security card and foreign currency. No clarity on whether shooting was justified Police say Carey rammed barricades and police cruisers -- actions Washington police Chief Cathy Lanier said appeared deliberate -- and sped down Pennsylvania Avenue before crashing. 'My sister just totally didn't deserve this' Carey's boyfriend reportedly told police last winter that she appeared to be delusional. Authorities also found in the lockbox hospital discharge documents, keys, a lease agreement, various mail documents and a check for Carey in the amount of almost $1,800. Carey, 34, died after police shot her following a wild chase.
