By the end of the year, there'll be 29 Diane von Furstenberg boutiques in major city centers around the world, with the three newest set to open before the end of year. In 1978 she sold her entire inventory of wrap dresses after steep discounting at New York retailers prompted fashion bible "Women's Wear Daily" to declare that the trend for wrap dresses was over. Wearing a floaty, flowery dress doesn't convey the traditional image of power, yet when it's designed by Diane von Furstenberg, somehow, inexplicably, it does. Diane von Furstenberg sold her first dress during New York Fashion Week in 1970. "Yes, of course the fact that I was a woman in my early 20s and that I looked cute and that I had a lot of drive and that on top of it all, I was a princess, all of that helped," Diane von Furstenberg told CNN from her office in New York, her face repeated on authentic Andy Warhol prints behind her on the wall.
