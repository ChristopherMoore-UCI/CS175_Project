And for good reason: Over the years, music has remained one of the few things, genres notwithstanding, that most people can agree to enjoy. That's why this week, we're going to highlight a passel of helpful music apps that do more than just, well, allow you to listen to music. When you fire up the app, you can pick from an array of playlist moods -- Sensual, Tender, Happy, Angry -- or search for a song that evokes a certain mood and create a mix of similar tunes. -- There are a ton of old sayings about music: that it's the food of love, that it soothes the savage beast, that it makes the people come together (yeah). However, just as genres and sounds have twisted and changed over the years (just watch these elderly folks listening to Skrillex for proof) the way we listen to, consume and integrate music into our daily lives has also shifted and altered.
