Saying she's an "old woman" trying to find out the fate of her only son, the mother of American hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig has sent a tweet meant for ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. Since the announcement -- made in an ISIS video showing the apparent beheading of of British aid worker Alan Henning -- Kassig's has issued repeated pleas asking his captors to show mercy and free him. " Wednesday night, Kassig's parents attended a vigil at Indiana's Butler University, Kassig's alma mater. How can we reach you?" Abdul-Rahman Kassig, whose given name is Peter, was detained on October 1 in eastern Syria while doing humanitarian work. 'I am an idealist' Kassig, 26, had already finished a tour in the Middle East as a U.S. Army Ranger stationed in Iraq.
