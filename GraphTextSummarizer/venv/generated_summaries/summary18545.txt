Watch video: 'Gulf Three' shake up global aviation But the "Big Three" are keen to stress that Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Dubai are more than just strategically located landing strips in the desert. Abu Dhabi Like Dubai, downtown Abu Dhabi has its fair share of large mirror-and-glass buildings that stretch high into the sky. Doha Unlike Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the Qatari capital of Doha has less experience when it comes to welcoming foreign tourists and travelers. A detailed plan is already in place to develop tourism in Qatar, although the CEO of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, is keen for the country to maintain its cultural integrity. Add to this the investment in state-of-the-art airports and vast new plane fleets, as well as the acquisition of stakes in some of Europe's biggest airlines which have ruptured traditional airline alliances, and it is clear why more and more commercial traffic is making a pit-stop in the region.
