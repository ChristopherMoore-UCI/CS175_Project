Families flee Mosul The influx of refugees has put a strain on the country, and nowhere is that more evident than at St. Mary's Church, where about 500 refugees, including some Muslims, have walked through the doors, Father Khalil Jaar said. Safe haven Jordan's capital of Amman has become a magnet for many refugees in recent years trying to escape war or persecution. It's all that is left of a life before the Islamic State terror group swept into northern Iraq, giving the Christians of Qaraqosh and Mosul an ultimatum: Convert, leave or die. Since ISIS fighters took control of the city, all have left, according to Caritas International, a nonprofit aid group working to resettle refugees. Christians flee Iraq ahead of ISIS Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, and its surrounds were home to an estimated 60,000 Christians prior to ISIS sweeping in.
