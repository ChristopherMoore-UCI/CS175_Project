Know the good and bad fats As of 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has required food manufacturers to include trans fats on the nutritional label of packaged foods. Restaurants and food manufacturers use partially hydrogenated oils and fats in baking, frying and food processing. A five-year-old ban on the use of trans fats in New York City restaurants has sharply reduced the consumption of these unhealthy fats among fast-food customers, a study by city health officials has found. The ban prohibits restaurants from serving foods or using ingredients that contain 0.5 grams or more of trans fats per serving. The restaurant industry initially opposed the ban, arguing that eliminating trans fats would be expensive and would alter the taste and texture of foods.
