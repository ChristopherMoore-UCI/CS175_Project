Because she had helped care for Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, and because another health worker who cared for Duncan had been diagnosed with Ebola, the worker was not allowed to travel on a commercial plane with other people, said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hospital denies 'institutional problem' Vinson, who lives alone, is in isolation at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. The second Dallas health care worker who was found to have the Ebola virus should not have boarded a commercial jet Monday, health officials say. The risk of exposure to the passengers who were on the plane with Vinson is low, since she did not yet have symptoms, health officials said Wednesday. "Health officials have interviewed the latest patient to quickly identify any contacts or potential exposures, and those people will be monitored," the health department said.
