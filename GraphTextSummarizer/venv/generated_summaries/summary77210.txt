A contentious crowd of Tokyo Electric Power Company shareholders showed up Tuesday for their first meeting since the March tsunami to grill company executives about the future of the embattled company, as well as nuclear energy in Japan. Wrapped in a white Tyvek protective suit and mask, similar to the suits worn by members of the clean-up crews at Fukushima Daiichi power plant, Mamiko Nakanishi was urging a general vote in Japan. But in the end, they rejected a motion for the company to abandon nuclear power, according to the Japanese news agency Kyodo, despite plenty of opposition. "The world is moving in that direction and I don't think TEPCO can resist that forever," she said, referring to anti-nuclear movements in nations like Germany. Protesters, including several activists from the environmental group Greenpeace, held up a banner that called TEPCO "the worst ever polluting company."
