The last official school proms were held in Wilcox County decades ago, before schools were racially integrated, community members said. Wilcox County and many other schools in the Deep South canceled proms and homecoming dances in the early years of integration, and in some places, private, segregated proms became the local tradition. Last year, it took a group of students, attention on social media and the support of the NAACP, parents and community members to make it happen. In 2013, a group of Wilcox County students organized an integrated prom open to white, black, Latino and Asian students. -- Last week, for the first time in decades, students from Wilcox County, Georgia, attended a school-sponsored prom that was open to all students rather than a private, racially segregated prom.
