The men were spotted on multiple ferries and ferry routes, Carr said. The FBI wants to question the men to determine if their behavior was harmless or whether they were surveilling the ferries and ferry terminals for nefarious purposes. Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. law enforcement has emphasized the need for the public to report suspicious behavior. The photos were shown to police and ferry workers, but no one could identify the men, so authorities called on the public for help. Although the initial FBI news release on the men did not discuss their possible ethnicity, "We just want to ensure that there is just one standard being implemented for suspicious behavior for both people who appear to be Middle Eastern and those who appear not to be Middle Eastern," said Naseem Tuffaha of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.
