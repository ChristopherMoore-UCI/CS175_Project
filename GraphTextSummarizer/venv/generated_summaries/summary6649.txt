Teens can relate to the way the characters connect through music, Angie Manfredi, former Morris Award committee member and head of youth services for the Los Alamos County Library System in New Mexico, told CNN. "It's a stunning, first-person narrative from this character with a crazy life," Teri Lesesne, a professor and former Morris Award committee chairwoman, told CNN. While many recognize the Newbery and Caldecott awards for the year's best children's books, the seventh annual Morris Award celebrates debut books published in 2014 by promising first-time authors in young adult literature. Quintero, a community college teacher from the Inland Empire of Southern California, wanted to reinforce that young women should feel empowered to make their own life choices, rather than simply live up to societal expectations based on gender or patriarchy: "There is not just one true experience for everyone -- not as an American, not as a woman, not as a Mexican-American, and I felt like this was a story that needed to be told," Quintero told CNN. "The Morris Award committee wants a distinct voice that takes readers to new places," said Chris Shoemaker, president of the Young Adult Library Services Association.
