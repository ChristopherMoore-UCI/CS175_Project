Pentagon spokesman George Little said Tuesday that Obama has not made a decision on U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan beyond 2014. The refusal by the Iraqi government to extend legal protections for U.S. troops after the end of the war in Iraq was a major reason the United States left the country with no residual military training force. Karzai has said he would like for U.S. troops to remain after the end of the NATO mission. -- President Barack Obama is seriously considering withdrawing all U.S. troops from Afghanistan in 2014, a senior administration official told CNN. But he also has been highly critical of the troops over the years, following incidents in which U.S. forces have killed civilians.
