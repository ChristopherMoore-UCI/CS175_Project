-- A former commander of the elite Blue Angels is being investigated by the Navy for allegations that he tolerated a work environment that violated military policies against sexual harassment, the Navy said in a news release Wednesday. "All Navy leaders, whether assigned to a highly visible unit like the 'Blues,' or to our installations, squadrons, ships and submarines, are held to the highest standards," said Vice Adm. David Buss, commander of the Naval Air Forces. The McWherter investigation comes to light about a month after a former top U.S. commander in Afghanistan was ordered to pay thousands of dollars but avoided prison time in a case that put a spotlight on the military's handling of sexual misconduct among troops. The most recent Pentagon report on sexual assaults showed that there were estimated to be 26,000 incidents of assault and unwanted sexual contact in 2012, and just over 10% of those were reported. The Washington Post first reported McWherter's reassignment Wednesday.
