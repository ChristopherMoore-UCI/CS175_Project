The 23-year-old rapper, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested after a Los Angeles police officer pulled over a car in which he was a passenger, police spokeswoman Rosario Herrera told CNN. The local district attorney in Carroll County, Georgia, declined to prosecute the case because federal prosecutors took it over, according to a spokesman for the district attorney. Soulja Boy was booked into a San Fernando Valley jail, but freed after posting a $35,000 bond Wednesday afternoon, according to jail records. Hip-hop artist Soulja Boy faces a felony weapons charge after police say he was carrying a loaded gun in Los Angeles Wednesday. He was arrested on felony weapons and drug charges during a traffic stop on a Georgia interstate in October 2011.
