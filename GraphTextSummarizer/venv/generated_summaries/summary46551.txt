In the 1970s, Mitchell was a principal in Hi Records and owned Royal Studios, where musicians such as drummers Al Jackson and Howard Grimes and guitarist Teenie Hodges plied their trade. -- Willie Mitchell, the Memphis producer whose percussive, string-and-horn-tinged R&B sound shaped '70s hits by such artists as Al Green and Ann Peebles, died Tuesday. Despite being in and out of the hospital, Mitchell would write horn and string arrangements one day and record them the next, Lawrence Mitchell said. Memphis named the street in front of Royal Studios for Mitchell in 2004. Green has often talked about how important Mitchell was to his sound, working him until his voice was just so -- a difference that can be heard on his pre-Mitchell songs, such as "Back Up Train." Mitchell also helmed Peebles' "I Can't Stand the Rain" and O.V. Wright's "The Ace of Spades."
