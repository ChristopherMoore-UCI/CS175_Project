But Ethan turned 6 on Wednesday after surviving an unimaginable ordeal, and Midland City, Alabama, wanted to make sure it was a birthday worth remembering. The city had planned a vigil at Napier Field Town Hall on Tuesday night, but after Ethan was rescued it turned into a celebration. Knowing Dykes had already shot and killed bus driver Charles Poland, and dragged the boy into the underground bunker, authorities feverishly tried to negotiate with him. The assault Monday afternoon came from the top of the bunker, a law enforcement source said, and left Dykes with multiple gunshot wounds. More than 1,200 other cards came in from across the nation, said Philip Parker, principal of Midland City Elementary.
