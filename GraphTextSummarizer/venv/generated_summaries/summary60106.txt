Lisa DeFluri and Steve Twomey traded a bridal gown and tuxedo for Oregon jerseys adorned with "8," the number worn by the Ducks' 2014 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Marcus Mariota.

"We're not traditional, we love football and love the Ducks," Lisa told CNN. Two obsessed Oregon Ducks football fans plunged into the end zone of holy matrimony in front of the Rose Bowl Thursday morning.
