Since December, eight sets of human remains have been found in Suffolk County, just to the east of Nassau County and roughly five miles from the sites of Monday's discoveries. "Collectively, we want to bring to justice this animal who has obviously taken the lives of a number of people," said Nassau County Executive Ed Mangano on Monday. But police have said that the bodies discovered earlier were in various stages of decomposition, including at least one that could have been there for as long as two years, according to Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. Authorities would not describe what type of remains were found on Monday morning, and Smith did not detail the condition of the skull found in the afternoon. These discoveries come on the first day that authorities probing the deaths of several young women searched for evidence in and around Nassau County.
