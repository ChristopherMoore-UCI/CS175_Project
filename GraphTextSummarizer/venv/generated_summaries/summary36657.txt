Since 2001 Narahashi has been using an all-weather film camera to take the series of photos that were first grouped under the title "Half Awake and Half Asleep in the Water." Using an all-weather film camera she has traveled across Japan in all seasons, wearing a bathing suit in summer or fishing waders in winter months, and sometime taking to a boat or canoe to capture the shots. "(In Japan) nature exists within reach of people," she said. "You'll find old and new buildings or billboards and other artificial things randomly mixed along with nature. But as I progressed, I felt this framework is not necessary for me, so I shoot both in Japan and other places. "After much trial and error, I realized that it was better to give a sense of the water in the foreground, and gradually I took more photographs positioned as though the lens was put partially in the water," Narahashi told CNN via email.
