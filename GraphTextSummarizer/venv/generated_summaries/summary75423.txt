As Udall (D-Colo.) delivered a line on the issue in his stump speech Sunday during the final hours of a tight campaign against Republican challenger Cory Gardner, a heckler interrupted by shouting: "That's not the only thing you stand for! He said on Monday, Udall was at a press conference with several other top Colorado Democratic officials on immigration reform. He's far from the first person to criticize Udall's campaign for its focus on the issue -- largely targeting Gardner's previous support (he reversed his stance this year) for a "personhood" measure that would have had the effect of outlawing abortion.
