When he did, his victim was a correctional officer making his rounds, according to Kankakee County Sheriff Timothy Bukowski. And then when the opportunity arose, he attacked the officer," Bukowski said, noting that Taylor "attacked from the side" around 3 a.m. "Beat him, choked him." That officer is now in an intensive care unit at St. Mary's Hospital in Kankakee, Bukowski said. "We think that because he had the officer's uniform on," the sheriff explained, "that's how he was able to effectively escape." Taylor walked out the door and into the detention center's parking lot, where, authorities said, he clicked the correctional officer's key fob to find the Chevy Equinox. After the verdict was read, Taylor sat down, looked back, then got up and ran, according to The Daily Journal in Kankakee.
