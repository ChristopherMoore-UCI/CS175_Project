"When you have gone into and potentially soiled or contaminated gloves or masks or other things, to remove those without any risk of any contaminated material touching you and being then on your clothes or face or skin and leading to an infection is critically important and not easy to do right," Frieden said. Sometimes the situation calls for more precautions, such as wearing disposable shoe covers, leg covers and two layers of gloves. CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said gear removal is a "major potential area for risk." Finally, after washing their hands, health care workers should put on gloves over the sleeves' cuffs. So what's the protocol for health care workers if they suspect a patient has the virus that has already killed more than 4,000 people in West Africa?
