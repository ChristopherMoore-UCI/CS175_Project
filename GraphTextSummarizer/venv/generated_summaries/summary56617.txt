Congress must act to legalize cellphone unlocking substantively, but then it must legalize other technologies that have been banned without explanation. I teamed up with Sina Khanifar, an entrepreneur whose company had been shut down for unlocking phones, and we led an advocacy effort for a White House petition. Currently, there is an exception for personal jailbreaking (allowing individuals to install unapproved applications by altering the phone's operating system), but developing, selling, trafficking or discussing the underlying technology is still illegal and there are no personal exceptions for tablets or other devices. It is unconscionable that persons who are deaf and blind are considered felons punishable by up to five years in prison and a $500,000 fine for using technology that they may need to access media. In this case, the government has banned broad categories of technologies -- and broad categories of uses -- without any clear governmental interest.
