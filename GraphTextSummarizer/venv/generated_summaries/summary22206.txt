Shooting of Florida teen is no Trayvon Martin case, attorney says CNN's John Branch and InSession's Aletse Mellado contributed to this report. "It's about loud music and it's also about anger, about having a concealed weapon in your car, knowing you have it and feel bold enough to use it because you're being shielded in the state of Florida," Jordan Davis' father, Ron Davis, told CNN. The case against Dunn, who has been jailed without bond since the November 26 shooting at the Jacksonville, Florida, gas station, has been compared to the "stand your ground" case in which George Zimmerman is charged with killing Trayvon Martin. "There are no comparisons to the Trayvon Martin situation," said Robin Lemonidis, Dunn's attorney. Michael Dunn, 45, entered his plea during a hearing Monday morning at the Duval County, Florida, jail.
