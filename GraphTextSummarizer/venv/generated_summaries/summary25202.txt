Spain's spy agency chief said Tuesday a suspected double agent had been arrested who revealed the names of Spanish spies and other state secrets to a foreign nation. Flores, a Spanish Civil Guard assigned to spy agency headquarters for internal matters, had been a suspect under surveillance by Spanish intelligence since July 2005, said Saiz. Saiz, at a news conference, refused to publicly identify the recipient country, but Spain's SER Radio, said it was Russia, citing unnamed sources. The suspect allegedly revealed the names of dozens of Spanish spies, possibly including the seven Spanish spies killed in an ambush south of Baghdad in November 2003, Saiz said. Saiz spoke at a rare news conference in Madrid, which some Spanish media said was the first ever offered by Spain's intelligence chief.
