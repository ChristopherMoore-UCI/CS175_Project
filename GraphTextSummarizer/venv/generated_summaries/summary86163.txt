The Italian coast guard told CNN a "real disaster" was avoided when authorities boarded the Blue Sky M after the crew apparently jumped ship. Italian coast guard commander Filippo Marini said the vessel was cruising on autopilot toward the rocky Italian coast at 6 nautical miles per hour. From what we know, the ship, which flies the flag of Sierra Leone, would have hundreds of migrants on board," the Italian air force said in a statement. Italian authorities responded late Thursday to a ship without any crew that was carrying 450 migrants, that country's coast guard said. The migrants launched an SOS, said Floriana Segreto, a spokeswoman for the Italian coast guard.
