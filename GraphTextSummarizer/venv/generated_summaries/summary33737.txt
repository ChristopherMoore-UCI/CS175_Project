The CDC said several policy initiatives have been proven to cut down on crash injuries and deaths, including graduated driver licensing programs, which allow new teen drivers to get road experience in low-risk situations. This study highlights the magnitude of the problem of crash-related injuries from a cost perspective, and the numbers are staggering," Dr. Grant Baldwin, the director of the CDC's Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said in a press release. The CDC says strong graduated driver licensing laws have been associated with up to 40 percent decreases in crashes among 16-year-old drivers. Other CDC-recommended policies include child safety seat education, seat belt laws and enforcement, sobriety checkpoints, and motorcycle and bicycle helmet laws. That includes $3.6 billion annually toward injuries to children.
