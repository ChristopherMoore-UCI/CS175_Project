Kitchens don't work like other rooms, say decorators, and it's not always obvious how to decorate them. " Kitchens take a beating, and countertops, floors and appliances need to be strong enough to stand the test of countless dinners and holiday feasts. "The decor feature that stands out the most in our kitchen, and I would have to say in most kitchens, are the countertops. "Sometimes people hesitate using glass doors on cabinets because they want to hide all their mess or they don't know how to beautifully style them with just simple stemware," said decorator Rina Norwood of Cornelius, North Carolina. Instead of four blank walls to adorn, there are cabinet doors, appliances and counter tops, which can leave you feeling a little boxed in.
