Map: World weighs in on U.S. election "We can't blame the U.S. for the violence in Mexico," says Anabel Hernandez, an investigative journalist who has put her life on the line writing about Mexico's drug lords. "That's exactly the problem," says Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard, from the left-of-center Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). Largely irrelevant to most Mexicans, except for Eduardo Cruz, a Mexico City taxi driver who put it this way: "It doesn't matter who wins the U.S. elections, they just better send the loser to sort things out here!" -- "Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States," is something I heard a lot growing up in Mexico in the 1980s. Because it is hard to understand how we got here, I think back to the time when I was a child here -- back then, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, dominated Mexico -- and miles of walls across the country had the PRI logo painted in Mexico's flag colors of green, white and red.
