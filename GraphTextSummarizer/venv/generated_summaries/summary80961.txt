-- While reaching out to supporters through one of the latest high-tech means, President Obama expanded his social media experience by holding a Google+ video chat room interview Monday afternoon. In an election year, it's probably not good politics to talk about what you look forward to doing after your time in the White House, but that's exactly what President Obama did when asked about the frustrations of living in the security bubble. "I don't know if any of this stuff affects an election, but I know that it makes our country stronger that you can make fun of the president -- or anybody -- and everybody can get a laugh," President Obama said. But we've still got a lot more to do," President Obama said. We've created 3 million jobs over 22 months, and we saw the largest boost in manufacturing jobs that we've seen since the '90s.
