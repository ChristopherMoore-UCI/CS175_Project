Because they are voluntary, most workers do not even have a retirement account plan, which means many middle-class and upper-middle-class workers will only have Social Security to rely on for retirement. Workers at IBM aren't marching to the picket line like Walmart workers and longshoreman who protest pay and working conditions, but you just never know. What is there to stop companies from ending retirement accounts altogether? I don't see anything on the horizon that will encourage companies to maintain or improve retirement programs at the workplace. Moreover, few IBM workers are going to voluntarily leave before December, which means projects can be planned better and employees can be asked to do more.
