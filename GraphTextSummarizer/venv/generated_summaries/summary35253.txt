-- It wasn't long after the Illinois state Senate voted unanimously to remove Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich from office that Lt. Gov. Patrick Quinn put his hand on a Bible and took the oath of office to replace him. He served a term as Illinois state treasurer from 1991 to 1995, leaving office after an unsuccessful campaign for secretary of state in 1994. "The citizens of Illinois can be extremely proud of our elected representatives in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, the senators who today carried out their responsibilities with serious purpose and due process. New Gov. Patrick Quinn says he hopes "to restore the faith of the people of Illinois. Early to bed, early to rise, organize, organize, organize and that's what we've got to do for Illinois for everyday people.
