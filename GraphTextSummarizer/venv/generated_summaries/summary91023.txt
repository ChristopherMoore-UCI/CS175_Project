A lawmaker, tribal leader and 10-year-old child were killed, but President Hamid Karzai escaped unhurt, according to an official and a statement from Karzai's office. The Taliban also claimed its fighters got within 30 yards of the stand where Karzai and other dignitaries were standing. Soon, people were scrambling from their seats while a stream of Afghan soldiers ran by, away from the sound of gunfire. Small arms fire erupted as a military band played the Afghan national anthem and as soldiers fired a 21-gun salute with artillery rounds. The Health Ministry official said lawmaker Fazel Rahman Samkanai died from injuries sustained in the attack.
