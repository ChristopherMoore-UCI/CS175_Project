Last year's Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South African was sixth, six shots back, while defending champion Matteo Manassero and former world number one Martin Kaymer tied for seventh at the $2.5 million tournament co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours. Gallacher, looking for his second European Tour win, was in touch until the back nine where his South African opponent birdied the 13th and 16th to pull clear. His 17-under total of 271 gave him his fifth European Tour win and for Oosthuizen acted as the perfect tonic after his Masters heartbreak. -- Just a week after losing to Bubba Watson in a playoff at the U.S. Masters, Louis Oosthuizen bounced back with a three-shot victory in the Malaysian Open Sunday. "It was a long journey to get here and I have to be honest and say that I didn't expect to play this well because of the tiredness," he told the official European Tour website.
