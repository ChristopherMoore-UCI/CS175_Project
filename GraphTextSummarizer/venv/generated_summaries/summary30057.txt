The Duchess of Cambridge's ivory duchess satin and lace wedding shoes and her silk-tulle veil are also on show at the palace, in central London, presented by the Royal Collection -- a trust which looks after royal art, jewellery and valuables for the nation. The ivory and white satin gown and nine-foot train, designed by Sarah Burton for the Alexander McQueen fashion house, is on display at Buckingham Palace from Friday to October 3, as part of the palace's annual summer opening. And her bridal bouquet -- which included lily of the valley, Sweet William, hyacinth, myrtle and ivy -- has been recreated from artificial flowers for the display. The ensemble prompted the prince to say "you look beautiful," as his bride arrived at the altar on the arm of her father Michael on April 29. Now, almost three months later, there's a chance for royal wedding fans to take a closer look.
