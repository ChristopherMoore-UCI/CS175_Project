Los Angeles Opera Music Director James Conlon briefly peeks into the dressing room to wish young Meo good luck. " "He was always making goofy noises all the time, from the time he was a toddler," says Michael's mother, Trudy Meo. Meo says she isn't sure where Michael came by his musical talent. As soon as his role in "The Turn of the Screw" ends in Los Angeles, he's off to New York and a New York City Opera production of "SÃ©ance on a Wet Afternoon." And Michael is already thinking about a whole new world of roles he could sing as an adult.
