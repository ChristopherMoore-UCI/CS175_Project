-- A hacker's leak of nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence and other female celebrities is now a case for the FBI. The Los Angeles office of the FBI successfully investigated another hacker who stole nude photos, scripts and personal information from the e-mail accounts of entertainers including Scarlett Johansson, Mila Kunis and Christina Aguilera in 2011. Apple confirmed to CNN Monday that it is looking into reports that its popular iCloud online data backup service may have been compromised by the hackers. Lawrence's publicist said "authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence." "We intend to pursue anyone disseminating or duplicating these illegally obtained images to the fullest extent possible," attorney Lawrence Shire said.
