Attorneys act to conceal names in Zumba sex case According to Strong's sentencing memo, Wright would not engage in a prostitution session unless Strong had "prior knowledge of the session and was actively watching via the Skype connection. Alexis Wright, 29, walked out of the Maine jail at 8 a.m. Saturday after serving nearly six months of a ten-month term for a prostitution case that last year rocked the sleepy New England town of Kennebunk. Strong was found guilty of promotion of prostitution and conspiracy to promote prostitution in March. Court documents showed that Wright videotaped intimate encounters with some of her customers in three locations -- including her store-front Zumba exercise studio -- and would send the footage to her business partner, Mark Strong. In addition to jail time, Wright was ordered to pay $57,000 in restitution and $1,000 in fines.
