" Beaten, tortured After Foley's death, details slowly emerged of the experiences he endured after his abduction while he was on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. French journalist Nicolas Henin, who was taken hostage in June 2013 with French photographer Pierre Torres, told CNN that he also had been held with Foley in northern Syria before his release this year -- and that Foley "had to endure more because he was American. It emerged after Foley's death that U.S. special operations units were sent into Syria this summer to rescue him and other hostages, but their mission proved unsuccessful. And, as with the execution of journalist James Foley before him, ISIS ended its video -- titled "A second message to America" -- with a threat to another Western hostage, this time a Briton. With the beheading of a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff, militant group ISIS delivered another brutal message to the Western world.
