The agency rejected the audit's calls for mandatory and full reporting and cited a 2009 report that concluded "the current level of voluntary strike reporting is sufficient for determining national aircraft strike trends, determining the hazard level of wildlife species involved in aircraft strikes, and for providing a scientific foundation for FAA policies and guidance regarding the mitigation of risk from wildlife strikes. "While wildlife strikes have increased ... the percentage of significant strikes, in which multiple strikes occur simultaneously or in which an air carrier experiences a damaging collisions has decreased markedly, from 20% of total reported strikes in 1990, to 9% in 2010. Overall, only about 21% of strikes in logs at the airports examined were reported to the FAA. "Without full reporting and complete data on wildlife strikes, it is difficult to fully analyze the magnitude of safety issues, the nature of the problems, and the economic cost of wildlife strikes," the report found. Of the 35 airports auditors looked at with FAA wildlife hazard assessment plans, 27 did not comply with at least one requirement despite FAA inspection documents showing they did. Airlines shrink legroom in coach "It is imperative that FAA improve its management processes by improving oversight and enforcement of program regulations, making strike reporting mandatory, establishing performance metrics, and strengthening coordination with other governmental agencies," the audit concluded.
