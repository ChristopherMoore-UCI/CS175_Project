Gorilla are the last of the genus of living great apes (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans) to have their DNA decoded, offering new perspectives on their evolution and biology. Researchers found that genes relating to sensory perception, hearing and brain development showed "accelerated evolution" in all three, but particularly in humans and gorillas. The majority are found in Cameroon, Central African Republic, west Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and Angola. "It could have been some climatic change that separated humans in the east of Africa from chimpanzees in the forest -- that's an idea some have floated.
