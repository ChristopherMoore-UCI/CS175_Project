" "Girls Meets World" stars Rowan Blanchard as 12-year-old Riley Matthews, the older of Cory and Topanga's two kids. "I have a feeling it was Cory who was really ready to start a family and that was something they negotiated." Savage and Fishel both confess they did not re-watch the series to get back into character, hoping to craft new versions of the pair we first met as seventh grade students. For now, Cory and Topanga are the only returning characters, but that doesn't mean we won't see old friends over the course of the season. Riley's crush on new school transfer Lucas is noticeably similar to the dynamic of Cory and Topanga. From 1993-2000, the names Cory, Topanga, Shawn, Eric, and Feeny were synonymous with Friday night, and 14 years since Mr. Feeny uttered the words "class dismissed" on the series finale, nostalgia-addicts still miss the ABC sitcom.
