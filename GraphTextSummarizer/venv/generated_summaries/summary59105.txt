When you are suffering from alcohol poisoning, your liver can't keep up with the amount of alcohol in your body. Alcohol poisoning is when a person consumes a toxic amount of alcohol, usually after a binge of drinking. In what the CDC said was a surprise, it found that white men between the ages of 35 and 64 are dying most often from alcohol poisoning. While college students get a bad rap for binge drinking, the study found it's not typically college age people who die from drinking too much. By the end of today, an average of six people will have died from alcohol poisoning, and it's a "surprising group" that's dying more than any other, according to new research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
