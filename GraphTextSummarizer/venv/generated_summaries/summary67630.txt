Aaron Sofer was reported missing on Friday by a friend who he was hiking with in the Jerusalem Forest, Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN. Republican Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said the U.S. Department of State was helping Israeli authorities in the search for Sofer. Sofer's disappearance comes two months after what Israeli authorities have called the revenge killing of Palestinian teen Mohammed Abu Khedair, 16. "There are concerns, as we all know, about the possibility of abduction," Smith said, according to CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey. They can't find anything." Binyomin Isseeman, Sofer's rabbi in Lakewood, called the missing man a "very normal, a very healthy boy." "His mind is clear, no problems at all," Isseeman said to CNN affiliate WCBS reported.
