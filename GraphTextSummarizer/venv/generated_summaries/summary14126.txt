Watch Kerry explain why he's picking Obama Â» The endorsement could be seen as a blow to former Sen. John Edwards, who was Kerry's running mate in the 2004 election. " "Barack Obama isn't just going to break the mold," said Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate four years ago. Kerry said he was stirred by the way Obama "eloquently reminded us of the fact that our true genius is faith in simple dreams and insistence on small miracles." A Kerry spokesman said Obama will be sending out a note to Kerry's e-mail list, which was created during the 2004 run and numbers 3 million.
