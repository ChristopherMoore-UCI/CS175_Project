Alexandra Belayeva, left, and Zhenya Iordanskaya visit the Michael Jackson memorial in Moscow. On a rainy, cold day in Moscow, Iordanskaya and Belayeva say they still cry thinking that Jackson is no longer on Earth. And I still can't believe it." Iordanskaya was standing in the rain Sunday with her friend Alexandra Belayeva, 20, looking at the shrine Jackson's fans have erected along the fence in front of the Embassy. Young Russian fans, some of whom don't even speak English, bring homemade signs, pictures and drawings of Jackson, Russian religious icons, candles, teddy bears -- all signs of how much they loved the singer. It was such a shame that people put him down so much." Belayeva says she's still in shock over Jackson's death at his California home on June 25.
