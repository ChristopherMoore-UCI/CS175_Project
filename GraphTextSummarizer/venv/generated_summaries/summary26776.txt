-- The pilot or pilots aboard an unresponsive plane that flew from the United States over the Caribbean Sea on Friday may have been stricken by cerebral hypoxia -- a fancy term for when your brain is deprived of oxygen. Cerebral hypoxia can happen to pilots if they reach too high of an altitude or if there is a loss in cabin pressure. The human body has limited ability to function above 10,000 feet without additional oxygen. When a brain goes without oxygen for too long, the part of the brain that helps with breathing can stop working and can keep you from breathing. There is a progressive reduction of oxygen per breath the higher the altitude.
