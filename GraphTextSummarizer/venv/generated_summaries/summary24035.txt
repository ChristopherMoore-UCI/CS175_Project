Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas had a different take, telling "Fox News Sunday" that it is up to Obama to change, not Republicans. They're going to speak up on November 2nd." Cornyn's Republican colleague, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, agreed on the CBS program "Face the Nation" that Obama and Democratic leaders "over-reached" in the first two years, which he said rattled the American people. He made no mention of major issues such as immigration reform and energy reform, which Obama pushed strongly in his first two years. While Obama and some Democrats and Republicans say they hope for better relations after the election, they express different views of what that would mean. "If the president's going to maintain his ideological stance and try to jam things through to support the left in America, when we're still a center-right country, then we're going to say 'no,' " Cornyn said, adding that Republicans will work with Obama on issues such as job creation, spending cuts and reducing the national debt.
