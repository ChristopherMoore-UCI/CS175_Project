The Philadelphia-born Bryant, who speaks fluent Italian and Spanish, grew up supporting Serie A giants AC Milan, with his favorite player being former Dutch striker Marco van Basten. CNN -- Basketball star Kobe Bryant has revealed his love of soccer while doing charity work in South Africa during the 2010 World Cup. With the World Cup well under way in South Africa, Bryant took time out to visit a new football center in Soweto during his first visit to the continent. South Africa has the world's largest HIV-positive population and so, more importantly, the program will also give the children access to a HIV/AIDS education which involves counseling and testing. The center provides a football life skills program to 20,000 children in South Africa each year, offering them the chance to develop their talent.
