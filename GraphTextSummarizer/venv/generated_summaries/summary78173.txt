Attempts to innovate and open Muslim Brotherhood media and communications have met with approval from the under-40 generation as well as growing audiences, but have been censured by elders, according to a  source familiar with the situation, who asked not to be named. Political scientist Riham Bahi described feeling like an "alien in my own country" when it was under Muslim Brotherhood control. When he joined his large family for the first Iftar (evening meal) of Ramadan in July,  filmmaker and photographer Mohamed Radwan did not expect to find himself explaining to a hostile group why he had helped organize the sit-in at the Culture Ministry in Cairo and had marched on June 30 to oust Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy. This steady drumbeat of media attacks on both the "terrorist" Muslim Brotherhood camps and on anyone who questions their eradication has produced a climate of dehumanization, reflected in the widespread acceptance of the military regime's violent attack. While "any form of violence is regrettable," he believes that, with Muslim Brotherhood  strongholds  disbanded,  Egypt will have reached a "new phase" and will be able to move forward positively in the future.
