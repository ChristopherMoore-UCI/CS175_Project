The Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast and have been under British rule since 1833. But potential revenues from oil and gas reignited a long-running dispute between London and Buenos Aires over ownership of the Falklands. The island's government, representing a population of around 2,500, remains committed to British sovereignty and the UK maintains a military presence on the islands. Last month, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner signed a decree requiring all ships navigating from Argentina to the islands to carry a government permit. -- The value of shares in a British company drilling for oil off the Falkand islands halved Monday, after it revealed the existing supply may not be commercially viable.
