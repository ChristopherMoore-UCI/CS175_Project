In the years between the 1963 March on Washington and 1993, the AIDS epidemic and societal changes propelled by the African-American and women's civil rights movements helped launch LGBT from nascent to engaged activism. Jews were among the early white supporters of civil rights. In the late 1980s, I came out as a gay man and became increasingly involved in LGBT civil rights. While Dr. King is recognized today as America's preeminent civil rights leader, his numerous co-organizers also spoke that day. When Dr. King began "I Have a Dream," I was struck as if by lightning.
