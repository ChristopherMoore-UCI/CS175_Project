Slap and tickle Sources say the president will point out bipartisan progress on immigration reform but he'll take it to the GOP on debt and tax reform. So, will he seize the opportunity to answer his critics and respond to his base on issues including: U.S. use of unmanned drones, the legal rationale for targeting Americans, U.S. policy in Syria, Iran's nuclear program, and security of U.S. diplomatic posts? Granted, the Monroe Doctrine and the Four Freedoms were both laid out in State of the Unions, but in general they tend to be laundry lists for party policy wishes. What he doesn't say An average of 44 million people have watched Obama deliver previous State of the Union addresses. Nothing personal, Mr. President, but State of the Union addresses are notoriously forgotten.
