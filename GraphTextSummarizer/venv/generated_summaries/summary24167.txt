Then again, I also remember what Grey Cloud said when I asked him why Native American Heritage Month barely gets a mention compared with, say, Black History Month or National Hispanic Heritage Month. If Native American Heritage Day fell on November 5, for example, then students would be in the classroom and teachers could offer lessons about the Native American today. Happy Native American Heritage Month, folks. If we're going to choose a day for Native American Heritage Day when school is out, then how about Thanksgiving Day itself? Sadly, I can't help but worry that this column will be the only thing that many people will read about Native American Heritage Month.
