Tom McAndrew of the Pennsylvania State Police, who along with Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Brendan O'Malley, was instrumental in clearing the path for Kimmerle's team to exhume Curry's remains, she said, "It was a little bit of a shock. " McAndrew has been in contact with two of Curry's distant cousins, and while they weren't familiar with Curry or his death before Kimmerle's team began investigating, they've done what they could to advance the investigation, the police corporal said. Layers of pieces of wood," said anthropologist Erin Kimmerle, explaining what she and her team found in the casket. A dubious legacy That bodies lay there was never a secret -- 31 rusty, white crosses marked the resting places of victims who died from a dormitory fire, influenza, pneumonia and other causes -- but Kimmerle's team has found a total of 55 bodies there so far. Kimmerle had hoped, of course, that Curry's remains would unravel some of the mystery surrounding his death.
