The gunman, described as a 49-year-old man, fired six shots at police before being taken into custody, said a national police officer who was not authorized to speak to the media. Francesco Puglisi, a journalist for Il Tempo newspaper, heard the shots from his office, then saw police tackle the man. He ran to the scene and said the face-down suspect appeared calm and was complying with police. The agency also reported that prosecutor Pierfilippo Laviani said the shooter had confessed and was hoping to shoot politicians but found none so he struck out at police. On Saturday, Letta, a center-left politician, accepted a mandate to form a government from President Giorgio Napolitano.
