" Pirelli will begin testing this week in a Toyota TF109 car from last season, with Bridgestone stepping aside at the end of 2010. The 33-year-old German had driven in F1 for a decade but was left without a seat when BMW ended its association with the Sauber team at the end of last season. Nick Heidfeld has left his role as reserve driver at Mercedes to become a tester for Pirelli ahead of the Italian company's return to Formula One as the sport's sole tire supplier next year. The Milan-based company has not been involved in F1 since 1991, but has landed a three-year contract to provide all teams with tires to go with its exclusive deals with motorcycling's World Superbike and British Superbike categories. "It would be great to see Nick in a competitive car in next year's world championship and I am sure his leading role in the new tire development, in addition to his skills, puts him in a good position for the remaining seats in 2011," Haug said.
