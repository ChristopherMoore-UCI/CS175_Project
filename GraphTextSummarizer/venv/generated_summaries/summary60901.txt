As head of the Junior Ambassadors Program for Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Max has dedicated much of his young life to raising awareness and funds for other kids in need. Shaun White's parents said go for it" It's been seven months since Max's last surgery -- an open heart pulmonary valve replacement -- and he has been cleared for all activities by his doctors. His mom watched White compete in the Olympics the same year Max was first diagnosed, and after hearing from doctors about the limitations her son would face, she says she found hope in White, who has the same heart defect. "We feel a tremendous responsibility to make sure the doors stay open for us and families that follow us and to do our part," Jennifer Page says. His parents, Jennifer and Buck Page, said they felt grateful to the families who came before them and others who donated to keep the Los Angeles hospital and neonatal intensive care unit open.
