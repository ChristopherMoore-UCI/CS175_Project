Klout scores are derived from social networks -- mostly Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus -- to measure how many people you influence, how much you influence them and the relative power of your network. CNN sat down recently with Klout co-founder and CEO Joe Fernandez to discuss why web users should know their Klout score, how brands are capitalizing on rewarding key influencers, the company's first acquisition and why burritos helped shape the initial idea behind Klout. One of my favorite uses are by hotel properties that are now using Klout scores to upgrade the rooms of guests during check-in as they access their online influence rating. We predicted the New England Patriots would win the Super Bowl because many of their players had higher Klout scores. Last year Klout users reacted rather loudly to some pretty significant changes to the service.
