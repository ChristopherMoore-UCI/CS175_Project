-- President Obama met Wednesday with Haitian President Rene Preval to discuss relief, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Haiti. More than half of all United States households have made private contributions to Haitian relief, Clinton said. Clinton said she assured Preval "that the United States would work with the international community to hold elections as soon as appropriate. Much of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, was destroyed, and more than 217,000 people were killed, according to the latest figures from international relief organizations. A continuing desperate need for food, medicine and shelter will be exacerbated by the onset of Haiti's spring rain season, he said.
