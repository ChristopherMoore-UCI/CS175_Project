The unsolved case inspired the 2007 film "Zodiac," starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo. A Louisiana man claims in a new book that his biological father was the notorious Zodiac Killer of northern California, who's still sought by authorities, publisher HarperCollins said Tuesday. Stewart was born in New Orleans and abandoned as a newborn in a stairwell of Baton Rouge apartment building. The Zodiac serial killer is believed to have killed five people in 1968-69 and gained notoriety by writing several letters to police boasting of the slayings, with swatches of bloody clothing as proof of his claims. HarperCollins publicist Tina Andreadis told New York Magazine that "Stewart's father had a criminal record in San Francisco ('forgeries, bad checks'), and there was a strong resemblance between his father's mug shot and the police sketch," the magazine said.
