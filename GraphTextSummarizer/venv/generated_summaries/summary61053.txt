NASA deployed live webcams on the International Space Station in March, and UFO enthusiasts monitoring their live feeds online have nabbed unidentified flying objects scooting through Earth's orbit. And the website has page after page of alleged photographic signs of advanced alien life on Mars that it claims happened to turn up in pictures shot by NASA Mars rovers. Trawling NASA images for proof of intergalactic visitors to our solar system has gone on since NASA started snapping the images decades ago. Students designed some of the hardware components in the overall system in a project with NASA called HUNCH, or High Schools United with NASA to Create Hardware. NASA is separately experimenting with using a laser beam to transfer data to Earth.
