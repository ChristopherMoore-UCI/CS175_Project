When McCain turned to Palin, he did so in an effort to overcome many of his perceived weaknesses against candidate Obama -- his inability to attract the base of his party, fears that he would appear to look like the "older" candidate in the race, as well as the concern that he was a less charismatic candidate in the eyes of the media. Now candidates think nationally, focusing on how a vice presidential choice will complement their national campaign and strengthen positive perceptions that voters have. When it comes to vice presidential candidates, less attention is better. A second lesson is that candidates must make sure that their running mate can handle the national spotlight in the modern media age. And despite all the criticism that our current politics are shallow, the fact is that competence can matter very much when candidates stand before the media.
