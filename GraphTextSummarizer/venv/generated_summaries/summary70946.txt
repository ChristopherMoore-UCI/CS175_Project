Years later, when it realized Ewelina had never achieved legal status, ICE ordered her to return to Poland to apply for legal U.S. residency through the U.S. Embassy there. "This is very typical of a lot of family immigration cases, and it creates a lot of family separation," Odom said. Records show baby Ewelina was brought into the United States illegally in the summer of 2000, a few months after her mother arrived on a visitor visa. "They seem to be willing to find a favorable solution to this matter," said Ewelina's attorney, Maria Odom of Atlanta. The government gave Ewelina until July 23 to leave the country voluntarily; after that date, she would be deported and ineligible to return to the United States for 10 years, Odom said.
