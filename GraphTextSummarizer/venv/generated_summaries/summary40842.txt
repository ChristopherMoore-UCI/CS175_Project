If we are to fix Washington, the city needs more figures like Dirksen, FDR, and Reagan, individuals who love the craft of politics and the art of making deals. Though he was not a champion of civil rights, Dirksen emerged as a towering figure on Capitol Hill as a result of this and other deals. On the other side of the aisle, there is former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, the front-runner who Republicans love to hate. There seems to be no room any more for politicians like Sen. Everett Dirksen. As a result, he was able to make bold moves to make legislative deals even when they defied some of the core ideals of his party.
