Rudd is the latest in a long line of Aussie Prime Ministers who have indulged their love of cricket. As his nation battles to win the third Test against England, and keep the five-match series alive, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has left the game's officials in no doubt as to his disgust. With the match only a few hours old, Aussie batsman Usman Khawaja was given out caught behind by umpire Tony Hill, a call he instantly reviewed. Rudd, who ousted Julia Gillard in a leadership election to become Prime Minister for a second time in June, was so incensed he took to Twitter to voice his displeasure to over 1.3 million followers. John Howard, who served between 1996 and 2007, was a regular visitor to Test matches involving his country at home and abroad.
