The idea is that tourists will be able to spend an entire day on the Richard III tour. The area between the grave site and visitor center -- housed in an old school -- and the cathedral, where the much-tested remains will be reinterred is being redeveloped, with new gardens linking the two, and part of the cathedral itself is being remodeled to make way for the new royal tomb. The museum, which opened with much fanfare recently, tells the story of the "three Ds" of Richard III: his dynasty, explaining the complex family history which led to the bloody Wars of the Roses; his death, at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, defeated by Henry Tudor and later flung into an unmarked grave; and finally, the discovery of his remains. The museum shows how the excavation was carried out, and explains the complicated series of tests carried out to prove "beyond reasonable doubt" that the remains were indeed Richard III's. With the announcement that Richard III's long-lost remains -- curved spine and all -- are to be buried at Leicester Cathedral on March 26, 2015, the UK city is set for another spike in tourist numbers driven by the dead monarch.
