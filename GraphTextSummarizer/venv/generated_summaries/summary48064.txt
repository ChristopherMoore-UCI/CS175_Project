Tuesday night, look to see who blames whom for Democratic losses, and keep an especially sharp eye on pro-growth, pro-business Democrats and big Democratic contributors. President Obama has deluded himself that he is not a plague upon Democratic candidates but Tuesday evening, two East Coast states may set him straight. Any cracks in these elemental building blocks of the Obama coalition would not augur well for Democratic strategy, long term. Republicans have been split between establishment types, libertarians, neo-isolationists, tea party supporters, social issue conservatives and a small group that fears trigonometry. With a bad night in these states, Jimmy Carter may have a better chance of getting invited to speak at the 2016 Democratic convention than Barack Obama.
