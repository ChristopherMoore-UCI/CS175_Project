This southern California city is home to the world's largest lemon (the 10-foot-long fiberglass behemoth sits in Lemon Grove, a small town in metro San Diego) and also boasts the world's largest collection of memorabilia from the late Dr. Seuss, who was a longtime resident of the city's La Jolla community. The $2-an-hour chicken-suit gig beat the pay he made as a dishwasher, and Giannoulas, angling to score free admission to baseball games, talked his way into donning the costume again at Padres games. A comedian in a chicken suit turned folk hero Ted Giannoulas, the man behind the famously irreverent San Diego Chicken, was named by The Sporting News as one of the Top 100 Most Powerful People in Sports alongside Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Jesse Owens, Pete Rozelle and Wayne Gretzky. Giannoulas (as the chicken) has gone on to star in movies ("The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" where he stomped the evil villains in a parking lot), commercials, TV shows and a recorded cover of Rod Stewart's "Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" -- San Diego is a veritable repository of the unique, the one-off and the rare.
