Like using Google profiles to contact information with select contacts, using Google Latitude tells Google who's who in your social graph. With Google's new Latitude software, cell phone users can share their locations with others. Google envisions two broad classes of people with whom you might want to share location information. Location is an important part of navigating the real world, and Google clearly sees its geographic services as a way to establish a more personal connection with customers who today use Google chiefly for the virtual realm of the Internet. Latitude uses Google's technology to judge a user's location not just by GPS satellite, but also by proximity to mobile phone towers and wireless networks.
