As Europe protects individual rights, America persists in its belief that rights are for big corporations, people be damned. It just says that if a European requests that information come down, Google must respect the request but can refuse if it has good cause. Google doesn't like being told what to do, and critics raised an outcry about First Amendment rights. But the ruling does not say that old information must be deleted. The "right to be forgotten" does not apply if it appears for "particular reasons": if there is good cause to interfere with the citizen's right to privacy, including "the role played by the data subject in public life," and if a majority of the evidence shows that the general public has a right to that information.
