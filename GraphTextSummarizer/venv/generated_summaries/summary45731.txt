Social Democratic Party candidate Josipovic won 60.3 percent of the vote, or about 1.3 million of the nearly 2.3 million votes cast, said spokesman Hrvoje Sadaric of the Croatian State Election Commission. Slightly more than half of voting eligible Croatians voted in the runoff and more than 99 percent of votes had been counted, Sadaric said. Josipovic, 52, a law professor and classical music composer, had earlier garnered the most votes in the first round of voting. -- Ivo Josipovic won the runoff election Sunday for Croatia's presidency, a spokesman for the election commission told CNN. He was once a member of Josipovic's party, Sadaric said.
