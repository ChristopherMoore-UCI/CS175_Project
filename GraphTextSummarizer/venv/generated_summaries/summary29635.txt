-- A Swedish political party dedicated to copyright reform and privacy rights says it has agreed to host several new servers for the whistle-blower website WikiLeaks. The Pirate Party is pushing for representation in the Swedish and European parliaments on a three-point platform that includes reform of copyright law, to make all non-commercial use of copyrighted material free and to limit the terms of current copyrights; getting rid of the patent system; and tightening privacy rules. "The contribution of WikiLeaks is tremendously important to the entire world," Pirate Party leader Rick Falkvinge said in a statement on the group's site. The Pirate Party said Tuesday it agreed to host the servers during a visit last weekend by WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. By hosting WikiLeaks information on the party's computer servers, WikiLeaks information will be available to more web users.
