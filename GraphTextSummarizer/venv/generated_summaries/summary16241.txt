-- World number one's Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams continued their successful title defenses in Madrid Thursday but the Spanish capital again proved a less than happy hunting ground for Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. Kvitova beat fellow Czech Lucie Safarova 6-4 6-3, while second seed Li Na had a more testing morning as she came from a set down to beat 16th seed Sloane Stephens of the United States 2-6 6-3 6-2. Murray scored an impressive victory over Spain's Nicolas Almagro the previous evening, but he never looked set to stage a repeat against Giraldo. Earlier, Nadal, looking to get back to his invincible best after defeats David Ferrer and Almagro in the quarterfinals in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, dispatched Finn Jarkko Nieminen 6-1 6-4. Australian Open champion Li will now face Maria Sharapova for a place in the semifinals after the Russian continued her superb recent form on clay with a 6-4 6-3 win over Australian Samantha Stosur.
