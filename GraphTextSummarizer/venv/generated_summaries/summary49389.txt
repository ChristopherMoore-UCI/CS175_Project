" This spike in demand at Maryhouse and other social service programs across the country comes as House Republicans want to cut WIC by 10% as part of the 2011 federal budget plan passed last week, despite objections from Democrats and WIC advocates. In addition to WIC, the GOP-controlled House also passed cuts to Planned Parenthood, arts programs and heating subsidies for low-income households. "The funding level that was provided last year...turned out to be more than what's needed," explained ZoÃ« Neuberger with the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Even if the Democratic Senate and Obama agree to WIC cuts, WIC has been running a surplus in 2011, and that money could be used to fill any funding reduction. Milk makes up about 20% of WIC program expenditures.
