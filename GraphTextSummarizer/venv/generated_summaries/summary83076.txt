Last week, just days after American troops pulled out of Iraq, 63 people died and 176 were wounded in Baghdad. In the Mashtal area of Baghdad, a local women's NGO is offering an awareness seminar for widows. -- Home is the hardest place to find for children of immigrants, but for us, nothing hits closer to home than when a bomb goes off in Baghdad. My sister-in-law returned from Baghdad last week, with pictures from the seminar. My aunt said that it felt like "hell opened loose" this past Thursday, heat lingering in the air as it rose from the rubble and twisted metal around Baghdad.
