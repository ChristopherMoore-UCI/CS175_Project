The event is billed as "Fun for the whole family," and children take their turns to skin a snake, and afterward, press their hands covered with snake blood onto a wall of handprints. And children could leave their handprints in bright, colorful paint rather than snake blood. If children learn that it's OK to hurt and kill animals for fun, what is to stop them from doing the same to people? Psychologists say that people who murder often tortured animals as children; there is a link between violence against animals and violence against people. The Sweetwater branch has been holding what it calls "The World's Largest Rattlesnake Round-Up" for 56 years on the first weekend in March, and the tool for success that it teaches young people is that it's fun to kill and torture animals.
