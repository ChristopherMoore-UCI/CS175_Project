-- Former Cuban President Fidel Castro says he is open to the idea of meeting with U.S. President-elect Barack Obama. Former Cuban President Fidel Castro has largely been out of the political scene since falling ill in 2006. Friday's missive marked the second time in recent weeks that a Cuban leader has said he is open to meeting with Obama. In the latest issue of The Nation, actor Sean Penn writes of his recent conversation in Havana with Ra√∫l Castro, who took over as president this year from his ailing brother. Obama has called for the U.S. detention facility at the Guantanamo Bay naval base on the island of Cuba to be closed.
