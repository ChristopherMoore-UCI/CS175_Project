-- Former world No. 2 Petra Kvitova secured her first WTA Tour title of 2012 by defeating former French Open champion Li Na in Monday's final of the Rogers Cup. Desite the loss, Li showed glimpses of the form which made her China's first grand slam singles champion at Roland Garros last year. "I'm very happy because this was the first hard-court tournament after the Olympics, and my new coach is going to come to Cincinnati, so I think this is a very good start to this season for me." Li recently started working with Justine Henin's former coach Carlos Rodriguez. " Kvitova's triumph in Montreal was all the more impressive considering the 22-year-old suffers from asthma, which usually adversely affects her performances in North America due to the summer humidity. It was Kvitova's first appearance in a final this season and the win meant she won a Tour event for the first time since the season-ending championships in Istanbul last October.
