Suspect in New York children's stabbings had been released on parole CNN's Rande Iaboni and Julie Cannold contributed to this report. No one was killed, but 34 people -- 23 of them firefighters -- were injured in the five-alarm blaze, which is now under control, said Frank Dwyer, a Fire Department of New York spokesman. -- When Anthony DiSimone and Darleen Cerzosie saw fire engulfing a multifamily home on their densely packed Staten Island street early Thursday, the New Yorkers -- engaged to be married -- sprang into action. FDNY fire marshals are investigating the cause of the blaze, Dwyer said. The situation was grim on the second floor of 203 Chestnut Avenue; a family was trapped.
