Also in western Baghdad, gunmen attacked a checkpoint manned by local Awakening Council members, wounding two of them, police said. In that attack, some 99 miles (160 kilometers) south of Baghdad, a suicide bomber parked a truck packed with explosives concealed by watermelons and began calling shoppers to the truck. -- A series of bomb blasts killed at least 37 people across Iraq on Tuesday, including 30 in an explosion at a vegetable market in Diwaniya, police officials said. On Tuesday evening, a car bomb exploded along a busy road near the al-Nidda Sunni Mosque in northeastern Baghdad's al-Qahira neighborhood, police officials said. The Awakening Councils, also known as the Sons of Iraq, are made up predominantly of Sunni Arab fighters who battled Iraq's al Qaeda militants after turning on them in late 2006.
