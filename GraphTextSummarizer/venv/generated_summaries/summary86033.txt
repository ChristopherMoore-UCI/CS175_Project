The trial of former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy on charges of inciting the murders of at least three protesters in 2012 has been postponed until February 1 because he did not appear in court Wednesday. Muslim Brotherhood members have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. A number of Morsy supporters gathered Wednesday morning outside the police academy where the trial session was to be held. Morsy has yet to accept legal representation, so he had no lawyer to represent him in court Wednesday. Morsy, who was deposed by the military amid widespread protest of his rule, has been in detention since early July.
