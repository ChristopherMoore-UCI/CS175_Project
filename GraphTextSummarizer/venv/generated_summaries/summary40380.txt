What keeps climate scientists working away in our labs and in the field, is that we keep uncovering more evidence of how climate change will impact our planet and our lives. Groups like the Union of Concerned Scientists are redoubling their efforts to defend scientists and advance public understanding of climate change. Climate scientists know the world is warming and human activity -- particularly burning coal and oil -- is the primary driver. And a vocal minority of corporate interests and their ideological allies are spending a lot of money to hijack the public debate about climate change. And scientific societies are starting to do more to help their members deal with the poisonous political environment around climate change.
