"The president believed the distraction over his birth certificate wasn't good for the country," White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said. The administration had to make a special request from the state of Hawaii to get the long-form certificate released, White House legal counsel Bob Bauer said. Doubters insist Obama was born overseas -- possibly in his father's home country of Kenya -- and may be constitutionally ineligible to serve as president. The U.S. Constitution says only "natural born" citizens can become president -- a vague clause that followers of the birther movement contend disqualifies Obama from the presidency, since they believe he was born overseas. Obama released a shorter, legally binding "certification of live birth" in 2008, but failed to persuade members of the "birther" movement.
