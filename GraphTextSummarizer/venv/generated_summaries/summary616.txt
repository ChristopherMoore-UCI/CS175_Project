One doctor said the odds of this happening are "one in a million." "A sudden explosion-type feeling in my chest" is how Hardman, 47, described the incident to CNN affiliate WXYZ. Detroit paramedic Joseph Hardman is being hailed as a hero for performing CPR on a patient having a heart attack -- even as he began to have one himself. Hardman has been working as a paramedic in Detroit for 15 years, and says he has no prior medical history of heart problems. "I would have to say one in a million is about appropriate" a hospital doctor told WXYZ. Doctors say he likely faces months of rehab before he'll be able to return to work.
