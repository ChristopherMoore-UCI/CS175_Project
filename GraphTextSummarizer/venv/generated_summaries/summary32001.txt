Pinterest user and social media consultant Colleen Pence thinks she knows the answer: "Everything on Pinterest looks so appealing, so gorgeous, so effortless," she wrote on CNN iReport. Because the bug that's infected Ishmael, her friends and thousands of women around the world is called Pinterest. And it's that visual interest that makes Pinterest -- created by three men, by the way -- so popular among women, whether they're planning a wedding or looking for a craft to try with their girlfriends. "The problem with Pinterest, though, is that I spend a lot of time pinning, pinning, pinning and not enough time trying, trying, trying," she wrote on her blog. The main thing that separates it from older social bookmarking sites, such as del.icio.us, is its emphasis on images.
