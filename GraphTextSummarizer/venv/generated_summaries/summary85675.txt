"Aerospace engineering, astrophysics, biology, climate modeling and national security all have applications with extreme computing requirements," Nikolopoulos said. Physically, exascale computing won't get any bigger, says Nikolopoulos, and might even get a little smaller. You're talking about many, many lanes of computer racks and thousands of processors," says Nikolopoulos. Nikolopoulos says "severe technology barriers" remain, the most important being power. "The current projections suggest that power consumption of exascale computers will be 100 megawatts.
