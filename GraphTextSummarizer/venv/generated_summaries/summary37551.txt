Prime Minister Raila Odinga made the comments Sunday while attending a rally in the Kibera neighborhood of Nairobi. "The gay community is very scared as the Prime Minister's statement will incite more violence against visible gays," David Kuria, a spokesperson for the Gay and Lesbian Coalition of Kenya told CNN. "If we find a man engaging in homosexuality or a woman in lesbianism, we'll arrest them and put them in jail," Odinga said. A spokesperson of the prime minister's office, Dennis Onyango told CNN that the comments made by Odinga were off the cuff and were not a directive to arrest anyone. "The constitution is very clear on this issue and men or women found engaging in homosexuality will not be spared," Odinga said during the rally.
