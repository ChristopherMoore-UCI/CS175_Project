Issuing patents to the first person or company to file will help provide clarity in the patent-granting process, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office says. " Obama used the occasion to promote his $447 billion jobs plan, calling patent reform a "part of our (larger) agenda for making us competitive over the long term." It will also prevent inventors from coming out of the woodwork to challenge pending patents. Currently, all patent-filing fees are sent to Congress, and the patent office is allocated a set amount that is unrelated to how many patent applications are filed in a given year. Underfunding has led to a 700,000-patent backlog and a three-year waiting period for the average patent to receive final approval.
