In his second year as president, John Kennedy admitted, "The fact is that I think Congress looks more powerful sitting here than it did when I was in Congress ... when you are in Congress, you are one of a hundred in the Senate or one of 435 in the House, so that power is divided. The problem is that doing well in Washington requires a very different kind of skill set than the ones that business executives or mavericks bring to the table. Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum have tried to transform themselves from pillars of the congressional Republican establishment into conservative mavericks, while front-runner Mitt Romney talks frequently about how he would bring the skills of a CEO to Washington. But from here I look at a Congress and I look at the collective power of the Congress ... and it is a substantial power." Similarly, like it or not, it is hard to act as an outsider once daily life involves dealing with hundreds of insiders with considerable power.
