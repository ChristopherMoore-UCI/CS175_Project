"Secretary Hagel determined the totality of the evidence does not meet the proof beyond a reasonable doubt Medal of Honor standard," a Pentagon statement said, noting that he would not reopen the award nomination for Peralta. "Three separate secretaries of defense have now examined the case, and each independently concluded the evidence does not support award of the Medal of Honor," the statement said. They believe Peralta, severely wounded by gunfire, pulled a grenade under his body and shielded other Marines from the blast. Supporters of the Peralta family and some in Congress led by Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican, have advocated for the award posthumously. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has become the third-straight Pentagon chief to decide against recommending a Medal of Honor for a Marine who died fighting in Iraq.
