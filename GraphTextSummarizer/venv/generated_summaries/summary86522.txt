"We were all seated around a kitchen table, and John was seated next to Bob," Hester recalled to Dylan biographer Howard Sounes in his book "Down The Highway: The Life of Bob Dylan." Dylan claims he wrote "Song to Woody," a tribute to his musical hero Woody Guthrie, just weeks after arriving in New York, a trip partially inspired by the fact that Guthrie was living at Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in New Jersey and Dylan wanted to meet him. The first song recounts Dylan's earliest days in New York when he "got a harmonica job, begun to play/Blowin' my lungs out for a dollar a day." The 20-year old singer-songwriter from Hibbing, Minnesota had been playing the coffee houses in New York for a little over a year, mostly singing traditional folk songs in a nasal voice that was virtually impossible to imagine hearing on the radio. Van Ronk recalled to Dylan biographer Anthony Scaduto.
