Clinton, while Duke Lafoon will be "Billy" Clinton and Alet Taylor is Hillary Clinton. Performances will run July 18-20, July 22 and July 25 at the Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theatre in New York. The musical features two Bill Clintons -- W.J. Clinton as the smart and presidential man the American public knows well and the unruly, oversexed "Billy.
