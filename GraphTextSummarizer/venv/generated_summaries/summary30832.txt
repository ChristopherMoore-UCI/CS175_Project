On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the arrest of a 64-year-old Washington state resident for allegedly issuing death threats against Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, who supported the health care bill. Threats against U.S. senators and representatives increased as Congress completed work last month on the health care bill, which was unanimously opposed by Republicans. Most of the reported threats were against Democrats, though there were some against Republicans. Giusti was arrested Wednesday in San Francisco, where Pelosi's home district is located, according to FBI spokesman Joseph Schadler. Pelosi is the top Democrat in the U.S. House and was a leading figure in efforts to win congressional approval of sweeping health care legislation.
