That was John Kerry to U.S. President George W. Bush in August 2004. In 1992, the first President Bush was criticized for being out of touch with ordinary Americans. In every election since 1952 -- until this year -- either the president has run for re-election (like George W. Bush in 2004) or the vice president has run to succeed him (like Al Gore in 2000). But the camera caught Gore theatrically sighing while George W. Bush answered questions. "I'm not sure I get it,'' President Bush responded.
