In fact, my husband and I, like many in military families, never thought of the two conflicts as being separate wars. Today I am grateful the name "Iraq" is not in my family's scrapbooks, our memories or the stories we will pass on to future generations, though my reasoning has nothing to do with the actual fighting that took place there. Our nation's mission in Iraq will end this month with full flights of weary soldiers and thousands of tons of gear. They deserve the gratitude of the nation that sent them -- again and again and again -- to war. There were missing WMDs and deadly IEDs, soldiers with PTSD and TBI returning home only to struggle through deplorable conditions at Walter Reed.
