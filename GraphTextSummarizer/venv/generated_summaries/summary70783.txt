"At this time, there have been no reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with Ebola or of being able to spread Ebola to people or other animals," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. But it's not yet clear whether a pet's body, paws or fur can pick up and spread Ebola to people or other animals. Some studies have shown that dogs may experience asymptomatic Ebola infections, the CDC says -- meaning they may have the virus but don't get sick. "The risk activities that lead to human infections are direct contact with infected human body fluids, or through bats or consumption of infected wild meat." "We know that this virus can circulate in animals, but pets have not been a feature of Ebola spread, whether in Africa and certainly not here in the developed world," he said.
