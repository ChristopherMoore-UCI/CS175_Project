Beatty runs an organization called the Florida Wild Mammal Association (FWMA) in Crawfordville, Florida. Seeing images of oiled birds and wildlife splashed across the news channels, Beatty wanted to be ready in case they were called upon to take in these animals. -- When Chris Beatty got word about the oil spill in the Gulf, like many Floridians, she wanted to help -- but she wanted to help in a very specific way. The organization houses injured and sick wildlife and nurses them back to health so that they can be released back into the wild.
