Turkey's Anadolu News Agency said the majority of MRF's members are ethnic Turks, who make up nearly 9% of Bulgaria's population. Video shows the man pointing a gas pistol at the head of Dogan, who grappled with him, according to Bulgaria State News (BTA). A man Saturday approached Bulgarian opposition politician Ahmet Dogan, who was at a lectern giving a speech at a party conference in Sofia, the capital city. Dogan, leader of the ethnic Turk Movement for Rights and Freedoms (MRF), managed to knock the gun away as people rushed the stage and subdued the assailant. The suspect was arrested and identified as Oktay Yenimehmedov, 25, according to media reports.
