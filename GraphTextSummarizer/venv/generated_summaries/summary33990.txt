Goodell the big loser here Under the bounty program, Tagliabue wrote, Saints players were given incentives during the 2009 through 2011 seasons to render opposing players unable to play. In October, after he upheld suspensions, Goodell appointed Tagliabue to review player appeals. " Vilma's lawyer, Peter R. Ginsberg, accused Goodell of "trying every conceivable maneuver to avoid real and honest scrutiny of his manufactured allegations that Jonathan Vilma engaged in a bounty program aimed at opposing players." "Strong action was taken in this matter to protect player safety and ensure that bounties would be eliminated from football. "The decisions have made clear that the Saints operated a bounty program in violation of league rules for three years, that the program endangered player safety, and that the commissioner has the authority under the CBA to impose discipline for those actions as conduct detrimental to the league," the league said.
