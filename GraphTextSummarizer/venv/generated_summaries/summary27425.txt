The rapper, whose legal name is Dwayne Carter, pleaded guilty in October to felony gun charges as part of a deal with prosecutors. Carter also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in Arizona. The charges stem from his arrest in 2007 outside New York City's Beacon Theater. At Manhattan Supreme Court on Monday, the room was packed with onlookers, while more people crowded outside. As Carter was leaving the courtroom, a fan said to him, "Keep your head up, Weezy," using the rapper's nickname.
