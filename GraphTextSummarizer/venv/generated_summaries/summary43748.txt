-- England soccer captain John Terry endured a difficult end to last year, and his 2012 has begun in a bizarre manner involving an anti-smoking campaign in India. The Chelsea skipper denies aiming a racial slur at Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a Premier League match in October. The Chelsea defender's representatives are investigating how Terry's image might have been used without their permission as part of a warning on cigarette packets. However, one of the pictures seen on cigarette packets this week --which was cleared by the ministry and included in a May 2011 press release -- does show a strong resemblance to Terry. The public relations officer of India's health ministry told CNN that the picture that resembles Terry is not one of those pictures that it sanctioned.
