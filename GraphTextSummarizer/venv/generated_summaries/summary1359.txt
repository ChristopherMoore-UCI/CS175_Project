North Korea claims that "the South is using Roh's return as a pretext for eliminating the progressive pro-reform forces." South Korea did not send any representatives to the North after Kim's death. "Roh Su-hui's illegal entry to North Korea and his slandering of the South's government and praising of the North is an illegal act. Roh Su-hui, a leader with an organization close to North Korea, was taken into custody as he crossed back into South Korea after three months, the official said. Tension between the two countries remains high since North Korea's shelling attack on a South Korean island in 2010 and the sinking of a South Korean warship in a torpedo attack blamed on the North. He walked across the two countries' heavily guarded border in the demilitarized zone and was brought in for questioning, according to an official from the South's National Police Agency who refused to be named in line with Korean policy.
