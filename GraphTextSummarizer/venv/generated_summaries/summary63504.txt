But U.S. authorities believe Charlie Hebdo attacker Said Kouachi may have met with the late American terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki at some point in Yemen and received orders from al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to carry out an attack, a U.S. official told CNN's Barbara's Starr. In all, four people are suspected in the Paris attacks: â€¢ Brothers Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, who rampaged through the offices of Charlie Hebdo. And the shooting of a random jogger Wednesday has reportedly been linked to the spate of violence that included the attack at French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, the deadly siege at a kosher store and the killing of a policewoman. ISIS paraphernalia found:  Investigators discovered ISIS flags, automatic weapons and detonators in an apartment near Paris rented by Coulibaly, France's RTL Radio reported Sunday, citing authorities. Also, at least one suspect in the supermarket standoff demanded the freedom of the suspects in the Charlie Hebdo attack.
