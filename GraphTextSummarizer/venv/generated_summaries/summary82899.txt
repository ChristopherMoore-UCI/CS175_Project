"Over two years, we answered their questions about Google products, allowed them to see a Noogler (new Googler) orientation, had them speak with our internship programs team to learn more about life at Google," the Google spokesperson told CNN. "I think the reason why we got involved in that is that computer science has a marketing problem," explained Google co-founder Larry Page at a Google conference last month. Google didn't ask for any changes after seeing a final cut of "The Internship," despite a number of deviations from the original script -- and the fact that it sometimes strays from Google reality. "It couldn't have been more opposite than my own experience," said former Google intern Raymond Braun, who now works full time at the company. The comedy, which hits theaters Friday, is about two middle-age watch salesmen who overcome career obsolescence and a complete lack of tech savvy to join Google's internship program in hopes of scoring a job at the giant tech company.
