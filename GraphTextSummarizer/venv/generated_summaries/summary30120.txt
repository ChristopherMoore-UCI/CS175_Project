"Of course not," Mourad Medelci told French radio network Europe 1 when asked whether Gadhafi was in Algeria. Gadhafi's wife, two sons and other relatives fled to Algeria, deepening the mistrust between the rebel government and Libya's powerful neighbor. " Medelci also offered more insight on Gadhafi's family fleeing to Algeria. Algeria described the move as a humanitarian gesture, but it angered the National Transitional Council, with one official calling it "an aggressive act." The transitional council has accused Algeria of supporting the Gadhafi regime. "I think the information that was disclosed which concerns some of his family members who had to be received in Algeria because of extreme circumstances, mainly humanitarian reasons, created a wave of panic," Medelci said.
