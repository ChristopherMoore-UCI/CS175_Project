More than 3,200 civilians died from Sunday evening till Monday morning, said Lawrence Christy, the head of Tamils Rehabilitation Organization, according to the rebel Web site TamilNet. "Verification is, of course, the part of the problem, because humanitarian agencies are denied access to the region," U.N. spokesman Gordon Weiss said from the capital, Colombo. Government troops have closed in on rebel forces in a shrinking section of the country's north, and civilians have been caught in crossfire. The numbers provided by the United Nations pale in comparison with rebel claims. -- Hundreds of civilians died during weekend fighting between Sri Lankan government forces and Tamil rebel fighters, the United Nations reported Monday.
