But in a press conference, Arizona Sen. John McCain blamed illegal immigrants for starting unspecified fires in that area. "You have to have some sort of factual basis: John McCain should know better," said Parraz, a co-founder of Citizens for a Better Arizona, which is working to recall state Sen. Russel Pearce, the primary sponsor of Arizona's controversial anti-illegal immigration law. The U.S. Forest Service chief said earlier Saturday at the same press conference attended by McCain that he was "very optimistic" that damage from future wildfires could be minimized by thinning forests and clearing out biomass -- which did occur, to some extent, in parts of eastern Arizona. -- As discussions swirled about its origins and impact, the U.S. forest service chief deemed a raging wildfire in southern Arizona as "the number one priority" for firefighters nationwide. "We know where it started and when it started, but (the specific cause) is under investigation," Tidwell said hours later from southern Arizona.
