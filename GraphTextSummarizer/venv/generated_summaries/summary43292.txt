During a press conference in Kentucky, McConnell urged Obama to follow Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who built domestic legacies despite often having to deal with a Congress controlled by opposing parties. The success of Obama's final years in office could rely on Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is in line to become the next Senate majority leader. But Obama described that effort by encouraging lawmakers to lower tax rates by closing loopholes -- a strategy McConnell and other Republicans have rejected for years. President Barack Obama isn't ceding ground on his most controversial policies despite an election that delivered a stinging rebuke to him and his party on Capitol Hill. "You know, actually, I would enjoy having some Kentucky bourbon with Mitch McConnell," Obama said.
