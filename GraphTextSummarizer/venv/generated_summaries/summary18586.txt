Yahoo's logo redesign was headed up by an in-house branding group and product designers, according to AdAge. In a recent internal poll of Yahoo employees, 87% wanted the logo changed, Mayer said. The new logo is probably not different enough to raise much ire (or eyebrows) among Yahoo users, although some Internet critics were unimpressed. "The new Yahoo logo looks like it got run through Alien Skin Eye Candy on Photoshop 4.0.," said Justin Williams. When Gap tried changing its logo in 2010, there was an outcry among Gap loyalists and logo enthusiasts.
