In a time when tabloids, Internet chatter and even mainstream media will speculate wildly about famous couples, some, like authors Elizabeth Edwards and Jenny Sanford, choose to be part of the conversation and not just the topic of it. "While we look at these women as political wives," said CNN senior political correspondent Candy Crowley, "some of these wives are powerful career women or have been powerful career women. Elizabeth Edwards provided a glimpse into her journey with "Resilience: Reflections on the Burdens and Gifts of Facing Life's Adversities," published last May and months before she and her husband, former Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, eventually separated. Available in bookstores Friday is "Staying True" by Jenny Sanford, who filed for divorce in December from South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, whose affair with an Argentine woman was exposed by reporters after he disappeared for several days last summer. And that is one reason why former investment banker Jenny Sanford wrote her book, says publisher Ballantine Books on its Web site.
