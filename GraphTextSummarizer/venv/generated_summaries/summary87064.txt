Meanwhile, in the only English Premier League match played on Sunday, Newcastle drew level with fifth-placed Chelsea, just five points away from a Champions League place, after an impressive 3-1 victory at West Bromwich Albion. In Spain, big-spending Malaga are now level on points with third-placed Valencia after a 2-1 win at Espanyol on Sunday. Once cast adrift at the foot of the table, Zaragoza are now level on 25 points with Sporting Gijon and Racing Santander, who both drew 1-1 away from home on Sunday. Borussia Dortmund edged a step closer to retaining their German Bundesliga title on Sunday as Japan's Shinji Kagawa scored twice in a 6-1 thrashing of Cologne. And, after a level first 45 minutes, Dortmund -- led by man-of-the-match Kagawa -- produced a superb second half display with five unanswered goals, to once again hold a dominant lead with just seven matches of the season remaining.
