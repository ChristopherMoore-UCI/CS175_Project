Nel tore into Pistorius over five days in court in April, saying the Paralympic medalist had argued with Steenkamp and killed her on purpose. -- Oscar Pistorius prosecutor Gerrie Nel wants the South African track star sent for independent psychiatric evaluation, he said Monday, in a move that could delay the athlete's murder trial for a month or more. He's depressed now and feeling guilt from having killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, defense witness Dr. Meryl Vorster said on the stand. The defense is trying to show that Pistorius made a genuine and reasonable mistake and responded reasonably on the night he killed Steenkamp, 29, a model and law school graduate. Pistorius, 27, admits that he fired four bullets through a closed door in his house, killing Steenkamp, but says he thought he was protecting himself from a burglar.
