The Dutchman retired last year after Manchester United claimed a record 19th English championship, but that reign appeared to be over earlier this season as big-spending Manchester City took pole position under the guidance of Roberto Mancini. " Mancini guided City to the club's first silverware since 1976 with success in the FA Cup last season, but it has been 44 years since a league title was celebrated by the blue half of Manchester. City must next travel to Champions League-chasing Newcastle and relegation-threatened Queens Park Rangers. "They've both got strikers on good form -- Sergio Aguero scored a lot of goals, Wayne Rooney scored a lot of goals," said Van der Sar, who played for United for six seasons. Ferguson is the most successful British manager of the modern era, having won 12 Premier League titles and two European Champions League crowns in more than quarter of a century at Old Trafford.
