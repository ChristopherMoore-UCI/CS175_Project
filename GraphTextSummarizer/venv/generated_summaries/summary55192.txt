Floating homes To cope with rising sea levels, Rotterdam plans to build floating urban districts calling for 13,000 climate-proof floating homes in by 2040 -- of which around 1,200 would be built on top of the water. In fact, Rotterdam emits a whopping 29.8 tonnes of carbon per capita, one of the highest in the world. To combat the heavy rainfall, urban design and planning company De Urbanisten came up with the concept of constructing water plazas that serve as the perfect solution to holding excess water and take the pressure off the sewerage system. Not only do green patches provide a buffer to help absorb excess rainwater, but they also clear the atmosphere and slow down roof erosion, according to Rotterdam Climate Initiative. Rotterdam's waterways may be responsible for a bulk of the city's prosperity -- but that's not to say that the day to day living below sea level is easy for its residents.
