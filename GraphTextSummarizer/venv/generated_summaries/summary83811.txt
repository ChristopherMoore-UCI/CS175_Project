"Michaela loved to cook," said Petit, who was wearing a heart-shaped Petit Family Foundation pin on his lapel. Once he was taken to the basement, Petit was bound to a support pole by a rope around his chest and waist, his hands still bound with plastic zip ties. The men are said to have beaten up Petit, strangled his 48-year-old wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, and set the home ablaze. The family finished dinner and the girls settled into the family room to watch "Army Wives"; Petit fell asleep in the sun room while reading the Sunday paper, he said. Hayes is accused of raping Hawke-Petit, and prosecutors have charged Komisarjevsky, who will be tried separately, with sexually assaulting Petit's 11-year-old daughter.
