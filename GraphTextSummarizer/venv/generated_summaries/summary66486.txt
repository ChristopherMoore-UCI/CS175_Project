But it can lead to cuts if test scores sink, if students or teachers' miss a chance to shine or if schools can't fulfill a grant obligation based on instructional time.

On those days, higher numbers of students missed class, perhaps because of parental discretion or transportation issues, and entire classes suffered as teachers moved some students on and caught other students up.
