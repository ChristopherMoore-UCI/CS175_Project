Investigators looking into steroid use by professional baseball players obtained search warrants and subpoenas for the drug tests results on 10 major league players, but they took the results on 104 players. "The players were assured that the results would remain anonymous and confidential; the purpose of the testing was solely to determine whether more than five percent of players tested positive, in which case there would be additional testing in future seasons." -- A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that federal investigators' seizure of drug-test results of more than 90 major league baseball players five years ago was illegal. The test results were taken in 2004 during searches in California and Nevada of Comprehensive Drug Testing -- the company that kept the results -- and another company that stored the urine samples. "Urine samples were to be collected during the first year of the agreement and each sample was to be tested for banned substances," the court said.
