This echo-free room is where University College London scientist Sophie Scott has been recording laughter, in an effort to find out what makes us giggle and why. Such is the bonding power of laughter that it can even help make or break a relationship, as Scott explains: "Some of the things scientists are finding is couples who manage stressful situations with positive affect -- laughter -- are the people who stay together longer. Universal language For Scott, laughter is more than displaying amusement -- it's a primal way of showing people that we like them and want them to like us. Scott will be one of many prominent female scientists, engineers, and technologists talking about their work at Imperial College London. As part of their experiments, Scott and her team recorded two types of laughter in the anechoic chamber -- real, uncontrollable whooping, and posed, deliberate, chuckling.
