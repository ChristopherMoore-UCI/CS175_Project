Brody plays Lovelace's "Deep Throat" co-star, Harry Reems. Aside from seeing "Deep Throat," Brody said he prepared by watching "'The Devil in Miss Jones,' the next porn with Harry Reems, and I read his biography from the '70s -- very lighthearted, before he sort of fell on hard times and resurrected himself." -- If there was ever a reunion for teen soap "The O.C.," which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this week, former star Adam Brody would want it to be in the theater. The film, directed by Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, tells the story of adult actress Linda Lovelace. "I'll take the very low notes." Since "The O.C." ended in 2007, Brody has lined up a number of movie projects, including Friday's release, "Lovelace."
