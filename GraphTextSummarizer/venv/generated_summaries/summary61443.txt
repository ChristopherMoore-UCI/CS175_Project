Over the course of 13 months, common themes began to emerge whenever I would ask why kids such as these were doing such wondrous work in these places and substandard work elsewhere. And this is what we need to address forthrightly if we ever hope to close the so-called achievement gap that looms between black kids and white ones. Most of all, they spoke of the simple power of expectation: making it a conscious point to look for greatness in black kids in whom people had not thought to look for it before. In all these places, I saw black kids -- well-spoken, clean-cut and noon-sun bright -- making a lie out of other peoples' expectations. Thirteen months of interviewing young scholars left me more impatient than ever with a culture that writes off black kids because they are black kids.
