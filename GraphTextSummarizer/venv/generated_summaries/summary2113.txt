And just because I don't understand or particularly enjoy death metal, doesn't mean it's not good music and, dare I say ... Because art is exactly what was being celebrated recently in London when a local death metal band called Unfathomable Ruination decided to lock themselves in an airtight, soundproof cube and play until they ran out of oxygen. In fact, maybe they were discussing how, if they pooled all their collective happiness and reason, they could open up a combination orphanage and puppy day care center called Unicorn Land. "What rhymes with 'charred remains?'" Now, I can't say for certain that they were actually death metal. Interestingly, the death metal art cube sits right outside the famous London office building known as "The Gherken."
