Davis was granted a stay of execution by the U.S. Supreme Court two hours before he was to be put to death in 2008, and the court in 2009 ordered the federal District Court to take another look at the case. "Other evidence that Mr. Davis brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors," the court found. But upon reviewing Davis' claims of innocence, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia found in August that Davis "vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence." CNN Supreme Court Producer Bill Mears contributed to this report. That court, after holding a hearing to review evidence, ruled in August that Davis "failed to show actual innocence" in the case.
