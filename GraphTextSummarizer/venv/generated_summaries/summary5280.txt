New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said his city followed every protocol in its handling of Spencer's case. A doctor who recently returned from Guinea has tested positive for Ebola -- the first case of the deadly virus in New York City and the fourth diagnosed in the United States. Is the hospital equipped to handle Ebola cases? Spencer is at New York's Bellevue Hospital Center, where he has been in isolation since emergency personnel took him there. He arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on October 17, but he exhibited no symptoms of the virus until Thursday morning, said Dr. Mary Travis Bassett, New York City's health commissioner. Spencer came back to the United States last week after treating Ebola patients in Guinea, where he worked for Doctors Without Borders.
