A video file posted online Saturday by a known ISIS supporter shows an image of one hostage, Kenji Goto, holding a photo of what appears to be the corpse of his fellow captive, Haruna Yukawa. Al-Bayan Radio, an ISIS-affiliated online station, reported the extremist group's killing of Yukawa and the prisoner swap demand for Goto in its newscast Sunday. After Yukawa was reported to have been captured in August, Goto apparently decided to leave his wife and two young daughters in Japan to go into ISIS territory to try to extricate him. British Prime Minister David Cameron said the apparent beheading of Yukawa and ISIS' threats are "yet another reminder of the murderous barbarity of these terrorists. The voice of a person claiming to be Goto speaks over the image, saying in English that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to blame for Yukawa's death.
