"This is a rare and isolated incident, and I'm disappointed that it happened, but it should not detract from the outstanding work that is being done by a dedicated team on a daily basis," Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Cabana said in the statement. -- NASA says it has launched an investigation after finding cocaine in a processing hangar for a space shuttle at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. A small amount of cocaine was found in a restricted area of the processing hangar for the shuttle Discovery, NASA said in a statement. "There is no reason whatsoever to believe this incident will have any impact on Discovery's upcoming launch," Cabana said. NASA has drug-tested employees who worked in that area, the statement said.
