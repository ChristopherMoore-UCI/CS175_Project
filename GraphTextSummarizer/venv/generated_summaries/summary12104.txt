The result of the singer's ambition is "Itica Pritica" (the "C" sounds like a "K"), an exhibition of more than 20 silk-screened works by Matthews and close friend Beezy Bailey at the Robert Miller Gallery in Chelsea. " Matthews said getting over this first artistic hump might open the floodgates for more art shows. But Dave Matthews was still frightened when it came to showing his art in a professional New York exhibit. " A fellow South African, Bailey knew just what to say to get Matthews over his fears and into the gallery. Like classic Matthews lyrics, there are works celebrating the idea of "Eat, drink and be merry."
