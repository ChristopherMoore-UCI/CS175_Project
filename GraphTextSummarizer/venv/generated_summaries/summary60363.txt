Karim, 30, is charged with two counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts and fundraising for the purpose of terrorism, London's Metropolitan Police Service said Wednesday. Authorities said Karim -- who was born in Bangladesh and is now a British citizen -- collected money in Britain and sent it to Yemen and Bangladesh to fund terrorist activities. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton and producer Jonathan Wald contributed to this report. Police learned about his alleged activities from encrypted data on his computer at home, which was seized when he was arrested last month. British authorities believe he had significant success in financing terrorist operations, security sources with knowledge of the case told CNN.
