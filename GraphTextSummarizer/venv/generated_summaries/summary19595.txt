-- It's been more than three weeks since militants from the dreaded Boko Haram terrorist group dragged 276 girls out of their beds at a boarding school in northern Nigeria, and still no one knows where the girls are. They may also be used as human shields in any military operation against Boko Haram, said Shehu Sani, a human rights activist in northern Nigeria. In a video that surfaced this week, Shekau said girls shouldn't be in school. And on Monday, Boko Haram fighters attacked a town that had been used as a staging ground for troops looking for the girls. And larger efforts to subdue Boko Haram have had little success since Jonathan declared a state of emergency in Nigeria's north one year ago this month.
