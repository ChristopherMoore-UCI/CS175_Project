Jose Callejon scored a late winner for Real Madrid against Mallorca on Saturday evening as Jose Mourinho's men fought back from a goal down to defeat Mallorca 2-1 and extend their lead at the top of La Liga. Substitute Gonzalo Higuain leveled the scores in the 71st minute before Callejon netted five minutes from the end to give Real an eight-point cushion over rivals Barcelona who play Real Betis at the Nou Camp on Sunday. Mauricio Lanzaro gave them the lead with a well-executed header in the 39th minute, but 11 minutes from time Zaragoza defender Javier Paredes scored an own goal. Nicola Legrottaglie put the hosts ahead in the 24th minute but Roma responded with an equalizer three minutes later courtesy of a strike from Daniele De Rossi. Israeli international Tomer Hemed gave Mallorca the lead in the 39th minute which they held on to until the last quarter of the match.
