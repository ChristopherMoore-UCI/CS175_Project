And for many employees, that time is spent using simple visual language to doodle, sketch and prototype new business opportunities. Jackie Andrade, a professor at the University of Plymouth, published a study finding a 29 percent increase in information retention gained by doodlers. Scofield happened upon what native doodlers have known for a long time: Doodling can improve cognitive performance. With these 12 "letters," prospective doodlers can articulate any visual representation of any concept they can imagine. George Washington, Thomas Edison, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Ronald Reagan and Vladimir Nabokov were doodlers.
