At issue was how states may define mental retardation -- within the context of inexact IQ tests -- when determining whether convicted murderers deserve capital punishment. In the case decided on Tuesday, the majority led by Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded that Florida's limits were too rigid and thus unconstitutional. Kennedy, as the familiar "swing vote" determining the outcome, said professional clinicians have a built-in margin for error the state was ignoring. He was also supported by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Clarence Thomas. "There is therefore no excuse for mechanically imposing standards that are unhinged from legal logic and that override valid state laws establishing burdens of proof," said Alito.
