The Republic of Ireland defender could only divert French midfielder Steed Malbranque's 25th-minute cross into his own net, and Villa earlier saw winger Stewart Downing hit the post and striker Emile Heskey completely miskicked in front of goal in the second half. Newcastle won 2-1 at bottom club West Ham in the late match to move above Villa on goal difference, with young striker Andy Carroll netting a 68th-minute winner for his fifth league goal this season. Fulham boss Mark Hughes brought on former England striker Andy Johnson for his first appearance since January, but his team could not equalize and have now not won away since the opening day in August. Arsenal travel to City on Sunday, while United face a potentially tricky clash with Stoke in the club's first match since England striker Wayne Rooney -- who is sidelined with injury -- made a surprise turnaround and decided to sign a new five-year contract after threatening to leave. Sunderland have scored just 11 times in nine league matches -- seven from England striker Darren Bent, two from record signing Asamoah Gyan, and two own-goals.
