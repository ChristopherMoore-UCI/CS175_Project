" Europe is home to a rich diversity of native mammal species ranging from the small such as shrews and voles, to the large such as wolves and brown bears. Other species on the critically endangered list include the Arctic fox, Bavarian pine vole, European mink and North Atlantic Right whale. "This new assessment proves that many European mammals are declining at an alarming rate," said IUCN Director-General Julia Marton-Lef√®vre, a position echoed by the EU's Environment Commissioner Stavros Dimas. At a time when so many conservation initiatives and laws are already in operation, the population of many European mammal species is in apparent free fall. The aforementioned Habitats Directive -- a corollary of the 1979 Bern Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats -- introduced a range of measures aimed at protecting endangered species (including plants, birds and fish as well as mammals).
