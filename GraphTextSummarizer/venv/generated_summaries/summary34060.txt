" Other Brasky sketch regulars from the old days, such as Alec Baldwin and John Goodman, were also missing in action, and Meadows suggested the bit appeared to double as an "Anchorman 2" promo. Written by "SNL" alums Will Ferrell and Adam McKay, the sketch revolved around guys recalling the daring feats of legendary businessman Bill Brasky. The actor, who appeared on "SNL" from 1991 to 2000, initially seemed upset to see the show bring back its Bill Brasky sketch without him on Saturday. With Ferrell back on the show Saturday, "SNL" resurrected the sketch and tapped his "Anchorman 2" co-stars David Koechner and Paul Rudd, host of the night's episode, to join him. -- Perhaps Tim Meadows' invitation back to "Saturday Night Live" got lost in the mail.
