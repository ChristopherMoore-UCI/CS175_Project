In a joint Afghan National Army (ANA) and International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) statement released Wednesday afternoon, officials said the Afghan soldiers were on a planned patrol in Ghanzi province and had coordinated the location with ISAF officials, however, incorrect location coordinates were shared. "Unfortunately, after the engagement, ISAF forces discovered the individuals were ANA soldiers on patrol. "When an ISAF helicopter patrol came across a group of individuals digging beside the road, in an area that has experienced daily IED detonations and significant casualties, ISAF patrol was cleared to engage the individuals believed to be insurgents," the statement said. -- Military authorities have determined that a NATO airstrike that killed 6 Afghan soldiers Wednesday in eastern Afghanistan was the result of a miscommunication between coalition and national forces.
