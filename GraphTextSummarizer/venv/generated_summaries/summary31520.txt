A lasting solution to the crisis in northern Nigeria might lie in a missing trinity: a meaningful but powerful narrative to counter Boko Haram's narrative; an action plan akin to a "Marshal Plan" for northern Nigeria; and isolation of what Jonathan has described as Boko Haram sympathizers in the government and security forces. The question remains as to whether alleged Boko Haram sympathizers among the elite can be dislodged from this process. At this moment, Boko Haram is obviously asserting influence, and that assertion of influence is accepted by a significant number of people who see no change in their primary condition. In the immediate term, we can expect the Nigerian military to record successes against the Boko Haram sect. It does not offer much hope for dealing comprehensively with the underlying causes of the Boko Haram phenomenon.
