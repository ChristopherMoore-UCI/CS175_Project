"The database should track vehicle license plate numbers that pass through cameras or are voluntarily entered into the system from a variety of sources (access control systems, asset recovery specialists, etc.) and uploaded to share with law enforcement," the original solicitation read. The proposal, which had been posted online last week by the office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, sought a contractor who could establish a searchable database of license plates, with the times and locations where they were spotted by traffic cameras and other sources. Supporters of license-plate scanning, like former New York state homeland security chief Michael Balboni, said it could have been an invaluable tool for finding dangerous suspects. "The solicitation, which was posted without the awareness of ICE leadership, has been canceled," said spokeswoman Gillian Christensen. "What license-plate readers have been used for most effectively is (trying) to do hits against outstanding warrants, against unlicensed drivers, against folks who have shown before that they've been involved in some kind of crime -- that's where the hits come.
