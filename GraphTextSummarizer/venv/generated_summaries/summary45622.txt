Kenoi signed an emergency proclamation Thursday and asked Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie for emergency assistance. Lava from a vent that opened on June 27 has come within a mile of the edge of the Ka'ohe Homesteads subdivision in the District of Puna, northeast of the volcano, Hawaii County Mayor Billy Kenoi said. The Icelandic town frozen in time by a volcano Evacuations had not been ordered as of Friday morning, but Hawaii County's civil defense restricted access to roads to the Ka'ohe community, civil defense administrator Darryl Oliveira said. "When this occurs, communities south of the crossing will be isolated from the rest of the county," Kenoi said. "We project that lava could reach the Kaohe Homesteads boundary within 5 to 7 days," the USGS said Thursday.
