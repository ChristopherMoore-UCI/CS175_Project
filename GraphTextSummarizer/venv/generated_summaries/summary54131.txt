The 60-year-old appeared in a New Zealand court Thursday afternoon facing a count of attempting to procure the murder of two men, said Bay of Plenty Police District representative Kim Perks. Police searched Rudd's waterfront home in Tauranga on Thursday morning, TVNZ reported. In a statement Thursday, the band said Rudd's absence wouldn't affect the album's release or a tour scheduled for next year. The names of the men he allegedly wanted killed and the name of the alleged potential hit man are suppressed, CNN affiliate TVNZ reported. He was also charged with threatening to kill, possession of methamphetamine and possession of cannabis, Perks said.
