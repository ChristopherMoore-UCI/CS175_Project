-- Under a blazing sun in early June, a group of pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine were digging amid pine woods near the town of Krazny Liman. To operate the Buk correctly, Russian assistance would have been required unless the rebel operators were defected air defense operators - which is unlikely. Among the pro-Russian rebels are fighters who served in the Russian army. The pro-Russian rebels had taken control of several Ukrainian military depots and bases and stripped them of their weapons. The Ukrainian military alleged the missile had been fired from Russian territory.
