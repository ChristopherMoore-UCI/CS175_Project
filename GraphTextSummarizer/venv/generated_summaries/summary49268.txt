On her debut collection for Paco Rabanne ... Nowadays women want things that are ... more functional but at the same time we've such an affluence of clothes and brands that are very wearable, that we also are looking for things that are very precise and very special, like sort of extraordinary pieces. She sees herself as a mix of her German side, the designer who thinks about utility and shape and her South American side, which is more instinctive and into meshing together textures and colors. When I was a child I was always very interested in images, in materials and textures. This is not a fashion house that's purely about style, but mostly about handwork and craftsmanship, and texture and material. I think that it's that sensibility to color also, to materials mostly that people always saw in me.
