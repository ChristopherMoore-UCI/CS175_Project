A solemn-faced Robbins, dressed in blue jeans and spotless new shoes, was photographed by Cook County authorities after his arrest and before he was put into a police car. Robbins was convicted in the May 2002 shooting death of a 21-year-old man who tried to stop a street fight between Robbins and his wife Nicole Robbins, according to court documents. This saga started on Tuesday when Robbins was taken from an Indianapolis prison to Illinois for a court hearing on unrelated weapons and drug charges, according to the Indiana Department of Correction. -- Authorities captured a convicted murderer whom Chicago authorities mistakenly released from custody. It was unclear Thursday whether Nicole was instrumental in the apprehension or lived in the area where Robbins was captured.
