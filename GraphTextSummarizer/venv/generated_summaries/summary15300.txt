Medics received a call Friday from Roberts' Washington County, Oregon, home of a newborn in distress, authorities said. "At this time, it has not been determined if [Snively] died because of head wounds she received or as a result of cutting injuries she received to her abdomen," said a Monday statement from the Washington County, Oregon, Sheriff's Office. Police think Roberts may have had contact with numerous pregnant women in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area, the statement said, and police ask anyone who has had contact with her, either in person or over the Internet, to call the Washington County Sheriff's Office. Heidi Kidd, Snively's mother, told CNN affiliate KPTV that her daughter met Roberts on Craigslist, a classified ads Web site, and the two were to exchange baby clothes. Washington County is about 30 miles west of Portland, Oregon.
