The exhibit, called "Ciudad Juarez es the .1," is the work of local artist Abel Saucedo, 24, a recent arts graduate of the University of Texas in El Paso. Artist Abel Saucedo says the exhibit, "Ciudad Juarez es the .1" has drawn mixed emotions from viewers. Saucedo grew up in El Paso and Ciudad Juarez across the border in Mexico, and says violence is now a normal part of life on the border. El Paso Library spokesman Jack Galindo said the library had only one official complaint -- a man said he was "very offended" by the pieces. The pieces, which took Saucedo six months to complete, were received with mixed emotions.
