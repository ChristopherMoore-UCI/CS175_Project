The driver, Ophadell Williams, "was impaired by fatigue at the time of the accident due to sleep deprivation, poor sleep quality and circadian factors," according to the report. "Fatigue and speed are an especially lethal combination," NTSB Chairman Deborah Hersman said in a statement. He was also speeding, driving 78 mph in the 50 mph zone in the minute before the accident, according to the NTSB examination of the bus data recorder. At the time of the accident, police said Williams told them the accident occurred after he swerved to avoid a tractor-trailer that might have clipped the bus; however, the NTSB found no other vehicles were factors in the crash. The World Wide Travel motor coach was returning to New York City on March 12, 2011, with 32 passengers onboard after visiting the Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut.
