But a modern group of players, dubbed "The New Musketeers" by national sports newspaper L'Equipe, are striving to carve their own place in history. Named after a film version of the classic Alexandre Dumas novel, they ended U.S. supremacy in the prestigious Davis Cup teams competition, winning it six years in a row, and claimed 43 grand slam singles and doubles titles between them. Last year they took France to the final of the Davis Cup, losing to Novak Djokovic's Serbia, and this weekend they will travel to Spain, the home nation of the world No.1's predecessor Rafael Nadal, in a bid to again reach the title decider. After their demise, France had to wait 59 long years for another Davis Cup triumph, and it has been a decade since its last -- and ninth overall -- title. Rene Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Jean Borotra and Jacques "Toto" Brugnon were collectively unbeatable in the 1920s and early 1930s, dominating world tennis for almost a decade and establishing France as a major power in the sport.
