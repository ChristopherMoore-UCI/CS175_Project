Korovin was authorized only to observe Cohen, who performed the procedure, since she was not certified by Yorkville Endoscopy clinic, as required by New York health law, the source said. The situation was compounded when Rivers went into cardiac arrest. " At first, Lloyd said, Rivers was unable to bring oxygen into her body due to the vocal cord spasm. But Korovin denied "performing an unauthorized procedure" before the comedian suffered cardiac arrest, a source close to the doctor told CNN last month. Comedian Joan Rivers died of "therapeutic complications" during a procedure to evaluate her "voice changes" and stomach reflux, the New York medical examiner said Thursday.
