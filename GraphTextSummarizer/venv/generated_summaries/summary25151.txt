" Unmanned land vehicles that can offer support behind ground troops or drive themselves in convoys are still being trialed and developed by the likes of Lockheed Martin, but aerial drones are now so prevalent that some in the industry think the market is saturated with manufacturers. As well as keeping pilots out of danger, could keeping a human out of an immediate mission area lead to better, calmer decisions being made during critical missions? That ratio will probably rise in the next few years with some in the industry predicting that within five years half of U.S. military aircraft will be unmanned. But so far removed are modern unmanned aerial vehicle pilots from their counterparts in cockpits, that basic computer knowledge isn't even essential before learning to fly a UAV. Peleg now works for Israel Aerospace Industries training future operators of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
