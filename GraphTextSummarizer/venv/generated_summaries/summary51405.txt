New York City Criminal Court Judge ShawnDya L. Simpson ruled Wednesday that there was no evidence that former New York Supreme Court Judge Frank Barbaro acted with bias toward the defendant when the verdict was rendered. Simpson ruled that Barbaro's claims of bias and prejudice were "mere afterthoughts or second guesses. " On the issues of Kagan's proclaimed innocence, Simpson wrote that Kagan failed to meet his "burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that he is actually innocent for the crimes he was convicted." Barbaro, who is white, found Kagan guilty of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon. "The evidence demonstrates that Justice Barbaro applied considerable effort in his deliberations and issued a written decision," Simpson said in the decision. As a result, Barbaro says, he ignored evidence that Kagan had acted out of fear and not hatred.
