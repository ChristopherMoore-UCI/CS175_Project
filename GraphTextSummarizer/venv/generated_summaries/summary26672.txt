A man charged in the "Fast and Furious" death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry has been extradited to the United States from Mexico, the Justice Department said. But officials couldn't track the firearms, and most are believed to have ended up with cartels and gangsters in Mexico. Terry was killed in a confrontation with Portillo Meza and four others along Arizona's border with Mexico on December 14, 2010. He is also charged with second-degree murder, conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, attempted interference with commerce by robbery, using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, assault on a federal officer and possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. "This development brings us one step closer to achieving justice for a beloved agent who paid the highest price in protecting this country," U.S. Attorney Laura E. Duffy of the Southern District of California said in a news release.
