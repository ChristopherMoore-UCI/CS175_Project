I think it's a concern." Michael Waddington, a civilian lawyer who has represented U.S. soldiers in military murder trials, said Sunday's shootings in the villages in Kandahar province represented the worst of chilling incidents involving U.S. troops. "However, one can't help but wonder whether the recent spate of events, including the desecration of Taliban corpses by four Marines, the burning of the Quran by U.S. troops and now the slaying of Afghan civilians point to the toll that the Afghanistan war is taking. And there is another question circulating after Afghan President Hamid Karzai urged U.S. troops to withdraw from village outposts and international forces to hand over security control of the country by 2013 instead of the planned 2014. There has to be at least one aggravating factor -- such as the accused knowingly created a grave risk of substantial damage to U.S. national security -- in order for a death penalty proceeding. But what is clear is that the U.S. soldier, a staff sergeant in his 30s, faces grave accusations unlike others faced by Americans in Afghanistan so far.
