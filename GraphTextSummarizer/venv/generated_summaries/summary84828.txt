Murphy the hairstylist said Fawcett told her she owned one Warhol portrait and O'Neal owned the other. O'Neal: Warhol portrait of Fawcett 'is mine' Backing up O'Neal's story O'Neal's story was backed by other members of Fawcett's inner circle who testified for the defense this week. " After the Houston party, O'Neal said he received a call from Warhol, who said he was ready to paint Fawcett and asked if they minded if the television news magazine show "20/20" filmed the sitting. The university's star witness was reality show producer Craig Nevius, who said O'Neal stole the Warhol off the wall just days after Fawcett died.
