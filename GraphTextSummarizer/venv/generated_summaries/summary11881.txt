Then, in a mammoth opening number, he and Anna Kendrick were joined by Jack Black, who angrily hopped on stage to throw a sarcastic wet blanket over their hailing of "Moving Pictures," noting that the business is as much about "raising tents with tentpoles and chasing Chinese bucks" than it is about art. The film, about a onetime superhero actor -- played by Michael Keaton -- making a comeback bid through a Broadway play, was filled with unusual touches: filmed as if all one shot, scored with a jazzy-drum soundtrack, shaded with magical realism, largely the vision of director and co-writer Alejandro Gonzalez IÃ±arritu. "Birdman" soared late at the 87th Academy Awards, winning the big prize: best picture. "Ida" won best foreign language film.
