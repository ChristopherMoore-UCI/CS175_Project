Faustino lives 20 or so miles from Villa O'Higgins, but those miles are of the Chilean Patagonia variety. While Argentinean Patagonia can be barren and almost desert-like, Chilean Patagonia is rugged in the classical sense. The closet thing to an urban center is a place called Coihaique, in which more than half of the region's 100,000 residents reside, and smaller frontier settlements are home to fewer than 500 people, such as Villa O'Higgins where Faustino sells his livestock. Due to the increased road access, the area developed a nascent yet thriving adventure-tourism industry based out of towns like Coihaique in the North and Torres del Paine and Punta Arenas in the South. Lake O'Higgins is located in the AysÃ©n region, one of the most remote areas of Patagonia.
