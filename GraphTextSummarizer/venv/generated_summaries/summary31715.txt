Stingrays prefer to bury themselves under the sand, with only their bulbous eyes remaining above the ocean floor, keeping a watchful eye out for predators such as Caribbean reef sharks or hammerheads. Years ago, Grand Cayman's popular North Sound has a cut in the reef which was a popular route for fishermen to enter and then sit in calm water while cleaning the day's catch. As tempting as it seems, care should be taken not to touch these wild creatures; rays have a protective mucous on their skins, and touching them can remove this coating, leaving them vulnerable to infection. This stretch of sandy seafloor in Grand Cayman's North Sound is the meeting place for southern stingrays hungry for a meal. Should they be attacked, rays have one weapon in their arsenal -- a serrated, venomous-sheathed barb, four to eight inches long, that can be used to ward off enemies or someone settling on top of them.
