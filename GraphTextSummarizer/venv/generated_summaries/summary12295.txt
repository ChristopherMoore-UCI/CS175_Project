"These record-breaking figures show just how popular football and the FIFA World Cup are across the world, from Japan to Argentina," FIFA TV director Niclas Ericson said. -- The 2014 World Cup in Brazil has shown the growing global interest in football, according to early broadcast figures released by the game's governing body FIFA . "The FIFA broadcast production of all World Cup matches makes this competition truly global and accessible for fans all over the world," Ericson said. FIFA said the first-round game between the U.S. and Ghana brought in 11.1 million viewers on ESPN, a record high for its coverage of World Cup matches. The first round of group matches have shattered TV viewing records worldwide and highlighted an increase in the amount of people watching football in countries that aren't known for their ardent fanaticism.
