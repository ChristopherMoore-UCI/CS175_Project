-- Lawmakers in Libya passed a law on Sunday banning senior Gadhafi government officials from holding official posts. "The events of last week have set a number of precedents -- the precedent that using arms to force the government to adopt a law or policy; the precedent of establishing non-equality of citizenship before the law, in effect creating classes of Libyans; and the principle that in the New Libya, people can and will be judged on the bases of general classification, not individual responsibility," said Hafed al-Ghwell, a former Gadhafi opposition figure and a Libya analyst. The siege of government ministries seems to have ended with the passing of the law, but many Libyans are concerned about the implications of the vote. "(The law) violates human rights and Libya's provisional constitution because it allows for guilt by association rather than provable misdeeds. The desire to ban corrupt and abusive officials is understandable, but this law is deeply flawed," said Hanan Salah, Human Rights Watch's Libya researcher.
