Rampant Juventus In Italy, defending Serie A champion Juventus thumped Lazio for the second time this season, winning 4-1 in Turin. And on Saturday, while Lyon fell 2-1 at Evian to suffer a fourth straight defeat in all competitions, PSG scored twice in injury time to see off a spirited Guingamp and move a point behind idle league leader Marseille. "A lot of disappointment with this loss and this bad start to the game," Lyon midfielder Fares Bahlouli told the club website. With millions pumped into the squad by its Qatari owners, PSG ended a 19-year title drought in France last season and looks set to challenge for league honors and on the European front for some time. Lazio, routed by Juventus 4-0 in the Italian Super Cup, had midfielder Hernanes sent off in the 63rd minute for a handball offense, although Juventus was already leading 3-1.
