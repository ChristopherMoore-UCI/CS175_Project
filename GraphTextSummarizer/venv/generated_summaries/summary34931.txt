Serbia led 2-1 going into the deciding day, following Troicki's five-set win over U.S. Open doubles finalist Rohan Bopanna on Friday and Saturday's doubles victory for Ilija Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic. Both teams were missing their best players for the tie, with world No. 3 Novak Djokovic -- who led Serbia to victory over France in the 2010 final -- and Indian doubles pairing Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi having opted out. Meanwhile at the WTA Malaysia Open, Australia's Jelena Dokic won her first title on the women's tour since 2002 when she beat world No. 31 Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic. The U.S. team will now face 2008 and 2009 champions Spain in the last eight, after the team lead by world No. 1 Rafael Nadal and comprising of two other top-10 players David Ferrer and Fernando Verdasco, booked their place in the final after racing to a 3-0 lead over Belgium in Charleroi on Saturday. Philipp Petzschner was the hero for Germany after the world No. 67 defeated big-serving Ivo Karlovic of Croatia 6-4 7-6 7-6 in their tie's deciding rubber in Zagreb.
