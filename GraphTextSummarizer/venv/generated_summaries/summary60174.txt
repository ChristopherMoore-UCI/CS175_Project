Russia: 'Absolutely legitimate' Russian officials have compared Crimea's potential departure from Ukraine to Kosovo's secession from Serbia after many years of bloody civil war with its former neighbor. The new pro-Russian government on the peninsula in Ukraine's southeast said Tuesday that if the voters opt to join Russia, the first step will be to declare Crimea an independent and sovereign state. -- U.S. President Barack Obama and Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk had strong words for Russia on Wednesday as Washington again warned Moscow there will be consequences if it doesn't remove its troops from Crimea and Kiev said that it will "never surrender." G7 tells Russia to back off The G7 -- the world's leading industrial powers without Russia -- and leaders of the European Council and Commission issued a strongly worded statement calling on Russia to "cease all efforts to change the status of Crimea contrary to Ukrainian law and in violation of international law." The G7 nations -- the United States, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy and Japan -- had already suspended preparations for a planned G8 summit in the Russian city of Sochi in June in response to Russia's actions in Ukraine.
