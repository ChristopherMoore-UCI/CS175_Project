But at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, several major manufacturers were putting the waterproof credentials of their devices ahead of more conventional selling points such as processor power. British company P2i, a few stands away at Mobile World Congress, uses a similar process, but works directly with manufacturers, rather than consumers. The company, which is working with Motorola and about 100 other manufacturers, says it has used its Aridion nano-coating technology to waterproof more than 9 million electronic devices, including mobile phones, tablets and hearing aids. Spokesman Myeonghwan Yeom said: "Not every manufacturer has waterproof phones, and this is so easy to use. "You can also take photos under water, and none of the major phone manufacturers have worked out how to do that yet."
