There could also be benefits for the green fingered, says Melki, who could turn a profit growing and selling olives and citrus fruits, which thrive in Beirut's Mediterranean climate. The lack of greenery has contributed to poor air quality and trapped heat, among a host of other environmental issues, claims architect Wassim Melki. Challenging though it sounds, Melki's proposal does not involve complicated drainage systems or engineering. "We want to cover the top of nearly every building in the city with trees," said Melki. "Planting trees in the ground is always preferable, and nothing can replace a wide open space to walk through," said Melki.
