And other prospective Republican 2016 candidates -- including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas â€” have been supportive of sentencing reform for nonviolent drug offenders. Following the 2012 presidential loss, in which Republican nominee Mitt Romney won only 6% support among African Americans and 27% among Latinos, Republicans have been more vocal about making changes to the criminal justice system for nonviolent offenders -- an issue that resonates deeply within minority communities. Holden added that Koch also wants to address voting rights for former offenders and make it easier for nonviolent offenders to find employment after completing their sentences. According to the newspaper, Koch's interest in criminal justice reform originated from a lengthy, expensive case defending his company, Koch Petroleum Group, against 97 felony indictments involving alleged environmental crimes at an oil refinery in the 1990s. Charles Koch, the billionaire GOP donor whose money plays a big role in shaping Republican campaign efforts, said he plans to make criminal justice reform a priority of his as the country heads into the next presidential election.
