Trujillo explains that a bona fide planet is big enough that other objects in its orbit will be sucked into it gravitationally. "Nothing that we currently know in the solar system can make objects that are so distant all the time, that never come close to any of the planets," Trujillo said. The dwarf planet's current name is 2012 VP113, and it is located in a  "wasteland or badland of the solar system," said astronomer Chad Trujillo, head of adaptive optics at Gemini Observatory in Hawaii and co-discoverer of this object. But in terms of average distance from the sun, there is a dwarf planet even farther out: Eris, which Trujillo helped discover. Beyond Neptune is the Kuiper Belt, a doughnut-shaped ring of small objects, which extends from about 30 to 55 AU, according to NASA.
