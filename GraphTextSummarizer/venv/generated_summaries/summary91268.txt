-- Incumbent Evo Morales declared victory in Bolivia's presidential vote Sunday. All of them want to vote," said Alvaro Colom, a former Guatemalan President who's heading a mission of election observers from the Organization of American States. Amid rumors that former NSA contractor Edward Snowden could be on his presidential plane last year, authorities in several European countries refused to let the aircraft land to refuel on its way from Moscow back to Bolivia. "The distance between Evo Morales and the rest is so great, that obviously I don't expect a surprise," economic analyst Carlos Toranzo told CNN en EspaÃ±ol. Since Morales took office, the country has seen economic growth while many of its neighbors have struggled.
