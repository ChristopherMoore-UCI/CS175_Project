Echoing sentiments also expressed by James Clapper, the head of U.S. intelligence services, Obama said the government "underestimated what had been taking place in Syria" during its civil war, allowing Syria to become "ground zero for jihadists around the world." Speaking in a taped interview with CBS' "60 Minutes," Obama said the terrorists were remnants of al Qaeda in Iraq, which after being diminished by U.S. forces "went back underground. The "no boots on the ground" mantra was questioned Sunday by House Speaker John Boehner, who said if local forces aren't trained to battle ISIS quickly enough, U.S. troops would be required. The White House has remained adamant there won't be any U.S. combat forces deployed in Iraq or Syria, though military "advisers" have been sent to Iraq in the hopes of fortifying local security forces. "And that's why what we have to do is, rather than play whack-a-mole and send U.S. troops wherever this occurs, we have to build strong partnerships," Obama told "60 Minutes." Aides to Obama have been careful to underscore that the military operation in the Middle East won't resemble the wars of the past decade, which left many Americans skeptical of intervention abroad. Obama claims he doesn't need Congress' permission for the air campaign under way in Iraq and Syria, citing the 2001 authorization to go after al Qaeda.
