The senator from Texas, who burst into the national limelight with his staunch opposition to Obamacare and his willingness to shut down the federal government, presents a direct challenge to the expected bids of establishment Republicans such as Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- candidates Cruz coyly refers to as the "mushy middle. Not all in the audience were guaranteed Cruz supporters: Several attendees sported red "Stand with Rand" shirts, repping Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who is slated to announce his candidacy early next month. Sen. Ted Cruz, the conservative firebrand from Texas, became the first Republican to announce his campaign for the presidency, and he spent Monday morning telling a crowd at the largest Christian university in the world to imagine what the country will be like when he takes office, and pitching his personal history as a key part of his campaign. While popular in conservative and tea party circles, Cruz has a long way to go in terms of broader support in the GOP base, according to public opinion polls. Jason Miller, an adviser to Cruz's campaign, confirmed that the campaign's fund-raising target is $40 million, and the campaign believes it can raise $1 million in the first week.
