"The evidence demonstrated that Goodling violated department policy and federal law and committed misconduct by considering political or ideological affiliations" in Justice Department appointments, the report says. The 140-page report represents the culmination of a yearlong investigation by the department's inspector general and the Office of Public Responsibility, which monitors the conduct of Justice Department attorneys. In a brief statement, Gonzales said, "Political considerations should play no part in the hiring of career officials at the Department of Justice." Goodling, who resigned from the Justice Department last year, may have jeopardized her ability to practice law. In her testimony, Goodling admitted that some of her decisions "may have been influenced in part based on political considerations." Kyle Sampson, former chief of staff to Gonzales, also came in for criticism for considering politics in hiring, as did Goodling's predecessors, Susan Richmond and Jan Williams, who served as White House liaison. The only individual cited for misconduct who remains with the Justice Department is John Nowacki, who told superiors Goodling had not used political affiliation to select candidates when he knew that she had done so.
