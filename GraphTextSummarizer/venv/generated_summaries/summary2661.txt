Still, it remains far away from land -- the closest being the Cape Verde Islands off Africa, some 345 miles (550 kilometers) away, with the closest Caribbean islands about 3,000 miles away. Tropical Storm Ophelia, meanwhile, is slightly more powerful and significantly closer to the Caribbean and the coastal United States. Ophelia's movement is described as "erratic," as it heads in a general west-northwest direction at around 12 mph and is then expected to turn more northwest on Monday. -- A new named tropical storm, Philippe, formed Saturday in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean, the National Hurricane Center reported. As of Saturday evening, there were no coastal watches or warnings in effect for either Ophelia or Philippe.
