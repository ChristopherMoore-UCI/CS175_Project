Amassing more grand slam titles will only strengthen Sithole's profile, said De Jager, who rose to No. 11 in the world in doubles after overcoming a heart condition at birth. " Sithole and Wagner -- who are occasional doubles partners -- developed a rivalry in 2013, meeting nine times in singles since the end of May, and more battles are expected next year given they are the top two in the quads rankings. Prior to his accident -- Sithole said he preferred "not to go back there" when the incident was brought up in this interview -- he hadn't seen anyone play tennis. "Lucas is fortunate that people in South Africa have already recognized athletes with a disability probably stronger than other countries," says Sithole's coach, Holger Losch. Judging by the welcome he received in Johannesburg following his historic victory in New York in September, Sithole is well on his way.
