The documents, compiled by the U.S. Joint Task Force at Guantanamo Bay, show that: -- A network of al Qaeda recruiters was able to operate in Yemen with virtual impunity. His brother was also an al Qaeda fighter and he allegedly had ties to several al Qaeda members responsible for the attack on the USS Cole in 1998. Several religious institutes in Yemen were fertile al Qaeda recruiting grounds, according to the documents. Mohammed al Ansi would later train for an aborted al Qaeda operation in southeast Asia to hijack airliners and crash them into U.S. military bases in the region. It soon transpired most of the "Dirty Thirty" were from Yemen, a country where al Qaeda has an even greater presence today than it did before 9/11.
