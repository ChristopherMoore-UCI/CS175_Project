Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, described dozens of people falling to the ground after government forces fired on them using heavy machine guns. Syrian forces carried out a siege Tuesday at Raqa University in northern Syria after a massive demonstration and fired live ammunition at a college student demonstration in Aleppo, the Local Coordination Committees said. Dissidents accuse the Syrian regime of staging attacks to smear the opposition and to try to link rebels to terrorist groups such as al Qaeda. The attack on the vehicles happened around the same time government forces opened fire on a nearby funeral procession, according to opposition groups. Throughout the uprising against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria has blamed the violence on "armed terrorist groups."
