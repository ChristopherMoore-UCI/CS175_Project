-- As part of a "rebalancing" with Asia, the United States will enhance military-to-military cooperation with China while also boosting the capabilities of its allies in the region, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said Saturday. "I reject that view entirely," Panetta said, calling the U.S. shift "fully compatible with the development and growth of China. Along with enhanced military cooperation, Panetta emphasized diplomacy and a "rules-based order" that includes "open and free commerce, and open access by all to their shared domains of sea and air" -- a current point of friction in the South China Sea between China and regional nations. Why the Chinese are flocking to U.S. colleges The increased regional involvement by the United States has raised concerns about tensions with China and suggestions it represents a threat to China. Indeed, increased U.S. involvement in this region will benefit China."
