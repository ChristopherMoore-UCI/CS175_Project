" Craigslist chief executive Jim Buckmaster released a statement saying the activities took place in 2008, "well before Craigslist eliminated erotic services and commenced manual screening of all ads posted to adult services. The bookers for the company "continuously created and posted prostitution advertisements on Craigslist's erotic services section because the more current the post, the more prominently the ad was featured on Craigslist," the statement from Cuomo's office said. Room Service Entertainment posted advertisements for its services every day on Craigslist's erotic services section, the indictment said. Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office said the group ran a 24-hour prostitution ring called Room Service Entertainment from Craigslist's erotic services section from June 2007 to December 2008. "Until Craigslist gets serious about putting real protections in place, it will continue to be an environment where criminal operations thrive with impunity," Cuomo said in a written statement.
