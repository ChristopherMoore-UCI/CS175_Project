But how much concern over weight gain is about vanity and how much is about critical health issues? On Monday's "Larry King Live," Kathy Ireland and Bob Greene joined Larry to talk about the subject, prompted by Kirstie Alley's well-publicized battle with weight. Kathy Ireland says she's more concerned about what weight gain does to her health than her appearance. King: Is fluctuating weight like Kirstie Alley bad, Bob? Greene: Larry, with your foundation and what you are doing to make heart health at the forefront of everyone's mind, and Bob with your information about healthy living, it is so important.
