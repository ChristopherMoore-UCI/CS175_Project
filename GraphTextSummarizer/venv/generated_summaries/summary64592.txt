Earlier that day in February 2013, authorities say he gunned down two men who were trying to help him at a firing range: Chris Kyle, subject of the hit film "American Sniper," and Kyle's friend, Chad Littlefield. Jodi Routh said she had asked Kyle to help, telling him that her son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. From inside the jail where Routh has spent the last two years, he spoke with a writer from the New Yorker Magazine three months after the shootings Routh can be heard saying he was annoyed at Kyle and Littlefield. Kyle and Littlefield took Routh to the firing range as a kind of therapy. Routh's trial comes just weeks after the release of the film about Kyle, a former Navy SEAL who claimed to be the deadliest sniper in U.S. history, with 160 confirmed kills in Iraq.
