For those having to wait in the terminal, airport operator BAA built T5 with 112 shops and restaurants, including British chef Gordon Ramsey's first airport eatery. " "I've been very critical of the airport," BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh told CNN. "The greatest stations, whether it is New York or London, the 19th century stations did exactly that." BA rival Virgin Atlantic calls it a gift for BA. Supporters say expansion is vital for London's economy, but environmentalists say expanding London's three main airports -- Heathrow, Gatwick, and Stansted -- will only add to harmful climate change.
