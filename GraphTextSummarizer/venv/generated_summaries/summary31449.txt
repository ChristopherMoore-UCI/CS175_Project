Winans, pastor at Perfecting Church on Detroit's east side, officiated at Houston's 1992 marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown. Winans told WDIV about the last time Houston performed at the Fox Theatre in Detroit. "If you scratched the surface it didn't take you long to find out that she still was that little girl from New Jersey," he told CNN Detroit affiliate WDIV. The musical Winans family group hails from Detroit. While many of her fans lamented the fact that Houston's service was invitation-only, Winans thanked Houston's mother for having the service at the church.
