"The Syrian regime, backed by Iran, allowed ISIS to proliferate so that they could present the U.S. and Europe with a 'devil you know' choice" -- pushing against U.S. calls for al-Assad's ouster amid the nation's bloody civil war, argues Rebecca Abou-Chedid of the Truman Project. "I bet you U.S., Saudi and Jordanian officials are working 24 hours a day to try to convince these leaders to join their alliance, and to in turn convince their counterparts to stand up against the Islamic State." Analysts: It's up to the Saudis "Saudi Arabia is the only authority in the region with the power and legitimacy to bring ISIS down," two analysts write in The New York Times. Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian American Council, believes Iran is even better equipped to fight ISIS than Saudi Arabia is. Given U.S. tensions with both Iraq and Syria, incorporating them into a joint effort against ISIS will be "very complicated diplomatically," notes Christopher Chivvis of Rand Corporation. Having Saudi Arabia "in the lead can only add to the legitimacy of the campaign against ISIL," said Dennis Ross, a former U.S. ambassador who is now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
