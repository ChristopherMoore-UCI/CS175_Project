Although Gibson died over a decade ago, aged 76, King remains keen to publicize the seminal role she played in the sport of tennis and how she inspired a generation of black athletes to pick up a racquet. For Billie Jean King and tennis fans around the globe, however, Gibson will always be best remembered as a towering figure of their sport. -- Over the course of her remarkable life, Althea Gibson was many things to many people -- an accomplished jazz singer, a saxophone player, an actress and the first black woman to play on the professional golf circuit. Gibson inspired prominent black players including three-time men's grand slam winner Arthur Ashe, 1990 women's Wimbledon finalist Zina Garrison and modern day greats like the Williams sisters. In many ways it did, but it's sad that more people don't know about her (Gibson) and who she was."
