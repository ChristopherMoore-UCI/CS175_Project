The revelations come as part of an in-depth interview between PBS's Charlie Rose and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg. (Mashable) -- Mark Zuckerberg says he asked Steve Jobs about how to build a high-quality team and great products, but denies Apple and Facebook ever talked about an acquisition. " Zuckerberg professes respect for Apple because, like Facebook, it is out to build a company that will change the world rather than fatten the bottom line. "I mean, nor would I have wanted to sell it." Sandberg and Zuckerberg then start talking about how Jobs never raised the issue because he understood that Zuckerberg had no interest in selling. The extensive interview covers all of the bases, such as whether Facebook will ever build games (no, Zuck says) and what Zuckerberg thinks of Google+ (he calls it "their own little version of Facebook").
