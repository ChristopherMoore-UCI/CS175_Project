In the blast-oven heat that stifled much of the nation in recent days, the absence of air conditioning felt anguishing. According to the Carrier Corp., the pioneering air-conditioning manufacturer, as late as 1960 few college buildings featured air conditioning, and virtually no elementary or high schools had it. Air conditioning? Window units were available, but by 1965, according to Carrier, only one out of 10 U.S. homes had central air. It wasn't until the 1920s that movie theaters featured early versions of air conditioners, which proved to be an enormous draw for the public who yearned to escape their broiling homes.
