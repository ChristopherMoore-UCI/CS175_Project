Many films that play primarily to African American audiences (or really, any niche audience) drop quickly in their second week -- Perry's last three "Madea" films have fallen by an average of 60 percent in their second weekends -- but "Red Tails" may avoid a similar fate. The strong debut came out of 2,512 theaters, which gave "Red Tails" a hefty $7,604 per theater average, the second-best in the Top 20. Her new movie, "Underworld Awakening," a 3D fourth installment of the popular vampires vs. werewolves franchise, debuted in first place with $25.4 million, good for a $8,252 per theater average. In second place, George Lucas' passion-project "Red Tails," a $58 million film starring Terrence Howard and Cuba Gooding Jr. that chronicles WWII's African-American Tuskegee airmen, took off with $19.1 million in its first three days. (Another well reviewed action film, "Drive," earned a similarly unenthusiastic "C-" grade a few months back.)
