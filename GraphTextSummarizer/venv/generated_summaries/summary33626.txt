U.S. President Barack Obama called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to express his condolences over the Jerusalem bombing and his concern about the attacks against Israel from Gaza, the White House said in a statement. -- Eleven rockets were fired into Israel from Gaza on Thursday, a day after a fatal terrorist bombing in Jerusalem killed a woman and wounded more than 50 other people, the Israel Defense Forces said. Kuperwasser said Thursday night's strikes were aimed at trying to prevent more attacks on Israel. In response to the rocket attacks, the Israeli military launched airstrikes in Gaza on Thursday night. He met with his Israeli counterpart, Ehud Barak, who said Israel will not "tolerate" terrorist attacks.
