Under Saudi law, women are subject to numerous restrictions, including a strict dress code, a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man's permission to travel or have surgery. The woman's sentence provoked outrage in the West and cast light on the treatment of women under Saudi Arabian law. Al-Lahem had previously told CNN that the Saudi judge revoked his license as punishment for speaking to the media about his client's case, which attracted international attention. He said the council charged with deciding law license revocations had not issued any decisions in the case. The Saudi lawyer who represented a woman kidnapped and raped by seven men said his license to practice has been reinstated.
