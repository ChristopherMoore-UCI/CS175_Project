The skeleton of a wooden boat found off the coast of Iwaki, Japan, that spills delicate pieces of porcelain from its hull is recreated piece by piece by the people who helped excavate it. However, the work he displayed -- Rent Collection Courtyard, a replica of famous Chinese socialist-realist sculpture -- upset artists of the original piece in Shanghai who believed it diminished the sentiment behind the original work. "In any country, in any city, there will be political influence on what is said, what kind of images are to be projected and, yes, of course artists can be and are influenced by politicians," he told CNN. "Some works of art have material other works have form, but this piece has something additional, it has a narrative, it has a story that is just as important as the material and form itself. For the cars the energy goes inward out and for the tiger piece the energy flows in," he told CNN.
