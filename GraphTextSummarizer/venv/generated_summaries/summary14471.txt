This, China analysts say, signifies that Xi has become the most powerful Chinese leader since the death of Deng in 1997. All these events have prompted much talk not just on Deng but also on Chinese president Xi Jinping. The 110th birthday of former Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was celebrated on August 22 with an exhibition, a television biopic, and a series of national events. "If you look at what he does and how he does it, I don't see much Maoism," said Ezra Vogel, a retired Harvard professor and author of the book "Deng Xiaoping and the Transformation of China." "I see much more of Deng Xiaoping." Vogel recalled how Xi chose Shenzhen as the site of his first "inspection tour" as president.
