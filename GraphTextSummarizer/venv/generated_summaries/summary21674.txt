Described by his Cesura colleagues as young, idealistic and very passionate, Rocchelli lived and breathed photography and storytelling. These children hiding in Slovyansk, Ukraine, are looking at the camera of Andrea Rocchelli, a young Italian who died while photographing their stories. Rocchelli was barely 30 years old when mortar shells obliterated his convoy in May near Slovyansk. "Andy was a very sincere person," said Luca Santese, who co-founded Cesura, a collaborative photo agency. Photographing these children in dark bunkers and hiding spaces, Rocchelli creates a womb-like image that highlights the purity of childhood versus the ugliness of war.
