Sudal said he has a degree in environmental science and supports conservation efforts. But when you move to Nantucket and start wrestling sharks on the beach, people take notice. But Sudal has also received a wave of criticism over his captures, including concerns about injuries to the shark. When Sudal finally got the shark onto the beach, he kept it for about a minute and posed for some photos before sending it back into the ocean. Reeling in bluefish or bass just doesn't excite Elliot Sudal anymore.
