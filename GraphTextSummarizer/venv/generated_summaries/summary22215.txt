During his last run, he says, "I saw others who were sitting members of Congress or the Senate, who would still receive the paycheck plus all their benefits that I helped pay for, and yet never had to show up for work to get the check!" Mike Huckabee is releasing a new book as the former Arkansas governor prepares for a potential 2016 presidential run, and it covers everything â€” from reality television to government surveillance (in a curiously-named chapter "Bend over and take it like a prisoner!"). He gushes over Mitt Romney, calling him "a good man with impeccable integrity in his personal and business life," praises Rick Perry for recruiting businesses to come to Texas during his time as governor, and defends his work with former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Common Core. Huckabee also name-drops Lady Gaga twice. Huckabee says that he's "generally admired the parenting instincts of the First Couple," but is appalled that they let their daughters listen to Jay-Z and Beyonce's "Drunk in Love."
