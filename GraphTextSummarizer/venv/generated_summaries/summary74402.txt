Collier County investigators are traveling to Port-au-Prince on Tuesday to interview Damas, the statement said. The FBI's legal attach√© in the Dominican Republic notified Collier County authorities that a man believed to be Damas was taken into custody Monday by the Haitian National Police. Authorities have not said how the five were killed, but Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk described the scene as "horrific." The body of Damas' wife, Guerline Damas, 32, was found Saturday in the family's North Naples, Florida, home, along with those of the couple's five children -- Michzach, 9; Marven, 6; Maven, 5; Megan, 3; and Morgan, 11 months, police said. The judge who signed the warrant ordered that Damas be held without bond upon his return to Collier County, authorities said.
