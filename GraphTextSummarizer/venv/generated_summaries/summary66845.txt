London police have already recovered some of the electronics taken from Winehouse's home, according to a Metropolitan Police spokeswoman. -- Burglars broke into Amy Winehouse's London home early Thursday and took away several valuable guitars, recording equipment and a flat-screen TV, according to her spokesman. It was an easy mark for intruders who may have known Winehouse has been away for weeks on a Caribbean vacation, spokesman Chris Goodman said. Husband Blake Fielder-Civil earlier this month asked his lawyer "to commence divorce proceedings on the grounds of Amy's adultery," said his lawyer, Henri Brandman. " When the Grammy-winning singer is in town, "it's the safest street in London," he said.
