-- A Cuban dissident who testified before Congress via video link from Havana last week was detained and beaten two days later, his wife said. In spite of being warned of the risk of reprisals, Jorge Luis García Pérez, known as Antúnez, testified last Thursday, describing repressive conditions for dissidents in Cuba. Reached by phone in Cuba, Yris Tamara Pérez Aguilera said her husband was beaten in his cell and rendered unconscious by pepper spray. She has since been released, she said, but her husband is still being held by Cuban authorities in Santa Clara. According to another activist who was also incarcerated, she said, "the state security agents told him, when they were attacking him, that he was going to pay very dearly for what he did." Representatives for the Cuban government in Havana, Washington, and New York did not reply to requests for comment.
