Health.com: 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day Mothers, who are usually the primary caregivers in a household, may have little time to prepare healthy meals for themselves in addition to what they fix for their children, and so they may be apt to fall back on quick-and-easy processed foods such as macaroni and cheese, says Jerica Berge, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis. "Moms might be having multiple time demands and have to sacrifice making healthier meals," she says. The average BMI was one point higher among moms than among childless women, whereas fatherhood appeared to have no association with BMI. For the mothers, less exercise and less-healthy diets added up to a higher BMI, a ratio of height to weight used to estimate body fat. When it comes to exercise, raising kids appears to cut into workout time for both parents.
