-- A Paris prosecutor has asked for corruption charges against former President Jacques Chirac to be dropped, courthouse press representative Sylvie Polack confirmed Tuesday. Chirac was accused of misuse of public funds when he was mayor of Paris, from 1977 to 1995, before he became president. The prosecutor also asked for nine other people charged along with Chirac to be acquitted Tuesday. He was accused -- along with the other defendants -- of using public money to pay people to work for his political party, the RPR, and to pay others to perform jobs that did not really exist. Chirac, now 78, had immunity from prosecution during the 12 years he was president of France, from 1995 to 2007.
