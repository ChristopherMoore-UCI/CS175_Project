Ruetten sees fast food as a symbol of class divide, much like Caravaggio unconventionally relied on lower classes of Roma people, laborers and even prostitutes to pose for many of his works. During the Renaissance era, food often appeared in popular works of art by way of still-life paintings, and painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio is often heralded for elevating the seemingly simplistic genre with dramatic lighting, angles and imperfections. Photographer Rebecca Ruetten was inspired by the "eroticism, presentation and charisma" of these paintings by Caravaggio and artists like Luis Melendez, Diego Velazquez and Pieter Claesz, so she decided to approach a distinctly modern phenomenon -- fast food -- in the Renaissance-era style. "Fast food is created to attract, but everybody knows the food they order will -- in the end -- never look like the food in the advertisement's photo," Ruetten said. "It underlines the concept that they are 'children of the modern age,' having been brought up in the changing America, often defined by the culture of fast food," Ruetten said.
