Read more: Ready for Egypt's 'second revolution?' Two people were shot dead Thursday when armed men attacked the Muslim Brotherhood officers in Zagazig, Morsy's hometown, spokesman Gihad Haddad said. Four members of that Islamist group -- which was banned under Mubarak but has risen to power since his fall, most notably in the form of President Mohamed Morsy who has been in office for a year -- have been killed in recent days. Friday's move follows deadly clashes in Alexandria and elsewhere, many of them targeting Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. Morsy's speech "only deepens our resolve to press our demands for early presidential elections in order to achieve the aims of the revolution, most important of which is social justice," the statement said. But the largest opposition umbrella group said Morsy did not address his shortcomings, and issued a statement calling for snap presidential polls, a new government and constitutional amendments.
