Many modern women like myself believe in empowering women to make the choices they want to make, and that many women would choose a career and marriage and motherhood, too. While I understand Patton's desire to have young women feel more comfortable admitting whether they want motherhood in addition to (or in the absence of) a career, I wondered if her delivery, and her words, are doing more to set modern women back. Kelly: Do you feel misunderstood by many women who are criticizing you and who say you are setting women back? Kelly: You talk about "Marrying Smart" and spending more time in college to find that right person, but you have to believe it's also very important for women, at the same time, to be fulfilled and find what they want because their marriage could end; 50% of marriages end in divorce. Patton: In my experience, I certainly agree that modern women today do want marriage and motherhood.
