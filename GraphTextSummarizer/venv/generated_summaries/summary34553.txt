Economic indicators suggest it is slowly emerging from six years of recession, with unemployment figures released Friday showing a slight dip from 27.2% in December, to 26.7%. The figures come after demonstrators across the world took to the streets for May Day, or International Workers Day. Youth unemployment across the euro area has also dropped slightly, but remains highest in Greece, at 56.8%. Greek unemployment remains the highest in the eurozone, above Spain at 25.3%. Greece, bailed out in 2010 then again in 2012 at a combined cost of 240 billion euros, returned to the bond markets in April, raising three billion euros on robust demand.
