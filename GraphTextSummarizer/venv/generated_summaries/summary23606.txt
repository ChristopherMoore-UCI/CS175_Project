Infrared cameras on a boat accompanying the rig as it was being towed detected no signs of leakage early Monday, according to the unified incident response command, which includes the Coast Guard, Alaska's state environmental conservation department, a drilling company and Kodiak Island officials. The 266-foot-diameter Kulluk arrived at Kiliuda Bay, off Alaska's Kokiak Island, about 10 a.m. (2 p.m. ET) after being towed some 45 nautical miles in the previous 12 hours, according to the team, which includes representatives of the U.S. Coast Guard, Shell, the state of Alaska and the Kodiak Island government. While it was being towed, the Kulluk was accompanied by a Coast Guard cutter and two oil-spill response ships, the incident response team said. -- A Royal Dutch Shell oil-drilling barge that ran aground last week off southern Alaska arrived at a harbor Monday with no sign of any fuel leaks, an incident-response team reported. The rig had been working in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska's North Slope.
