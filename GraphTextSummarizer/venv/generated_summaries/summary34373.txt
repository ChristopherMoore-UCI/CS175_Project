"We have much, much more information on which to base the crucial decision as to which embryo is the one to transfer back to the patient." Embryos that show early abnormalities can be immediately ruled out, and learning algorithms have been created that recognize positive or negative patterns at key development points thereafter -- meaning patients can be implanted with embryos that have an optimal chance of success. "The images also allow you a higher level of assurance to pick an embryo with the highest chance of being genetically normal," says Dr. Jason Barritt, lab director at the ART Reproductive Center, in California. "I think this is the most exciting breakthrough since IVF started," says Dr. Simon Fishel, managing director of the UK's CARE Fertility, responsible for the first Embryoscope baby born in the UK, in 2012 (as well as the first ever IVF baby back in 1978). The extra information is particularly beneficial for patients with the lowest chances of pregnancy -- such as older women, or those with reduced egg counts. But since the inception of IVF in the 1970s, monitoring embryos has been a difficulty.
