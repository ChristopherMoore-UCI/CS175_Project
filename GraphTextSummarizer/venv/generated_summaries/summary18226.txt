-- Sixteen-year-old Valery Bianco and his 13-year-old sister Marina Bianco take extra care in preparing and wrapping their shoe box gifts for "Operation Christmas Child." That first year, Operation Christmas Child collected 28,000 shoe box gifts. For Marina, the shoe box gift came when she needed it the most. " As Marina started her own shoe box to send, she included a coloring book, a toothbrush, hard candy, a ball and a puzzle. Those shoe boxes were the first gifts that Valery and Marina received during their life at a Russian orphanage.
