Senior Brotherhood leader Issam Al-Arian is quick to reassure them they are all partners in a new democratic Egypt. "What's wrong with good organisation?" said Abdel Aziz Zaid, production manager at an industrial printing press in Cairo and Brotherhood member. In 2006, when a ferry sank between Saudi Arabia and the Red Sea port of Safaga carrying more than 1,000 workers from Upper Egypt, the Brotherhood rushed relief supplies, only to have them blocked by the government. In a country where the sheer mass of people sometimes overwhelms creaking government services, the Brotherhood has won praise for its ability to create order out of chaos. When it became clear Mubarak's days were numbered, the Brotherhood's presence in Tahrir Square increased steadily.
