The woman is a "possible victim" of sexual assault by Bill Cosby, Officer Jane Kim said, adding it is an open case but declining further comment. The new accusations could further sully the reputation of Cosby -- the man behind children's programming such as "Fat Albert" and "Little Bill," and whose eponymous No. 1 sitcom, "The Cosby Show," cast him as a wisecracking, doting family man. Hefner responded to the allegations in a statement Friday, saying "Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening. She said she told her supervisor soon afterward and was told no one would believe her because Cosby and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner were good friends. Los Angeles police are investigating a sexual assault claim against Bill Cosby, a police spokeswoman said Friday.
