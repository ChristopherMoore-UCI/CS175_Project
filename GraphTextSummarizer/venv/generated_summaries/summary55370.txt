Suspected jihadist militants opened fire on Israeli troops near the Israel-Egypt border Wednesday afternoon, wounding a female officer and a male soldier, the Israeli military said. A post on the Israeli military's Twitter account said that the troops were hit by "fire directed at them from Egypt." Israeli military spokesman Peter Lerner later said only that the attack happened close to the border, near Esoz. Lerner did not say whether the Israeli military returned fire. He said more Israeli forces were being sent to the area, and the people who live in the area should stay in their homes.
