" Jakosky's team will use the spacecraft's three instrument suites to try to meet three key objectives: â€¢ Determine the composition of upper Martian atmosphere â€¢ Determine how fast Mars is losing what's left of its atmosphere â€¢ Determine the history of the atmosphere MAVEN won't make a cool, daring landing like the Mars Curiosity Rover, which has been roaming Mars for more than a year now. It's called MAVEN, which stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution. Interactive: Mars exploration from Viking to MAVEN New spacecraft will find out "MAVEN will fill in a very big gap in our understanding of the planet by exploring the upper atmosphere and its influence on the Martian environment," principal investigator Bruce Jakosky, from the University of Colorado, says on his NASA webpage. -- You may have heard it before: billions of years ago Mars probably looked more like Earth does now, with clouds and oceans and a much thicker atmosphere.
