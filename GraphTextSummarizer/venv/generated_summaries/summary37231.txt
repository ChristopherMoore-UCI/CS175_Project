Nonetheless, it seems unlikely human sommeliers will be out of a job in fine restaurants any time soon, since their skills tend also to include knowledge of wine regions, service, glasses -- and the all-important wine jargon. Using sensor systems and mathematical processes, the electronic tongue can currently distinguish between three types of cava -- brut nature, brut and medium dry -- researchers at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona say. Scientists in France have in recent years developed an electronic "nose" which can pick up chemical signals to detect different types of wine and where they were made. "Sommeliers are not just about wine recommendations and tasting abilities, they are about being personable when a customer comes in the door. The scientists have aimed to reproduce human senses by developing biosensors to obtain chemical information and using computerised systems to interpret that data in the way the human brain and nerve system would.
