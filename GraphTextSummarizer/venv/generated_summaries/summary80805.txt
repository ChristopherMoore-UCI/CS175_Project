But she faces a long rehabilitation, said Dr. Bill Kelly, hospital epidemiologist for Greenville Hospital System, last week. The recovery for such infections typically requires four to six weeks of inpatient rehabilitation, followed by weeks of outpatient rehabilitation, he said. "Her leg wounds are healing well, and she's making excellent headway on therapy," said Dr. Kevin Kopera, medical director for Roger C. Peace Rehabilitation Hospital in Greenville. Kuykendall was moved last week to the rehabilitation hospital, where she was in good condition, hospital officials said. Kuykendall was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis on May 11, four days after giving birth, and taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital.
