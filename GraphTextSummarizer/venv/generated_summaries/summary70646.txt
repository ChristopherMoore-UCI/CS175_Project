I concur with the American gun lobby that gun control amounts to an obvious restriction of individual liberties. There are eight categories of weapon, ranging from automatic hardware and machine guns which are prohibited, to hunting equipment allowed with a hunting permit. Will Newtown change America's attitude toward guns? As a reporter in the United States, I sometimes had to smile at my prudish European state of mind, when I saw, for example, members of the Blood gang in Los Angeles casually eating their pizza, their guns visible in their belts, or every time I pass by the weapons counter at Walmart where families buy guns as if they were shopping for the nearby kitchen appliances. They are still rarely used, and to most French people, they belong in a parallel world.
