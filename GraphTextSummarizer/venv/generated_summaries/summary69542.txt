-- FIFA President Sepp Blatter said Monday his organization would ban for life any players and administrators found guilty of match-fixing. Player Method Mwanjali was one of five athletes who told a ZIFA inquiry last year that he accepted bribes in return for losing matches against Thailand and Syria in 2009. They will not be allowed back into football," Blatter told reporters in Harare, as he wrapped up a one-day visit to Zimbabwe. FIFA security chief Chris Eaton arrived in Zimbabwe ahead of Blatter on Sunday. Besides meeting with the country's football administrators, the FIFA president met with President Robert Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai during his one-day visit.
