The news release, sources said, would be about the latest development on Bo Xilai, the popular but controversial official who last month was sacked as Communist Party chief of Chongqing, China's biggest metropolis. Hours before the news release Tuesday, Chinese sources say, Communist Party officials, from the top tiers of leadership down, were told of the impending news in closed-door briefings. The terse news item identified Bo as "Comrade Bo Xilai," signaling that he has not been expelled from the party, but said Bo is still under intra-party investigation. Finally, at 11 p.m., China's mainstream official Xinhua new agency announced that Bo had been stripped of his top Communist Party posts for an unspecified "serious breach of (Communist Party) discipline." Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, and family aide Zhang Xiaojun have been arrested in connection with the mysterious death of British businessman Neil Heywood.
