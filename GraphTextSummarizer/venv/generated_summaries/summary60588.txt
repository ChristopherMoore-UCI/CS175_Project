Department stores such as Wal-Mart and Asda have been regular targets for consumer campaigns, but have continued to thrive through their ability to undercut competitors with lower priced goods. "Social media has made the world more transparent so bad news travels faster and spreads further," says Jonathan Hemus, founder of reputation management company Insignia Communications. Given the volume of online opinion, much of it from anonymous critics that could be trolls or competitors in disguise, companies need not always take heed of it. " In some cases, companies have chosen to court controversy and prospered, such as with Ryanair and its combative Chief Executive Michael O' Leary who has often seemed to relish confrontation but posted record profits nonetheless. A pristine reputation may also be of lesser importance to larger brands, that are better insulated against reputation damage.
