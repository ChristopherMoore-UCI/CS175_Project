"Car Talk" debuted in 1977 on Boston radio station WBUR and was picked up by NPR 10 years later. The show consists of the two brothers, who own a Cambridge, Massachusetts ("our fair city," as they've long called their home), garage, taking calls from listeners about their automobile -- and sometimes relationship -- problems. New "Car Talks" will be assembled from archival material, the brothers wrote. On Friday, hosts Tom and Ray Magliozzi, known as "Click and Clack, the Tappet brothers," announced that they would be retiring from the popular NPR program in October. Â That's right, we're retiring," Tom added, noting that "Car Talk" is celebrating its 25th anniversary on NPR this year.
