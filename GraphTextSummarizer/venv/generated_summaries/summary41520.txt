Moreover, China wants the EU to give it market economy status, which would reduce the tariffs for Chinese products sold in the eurozone. How China can really help Others say that China's real opportunity to help isn't through bailing out Europe, but investing in the EU and boosting domestic consumption of European products. China is scheduled to get market economy status by the World Trade Organization in 2016, and observers say it's likely the EU will wait until then.

Most people think the Europeans are coming to China hat in hand hoping for bailout funds.
