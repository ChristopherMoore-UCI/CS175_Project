Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, left, with President Robert Mugabe. "He had wandered off and was found later in the pool of the house," said Tsvangirai spokesman James Maridadi. The retreat was attended by Tsvangirai, President Robert Mugabe and government ministers. The 2-year-old grandson of Zimbabwe Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai drowned in a swimming pool, barely a month after Tsvangirai's wife died in a car crash, according to his spokesman. The child, Sean Tsvangirai, was at Tsvangirai's house in Harare when he was found drowned in a swimming pool Saturday afternoon.
