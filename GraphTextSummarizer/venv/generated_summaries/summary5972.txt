He's going to have more opportunity those weeks coming up." World No. 1 Rafael Nadal, who is assured a place at the London finals, moved into the Shanghai quarterfinals with a 6-1 7-6 (7-5) victory over Carlos Berlocq on Thursday. As a semifinalist last year, the 32-year-old will lose points in the race for the eight places in London. Mayer, meanwhile, will next face French seventh seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who kept alive his hopes of qualifying for London by beating Japan's Kei Nishikori 7-6 (7-5) 6-0. Defending champion Djokovic, meanwhile, booked his place in the quarterfinals with a 6-3 6-3 win over Italy's Fabio Fognini. He was the losing finalist in Basel last year, but skipped the French event so can potentially gain points there.
