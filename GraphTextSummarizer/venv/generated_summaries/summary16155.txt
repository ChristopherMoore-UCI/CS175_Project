"In the absence of credible judicial oversight," Human Rights Watch said, "the Chavez government has engaged in often discriminatory policies that have undercut journalists' freedom of expression, workers' freedom of association and civil society's ability to promote human rights in Venezuela." Human rights organizations have frequently accused leftist President Hugo Chavez of intimidating or punishing citizens based on their political beliefs. In February, the commission issued a 319-page report accusing Venezuela of routinely violating human rights. The Chavez government has routinely denied any allegations of human rights abuses, saying that authorities arrest citizens only on suspicion of breaking the law. The commission believes that conditions do not exist for human rights defenders and journalists to be able to freely carry out their work." The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is an independent arm of the Organization of American States.
