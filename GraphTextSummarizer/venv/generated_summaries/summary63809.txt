Two former World Wrestling Entertainment wrestlers are suing the WWE, alleging their old employer ignored or downplayed signs of brain damage and other injuries while it raked in millions. "WWE's representations, actions and inactions have caused its wrestlers to suffer long-term debilitating injuries, lost profits, premature retirement, medical expenses, and other loses," the suit states. As a result of his wrestling injuries, the suit alleges, LoGrasso suffers from serious neurological damage, which includes severe headaches, memory loss, depression, anxiety and deafness. The suit, which is dated January 16, is seeking damages to be determined at trial and medical monitoring. WWE forces wrestlers to do stunts "in a matter that dramatically increases -- often to a near-certainty -- their chances of sustaining brain damage," the suit says.
