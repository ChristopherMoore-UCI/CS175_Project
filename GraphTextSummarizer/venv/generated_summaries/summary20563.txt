And more importantly what did those people who are persecuted and whose human rights are violated in Cuba get in return for America now opening up its economic and travel doors, and (granting) full diplomatic relations with the power and majesty that that has to have an American embassy in your country," Christie said during the hour-long interview Monday night with New Jersey anchor Steve Adubato on the PBS television station NJTV. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sharply criticized President Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba, saying he did not get enough out of the deal. Following up on a letter that he sent to the White House over the weekend, Christie said it was incomprehensible that Obama went ahead with the change in diplomatic relations with Cuba given that leaders within that country have granted asylum to Joanne Chesimard, who escaped from prison after she was convicted of slaying a New Jersey state trooper in the 1970s. The New Jersey governor declined, however, to weigh in on the handling by New York City leaders of this weekend's shooting of two New York City police officers.
