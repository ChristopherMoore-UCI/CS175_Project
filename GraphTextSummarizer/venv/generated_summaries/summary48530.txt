"What 'Lindsay' succeeds most at is, for the first time in years, convincing us that Lindsay Lohan isn't a name in an Us Weekly headline or a joke in a late-night monologue or a character in a drama so wild it can't possibly be real life," Fallon writes. On Sunday night, the 27-year-old made her latest comeback attempt in the OWN network's "Lindsay," a docu-series that came across in its first episode as part "E! True Hollywood Story" and part "Intervention," with a dash of "Hoarders." -- After all the arrests, court appearances, trips to jail and rehab stays, Lindsay Lohan has turned to reality TV. Maybe for fans of Lohan's (and she does still have them, as "Lindsay" proved by chatting up strangers on the street about the actress) or the compassionately voyeuristic. Lohan had to know when she signed up for "Lindsay" that she was leaving herself wide open to this wide-ranging barrage of reactions, especially to comments like the one she made about a past jail stint.
