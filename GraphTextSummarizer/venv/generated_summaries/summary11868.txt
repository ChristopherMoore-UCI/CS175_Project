The Israeli spokesman said the military targeted a "terror-activity center" in northern Gaza and a "weapons manufacturing facility" in central Gaza. The Israeli military launched airstrikes in northern and central Gaza early Sunday, said spokesmen for the Israel Defense Forces and Hamas. The military said that more than 235 missiles, rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israeli territory in 2010. The second strike hit an old house in central Gaza, he said. A security official for Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that controls Gaza, said the northern strike hit an airfield that Hamas uses for military training.
