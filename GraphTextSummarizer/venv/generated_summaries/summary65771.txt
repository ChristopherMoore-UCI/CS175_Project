Now, under relaxed restrictions announced just over a year ago, couples like Yang Xue and Chang Zi'an, both professionals working in Beijing, are eligible for a second child to join their baby girl -- 11-month-old Tao Zi, or Little Peach. And they want to send little Tao Zi to a private bilingual English and Chinese pre-school to help her in the ultra-competitive Chinese education system. Since the early 1980s, the Party has enforced a draconian one-child policy on most Chinese to curb population growth. In January 2014, China said it would allow couples to have a second baby if the mother or father was an only child themselves. " Chang and his young family live in Tongzhou, on the eastern outskirts of Beijing, where high rise apartments compete with mega malls.
