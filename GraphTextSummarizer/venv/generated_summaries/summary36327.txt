"The death toll has hit 11 people, including three attackers and five security personnel, while the rest were civilians," said Gen. Mohamed Yusuf Omar Madale, a Somali police spokesman. Police official Yusuf Ali said Wednesday that the first suicide car bomb exploded outside the main gate of the Jazeera Palace Hotel, and the second blast came as first responders began gathering to evacuate the injured. The Jazeera Palace Hotel is near Mogadishu airport and it is frequented by government officials and diplomats. Those killed included Abdulkadir Ali, the Somali government's former acting envoy to Britain better known as "Dhub," said Abdirahman Omar Osman, a presidential representative. At the time of the Mogadishu blasts, there were several senior members of the Somali government inside the hotel.
