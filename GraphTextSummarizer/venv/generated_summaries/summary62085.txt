Mid-thick cuts of potato get dunked in duck fat to provide both their rich flavor and crispness, and an order covers three seasoning and sauce combos: rosemary herb accompanied by a side of spicy ketchup; onion-dusted with sour cream sauce; and smoked paprika with smoked barbecue sauce. -- If you crave fries in San Francisco, Jasper's Corner Tap is a natural choice. At this family-run stalwart, the mountain of fries that comes in even a small order borders on the ridiculous -- so no wonder the college kids keep coming back. Since its 2011 debut, Jasper's has won a following for its bar offerings, including a menu devoted exclusively to fries. It's no secret that French fries served crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, are the golden standard.
