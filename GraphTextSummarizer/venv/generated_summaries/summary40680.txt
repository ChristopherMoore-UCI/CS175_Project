Q&A: Lamb of God's Randy Blythe on Imprisonment and Freedom Concertgoers testified in February and on Monday that Blythe had violently pushed 19-year-old Daniel Nosek off the stage during the band's concert in Prague on May 24, 2010, using both hands. A panel of Czech judges ruled Tuesday that concert promoters -- and not Lamb of God frontman Randy Blythe -- were largely to blame for the tragic death nearly three years ago of a teenage fan of the metal band, saying the singer's actions did not constitute a crime. Lamb of God Singer Randy Blythe's Manslaughter Trial Resumes in Prague Crucially for Blythe's defense, the expert said that had the teenager been pushed, he would not have fallen beyond the first row of fans, as two witnesses had testified. Nonetheless, the judge said, Nosek must have known that stage-diving was not permitted, as there was a barrier in place and security personnel who had prevented other fans from climbing over it. " "This has been a very sad and emotive experience for me, but I've tried to remain as objective as possible because my emotions have no impact on what is for me and for the family of Daniel Nosek the most important thing: the truth," said Blythe.
