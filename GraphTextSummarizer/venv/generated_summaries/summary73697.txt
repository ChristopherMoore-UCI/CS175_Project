The author of the amendment, Rep. Chris Carney, D-Pennsylvania, said, "Our military men and women deserve only the best equipment and it has become clear that Federal Prison Industries cannot meet the standards required in manufacturing helmets." She said if the company resumes helmet production, it will voluntarily submit to competitive bidding. The company is one of several major manufacturers of combat helmets. Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR, has also agreed to waive preferential status that gives it right of first refusal on U.S. government contracts. And this company has quit making helmets right in the midst of an investigation by the Department of Justice."
