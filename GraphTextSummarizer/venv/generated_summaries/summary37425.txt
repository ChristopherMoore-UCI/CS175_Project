We believe this incident is all connected to some known relationships," Anne Arundel County police spokesman Lt. T.J. Smith told CNN affiliate WBFF. Three people were found dead inside a home in Glen Burnie, Maryland, early Sunday morning after a reported shooting around 1:35 a.m., police in Anne Arundel County said. Earlier this year, WBFF said, he earned praise from local officials for helping a lost toddler find his way home. Hoffman was a third-generation member of the fire department who had worked for the city since 2006, Baltimore Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal said in a statement, according to WBFF. "Preliminary investigation indicates that the suspect/shooter was one of the deceased and that he had a relationship with the female victim," police said.
