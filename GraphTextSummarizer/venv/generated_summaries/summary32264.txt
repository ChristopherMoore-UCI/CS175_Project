Assailants hurled Molotov cocktails at the headquarters of one of Hong Kong's largest media companies, Next Media and at the residence of its founder and former chairman, media tycoon Jimmy Lai in the early hours on Monday morning. Lai, a fervent China critic and staunch supporter of the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, resigned as chairman of Next Media shortly after the protests sites were cleared in December. Next Media and its founder, who retains a majority -- 73% -- stake in the company, are known to be critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, and have been targeted in several attacks. A week after the attack, two masked men set fire to bundles of the Apple Daily newspaper, a Next Media publication, in an intercepted delivery van, according to the Guardian, a British newspaper. For several days in mid-October, a group of protestors blocked the entrance of a printing plant that published Apple Daily, in attempt to prevent the pro-democracy newspaper from reaching newsstands.
