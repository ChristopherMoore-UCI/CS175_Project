"We need the help of the people we were founded to serve to put on our season this year," Steel had said, speaking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere. The company, dubbed "The People's Opera" by former New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said. The New York City Opera received critical praise for its world premieres of works including Robert Ward's "The Crucible" and Anthony Davis' "The Life and Times of Malcolm X." It opened its current season on September 17 with the opera "Anna Nicole," which turned out to be the company's last production. This year marked the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943 as the second opera house in the city. The fat lady finally sang when the New York City Opera filed for bankruptcy on Thursday after the company fell short of an emergency fund-raising goal of $7 million.
