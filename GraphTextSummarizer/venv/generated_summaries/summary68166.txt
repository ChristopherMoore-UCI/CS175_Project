"It takes 20 minutes for a signal to reach Mars which is too slow for good control from the Earth," said Justin Byrne, head of Earth observation and science at Airbus Defence and Space. ESA's Mars Express is still in orbit around the Red Planet and has been sending back data for 10 years. ESA is planning two missions as part of its ExoMars program to shed more light on whether Mars could ever have supported life and in preparation for a possible sample return in the 2020s. Exploring Mars is a tough challenge. "We are going to Mars to look for signs of life -- and this is an important step towards that goal," he said.
