China Central Television reported that the November death of Neil Heywood, a family friend of ousted Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai, has been ruled a homicide. Bo was once seen as one of the rising stars of Chinese politics. The British government had sought a new investigation into the death of Heywood, who was married to a Chinese woman and had lived in China for more than a decade. The British strategic information consultancy Hakluyt and Co., a company formed by former officers of the spy agency MI6, has said it and other Western companies had sought Heywood's advice on doing business in China. "However, they had conflict over economic interests, which had been intensified," Xinhua reported, citing unspecified Chinese authorities.
