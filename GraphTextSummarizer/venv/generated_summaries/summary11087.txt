-- Ever since we saw him pop up on "The Walking Dead" last season, we've been wondering: Does Eugene really have the cure for the show's "walker virus"? Also, we talked mullets: CNN: Were you surprised at the truth about Eugene, or were you told ahead of time? CNN: What do you think of Eugene's true motivation? We spoke to Josh McDermitt, who plays Eugene, about his time on "The Walking Dead" and what might be next for the character (that is, assuming he's OK after being beaten up by Michael Cudlitz's Abraham). Eugene looks at himself as not having anything to offer to the group.
