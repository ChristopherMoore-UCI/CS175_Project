Clinton angered Palestinian leaders during her stop Saturday in Jerusalem when she praised Israel for what she called "unprecedented" steps to limit -- but not fully halt -- the construction of Jewish settlements. Clinton met with Aboul Gheit and other Egyptian leaders before consulting Wednesday with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. "President Obama, special envoy [George] Mitchell -- who is here with me today -- and I are all deeply and personally committed to achieving a two-state solution and comprehensive peace between Israelis, Palestinians and all of their Arab neighbors," Clinton said at a joint news conference with Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Ali Aboul Gheit. Egyptian leaders told Clinton her statement was perceived as "a sort of backtracking" and "listened with great interest" as she insisted the U.S. opposition to settlements has not changed, Aboul Gheit said. But Palestinian frustration over Clinton's statement in Jerusalem and the stalled peace process was still on display Wednesday in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
