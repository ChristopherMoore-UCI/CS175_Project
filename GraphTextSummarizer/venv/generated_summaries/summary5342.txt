Authorities in Northern Virginia on Thursday busted an alleged violent gang and arrested the accused ringleader and four others on charges of forcing high school girls to be prostitutes. Officials from the U.S. attorney's office, the Virginia attorney general's office and others say Strom and his associates recruited high school girls to work for them as prostitutes and vowed violence if they tried to leave. The defendants, most of whom were arrested overnight, were scheduled to appear in federal court Friday afternoon in Alexandria, Virginia, on charges that include underage sex trafficking. The amounts of money involved were generally small, with prostitutes often receiving $50 for performing sexual acts. The alleged ringleader is identified in court documents as Justin Strom, 26, of Lorton, Virginia, a suburb of Washington.
