Raquel Nelson's trial is set to begin October 25, according to an order filed by Cobb County State Court Judge Kathryn Tanksley on Tuesday. Nelson on Tuesday was sentenced to 12 months of probation and 40 hours of community service, but Tanksley also gave her the option to seek a new trial. Nelson told NBC's "Today" on Monday that the jurors who convicted her probably couldn't relate to her because she is a single mother and they don't regularly use public transportation or need to walk on busy streets. The case also attracted attention from transportation advocates, who said Nelson was treated unfairly because transportation planners fail to take into account the needs of pedestrians when designing roads. Nelson and one of her two daughters also suffered minor injuries.
