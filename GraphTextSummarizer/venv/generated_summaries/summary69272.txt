And if you don't cool off quickly -- by going into an air-conditioned building or drinking cold water, say -- heat exhaustion can sometimes turn into heat stroke. The condition can cause problems in the muscles, kidneys, liver, brain, and heart, and people with heat stroke often start to breathe quickly and behave erratically, Bergeron notes. Research that Bergeron took part in has shown that even if kids are well hydrated, they can overheat and even experience heat stroke if they exercise too intensely and get hot too quickly. If your only option is to exercise outdoors despite the torrid weather, you can take some steps to avoid problems such as dehydration, cramping, heat exhaustion, and -- because air quality gets worse on hot, muggy days -- breathing trouble. In extreme cases heat stroke can be deadly.
