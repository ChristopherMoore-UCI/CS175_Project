If you take aspirin for your heart, but have not had a previous heart attack, you are engaged in an off-label use of drugs right now: FDA-approved labels only mention aspirin as a remedy against recurrent heart trouble. The FDA applies bright line rules, backed by criminal penalties, to an area of science where the lines are not bright at all. The FDA tells pharmaceutical companies what they may say about their products. Yet many doctors recommend aspirin as a prophylactic for everyone at risk of heart disease. For example, FDA-approved advertising will recommend aspirin only for those who have had one heart attack already, but many doctors recommend aspirin prophylactically for people at risk for a first attack.
