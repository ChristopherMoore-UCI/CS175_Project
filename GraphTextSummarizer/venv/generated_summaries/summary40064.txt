Neville patrols Fifth Avenue in his Mustang with Sam, a German Shepherd (also immune to the airborne virus), broadcasting into the void, then returning home to his Washington Square townhouse to put up the shutters before nightfall. Wisely dispensing with the Luddite rhetoric that bogged down "The Omega Man," "I Am Legend" doesn't have much time for Neville the soldier. Will Smith plays the survivor of a plague in "I Am Legend." Cool and athletic, focused and unflappable, he's not someone who's going to give up on humanity just because the odds are stacked against him. In fact, he's scored consistently well in sci-fi, from "Independence Day" through "Men in Black" and "I, Robot," and there's no reason to suppose the tense, scary "I Am Legend" won't continue that impressive box office run, even if the movie itself flags on the last lap. Cut to New York three years later: abandoned cars, no one in sight, grass growing waist-high around Times Square.
