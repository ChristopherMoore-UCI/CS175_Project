In its Federal Register notice, the DOT also tried to clear up some confusion regarding rules that require airlines to give "specific baggage fee information" on websites, and require carriers to provide "specific charges" on e-ticket confirmations. Airlines must disclose baggage fees on e-ticket confirmations. Airlines must post changes in baggage fees on their websites for three months. -- Where refunds are due, airlines must provide prompt refunds of fares and optional fees. Airlines must prominently disclose all potential fees on their websites, including fees for baggage, meals, canceling or changing reservations, and advanced or upgraded seating.
