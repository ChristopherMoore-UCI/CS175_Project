"We don't know much about these near-death experiences," says Dr. Harold Koenig, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences, and head of the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health at Duke University Medical Center. While near-death experiences (NDEs) were once thought to be rare, researchers now estimate that about a third of those who come close to death, or approximately 5 percent of the American population, experience an NDE, according to Dr. Bruce Greyson, professor of psychiatry and director of the Division of Perceptual Studies at the University of Virginia Health System. Most religious groups don't have a position on near death experiences, explains Sandra Yocum Mize, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Religious Studies at the University of Dayton. "There is, for example, no official Catholic position on near death experiences," she says. Dr. Sam Parnia, author of "What Happens When We Die," thinks that NDEs are hallucinations brought about by the brain shutting down, or a comforting psychological phenomenon summoned up by patients as death approaches.
