Brain scans may identify which patients suffering from mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, are likely to progress to Alzheimer's disease, and who will probably not develop the disease, according to a new study.

The images of patients with Alzheimer's showed many areas throughout the brain where the cells and tissue have begun to deteriorate or have already died.

The findings, published in April 2009 issue of the journal Radiology, could help in developing new drugs for Alzheimer's.
