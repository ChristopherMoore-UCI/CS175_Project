The crew notified the service that the woman had gone overboard about 750 miles northeast of Hilo, the 14th Coast Guard District in Honolulu said. The ship changed course to search, and an HC-130 Hercules airplane crew was en route from Air Station Barbers Point in Hawaii, the Coast Guard said. -- An American cruise ship passenger was reported overboard Wednesday, and the U.S. Coast Guard joined the search in the Pacific Ocean northeast of Hawaii. The Grand Princess was on day three of a 15-day cruise round-trip sail from San Francisco to Hawaii. It said it immediately contacted the FBI and the Coast Guard.
