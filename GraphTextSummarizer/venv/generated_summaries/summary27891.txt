Mark Gongol and his wife and daughter were traveling from Des Moines to Denver aboard a United Boeing 737. " Gongol strapped himself in and did what he could to help get the plane to the airport in Omaha. After Gongol and his family got off the aircraft, they simply "slinked out the back door," with the Air Force pilot feeling confident he'd done all he could to help. Although he never suspected he would have to fly the plane, piloting a B1B bomber isn't too different from a 737, Gongol explained. Gongol, who pilots B1B Lancer bombers, already could tell something was wrong.
