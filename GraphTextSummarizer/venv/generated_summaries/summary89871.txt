Shea was torn down in 2008 to provide parking space for the New York Mets' new Citi Field (123-01 Roosevelt Ave., +1 718 507 6387), but there are plenty other non-Beatles attractions nearby, particularly the space age relics of two World Fairs (Grand Central Parkway, +1 718 760 6565). Amsterdam Newlyweds John Lennon and Yoko Ono began their 1969 honeymoon with a highly publicized "bed-in" at the Amsterdam Hilton (Appollolaan 138, +31 710 6000), where they invited the press into their room to promote "bed peace" and "hair peace." He and the Beatles, however, paid several other significant visits to the city. The band stayed at the Balmoral Club, a hotel on Nassau's Cable Beach now renamed the Sandals Royal Bahamian (West Bay Street, Nassau, +1 242 327 6400).
