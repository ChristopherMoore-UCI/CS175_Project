President Barack Obama took his economic relief plan on the road to Colorado Wednesday, highlighting new measures designed to help college graduates manage student loan debt. Another measure is designed to encourage graduates with two or more kinds of federal loans to consolidate them and get a small break on interest rates. While college costs are rising, employment prospects for new college graduates are dimming. Congress passed a law set to go into effect in 2014 that would drop the monthly payment for loans originated that year to 10% of discretionary income and would forgive all debt after 20 years. The other proposal would encourage graduates with two or more kinds of federal loans to consolidate their loans, giving them a small interest rate break of 0.5%, according to Barnes.
