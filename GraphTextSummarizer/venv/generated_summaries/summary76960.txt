"I imagine it's much like being in the presence of the actual movie star -- you will get to sit where they did, walk where they did, maybe even look at memorabilia if the crew were allowed to take pictures," says Nicci Perides, editor of search site Charterfleet.com, which features Lady M and other film boats.
