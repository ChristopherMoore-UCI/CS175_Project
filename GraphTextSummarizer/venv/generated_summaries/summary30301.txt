Khan could not say how many people were on the ferry when it sank early Tuesday in southern Bangladesh. Ferry accidents are common on Bangladesh's vast river network. Khan, the police chief, said Tuesday that divers from the Bangladesh navy and the Fire Service and Civil Defence took part in the operation alongside police and the Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. The 55-year-old survivor said he "jumped into the river and was rescued by people in another passing ferry." Dewan and his family were traveling to Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital, to see his brother-in-law off to the United States. -- At least 112 bodies have been recovered after a packed ferry capsized in Bangladesh, police said Wednesday.
