Despite all the challenging news, thousands of industry professionals and eager music fans turned out for the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival in Austin, Texas, over the weekend. The festival brought in an estimated $103 million to the Austin-area economy in 2008, and though this year's numbers have yet to be tabulated, SXSW representatives expect the amount will be on par with last year. If the turnout at SXSW 2009 is any indication of consumers' willingness to spend money on music, then record label executives have reason to be hopeful. In spite of a few complaints from Austin residents, SXSW can provide an amazing opportunity for a lucky few whose acts get picked up by industry folks. Almost 2,000 artists played SXSW this year, which is about a hundred more than last year.
