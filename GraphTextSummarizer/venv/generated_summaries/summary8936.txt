More than two dozen Free Syrian Army officials have signed the documents, just days after an uproar over reports that a unit called the Tawheed brigade claimed responsibility for executing pro-regime members of the Berri clan in Aleppo, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. The pledge calls for shunning "any form of torture, rape, mutilation, or degradation," preserving prisoners' rights, rejecting "physical torture or murder of prisoners or informants," and says army members should "not participate in any public execution. The reported executions last week highlighted fears that rebels are intent on revenge killings and sectarian retribution. The rebel battalions and commanders battling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime are signing a "code of conduct" pledging to refrain from torture and other human rights abuses, an opposition group said Wednesday. The al-Assad regime has been widely condemned for torture and other human rights abuses.
