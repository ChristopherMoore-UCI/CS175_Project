And as Justice Kennedy, Justice Alito, Justice Scalia, and Justice Sotomayor all recognized today...we have 5 years of data on gay marriage versus 2,000 on traditional marriage. It suggests the Court may look for a narrow decision, possibly just affecting California, on whether states can ban gay marriage. We have very little data on the effects of same sex marriage and - for example - the effects on child rearing. Look, I support gay marriage from a policy/voting booth perspective. And I suspect including gay marriage under the umbrella of "marriage" will strengthen families.
