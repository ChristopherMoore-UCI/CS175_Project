In addition to pushing for diplomatic efforts to remove al-Assad from power, Clinton backed a proposal last year to provide weapons to Syrian rebels when she served as secretary of state. "Had President Obama and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton acted then in support of pro-democracy forces when that rebellion was taking place, we could have removed Assad and helped usher in stability for that country," former U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum said in a statement last week. She adhered to the White House line on Russia's proposal earlier in the day that Syria relinquish chemical weapons to international control to avert a possible U.S. military strike, which Obama is trying to get Congress to approve. Clinton also issued warnings in January shortly before leaving office about Iran's involvement in Syria, saying the country was providing al-Assad's regime with military supplies.
