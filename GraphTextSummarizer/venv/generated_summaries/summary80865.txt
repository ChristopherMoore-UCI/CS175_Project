-- Passenger David Martin knew the situation on Virgin America Flight 404 was unraveling Saturday when members of the flight crew began snapping at passengers. See Martin's visual posts from flight on Kontain.com Martin said the situation did not improve until the flight was finally canceled, 4Â½ hours after it parked at Stewart and nearly 12 hours after it took off from Los Angeles International, during which time passengers say they endured shortages of food and water, crying babies, panic attacks and rising tensions. "Carriers, faced with increased operational difficulties as a result of constrained runway capacity just at the time the new tarmac delay rule goes into effect, and with the prospect of incurring $27,500 per passenger in fines, will inevitably cancel flights during challenging operational situations," the airline's DOT request said. "Although we cannot control the weather or the circumstances, we agreed that we needed to have done a better job with making our guests more comfortable in a difficult situation," Virgin America spokeswoman Abby Lunardini said in an e-mail. On Sunday night, Martin says he received a phone call from Virgin America CEO David Cush telling him that he'd seen his posts and expressing apologies.
