-- President Barack Obama, speaking at auto plants here Friday, praised the recovery of the embattled U.S. auto industry and celebrated the tough choices he says made a comeback possible. In the 12 months before he took office, Obama said, the U.S. auto industry had lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and had seen its sales drop 40 percent. Today, U.S. automakers have added more than 55,000 jobs since last June," said Obama, speaking at a Chrysler plant. "Last year, many thought this industry would keep losing jobs, as it had for the better part of the past decade. At the GM plant, Obama also stressed the need to develop and manufacture green technologies that would cut the country's dependence on oil.
