Investigators are now working to confirm the details of the suspect's statements and are gathering additional evidence to present in court, said Stein. The suspect was then extradited to St. Maarten, where he was arrested again upon his arrival, according to a statement from the St. Maarten Public Prosecutor's office. The first suspect, a 28-year-old Jamaican-born man identified as M.K.J., has confessed to his involvement in the murders, according to the island's solicitor general, Taco Stein. The killings occurred in what is generally considered a safe area that is popular with tourists, according to Stein. -- Police arrested Friday a third suspect in connection with the stabbing deaths of an American couple on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten
