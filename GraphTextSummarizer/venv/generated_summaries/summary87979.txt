Lower tax rates will reduce people's incentive to avoid tax and a simplified tax code should also provide fewer opportunities for avoidance in the first place. Tax evasion is illegal and cannot be condoned, but tax avoidance is when people devise mechanisms which contravene an interpretation of the spirit of the law but are nonetheless perfectly legal and intended wholly or primarily to reduce their liabilities. In the final report of the UK's 2020 Tax Commission, published earlier this year by the TaxPayers' Alliance and Institute of Directors, we reviewed literature by academics the world over and looked at tax changes introduced in a number of different countries to demonstrate the folly of punitively high tax rates. In the 2020 Tax Commission report, we also cite the work of Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva, who have looked at the effects of tax changes specifically on the richest one per cent, amongst whose number Mr. Arnault features in France: "The incomes of the top one per cent respond to taxes in three ways: (1) the standard supply-side channel through reduced economic activity, (2) the tax avoidance channel, (3) the compensation bargaining channel through efforts in influencing own pay setting. That lower tax rates increase the tax take has been demonstrated time and again in the real world: remember how JFK said in 1962 that "the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long term is to cut the rates now"?
