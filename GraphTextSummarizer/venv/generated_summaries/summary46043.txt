"I have a bunch of friends who work on Wall Street and there's a big link between college and there," says Billings, who earns his living by playing lacrosse and coaching for Canada's Toronto Rock team. The Virginia Lacrosse Alumni Network, to which Billings belongs, has helped hundreds of graduates reach Wall Street, while other schools boast similar systems. " While the "Lax Bros" continue to rule on Wall Street, Billings has trodden a different path away from the world of bankers and investors. The unofficial club has played a leading role in helping former college lacrosse stars walk into some of the biggest jobs in New York City. The growth of lacrosse and the rising profile of stars such as Rabil has convinced Billings that the sport is only going to get bigger and bigger.
