Janet and Fran's fight has temporarily changed national policy, making children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists. -- Sarah Murnaghan fully understands all she's been through: her lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis that led to her deteriorating lungs, the campaign her parents waged that temporarily changed national policy surrounding organ transplants, and the fact that she came so close to death in the days leading up to her two double lung transplants. " Janet and Fran are quick to call Sarah a fighter, even though anyone who meets her knows it from the start, and these days they have more confidence than they've had in months that they'll be able to see their daughter live out a life that's closer to normal. Speaking exclusively to CNN for the first time since the surgery, Janet and Fran Murnaghan say 11-year-old Sarah could be discharged from Children's Hospital of Philadelphia as early as Tuesday. Today, spirits are vastly different than they were two months ago, when Sarah -- who's had cystic fibrosis since birth -- was in dire shape after being on the waiting list for pediatric lungs for 18 months.
