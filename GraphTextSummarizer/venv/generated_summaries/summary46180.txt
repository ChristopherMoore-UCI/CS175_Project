Zhou Kehua -- one of the country's most wanted criminals -- was killed by police in the southwestern city of Chongqing on Tuesday morning, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Described as "ruthless and highly dangerous" by Chinese authorities, Zhou became infamous for robbing people while they were drawing money from banks and repeatedly dodging police manhunts. Later that day, local police reported that a railway policeman was killed while in pursuit of a man believed to be Zhou -- his ninth victim in eight years following a series of robberies in Chongqing, Nanjing and Changsha. Zhou was eventually tracked down in Shapingba, a mountainous district on the outskirts of Chongqing, after police uncovered a cave on Monday that Zhou is believed to have stayed in. Thousands of police and soldiers were drafted in over the weekend to search for the 42 year old after a woman was shot dead and two others injured on Friday outside a bank in Chongqing during an attempted robbery, Xinhua said.
