During the last century, China experienced how nationalism led to xenophobia during the Boxer Rebellion in the early 1900s -- when groups of peasants banded together to rid the country of foreign influences -- and the Cultural Revolution (1966-76), when Mao Zedong attempted to reassert revolutionary values in China by purging what he described as bourgeois influences. Foreigners were disparagingly referred "waiguo guizi" (foreign devils). Like most foreigners who lived in China in the 1970s, I saw a closed, xenophobic society riddled with ingrained racial stereotypes. "The crackdown makes sense in the light of the large number of illegal migrants that have made it into China, some of whom may have been involved in illegal or violent activities," said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University's Department of Science and Technology. The campaign has enlisted the help of the Chinese public, who can call a telephone hotline to report "suspicious foreigners."
