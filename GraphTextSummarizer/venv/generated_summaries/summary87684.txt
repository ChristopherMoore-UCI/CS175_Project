However, Capello is confident he has made the right choice for Russia's base in the town of Itu -- close to Sao Paulo -- for the forthcoming World Cup. The English media never holds back in its forensic analysis of England managers and Capello also faced criticism for the stifling security of the team's training camp at Royal Bafokeng Sports Complex. As it was with England, expectations in Russia are high for this year's tournament, but who are the other teams Capello is backing to do well this summer? "It's really important which physical condition the teams arrive at the World Cup," Capello told CNN's World Sport. But it is highly likely it won't be England who lift the World Cup in Rio this July, says their former boss Fabio Capello.
