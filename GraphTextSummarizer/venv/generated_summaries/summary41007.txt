"Sebastian was not the first great talent after Michael," explained Noack, who also coached a generation of German F1 racers that included Ralf Schumacher, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Nick Heidfeld. This year Vettel became one of just four men to win the F1 world title four times, and Noack predicts his former charge could one day surpass all Schumacher has achieved. Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel have won 11 world titles between them, winning renown across the globe for their record-breaking feats. "I got to know the Schumacher family, the father and mother," Noack explained to CNN's The Circuit in a rare television interview. It is a little ironic that after being introduced to karting by the Schumacher family, Noack would go on to mentor the man who is already well on the road to usurping Schumacher's place in F1 history.
