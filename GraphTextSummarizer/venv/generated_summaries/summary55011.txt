You won't be searched and there are no drug dogs patrolling Denver International Airport, but if you are searched for another reason, you could lose your weed and face a $999 administrative fine, Denver International Airport spokeswoman Stacey Stegman told CNN on Monday. "Passengers may be warned that if they are traveling into a state where marijuana remains illegal that they could face further consequences." Denver police, who patrol the huge airport, will decide if a ticket will be issued, just as if it were a speeding ticket, Stegman said. Airport officials have imposed a zero-tolerance marijuana policy to discourage them, Stegman said. Officers at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints will not look for marijuana in carry-on bags or travelers' pockets, but if they find it incidentally, it will be confiscated and airport police would be alerted, according to the TSA's published policy. " Colorado cities have authority under the new law to ban marijuana from public property, including municipal airports.
