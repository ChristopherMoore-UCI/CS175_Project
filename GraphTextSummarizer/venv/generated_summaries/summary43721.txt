As the bus sped downhill, the students could do little but hold onto each other before the collision, according to Police Lt. Kittikarn Klomlee, who said he'd spoken to survivors of the crash. Thailand has the second highest fatality rate from road crashes in the world, after Namibia, according to a report published this month by the Transportation Research Institute of the University of Michigan. The crash happened early Friday in Nadi district of Prachinburi province. Earlier Friday, a different local police official had incorrectly reported that 14 or 15 of the dead were children. -- Fifteen people, most of them children, were killed in central Thailand on Friday after the brakes failed on a bus taking them on a school trip, sending the vehicle careening into a truck, police said.
