British actress Emma Watson made an impassioned plea to women around the world: "Don't let anyone tell you what you can or cannot do, or cannot achieve. " In the audience, a man wearing a Hogwarts jumper asked Watson whether women should be paid the same as men, when they are more likely to take maternity leave. " Answering questions submitted via Facebook, Watson said the recent lack of female representation at the Academy Awards showed that the fight for gender equality was far from over. Almost 230,000 men and boys across the world have since joined the HeForShe campaign, including U.S. President Barack Obama, and actors Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Matt Damon. " And it's not just women affected by gender inequality -- men suffer too, she added.
