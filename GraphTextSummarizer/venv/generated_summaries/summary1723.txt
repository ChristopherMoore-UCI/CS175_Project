There will be time enough after President Obama leaves office for historians -- along with Bob Woodward and others -- to weigh the evidence and reach more studied conclusions about how wisely he and his White House team ran national security. The press likes nothing better than a food fight among top officials, so naturally enough, they weighed in on whether Panetta -- and other Obama heavyweights like former Defense Secretary Bob Gates, who had also written searching memoirs, had done wrong. White House aides and allies of the President were naturally upset to read some of the stinging comments by the former defense secretary and CIA director about the inner workings of the Obama administration. Within a few years, it became standard practice for White House aides to sit down regularly with Woodward to make sure their side of the story got out. For all the controversy, books by Leon Panetta, Bob Gates, Hillary Clinton and others offer invaluable guides.
