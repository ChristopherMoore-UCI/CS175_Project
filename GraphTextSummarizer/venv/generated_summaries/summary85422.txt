-- A Fort Lauderdale nurse has resigned and more than 1,800 patients have been notified that they may have been exposed to diseases such as HIV and hepatitis, after the nurse allegedly admitted to the hospital that she used disposable IV equipment on multiple patients, a violation of safety standards. On Friday, an attorney for Lan told CNN: "Ms. Qui Lan has been a registered nurse for over 37 years providing excellent medical care to all of her patients. This is what nurses go into nursing school for," Meyer said. The hospital believes the risk of exposure is low but said it's important for patients to be tested and will pay all necessary costs. We are confident that once the facts surrounding this incident are revealed, Ms. Qui Lan will continue to be seen in the same light.
