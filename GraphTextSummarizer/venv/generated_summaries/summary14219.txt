David and Janelle Shimshi 's lack of income has left them struggling to pay for daughter Shalom's preschool. Las Vegas magician David Shimshi used to work as house magician at the famous Mirage hotel and performed with the World's Greatest Magicians show at the Greek Isles Casino. Ner Tamid preschool director Lonnie Kritzler says she has been hearing from a family each week that a job is lost and tuition will be hard to make. They cancelled their home phone service, pool service, and a monthly pest control service that kept a scorpion problem in check. Shimshi's job these days is Mr. Mom, taking care of his 3-year-old daughter Shalom, while his wife Janelle works for a local caterer.
