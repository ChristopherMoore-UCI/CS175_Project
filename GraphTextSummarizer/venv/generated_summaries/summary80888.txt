NBC's "The Wiz," set for Thursday, Dec. 3, will again be executive produced by Sound of Music and Peter Pan duo Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, with Tony-winning director Kenny Leon attached to direct both the live event as well as the Broadway revival in 2016-17. Tony winner and Broadway icon Harvey Fierstein will contribute new material to the original book by William F. Brown and work alongside Zadan, Meron and Leon. The network on Monday announced that "The Wiz" will be its next live musical performance â€” with Cirque du Soleil boarding the project with plans to bring the show to Broadway in 2016. "We love this yearly tradition and we're more excited than ever to not only bring another Broadway musical to America's living rooms, but also see it land on Broadway as well," NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt said. As an actor, he's won Tonys for best actor in a musical ("Hairspray") and best actor in a play ("Torch Song").
