Several towns in Bulacan and Pampanga provinces, in Central Luzon, were under chest-deep water when continuous rains from Typhoon Nesat last week prompted the release of water from four dams around the area. Typhoon Nesat -- known locally as Pedring -- has claimed 55 lives, and the death toll from Nalgae -- known locally as Quiel -- rose to four Monday as rescuers found the body of a man who drowned in raging floodwaters in Bulacan province. But Nalgae still threatened to bring heavy rainfall and strong winds to China's Hainan island on Tuesday and is expected to dump heavy rain on coastal Guangxi province in the next two days, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. Typhoon Nalgae, which made a landfall on Saturday morning, aggravated the damage from Nesat as it cut a swath of destruction along the upper regions of Luzon island, directly hitting the crop-producing provinces of Isabela and Cagayan as well as the Cordilleras. Several dikes have also been breached in Pampanga province during Typhoon Nesat.
