The veteran series â€” NBC's highest-rated scripted show last season â€” returned Thursday night to not only its lowest premiere rating ever, but the show matched its lowest-rated episode ever. The Peacock has had a great few weeks launching freshman series like apocalyptic drama "Revolution" and Matthew Perry's comedy "Go On," as well as maintaining "The Voice" (See: Can NBC's fall ratings winning streak continue?), but last night suggests the network is going to have a rough time on Thursdays this fall. NBC was in third place last night â€” and CBS and ABC haven't even launched their fall lineups yet. One of the biggest surprises in the fall schedule was that NBC didn't change this lineup considering how much it was struggling last season. But this big of a drop is surprising considering how little competition was on the air and how much pre-season momentum NBC has had lately.
