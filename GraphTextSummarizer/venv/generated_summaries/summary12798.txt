" In statements to police, Amarillo allegedly said that he believed the victims were witches and were "performing voodoo and casting spells on him," Brown said in the statement. Carlos Alberto Amarillo, 44, allegedly called 911 early Wednesday and said "two females are dead, they were assassinated, hurry, they are dead," the Queens district attorney's office said in a statement. "The defendant is accused of the violent beating death of his girlfriend and her daughter -- who in fact was herself the mother of a young child," Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said in the statement. When police arrived at the home where the 911 call was made, Amarillo was walking from the doorway to the street carrying a Bible. They seemed like normal people; it just makes no sense." Amarillo was arraigned Wednesday night on two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and one count of fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon.
