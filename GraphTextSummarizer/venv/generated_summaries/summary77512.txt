On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee kicks off the confirmation hearing for Loretta Lynch, President Barack Obama's nominee to replace Eric Holder as attorney general. The attorney general -- our nation's chief federal law enforcement officer -- plays a vital role ensuring laws and regulations are faithfully executed, while respecting and defending the rights of American citizens as well as the duties of each independent branch of government. This week, as the Senate fulfills its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent, the American people will have the opportunity to learn how Lynch intends to lead the department, if she is confirmed. This is Lynch's opportunity to make her case. She'll be asked tough questions from all members of the committee, and her responses will provide valuable insight into what sort of attorney general she may be.
