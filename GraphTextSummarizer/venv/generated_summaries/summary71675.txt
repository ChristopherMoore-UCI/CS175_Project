Even though he has received threats, St. Louis Rams tight end Jared Cook stressed Wednesday that he did not intend disrespect toward police when he and other Rams players made the "hands up, don't shoot" gesture before Sunday's game against the Oakland Raiders. The gesture that Cook and teammates Stedman Bailey, Tavon Austin, Chris Givens and Kenny Britt made when taking the field Sunday is the same one protesters have used to decry the death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown. That angered the St. Louis Police Officers Association, saying the players "chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury" after the jurors decided not to indict former Ferguson officer Darren Wilson.
