The blaze, which was fueled by dry Santa Ana winds and low humidity, followed a spate of California wildfires in October that charred more than 508,000 acres in several counties. A firefighter works to contain a wildfire threatening homes in Malibu, California, on November 24. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in the wake of the fire, which started on November 24. During the investigation, fire officials speculated that a campfire may have started the blaze -- which engulfed roughly 5,000 acres and destroyed 80 structures, including the 53 homes. Baca said investigators traced the fire to the cave, then used receipts and surveillance camera footage from a nearby store to hunt down the men.
