Twenty-two Palestinians have died in air strikes in the past week, Palestinian medical sources say, as Israel has carried out a series of targeted attacks on the alleged leaders of terror groups. Relations between the two nations reached rock bottom last summer, when nine activists on board the Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with aid and 700 activists from various countries, died in clashes with Israeli Navy commandos while attempting to break Israel's blockade of Gaza. Another Israeli was killed by a rocket attack near the city of Beer Sheva in southern Israel. Asked about Israel's relationship with Turkey, Barak said his country had to consider issuing an apology to Turkey over the deaths of activists on board a Turkish ship bound for Gaza last year. " Barak reiterated Israel's expression of "regret" over the deaths of Egyptian soldiers in its Sinai region, which borders Israel, last week.
