We were just with a tour of U.S. war veterans, and over here, the North Koreans are holding their own tour. Several countries -- including South Korea and the U.S. -- investigated the incident. The U.S. has an agreement with South Korea to defend it against any aggression. The results point the finger at North Korea, that a North Korean submarine launched a torpedo that sank the South Korean ship. Carley notes that "ocean life is the base of the food chain; when we pollute the oceans, we are affecting ourselves too."
