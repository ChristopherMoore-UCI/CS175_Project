Despite the fact that basic math and science cause me to bleed from my ears, I once confidently oversaw the design and construction of a fully functional nuclear power plant that provided safe energy to thousands of people. However, on March 5, those of us who have long fancied ourselves as urban planners will get a completely modern version of "SimCity" to once again assist us in the gleeful neglect of our jobs, family, and personal hygiene. And from someone who just went through the process of obtaining a real-life building variance, I can assure you that City Hall isn't exactly the ball pit at Chuck E. Cheese. Of course, I was never really mayor of a town -- I don't wear pants nearly often enough to hold down that kind of job -- but I did enthusiastically play one on the classic city-building simulator, "SimCity." The true beauty of "SimCity" is that for every disgruntled person who ever said, "This whole place is run by idiots," the game offers a way for you to prove to the world -- or at least, maybe, to your cat -- that you can do better.
