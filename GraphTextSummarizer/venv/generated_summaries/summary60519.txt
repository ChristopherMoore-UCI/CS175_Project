His death led to reports that the British director suffered from inoperable brain cancer, but his family disputed that he was ailing. Scott, best known for the films "Top Gun" and "Beverly Hills Cop II," jumped from a bridge in San Pedro, authorities said. While Scott's movies garnered box office success, they never received the acclaim that generated Academy Award nominations. An ABC report Monday suggested the director was told by a doctor that he was dying of inoperable brain cancer. The notes also did not mention any illnesses, diseases or other health issues, Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said.
