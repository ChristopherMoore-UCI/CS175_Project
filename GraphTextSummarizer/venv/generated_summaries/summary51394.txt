"As a Frank Sinatra fan, I think of the great song 'New York, New York,' and really for Republicans right now, we think if we can make it there in Massachusetts and New Jersey, we can make it anywhere," Republican strategist Doug Heye said. A similar battle could take place in Florida, where Republican Gov. Charlie Crist and former state House Speaker Marco Rubio are competing to be their party's nominee for the Senate race. Democrats are trying to calm frustrated voters and make sure that recent losses in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Virginia don't become a national trend. To many political observers, the election of Republican Scott Brown is a game changer. President Obama rode into the White House on a compelling message of change, inspiring his base while also winning over independent voters.
