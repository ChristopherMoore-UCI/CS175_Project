Other cables discuss weapons sales between other countries. The cable said the issue of helicopters was a "topic that [Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh] would manage to insert into almost every item of discussion during the hour-and-half-long meeting." Turkey not only wants to buy U.S.-designed military helicopters, it wants to build them, too. The crown prince of Bahrain, in another cable, seems to support U.S. missile defense systems aimed at Iran. Citing Iran's refusal to scale back its nuclear program and noting that "there are changes in the region that concern us," the chief of staff of the UAE's armed forces told an American ambassador he wanted the U.S. government to deploy between four and five Patriot batteries to the UAE during calendar year 2009, fearful that an Israeli strike on Iran would result in a retaliatory attack on other countries by Iran. The cables indicate that U.S. helicopters are in demand by many countries.
