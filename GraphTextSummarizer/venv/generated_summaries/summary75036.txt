The series ran its tribute episode titled "The Quarterback" in honor of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn Hudson on the hit Fox show. Viewers watched as the entire McKinley High School grappled with his loss -- including the character of Finn's love, Rachel Berry, played by Monteith's real-life girlfriend, Lea Michele. There were plenty of tears from most of the characters as Finn's football jacket appeared to become a symbol for Monteith's presence on the show. " Emma comforts her with a hug and pamphlets titled "It's Not All About You," "When to Stop Talking," and "Wait, Am I Callous?" Monteith was not only a favorite with fans, but also with his cast mates. At the Emmys in September, actress Jane Lynch, who plays Coach Sue Sylvester on the show, paid tribute to Monteith during a special segment on the awards show.
