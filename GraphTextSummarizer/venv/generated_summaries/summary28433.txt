Brian E. Dorian, 37, was to be released on his own recognizance Tuesday night, Will County State's Attorney James W. Glasgow announced. " The state's attorney owes the attack victims, their families, Dorian and Lynwood residents "an apology for rushing to judgment thereby causing a great deal of pain and suffering for everyone involved," Chief Russell L. Pearson said in a statement Tuesday night. Dorian was arrested Friday in the killing of one person and the wounding of three others in the spree, which occurred south of Chicago, Illinois. John Dorian, the officer's father, told CNN affiliate WLS he was "relieved" and "never doubted his son." Dorian's attorneys spoke only briefly Tuesday evening. The gunman was believed to be using a revolver -- possibly a Colt .38-caliber or .357 Magnum -- because no shell casings were found at either scene, Lake County Sheriff Rogelio "Roy" Dominguez said.
