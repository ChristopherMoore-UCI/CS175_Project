The two met behind closed doors at the White House for several hours as top officials from both countries worked to address issues tied to the global economic crisis, international security, the environment and human rights. Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama hosted Hu in talks defined largely by economic issues. Obama administration officials used the president's meeting with Hu to highlight economic progress between the two countries, announcing Beijing's approval of $45 billion in new contracts for U.S. companies to export goods to China. -- Less than a week after Chinese President Hu Jintao visited Washington, senior diplomats from China and the United States sat down in Beijing Friday to follow up on the visit and discuss other issues. The two leaders acknowledged continuing differences on human rights, but pledged to keep working on the matter in a "frank and candid way," according to Obama.
