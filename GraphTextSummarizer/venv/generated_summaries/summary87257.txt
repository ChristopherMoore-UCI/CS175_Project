Bin Hammam, in his third term as AFC president, said he will replace that committee with an expanded 41-member FIFA Board if he is elected, giving more representation to the world's regional confederations. The last time Blatter faced a battle was in 2002, when he defeated Africa's Issa Hayatou by 139 votes to 56 despite his campaign being run amid claims of corruption and financial mismanagement. FIFA's 24-man executive committee has again been mired in controversy, with two of its members suspended last November ahead of the decision on which countries would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, following an investigation into alleged bribery for votes. Bin Hammam will face a difficult task to convince FIFA's 208 member nations that he should replace Blatter, who has presided over a $1.28 billion profit following the success of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. -- Mohammed Bin Hammam has promised to reform FIFA's corruption-tainted top echelons if he is successful in ending the 13-year reign of its president Sepp Blatter in the June 1 elections.
