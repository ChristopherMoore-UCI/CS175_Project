Both parties agree on major aspects of health care reform, including a halt to insurance company practices of denying coverage for pre-existing conditions and capping the annual out-of-pocket expenses of consumers for health care. Democratic leaders reject that claim, saying the public option would provide needed competition for private insurers while making health coverage accessible to millions of people currently lacking health insurance. They also agree on creating incentives for preventive health care to help lower overall costs. It would require individuals to have coverage or face a fine of up to $1,900 for a family of four but includes subsidies to help low- and middle-income Americans obtain health care plans. Obama and Democratic leaders, aware of a rockier political climate because of midterm congressional elections in 2010, insist that a bill must pass this year to address spiraling health care costs that are threatening economic stability.
