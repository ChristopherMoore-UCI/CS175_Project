Last week, the Senate rejected a measure drafted by Cornyn that would have required much stricter border security standards. "We are pleased the Senate continues to work together on commonsense immigration reform," White House spokesman Bobby Whithorne said. "When the immigration bill passes, (GOP Speaker John Boehner) should bring it up for a vote in the House of Representatives quickly," said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. The Senate signaled its support on Monday for a bipartisan measure strengthening border security in the comprehensive "Gang of Eight" immigration reform bill, a sweeping blueprint that promises to overhaul America's immigration policies for the first time since 1986. GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee introduced the compromise amendment last week, saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system.
