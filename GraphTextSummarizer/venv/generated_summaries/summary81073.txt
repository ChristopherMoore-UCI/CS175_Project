As funny as Sheen's quip is, it's not entirely accurate — CBS entertainment president Nina Tassler told TV critics last week that the network wants to bring Men back for an 11th season next fall, though a renewal has not yet been finalized. And despite Sheen's wishes, it seems unlikely that Men creator Chuck Lorre — the man Sheen once called a "sad silly fool," an "a-hole p---y loser" and a "low rent, nutless sociopath" — would welcome his ex-star back into the fold. When David Letterman asked last night if Sheen ever feels embarrassed when he thinks back on the spring of 2011, the actor answered the question quickly and matter-of-factly: "Of course. He also didn't miss a chance to take a swipe at his old sitcom, even as he revealed that he'd like to return to the show for its last episode: "I am dead," Sheen said, referring to the convenient subway accident that killed off his character at the beginning of season 9, "but so's the show." That said, Sheen still seems proud of his very public crackup's sheer audacity.
