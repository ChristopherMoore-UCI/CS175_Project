Despite the conclusions reached by that article (is it really fair to compare a fictional character to activists and thinkers like Susan B. Anthony and Gloria Steinem?), women do owe something to the flighty young lawyer played by Calista Flockhart: She almost singlehandedly made the workplace safe for bare legs, freeing us from the tyranny of mandatory pantyhose. Still, "Sex and the City"had an enormous impact on regular women's style: Aside from all of those quickly knocked off (and forgotten) nameplate necklaces and oversized faux corsages, the ladies' willingness to play with fashion inspired legions. Nevertheless, the big-shouldered, wasp-waisted creations worn by oil mogul Alexis (Joan Collins) and her longtime rival Krystle (Linda Evans) were popular enough with fans that the show spawned a signature fashion line, "The Dynasty Collection" which was designed by the show's costumer, Nolan Miller. And Mary's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits. But it was her 70s work-wear that most women sought: colorful scarves, two-piece suits, and bright, office-appropriate dresses.
