The trouble is that activists want a lot more -- a total moratorium on deportations, and the expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program beyond its intended beneficiaries (undocumented young people brought as children) to include the parents of DACA recipients and parents with U.S.-born children. Time and again, you have held out the promise of executive action to Latino voters who want reform and who are furious at you for deporting a record 2 million people in five years. Given that many Americans still resist the idea of rewarding illegal activity by conferring legal status to the undocumented, for other Democrats there would be a significant downside to using executive action. For one, probably Hillary Clinton, who is eager to run for president in 2016 but not eager to take the blame for executive action taken by the previous president. Meanwhile, Mr. President, you've used the promise of executive action as a cynical ploy intended to distract critics and rally support for Democratic candidates for elective office.
