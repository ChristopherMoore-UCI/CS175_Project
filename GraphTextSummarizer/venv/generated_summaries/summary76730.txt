The scene on a street in the city of Tacloban is one of many CNN reporters and others have witnessed as residents deal with the death and destruction that Typhoon Haiyan left behind when the massive storm tore through the Philippines: 'Worse than hell' in typhoon-ravaged Philippines 'We don't have anything to eat' As they searched for loved ones lost in the storm, desperate survivors asked for help. " Fernandez was among the steady stream of typhoon victims arriving at the airport, searching for food, water and a chance to escape. "Nobody would think it's going to be lawlessness." 'We were just floating' Tacloban City Councilor Cristina Gonzales-Romualdez and her husband, Mayor Alfred Romualdez were at their home facing the Pacific Ocean when the storm surge came, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported Tuesday. William Hotchkiss, general director of the Philippines' Civil Aviation Authority, says he's never seen anything like it in decades of flying over the country after storms. "The biggest challenge," he says, "is to sort of come up with structures that will take into consideration what they call 'the new normal' -- storms that are maybe as destructive as this one."
