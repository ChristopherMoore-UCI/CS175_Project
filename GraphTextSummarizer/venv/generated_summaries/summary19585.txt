"At the Premier League we are open to developments that enhance the competition and it was clear from watching the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil that Vanishing Spray benefited referees, players, and all of those who watched the matches," Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in a statement. The vanishing spray used by referees at the recent FIFA World Cup has found a new home in the English Premier League. "As an assessor at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil I saw firsthand the benefits of Vanishing Spray for referees, and for the game as a whole," Riley said in a statement. The move follows consultations with both Premier League clubs and referees. "The Select Group referees are looking forward to using it during Barclays Premier League matches next season."
