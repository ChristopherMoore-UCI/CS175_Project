The nonprofit Hawaii Wildlife Fund said marine debris has been a problem for years for the island state and tsunami debris has made things worse. The wildlife fund organizes beach cleanups along Hawaii's  shorelines and struggles to keep up with the marine debris, made up primarily of plastic. "It's disheartening to come out here and see all this marine debris in an area that's otherwise so remote, debris that's washing up from other countries," said Megan Lamson, debris project coordinator for the Hawaii Wildlife Fund. Jantz has been studying the impact of marine debris in fish. Your first view of Kamilo Beach on Hawaii's Big Island is of majestic rock, postcard-worthy waves and miles of uninhabited beach.
