-- The leader of an apocalyptic New Mexico church who claims to be the Messiah was arrested Tuesday on sex charges, state police said. Bent has acknowledged having sex with his followers, but authorities will not divulge who the alleged victims are. "I was told by the agent in charge of the case that the arrest warrant specified charges of three counts of sexual contact with a minor, and three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor," said the post, written by an unnamed follower. A posting from a teenage girl on the compound Web site denied that she was molested, saying that her "lying with" Bent was not sexual. In a video clip of the show posted on the channel's Web site, Bent and some young female followers admit that the young women lay with him while naked but deny sex took place.
