"Unless we get the full cooperation with everybody in every neighborhood around here, the bears are going to come in for a free lunch," Florida Fish and Wildlife spokeswoman Karen Parker said. Neighbors in Longwood, north of Orlando, say bears often roam through the area, especially when looking for food thrown out by humans. Unprovoked black bear attacks in Florida are extremely rare. -- A bear believed to be involved in this week's attack on a 54-year-old Florida woman has been caught and euthanized, a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokeswoman said Thursday. The 200-pound female bear was caught by commission biologists in the Longwood neighborhood where Susan Chalfant was mauled Monday night.
