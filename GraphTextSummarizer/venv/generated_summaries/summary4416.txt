-- An influential group of House conservatives, unhappy with the midterm strategy of Speaker John Boehner and other top Republicans, outlined its own election-year message on the economy on Wednesday. Since its inception, the RSC's main objective is to move House GOP leaders to the right on policy measures. In a memo to House Republicans about the spring schedule, the majority leader touted several measures under his "American That Works" agenda and pledged more items were scheduled to address the "middle class squeeze. He heads the powerful Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives that includes the vast majority of rank and file House GOP members. Asked if that issue alone is enough to help Republicans expand their majority in the House, Gowdy replied, "Right now it is." Freshman Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina admitted that internal divisions among House GOP members make it hard to coordinate any unified message.
