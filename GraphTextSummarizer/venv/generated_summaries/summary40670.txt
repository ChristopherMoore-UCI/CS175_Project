Alongside a group of fellow MIT alumni and local Kenyan partners, Auerbach has helped found Sanergy -- a start-up that aims to make a business out of cleaning up Nairobi's sanitary mess. "Success of the business model like Sanergy depends on creating viable franchise opportunities for local entrepreneurs and attractive services for slum residents," says Austin Beebe of African Medical and Research Foundation. By the end of 2013 Auerbach says Sanergy plans to collect enough waste to power a bio-generator that can sell electricity back into the Kenyan national grid. The Sanergy model works by first installing a network of low cost sanitation centers, which provide access to clean toilets, at various locations in the slums.
