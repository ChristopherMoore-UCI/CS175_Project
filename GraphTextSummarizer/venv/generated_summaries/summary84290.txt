Another change from the original "StarCraft": You can now choose the order in which you tackle certain missions. "StarCraft II," on the other hand, benefits from the fully rendered cinematic scenes we've come to expect of modern gaming. "StarCraft II" uses a wide range of colors, and the attention to detail on things like marines' mechanized moving parts or the fluorescent glow of laser beams is spectacular as well. Blizzard's overhaul of its classic Battle.net service is geared toward helping strategy newbies become competent, offering an array of challenges designed to teach important multiplayer skills. In the sequel, you spend your downtime hanging out inside the spaceship owned by series protagonist Jim Raynor.
