"I drink to try new things, to learn about drinking cultures or new drinks," Lamprey said. Watch Lamprey use sword to open champagne Â» Gross stuff aside, Lamprey has what many consider to be a dream job. Besides demonstrating how one sabers champagne, Lamprey talked to CNN about dealing with thumping hangovers, staying in shape and other challenges of hosting a TV show about alcohol. We caught up with Lamprey in New York's Bubble Lounge, where he was preparing (soberly, mind you) to use a sword to lop off the end of a champagne bottle, glass neck and all. While Lamprey might not be as battle-scarred as Napoleon's men, he does have a victory to celebrate: "Three Sheets" has a new home after being put in limbo for several months after its original network went off the air.
