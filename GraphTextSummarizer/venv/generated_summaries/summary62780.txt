"For many years, the gun lobby has had an advantage both in terms of funding and a well-organized and committed grassroots which it has used to hold back efforts to strengthen gun laws that are supported by the vast majority of Americans, including the vast majority of gun owners," said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. Although McAuliffe's first effort at tougher gun laws in Virginia was thwarted in the legislature not long after he took office, it illustrated where the battles are being fought now that the issue has effectively moved from Washington, where the Senate a year ago failed to advance new measures following the horrendous Newtown school massacre in Connecticut. "It's mixed in many ways," economist and pro-gun advocate John Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, said of the nation's newest slate of gun laws. NIH also supports research to understand the relationship between alcohol abuse and gun violence, as part of broader efforts to develop more effective interventions to help prevent violence," Myles said. Separately, Republicans on the House Appropriations Committee have vowed to block President Barack Obama's proposal to try to secure $10 million in federal funding to scientifically study gun violence through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
