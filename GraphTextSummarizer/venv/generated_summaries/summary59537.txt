Pablo Rea has simple advice for security guards. Rea's lawyer, John Henrichs, is threatening to sue the store for using excessive force and causing injuries to Rea, something Forever 21 acknowledged in a statement. " Alejandro Rea has not seen the video, since he has been held in a Los Angeles jail since his August 7 arrest. Rea is deaf, so he didn't hear the alarm or the shouts from a security guard ordering him to stop. "We recognize that the security guard used excessive force, which is against our store policy and have suspended him indefinitely," the store said in a news release.
