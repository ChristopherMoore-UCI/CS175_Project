These threats are not just happening to high profile women, but to women and girls everywhere. In fact, weaponizing women's bodies -- whether by making rape threats or disseminating unwanted and compromising images of women's bodies -- are crimes, violations that are born of a deep-rooted hatred toward women and a drive to shame into submission any woman who dares to speak out. Sadly, systematically silencing women through rape threats and revenge porn has become the newest weapon in the war on women. It is time that we were collectively outraged -- men and women -- about the use of sexual threats online. Threats to rape and kill her were posted across the Internet as part of an assault that seemed intent on humiliating and silencing not only Roberts, but any woman who dares to speak up against inequality and expose the truth about how women are treated in our society.
