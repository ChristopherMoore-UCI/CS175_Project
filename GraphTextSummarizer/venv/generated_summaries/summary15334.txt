The Duchess of Cornwall could have chosen other cities for her first solo overseas tour, but she chose Paris, a city closely -- and tragically -- associated with Diana, the first wife of Prince Charles. Diana may have been a fashion icon who famously championed Dior handbags, but Camilla didn't shy away from accepting an invitation to Dior in Paris in her own right. The queen is cutting back on her travel and Prince Charles with Camilla are increasingly being asked to represent the monarchy, which will one day be theirs. Camilla, unlike Diana, isn't defined particularly by fashion. In a typical Camilla moment, she arrived Paris with a smile and greeted the media with a big hello, then went on to admit nerves.
