Beal College President Allen Stehle presented White with her diploma. White says she put herself through bookkeeping courses with $500 her uncle had given her years before she enrolled at Beal. Jessie Rose White of Belfast, Maine, received a degree in stenography and bookkeeping after completing courses at Beal College in Bangor in 1939. "It stayed in the bank, and he specified it couldn't be used for anything but education," White said. Dona Gilbert, a friend of White's who recently learned about her education plight, contacted the college to share White's story.
