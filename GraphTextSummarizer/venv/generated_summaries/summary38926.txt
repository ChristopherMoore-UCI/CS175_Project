The court document says Atwater had another run-in with airport security while leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve en route to Texas when a military smoke grenade was found in his bag. Investigators said Atwater explained it was his practice to carry at least two blocks of C-4 explosives on any operation. The Green Beret told authorities he didn't see explosives in the main compartment of the bag and was "surprised that the C-4 was in the bag when it was located" by TSA screeners at Midland International Airport, according to the complaint. Investigators said Atwater told them he grabbed the bag to use as a carry-on when he traveled to Midland, Texas, for the holidays and put children's items in it. When asked about the earlier incident in Fayetteville, the complaint said, Atwater admitted it had happened but that he had "forgotten to mention it" during his initial interview with law enforcement after he was arrested in Texas.
