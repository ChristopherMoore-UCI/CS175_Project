Sunderlands's big summer signing Jack Rodwell, once considered one of England's brightest prospects, scored his first goal for the club to secure a point that left Van Gaal still waiting for his first league win as Manchester United coach. -- Manchester United's poor start to the season continued with a lackluster 1-1 draw against Sunderland, leaving new coach Louis Van Gaal still seeking a first league win for his new club. Some good work by Antonio Valencia, who had been restored to the starting line up, released Spain international Juan Mata who fired home from close range. As the transfer window draws to a close on September 1st, United will likely add to their squad with Real Madrid's Argentina international Angel Di Maria heavily rumored to be joining for what may be a British transfer record. Hull were reduced to 10 men early in the first half but still had the best of the play and managed to take the lead through Croatia international Nikica Jelavic before half time.
