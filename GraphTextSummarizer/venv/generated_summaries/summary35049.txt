-- One person was killed in an anti-government protest in the Yemeni city of Aden on Wednesday, eyewitnesses reported, while human rights activists accused pro-government demonstrators of beating students after a similar protest in the capital, Sanaa. It was at least the sixth day that scuffles had broken out between pro- and anti-government protesters in Yemen, amid unrest and anti-government demonstrations in other Middle Eastern countries. More students showed up, both Al-Nihmi and Al-Janadi said, and the protesters began chanting anti-government slogans such as "The people want the fall of the regime" and "Oh Ali, son of Saleh, your regime is no good." Video distributed by student activists appeared to show the youth being carried away, bleeding heavily from his left side. " Shortly afterward, hundreds of pro-government demonstrators turned up -- but they were outside the university gates, while the students were inside.
