"We loved it," said Amazon editorial director Sara Nelson. The selection was made by six people on Amazon's editorial team who lobbied one another furiously but tried not to let outside forces -- including reviews from major literary publications -- influence their choices, Nelson said. Amazon has been involved in a months-long dispute with Hachette, a major publishing firm that owns such imprints as Little, Brown and Grand Central Publishing. "No one has said anything to me, ever, about choosing by publisher, even amidst this Hachette business," Nelson said. Nelson added that business politics are also kept away from the process.
