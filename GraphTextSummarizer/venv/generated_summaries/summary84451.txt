"Sadly, Mount Everest is now ... called the world's highest junkyard," Maj. Ranveer Singh Jamval, the team leader, told India Today. That's why an experienced climbing group from the Indian army plans to trek up the 8,850-meter mountain to pick up at least 4,000 kilograms (more than 8,000 pounds) of waste from the high-altitude camps, according to India Today. "We will target the mountaineering waste from Camp 1 (19,695 feet) to the summit," said Jamval, who has scaled Mount Everest twice. " More than 200 climbers have died attempting to climb the peak, part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Most climbers who try don't succeed in summiting the 29,035-foot-high Mount Everest, the world's tallest peak.
