-- Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said Monday he thinks Hillary Clinton will run for president next year and that her decision could be known as soon as December. "I had come out in, I guess in April or May, to strongly support Sen. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, should she run. Kaine, a Democrat who has vowed to endorse Clinton should she run, made the comments in a question and answer session with students at Randolph Macon College in Ashland, Virginia. But Kaine signed on with the Ready For Hillary super PAC earlier this year and announced that he will get behind Clinton if she seeks the Democratic nomination. The former governor and chairman of the Democratic National Committee was asked if he would run for president in 2016, but Kaine waved off the question and quickly pivoted to Clinton.
