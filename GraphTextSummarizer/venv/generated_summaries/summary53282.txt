Drone carrying drugs crashes south of U.S. border Maj. Gen. Randolph Alles, assistant commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, runs the program, and hey says while the program needs improvements, it's a mistake to only view the drones' success in terms of arrests. Alles also says in 2013, the arrests by drone brought in $66,000 per hour of contraband seizures. They are sleek, mostly silent converted weapons of war: Drones used by the Border Patrol to scan the skies in the empty deserts of the Southwest to spot illegal immigrants and then, if things work out, have agents arrest them. That figure comes from doing the math, derived from the most recent Inspector General report on the use of drones for the Department of Homeland Security. Inspector General John Roth says while the drones do contribute to overall border security, Customs hasn't "put any measurements in place as to whether it's effective; the measurements we saw show that in fact it's not effective." Alles says he doesn't want any more drones until he can prove the program works at every level.
