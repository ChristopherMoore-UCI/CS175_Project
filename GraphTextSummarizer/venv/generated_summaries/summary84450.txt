When Giuseppe DiBella's beloved 6-month-old puppy Nika disappeared from his home in Newburgh, New York, he immediately plastered countless fliers around town showing pictures of Nika as well as the toy fox terrier's microchip number. "I didn't even know where Marion County was." DiBella made the trek to Florida this week to pick Nika up from a family friend who has been caring for her. When CNN asked how his little pup could've made her way from New York to Florida, DiBella replied, "I have no idea." That microchip led Marion County Animal Services to DiBella, and they emailed him with the news he'd been hoping for. "I was so surprised when I realized it was in Florida," said DiBella.
