A patient being treated at a Dallas hospital is the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, health officials announced Tuesday. "The Dallas County health department has confirmed that paramedics did follow proper guidelines to avoid contaminating additional patients. The unidentified man left Liberia on September 19 and arrived in the United States on September 20, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The ambulance that carried the patient - ambulance # 37 --- was in use for two days after the transport but was adequately decontaminated, said Dallas city spokeswoman Sana Syed. "It's a severe disease, which has a high-case fatality rate, even with the best of care, but there are core, tried and true public health interventions that stop it," Frieden said.
