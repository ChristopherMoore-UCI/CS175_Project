Three of Majerus' players at Utah were NBA draft picks -- including Keith Van Horn as the No. 2 overall pick in 1997. -- Longtime men's college basketball coach Rick Majerus, who led Utah to the NCAA final in 1998, died Saturday from heart problems. "Rick left a lasting legacy at the University of Utah, not only for his incredible success and the national prominence he brought to our basketball program, but also for the tremendous impact he made on the young men who were fortunate enough to play on his teams," Utah Director of Athletics Chris Hill said in a statement. Last season, Majerus led Saint Louis to the round of 32 in the NCAA tournament. Majerus had ongoing health problems for years, dating back to his days as Utah's coach.
