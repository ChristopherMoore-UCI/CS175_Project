A spokeswoman for the Dugard family issued a statement recently which acknowledged Slayton as the father but questioned his motives for wanting into Dugard's life after many years. Legally establishing that he is her father would guarantee Slayton a courtroom seat when the couple charged with kidnapping Dugard are tried, Allred said. -- Kenneth Slayton wants to get a message to Jaycee Dugard, the California woman kidnapped as a child and held captive for 18 years. "Since she has been found, I have done everything I could to make contact with Jaycee, but to no avail," Slayton said at a news conference Friday. Slayton would like to get together with Dugard and her two children on Father's Day, but he said he is being blocked from communicating with the 29-year-old he believes is his daughter.
