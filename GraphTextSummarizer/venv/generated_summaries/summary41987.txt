The polls opened at 7 a.m. and closed at 7 p.m. Before the measure was defeated, a spokesman for U.S. English Inc., an action group that supports English-only laws nationwide, said the Nashville proposal was a good one. -- Voters in Nashville, Tennessee -- a city that has seen a dramatic increase in its immigrant population -- rejected a measure Thursday that would have made English the only language used for government business in its metropolitan area. "This amendment would exclude and marginalize those residents and visitors to Nashville simply because English is not their native tongue," the editorial said. " According to Toonkel, about 30 states and more than 100 localities have made English their official language, and he said his organization believes such laws are legal. U.S. Census data from 2000 showed an increase of 210 percent in the immigrant population of the Nashville metro area, including Davidson County, since 1990.
