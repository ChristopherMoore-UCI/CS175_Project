Biggs and his family campaigned for him to be released because of his poor health virtually from the day he returned to the UK and was immediately incarcerated in Belmarsh high security prison. Instead, Biggs was moved to a prison facility for elderly prisoners in Norwich, his parole prospects dismissed by justice ministers because of his apparent lack of remorse. Biggs spent more than three decades as a fugitive after escaping from prison in 1964. -- Britain's most celebrated fugitive -- "the last of the gentlemen crooks," as he liked to describe himself -- was born Ronald Arthur Biggs in Lambeth, south London, on August 8, 1929. The latter offence resulted in his first spell in prison -- four months in Lewes Prison for Young Offenders.
