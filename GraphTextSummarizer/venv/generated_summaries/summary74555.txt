The attack happened Sunday evening in the town of Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, a frequent scene of suicide attacks. The attack on Sunday came one week after a suicide car bomber -- apparently targeting people voting to fill a national assembly seat -- killed at least 37 people and wounded 16 others in the Bunair district of North West Frontier Province. -- Two explosions have struck a small cafe in volatile northwestern Pakistan, killing six people, including two police officers, local police and an official said. Some of the Taliban militants conducting attacks in neighboring Afghanistan have been based in the North West Frontier Province and nearby tribal regions. In November, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives in the midst of a funeral procession in Dera Ismail Khan, killing at least seven people and injuring 30 more, police said.
