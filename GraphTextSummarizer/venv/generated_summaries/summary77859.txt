On Monday, Joe Lozito told HLN's Vinne Politan that he felt "every kind of emotion -- scared to death, you're angry" -- when Gelman allegedly lunged at him with a knife Sunday morning about a Manhattan subway train. Soon after, the officers -- with aid from off-duty New York police Detective Marcelo Razzo and an unnamed civilian nearby -- wrestled Gelman to the ground, police said. Gelman's former girlfriend found her mother dead on the floor when she returned home at about 4:15 p.m., police said. Gelman, 23, who is unemployed and known to authorities mostly as a graffiti artist, was arrested about 9 a.m. Saturday, about 28 hours after he is alleged to have begun the spree spanning three New York boroughs, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Saturday. Shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday, Gelman allegedly got into a cab in Brooklyn and stabbed the driver.
