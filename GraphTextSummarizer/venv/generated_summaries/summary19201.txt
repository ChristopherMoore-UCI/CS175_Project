"It is a testament to the persistence of the sheriff's office that today, four months after the slide, we recovered the final victim," Snohomish County Executive John Lovick said in a statement. -- Authorities believe they have found the final victim of a deadly landslide in Washington state. Including Regelbrugge, 43 people are thought to have been killed in the March slide. A rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way on the outskirts of the town of Oso on March 22.
