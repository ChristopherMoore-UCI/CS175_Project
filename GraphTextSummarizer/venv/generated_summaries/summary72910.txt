Except that, after filming was completed, we had the Obama administration reverse their policy on medical cannabis and the U.S. Attorneys in California, in fact, go to war against us. I went to a friend's house after school, and I was ready for cannabis. For the first time in my life, I really became aware of myself as a creature of nature that was related to other creatures of nature. When I became convinced that they were really truly committed to showing us and showing medical cannabis as it is, I decided I was comfortable doing the show with them. We were approached by a series of producers of reality TV shows, about a half a dozen, maybe more.
