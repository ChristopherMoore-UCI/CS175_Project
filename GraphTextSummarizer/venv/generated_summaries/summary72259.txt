There may be changes to Acela Express and Northeast Regional services, Amtrak said. A deadly storm that brought Chicago its snowiest February day on record is now delivering more winter weather to the Northeast. In the Northeast, winter storm warnings covered parts of several states, including Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire. "With extreme conditions expected in some areas during the next 24 to 36 hours, crews are actively monitoring the latest forecasts and planning for the possibility that service adjustments may be necessary," it said Sunday. Along with Boston and Chicago, the cities of Detroit, Omaha, and the Ohio cities of Akron, Toledo and Cleveland canceled public school Monday, but New York City schools will remain open.
