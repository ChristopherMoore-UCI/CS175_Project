Arkansas: Even with the Clinton machine rallying to his side, Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor has been struggling against GOP Rep. Tom Cotton, a veteran and Harvard graduate who has been hammering away at Pryor for his ties to President Obama, a common theme on the campaign trail. In each of these states Republicans are holding their ground by connecting their opponent to President Obama while Democrats strike back by reminding voters of extremism in the GOP. Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley—who has received the support of Democrats like Michelle Obama—is having trouble stopping Ernst in the polls. Their hope was that Sen. Mark Udall would be able to capitalize on the demographic trends—such as the expanding population of Latino-Americans—that have been building a solid base for the party, allowing President Obama to win in both the 2008 and 2012 elections. While this election might result in a runoff in January, Nunn has been doing a good job overcoming the negative sentiment associated with President Obama by hitting hard against her opponent's record in the private sector, using some of the same kinds of attacks that were used against Mitt Romney on issues like outsourcing.
