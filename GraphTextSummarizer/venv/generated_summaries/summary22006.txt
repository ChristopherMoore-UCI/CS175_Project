Because Harry's post-Voldemort days eventually become pretty dang easy, I got to thinking about his Hogwarts years, which were 4,224 pages strong of mountain troll-fighting, blood quill-dealing, and mysteries galore. In honor of Harry's 33rd birthday today, here are 33 moments where Harry Potter was more incredible than Felix Felicis (and all of which have nothing to do with what he's best known for: killing the Dark Lord). While I'm sure even the non-Potterphiles among you are aware of his biggest accomplishments (defeating Voldemort comes to mind) there are a lot of moments where Harry was pretty bloody awesome, and it's totally been forgotten if you haven't recently done a re-read. Weirdly grown-up Harry lectured Remus about responsibility and love after he found out Remus wanted to leave a pregnant Tonks. In one of his most Gryffindor-esque moments of his Hogwarts years, Harry brought Cedric's body back to give to Cedric's parents.
