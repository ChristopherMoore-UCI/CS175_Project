Paramedics took Gabor, 93, to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she had undergone hip replacement surgery in July, he said. Gabor's left leg was "swollen like hell" and she had an infection in her right leg, her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, said Friday evening, as his wife was being treated in the emergency room at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Gabor "was complaining about her leg swelling and hurting her" Friday morning, so a doctor was called to her Bel Air, California, home, publicist John Blanchette said. -- Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to a Los Angeles hospital Friday after her doctor diagnosed her with "a massive blood clot," her publicist said. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge;" "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953; "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
