Tacit is a wrist-mounted device which informs the wearer about the proximity of objects in complex environments, according to its creator Steve Hoefer. Ultrasonic sensors positioned at the front measure distances from one inch up to 10 feet (2cm to 3.5m), Hoefer says, while motorized rubber pads at the rear apply increasing amounts of pressure on the wrist as users get closer to an object. Hoefer wanted to create a "dungeon crawl" game (a type of fantasy role-playing adventure set in labyrinths) that didn't rely on vision. San Francisco-based Hoefer is currently working on reducing Tacit's size as well as improving its accuracy and simplifying its construction. Hoefer has released details of Tacit's materials, circuits and software on his Grathio Labs web site under a Creative Commons license to maximise feedback and hopefully improve the design.
