One friend, Jake Shepard, told the Daily Mail newspaper in Britain that he'd texted with Wilson after a CNN appearance, and a woman going by the name "Josie" called a radio show to say she knew his side of the story. Separate federal and local investigations are under way, and Wilson -- who has received death threats -- has disappeared from public view. Wilson owns a house in a modest neighborhood about 20 miles from Ferguson. Wilson, who has six years on the force with no disciplinary issues on his record, is on paid administrative leave. The Daily Mail reported that Shepard said he didn't know for sure where Wilson is but that he's safe and under 24-hour guard.
