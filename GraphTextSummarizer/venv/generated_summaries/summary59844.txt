Fees for 'extras' likely to continue Will passengers see more fees in 2013? Additional revenue is generated by "a la carte" services such as snacks, preferred seating, luggage fees, commissions for hotel bookings and frequent flier mile sales to partners.

" Airlines making billions from fees Spirit's fees may seem extreme to some passengers, but most airlines seem to be making money from charging for services beyond the basic ride they provide. Airline ancillary revenue is projected to reach $36.1 billion worldwide this year, according to the Amadeus Worldwide Estimate of Ancillary Revenue, an increase of 11.3% over last year.
