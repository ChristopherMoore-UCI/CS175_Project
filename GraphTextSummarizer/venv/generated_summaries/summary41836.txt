According to court paperwork filed in Duval County, Florida, Alexander was granted a pretrial release with special conditions and a $150,000 bond. "We're all just happy that she'll be home for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and we're going to focus on that right now." 'Stand Your Ground' laws up to states, not Obama or Congress "We hope the decision means that the Florida justice system has relented in its vindictive, hostile and racist legal assault on this African-American mother of three," the statement by the Free Marissa Now Mobilization Campaign said.
