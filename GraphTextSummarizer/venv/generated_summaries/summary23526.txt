Redknapp was named Premier League manager of the year for 2009-10 after taking Spurs to Champions League qualification for the first time, and he guided the team to the quarterfinals in Europe the following season. -- Harry Redknapp is hoping to perform another Premier League rescue act after being confirmed as the new manager of bottom club Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. Winless QPR sack Hughes Redknapp has been out of work since being sacked by Tottenham five months ago, having taken the London club to fourth in the Premier League but missing out on another Champions League campaign after Chelsea's Munich triumph in May. "I'm delighted to be back in the managerial hot-seat at QPR," said Redknapp, who won the English FA Cup with Portsmouth in 2008 after returning the club following a controversial move to neighboring Southampton, who were relegated in 2005. Redknapp, who was interested in becoming coach of the Ukrainian national team, was at Old Trafford on Saturday for Rangers' game against Manchester United. "Harry was our number one target, the unanimous choice of the board and we're delighted we've been able to attract him to the club," QPR chairman Tony Fernandes said.
