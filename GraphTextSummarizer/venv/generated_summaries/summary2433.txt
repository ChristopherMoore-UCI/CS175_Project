Third seed Venus produced an awesome display on Centre Court, crushing world No.1 Safina 6-1 6-0 in just 51 minutes, after sister Serena had earlier won an epic three-set semifinal against Elena Dementieva. Defending champion Venus Williams ensured the Wimbledon final would be another family affair with a devastating performance against Russia's Dinara Safina in Thursday's second semifinal. Venus dropped only one game as she crushed top seed Dinara Safina to reach her eighth Wimbledon final. Unforced errors sprayed from Safina's racket throughout the second set and a double fault in the fifth game handed Williams another break of serve. When Venus broke the Safina serve again at the start of the second set the match was essentially over.
