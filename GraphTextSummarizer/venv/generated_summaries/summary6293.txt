She claims, "Tosh [started] making some very generalizing, declarative statements about rape jokes always being funny, how can a rape joke not be funny, rape is hilarious." I should probably add that having to basically flee while Tosh was enthusing about how hilarious it would be if I was gang-raped in that small, claustrophobic room was pretty viscerally terrifying..." Tosh tweeted: "The point I was making before I was heckled is there are awful things in the world but you can still make jokes about them," then added: "On a lighter note tonight's new episode of Tosh.0 will be featuring clowns." So keeping in mind that Tosh says he was misquoted, the original account was by a female audience member who says she was unfamiliar with Tosh's act when she caught his performance at the Hollywood Laugh Factory. The audience member felt "provoked" and says she yelled out, "Actually, rape jokes are never funny!" The original anonymous "friend of a friend" account would be too sketchy to use for a source if not for Tosh's tweet acknowledging there is some substance to it.
