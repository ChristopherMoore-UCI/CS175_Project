The mother of Rebecca Sedwick, a Florida girl who jumped to her death after being bullied by classmates, on Tuesday urged parents of potential victims to pay attention to the signs of bullying. In addition, Norman's attorney, Matt Morgan, is pushing Florida lawmakers to enact "Rebecca's Law" -- legislation that would allow the state to file bullying charges against minors and their parents, and make parents liable in civil court. Norman said all her efforts to halt the bullying -- including counseling, reporting the harassment to school officials as well as other parents, even removing her daughter from school -- failed to deter the alleged bullies. Authorities last week dropped criminal charges against two girls accused of cyberbullying Rebecca Sedwick. "For the parent, I think civil responsibility," Morgan told New Day on Tuesday.
