Santana's residency is produced by AEG Live, the same company that brought Celine Dion, Elton John, Bette Midler and Cher to The Colosseum at Caesars Palace. Santana said his show -- "Supernatural Santana: A Trip Through the Hits" -- will "mix up a little practical spirituality with a rebel-from-the-street vibe, and with lots of incredible music." "Now we are setting the standard for rock 'n' roll residencies with this new deal," said John Meglen, AEG Live president. Santana, who has sold 90 million records over the past 40 years, is credited with blending American rock with Latin jazz. The Joint, which holds 4,000, opens next month with Paul McCartney in a show that sold out earlier this month in just seven seconds.
