-- New York City police on Wednesday evening were searching the New Jersey home of Pedro Hernandez, who is accusing of killing Etan Patz more than three decades ago, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. Meanwhile, Hernandez's wife said her husband's confession to police is coming from a man with mental illness, her lawyer said Wednesday. Pedro Hernandez is charged with the second degree murder of the 6-year-old boy, who disappeared on his way to a New York school bus stop more than 33 years ago. "Mrs. Hernandez has seen her husband's delusions and hallucinations and other mental illnesses for a very long period of time," Gottlieb said. His lawyer previously told a judge that Hernandez has a history of mental disorders, suffers from hallucinations and is bipolar.
