Lewis, whose full name is Jonathan Kendrick Lewis, was born and raised in Los Angeles. The first officer responding to a neighbor's 911 call found Lewis dead in the driveway, Smith said Thursday. A large pool of blood where police say Lewis' head crashed onto the pavement remained Thursday in the driveway of the house that has for decades been the temporary home for actors and producers visiting Los Angeles to make movies. No one saw what happened inside the house where Davis, the homeowner, was found beaten to death, Smith said. Police suspect drugs were involved, but "we don't have any hard evidence that says he was on anything right now," LAPD Commander Andrew Smith said.
