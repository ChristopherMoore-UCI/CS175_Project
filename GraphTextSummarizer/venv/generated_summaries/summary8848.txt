The same could be said of climate change. So what would happen if governments ignored the un-capitalist cries for mercy spilling out from Wall Street and put the money towards climate change instead? "That's about $60 billion right there for mitigating climate change. "So if the U.S. Congress diverted money from the financial bailout we could have a really good head start on climate change in the next six years, if we applied the $700 billion in this way." $700-800 billion dollars wouldn't guarantee that you are going to avoid climate change.
