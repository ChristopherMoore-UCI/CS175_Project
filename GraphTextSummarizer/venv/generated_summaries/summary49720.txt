It's low Friday gross of $6.3 million seemed like it may simply have been a reflection that not many adults turned out on opening night for kiddie fare. The movie earned $13 million from Friday night showings, compared to "Apes'" lackluster $10.4 million, a 62 percent drop from its opening night a week before. In limited release, Zach Braff's partially Kickstarter-donation-funded "Wish I Was Here" opened in 68 theaters and earned $495,000 for a relatively strong $7,300 per screen. But "Apes" rallied big time on Saturday, earning $14.8 million to "Purge's" $9.5 million, which was a 27 percent drop from its opening night. The "Apes" sequel, starring motion-capture master Andy Serkis as the hyper-evolved higher primate named Caesar, collected $36 million for the weekend, according to Sunday estimates.
