-- South Korea's foreign minister said Tuesday he wants five Somali pirates captured alive during the rescue of a hijacked ship last week to be put on trial in South Korea. South Koreans rescued 21 sailors, killed eight pirates and captured five others, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The order was made in Korean -- not likely understood by the Somali pirates -- and is thought to have helped save South Korean lives. "It's a given that we deal with pirates who have caused damage to our people and attack our military, and along those lines we are seriously weighing the possibility of bringing the pirates to our country," Kim Sung-Hwan said. Kim defended the military's action to save South Koreans.
