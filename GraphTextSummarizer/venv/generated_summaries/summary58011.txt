"We've got an alternate sailing course available to us at Weymouth and of course we've got the famous roof at Wimbledon." As athletes continue to arrive in London, Coe said he was satisfied with the early stages of the Olympic operation, despite American hurdler Kerron Clement complaining that his bus got lost on the way to the Olympic village. In the first of what will be daily Olympic media briefings, Sebastian Coe said the bleak conditions were posing a huge problem for London. But though there is hope of better weather ahead Coe confirmed there was enough maneuverability in the Olympic schedule to be able to rearrange events if they are blighted by wet conditions. London has spent seven years planning to hold the Games and a spokesman from the London Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) told CNN last week that every eventuality had been accounted for. And according to London's 2012 chairman, weeks of torrential rain has forced his team to make contingency plans if the sporting spectacle becomes a washout.
