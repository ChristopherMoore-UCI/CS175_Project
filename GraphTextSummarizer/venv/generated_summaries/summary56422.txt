So why do doctors still occasionally place multiple embryos in women who undergo IVF? According to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies, women under the age of 35 have a less than 43% chance of giving birth after IVF; women over 41 have a less than 18% chance. But the result wasn't exactly what this couple was looking for. "To say we're excited would be an exaggeration," the dad wrote on Babble.com in an anonymous post that recently started trending on social media. Multiple births are an increasingly common outcome for couples using assisted reproductive technology, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and IVF is often responsible. Moms carrying multiples are more likely to miscarry, develop gestational diabetes and to suffer from high blood pressure-related issues such as pre-eclampsia.
