So in order to end this mock rebellion, the state declared that state employee retirement pension payments would be suspended for McDonald County, all current state employees would be fired, and all state funding would be withheld. The McDonald Territory Noel, Missouri, located in McDonald County in the far southwest corner of the Show Me State, has been a popular tourist destination for many years. Perhaps the most lasting impression were the thousands of McDonald Territory stamps that were printed and sold throughout the area. To display their dissatisfaction, McDonald County drew up papers of secession and presented them to the state legislature, declaring itself the independent McDonald Territory. Needless to say, McDonald Territory surrendered and returned to being simply McDonald County, Missouri, once again.
