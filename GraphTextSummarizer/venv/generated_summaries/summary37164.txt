A court report said those conversations included a variety of topics not related to work, including "personal life, boyfriend issues and sexual issues." A Florida judge cut short Thursday the probation of Debra Lafave, a former Tampa middle school teacher who six years earlier pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old boy, a state law enforcement official said. That was reduced to probation in July 2008, and was set to expire on November 15, 2015 -- 10 years after she entered her plea -- said Mark Cox, a spokesman for the Hillsborough County state attorney's office. In January 2008, a Florida judge ruled that she violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker, a 17-year-old hostess at a small Tampa-area restaurant named Danny Boy's. At the time, Lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations that included  sex-related topics -- with a minor violated terms of her probation.
