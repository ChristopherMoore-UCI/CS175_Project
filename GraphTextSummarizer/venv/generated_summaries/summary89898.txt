The Pentagon says women have been barred from roughly 237,000 positions, and they will now start looking to qualified women to fill these roles. For those who are against women serving on the front line, know this: Opening up combat roles for women is merely formalizing the reality of what was already happening; it's just opening more roles and opportunities. The ban on women in military combat has been lifted, allowing women to apply for jobs in front-line positions and elite commando units. The debate the move has raised presents an obvious reality check: Our American community needs to be educated that women are capable of taking on military roles and have done so throughout the nation's history. The argument that women in combat will have a negative impact on unit cohesion and morale is the same argument that was used to keep blacks and gays out of the military.
