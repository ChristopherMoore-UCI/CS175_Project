"Of course native controller support is really interesting for the types of games we are making, but new features like Airdrop and more ways to compete through Game Center could really pump up the highly competitive aspect of our games." The new "parallax effect" included in iOS 7 will create depth on what has traditionally been a flat display for the iPhone and game controller support will offer a new way to play games on the go with the smartphone. And mobile game developers are excited about the possibilities they see opening up with that newfound power. Changes to the interface will also present opportunities for mobile game developers. Mobile gaming will definitely get a boost from the new technology available to developers.
