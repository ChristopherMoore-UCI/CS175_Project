Ukrainian forces have taken full control of Donetsk airport as they continue to fight pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Ukraine city, a Ukrainian military spokesman says. Ukrainian officials have distributed recordings of what they say are intercepted communications between pro-Russian rebels discussing shooting it down. The United States says a Russian-made surface-to-air missile fired from pro-Russian rebel territory took down the Boeing 777. The move unleashed deadly strife that led to Yanukovych's ouster, Russia's annexation of Crimea and a pro-Russian rebellion. A market outside the train station caught on fire as the result of artillery fire.
