U.N. Security Council members on Wednesday unanimously approved a resolution to address the "growing threat" posed by foreign terrorist fighters, a measure that U.S. President Barack Obama applauded while insisting it "must be matched and translated into action" to have any effect. Unanimous vote, but hints of possible issues After Obama's roughly 10-minute remarks, other world leaders echoed his anti-terrorism views, from Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan's blasting of groups like ISIS and Boko Haram's "despicable campaign against humanity" to South Korean President Park Geun-hye calling them the "scourge of mankind. "This is the only way to maintain unity, achieve effective coordination and take assertive action." Obama: U.S. leading, but can't do it alone Before leading the Security Council meeting, Obama made a more far-reaching appeal earlier Wednesday for world cooperation against terror, climate change, Ebola and a host of other issues, saying the world stands at a crossroads "between war and peace; between disorder and integration; between fear and hope." Obama also said the world must do better at addressing root problems -- from economic insecurity and political instability, including in Syria, where he called for "a political solution" to the years-long civil war there -- that play a role in drawing some to join terrorist groups. But it will take more than corralling groups like ISIS militarily to permanently address the threat, Obama said.
