How the Navy avoids norovirus Are cruise ships floating petri dishes? Norovirus infects many people on land, but health officials track it on cruise ships, leading to more frequent reporting of cases, the CDC said. At least 66 passengers and 17 crew members came down with a quickly spreading digestive bug aboard the Crown Princess, said spokeswoman Karen Candy of Princess Cruises. It causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, and is believed to have infected passengers on a number of cruise ships in recent months. Though Princess Cruises believes norovirus is at the root of the outbreak, due to the quick increase in the cases of gastric ailment, Candy did not confirm it as the cause.
