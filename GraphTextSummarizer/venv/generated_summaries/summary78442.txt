Stratton is among a group of men, now in their 60s, who are suing state agencies in Florida as well as two former reform school workers over alleged abuse they received as teenagers. Nearly half a century later, he's telling a chilling tale of alleged beatings, sexual abuse and violent death at the hands of reform school workers. He said he believes the bodies of slain boys are buried in unnamed graves on the grounds of the former reform school in Marianna, Florida. Stratton attended a Florida reform school as a teenager in the early 1960s. When they meet with Stratton, they will hear his claim that he witnessed the violent death of one boy who exposed himself to reform school workers on a dare.
