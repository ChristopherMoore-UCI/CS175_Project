The convicted mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing wants nearly two decades of communication restrictions lifted, arguing he's no longer a threat to national security, his lawyer said Sunday. Now 44, Yousef "no longer should be considered a national security threat," his lawyer, Bernard Kleinman, told CNN. Kleinman said that other than the al Qaeda defendants facing trial at the U.S. prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, "there's nobody who's treated as a greater national security threat in the federal prison system than Yousef. " Duffy, who had sentenced Yousef to prison, referred the case to a judge in Colorado, where it's now pending. Kleinman said getting out of solitary could be "the effective end result" of Yousef's case, but it's not the immediate goal.
