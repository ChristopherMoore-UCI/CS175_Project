Nidal Hasan asked to withdraw from active participation in the case Wednesday, telling a judge that Hasan wants to be sentenced to death. Lunsford, a health care specialist, described how his friend and colleague, physician's assistant Michael Cahill, tried to hit Hasan with a chair to stop the shooting; Hasan shot him dead. As Lunsford was checking behind him, "Major Hasan is turning the weapon on me," he said. The lawyers' roles had been limited to helping Hasan file motions and coaching him on procedural matters. Military death row: More than 50 years and no executions Hasan did not want to deploy to fight against other Muslims and believed "that he had a jihad duty to kill as many soldiers as possible," said Col. Michael Mulligan, the lead prosecutor in the case.
