At the time, prison officials said they were looking into rumors that Fromme escaped after hearing Manson was ill, according to news reports. Fromme reportedly joined Manson's family after meeting him in California in 1967. " Fromme was sentenced to life in prison, but parole was an option at the time, although the federal system later abolished it, said Felicia Ponce, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Prisons. For years, she was one of Manson's few remaining followers, as many other "Manson Family" members have shunned him. FMC-Carswell spokeswoman Maria Douglas would not comment on Fromme's behavior in prison in recent years.
