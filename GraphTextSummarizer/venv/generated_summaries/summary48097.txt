With Germany international Mario Gomez causing Madrid's static defense problems and former Real and Chelsea player Arjen Robben using his pace to good effect, Bayern carved out chance after chance. -- Bayern Munich will enjoy home advantage when they play Chelsea in the European Champions League final after defeating Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu following Wednesday's dramatic penalty shootout. That goal meant that even though Madrid led 2-1 by halftime, the tie was level 3-3 on aggregate following Bayern's 2-1 first leg victory in Munich last week. Bastian Schweinsteiger struck the winning penalty kick after nine-time champions Madrid won the second leg semifinal 2-1, leveling the tie 3-3 on aggregate, and forcing the match into extra time. Madrid started in explosive fashion, dominating the opening exchanges, and quickly won a controversial penalty when Bayern defender David Alaba was adjudged to have handled the ball even though it had been blasted at him from close range.
