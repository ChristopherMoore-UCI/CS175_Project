The injured boy was coherent when he was taken to a hospital, said Principal Jay Townsend of Fairmount Public School, which has 112 students from kindergarten through 12th grade. The freshman, whose name wasn't being released, has lived in the small, rural community of 380 residents his entire life and has spent all educational years at Fairmount School, Mayor Jon Nelk said. An alert system called all parents, and school was canceled for the day, Townsend said. The student's grandparents grew up in the Fairmount area and his parents have lived in town their entire lives, Nelk said. A teacher provided first-aid to the boy, and the school went into lockdown shortly after the 8:40 a.m. shooting, Townsend said.
