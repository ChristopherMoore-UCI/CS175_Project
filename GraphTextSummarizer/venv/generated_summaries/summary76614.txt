I.Am sang "I Gotta Feeling" with octave-hopping pop singer Jessie J, X-Factor alumni JLS produced a medley of hits, while Barlow performed a duet with a painfully out of tune Cheryl Cole. Cynics might argue that a more accurate view of modern Britain could come from the likes of Plan B, whose "Ill Manors" single sticks the knife into Cameron's Britain, but a gig at Buckingham Palace was never going to be the place for punk sentiment. Before the majestic fireworks display and the heart-thumping national anthem, Barlow led the Queen, the Duchess Of Cornwall and Prince Charles on stage. But the real VIPs were in the royal box, where Prime Minister David Cameron stood with Prince Charles, The Duchess Of Cambridge, Princes William and Harry, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie and numerous other Windsors. Our attention was then drawn to the roof of the palace, where 80s British band Madness sang "Our House" as a light projection transformed the imposing royal residence into a row of typical British terraced houses.
