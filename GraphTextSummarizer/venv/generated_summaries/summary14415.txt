Dozens of people were inside the hotel when the blast took place, Umrani said. -- A bomb flattened a hotel Sunday in southwest Pakistan, killing at least 12 people, police said. In recent years, the province has been plagued by sectarian violence and separatist Baluch militant groups who demand political autonomy and a greater share of profits from the province's natural resources. The rockets struck while the paramilitary group was preparing for an Independence Day parade, said Maj.
