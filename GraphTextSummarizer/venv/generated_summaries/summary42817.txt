-- Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, delivering Thursday's commencement speech at Harvard University, criticized what he described as a disturbing trend of liberals silencing voices "deemed politically objectionable. " Bloomberg, who in April pledged $50 million to gun control groups he helped organize, spoke about Washington politicians' handling of gun issues, noting Congress has barred the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from conducting studies of gun violence, a prohibition that was recently extended to the National Institute of Health. " "This spring, it has been disturbing to see a number of college commencement speakers withdraw -- or have their invitations rescinded -- after protests from students and -- to me, shockingly -- from senior faculty and administrators who should know better," Bloomberg said. "Let's get serious: When 85 Americans are killed with guns every single day, and shootings regularly occur at our schools and universities, including last week's tragedy at Santa Barbara, it would be almost medical malpractice to say anything else," Bloomberg said. The Senate this year delayed a vote on President Obama's nominee for surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy, because the Harvard physician "had the audacity to say gun violence is a public health crisis that should be tackled," Bloomberg said to applause.
