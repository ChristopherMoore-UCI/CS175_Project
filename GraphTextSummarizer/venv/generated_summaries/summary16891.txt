Repairing relations with the United States There are any number of irritants -- from settlement construction to failed peace talks to Israeli military action in Gaza and Lebanon -- which have long tested the alliance between Washington and Israel. For all its official praise for the "unshakable bonds" between the U.S. and Israel, the White House sees Netanyahu as the problem. Privately, however, U.S. officials have warned the level of Washington's political support for Israel with allies and at the United Nations could be affected by Netanyahu's attitude toward the Obama administration. Leading opposition candidate Tzipi Livni, who once served as Netanyahu's main peace negotiator, accused Netanyahu of being responsible for a "diplomatic tsunami" against Israel. Israel's next prime minister -- whether incumbent Benjamin Netanyahu or Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog -- will be faced with a myriad of international and domestic crises amid deepening tensions with the United States, its closest ally.
