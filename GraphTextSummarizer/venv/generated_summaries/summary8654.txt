The conflict has made violence increasingly common in Juarez, Tijuana and other Mexican border towns. Extreme violence among warring drug cartels and the Mexican government has long plagued Juarez and the state of Chihuahua, but the situation has been getting worse. -- Nine bodies have been found in a common grave in the desert south of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, according to Chihuahua state prosecutor's spokeswoman Daniela Gonzalez. Ferriz said that during a recent raid, local police confiscated two .50-caliber military-style rifles. Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas, has become one of the major battlegrounds as drug cartels fight both each other and Mexican authorities.
