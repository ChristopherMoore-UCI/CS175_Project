Simon Young Ngai-man, director of the Centre for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, downplayed the apparent spat between Washington and Hong saying there may be nothing more to the Hong Kong decision than what it has publicly maintained: that Washington failed to meet the requirements under Hong Kong law that would have allowed the police to detain Snowden. "We are disappointed by the decision of the authorities in Hong Kong to permit Mr. Snowden to flee despite the legally valid U.S. request to arrest him for purposes of his extradition under the U.S.-Hong Kong Surrender Agreement," said NSC spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden in a statement. While there has been speculation that Beijing was behind the final decision to allow NSA leaker Snowden to leave Hong Kong -- a semi-autonomous Chinese territory -- on Sunday, Hong Kong authorities insist the judicial process was independent of China. " While the Hong Kong statement on Snowden pointedly requested a clarification from Washington of Snowden's claims that the U.S. had hacked targets in the territory, Young said he believed that this was aimed at domestic concerns over Snowden rather than any veiled attack on Washington. Couched in diplomatic language, the statement spelled out Washington's position: Hong Kong dropped the ball on Edward Snowden and the U.S. wants Russia to pick it up.
