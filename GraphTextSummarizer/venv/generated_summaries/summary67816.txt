Prime Minister Tony Abbott said an urgent review of parliamentary security was ordered amid intelligence reports of "chatter" of potential threats by "terrorist support networks." Meanwhile, several Islamic organizations in Australia sounded the alarm, warning about a surge of Islamophobia after Thursday's predawn counter-terrorism raids resulted in the detention of at least 15 suspects. In an interview with Australia's Seven Network on Friday, Abbott said a senior Australian member of the ISIS militant group in Syria had been overheard instructing sympathizers in Australia to carry out acts of violence. Australia is also sending fighter jets and combat support aircraft to the United Arab Emirates  to assist in the campaign against ISIS. Australian authorities estimate 60 citizens are fighting alongside ISIS and other militant groups in the Middle East. This month, Australia was quick to accept U.S. President Barack Obama's call for an international coalition to battle ISIS.
