Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel called Hadiya's family on Sunday morning to tell them about the development in the investigation, said Chicago police spokeswoman Melissa Stratton. -- A day after 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton was laid to rest -- and 11 days after she was shot to death on the streets of Chicago -- police are questioning two people in relation to her slaying, a police spokeswoman said. She was an honor student and band majorette at King College Prep School when a man shot her at a park in what her godfather, Damon Stuart, described as an "ideal community" on Chicago's South Side. " Her slaying -- the 42nd in the city this year -- also highlighted the problem of gun violence in Chicago. CNN's Katherine Wojtecki reported this story from Chicago, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote it from Atlanta.
