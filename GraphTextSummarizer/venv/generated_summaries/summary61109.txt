At least four people were injured, said Dave Williams, a spokesman for the Harford County Volunteer Fire & EMS Association, in an e-mail to CNN affiliate WMAR. Central Harford County bore the brunt of it: two buildings -- a mobile office trailer and a one-story auto detailing and repair facility in the Fallston area -- were destroyed; more than a dozen homes were damaged, he said. One of the injured was in a car dealership in the Fallston area, which partially collapsed, said Robert Thomas, a public information officer for Harford County. -- A fierce storm tore Friday evening through the town of Bel Air in northeast Maryland, damaging buildings, peeling off roofs, flipping a pickup truck, and felling trees and light poles, officials said. Search-and-rescue operations were being conducted Friday night in the affected area, which was concentrated within a mile radius of Fallston, which had lost power, he said.
