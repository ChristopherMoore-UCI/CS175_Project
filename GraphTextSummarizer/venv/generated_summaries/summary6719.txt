Red Lobster is not the only restaurant seeing more empty seats than in years past. "Our industry is in a period of significant change,with relatively low levels of consumer demand in each of the past several years for restaurants generally, and for casual dining in particular," said Clarence Otis, the CEO of Darden, the parent company of Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse, among others. But statistics suggest that we haven't been going to restaurants like Red Lobster the way we used to, and it's not because our collective palate has changed. Red Lobster remains a favorite spot for black families to dine after church. That also happens to be the same year Red Lobster was founded.
