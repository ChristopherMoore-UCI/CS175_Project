In the largest study of genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's in the African American population, researchers reporting in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that two genes associated with higher risk of the neurodegenerative disorder among whites also contributed to higher rates of the disease among African Americans. Changes in these genes, however, conferred a higher risk of disease among African Americans than among whites. By comparison, ABCA7 is likely responsible for a 10% to 20% increased risk for the memory-robbing disorder within white populations, and about 40% of whites with certain forms of ApoE are diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

The more prominent contribution that ABCA7 seems to play in Alzheimer's risk among African Americans, however, does suggest that such lipid-based pathways may be more important in this population than among whites.
