In a joint statement, Acting FAA Administrator Michael Huerta and National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Paul Rinaldi said the extension serves both organizations. Controllers will get the same pay raise given to other federal government employees instead of independently negotiating raises, the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said. And, after contract talks broke down in 2005, the union worked for more than three years under a contract imposed by President George W. Bush and Congress. And the controllers will get the same raises the president and Congress authorize for other federal employees. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fired striking controllers, leading to the decertification of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization, or PATCO.
