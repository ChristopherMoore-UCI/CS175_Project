The lawsuit alleges that Harrington not only was aware that organs were missing, but "actively undertook measures to dispose of said organs in an effort to interfere" with the investigation. Roy Copeland, a lawyer for Harrington Funeral Home and its owner, Antonio Harrington, said his client had not been served as of Wednesday and could not comment on something he has not seen. The doctor who carried out that autopsy determined that Johnson suffered blunt force trauma to the right neck and soft tissues, "consistent with inflicted injury," challenging the authorities' ruling that the death was accidental. In the lawsuit, filed January 31 and amended Wednesday, the family alleges that not only did the funeral home mishandle the organs, it disposed of them to thwart an investigation into Johnson's cause of death.
