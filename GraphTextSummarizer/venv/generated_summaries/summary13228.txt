Alexandra Williams and Arvin Shandiz met on a Delta Air Lines shuttle from New York to Chicago in 2010, CNN affiliate WGN reported. On Friday, in the middle of a flight from Chicago's O'Hare International to New York's LaGuardia Airport, Shandiz suddenly addressed a visibly shocked Williams over the plane's intercom (with the airline's permission) as other passengers looked on. "From the moment I met her that night, I knew that I never wanted to spend a second without her," Shandiz announced as Williams rocked in her seat with emotion. "Would you marry me?" The cabin erupted in applause as Williams said yes. I can't say how elated and lucky I feel," Williams said.
