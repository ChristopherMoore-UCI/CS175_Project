Giffords will be taken by ambulance Friday morning from University Medical Center in Tucson to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Thursday continued her dramatic recovery from a gunshot wound to the brain by going outside for physical therapy, one of her principal doctors in Tucson, Arizona, told CNN. He said Giffords' family looked at several different rehabilitation facilities and liked Memorial Hermann for several reasons. "We gave her some fresh air and also gave her some sunshine," said Rhee, speaking from outside University Medical Center. The medical team there specializes in penetrating head injuries like the one Giffords has suffered, and its closeness to Tucson is also helpful.
