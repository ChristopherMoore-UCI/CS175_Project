Madonna performed Tuesday night at a packed Moscow stadium, where she expressed her support for the Russian female punk rock band Pussy Riot, whose members face up to seven years in prison for performing a song critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin. -- Russian authorities are stepping up security after a threat of violence at Madonna concerts this week, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow warned. In February, they screamed "Mother Mary please drive Putin away" during a concert inside Christ Savior Cathedral, one of Moscow's grandest cathedrals, outraging many of the country's faithful. Maria, Katya, Nadia, I pray for you," Madonna said at Tuesday's concert, according to RIA Novosti. Pussy Riot specializes in sudden, often illegal public performances, including one in Moscow's Red Square.
