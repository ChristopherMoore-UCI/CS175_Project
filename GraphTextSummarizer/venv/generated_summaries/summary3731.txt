Abuse victims' group names preferred picks for new pope O'Brien resigned in scandal last week after allegations that he made sexual advances toward young men studying to be priests. These include how to tackle the issue of child sex abuse by priests and a scandal over leaks from the Vatican last year that revealed claims of corruption within the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy. Darmaatmadja cited health reasons, and O'Brien cited personal reasons. The apartments were placed under seal after Benedict XVI left last week and must be renovated before the new pope can take up residence, the Vatican said. The cardinals voted Friday morning to accept the letters of explanation of two cardinal-electors who are eligible to vote for the next pope but will not attend the conclave: Keith O'Brien of Scotland and Julius Riyadi Darmaatmadja of Indonesia.
