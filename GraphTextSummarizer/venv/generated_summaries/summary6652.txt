Union sources said the death toll had exceeded 50 since mid-December, but Minister of Information Samir Abidi said approximately 21 people were killed during two days of rioting in two Tunisian cities near its border with Algeria. -- As clashes spread Tuesday, a Tunisian workers union called on President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali to order an independent inquiry into the deaths of demonstrators protesting high unemployment and poor living conditions in Tunisia. Tunisia has been ruled for 23 years by Zine el Abidine Ben Ali, an ally of Western powers and a target of activist and human rights groups that accuse him of running a corrupt police state that has infringed on citizens' rights. Tunisia's 14% unemployment rate does not reflect the true problems faced by the nation, said Abidi, the information minister. The union Tuesday demanded the release of demonstrators and said it will call a general strike in several southern cities in response to what it calls police brutality.
