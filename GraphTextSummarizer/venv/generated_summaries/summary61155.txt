Roger Ebert, my friend of 40 years, has written about his memories of Dan-Dan the Yo-Yo Man pulling into his hometown of Urbana, Illinois, in a dark maroon 1950 Hudson automobile: "Dan-Dan dismounted on the far side of the big Hudson, and when he walked into view there were already two yo-yos spinning in the air before him, making a whirl of red and yellow. In our town, the yo-yo star who annually passed through called himself "Dan-Dan the Yo-Yo Man." (Rule told me that his name on the road was "Mr. Yo-Yo," and that I was wrong about all of them being called Dan-Dan: "If you saw Dan-Dan the Yo-Yo Man, then you saw Danny Maris.") Those Duncan Tournament yo-yos, and Duncan Imperials, and Duncan Butterflies, sold for as little as 39 cents apiece. There are probably many ways that a person such as Ronni Chasen can first feel the spark that leads to a career as a Hollywood publicist, but being a part of those Duncan yo-yo contests would qualify as an early intriguing view into the power of creative, fun and relentless promotion of a leisure-time product.
