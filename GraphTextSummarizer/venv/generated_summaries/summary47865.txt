No one is sure who started the custom of leaving items at the wall, curator Duery Felton said. Felton, a Vietnam veteran himself, says he's wary of making assumptions about an item's meaning. "You had, for the first time that we've been able to ascertain, people coming to a public site for a protracted period and leaving unsolicited objects," Felton said. -- Long before people posted their thoughts and feelings on social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook, millions of people were doing just that on a different sort of wall. Though it's not open to the public, traveling collections are often on display at museums both in the United States and abroad, Felton said.
