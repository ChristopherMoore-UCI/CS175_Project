Beadle, whose day job is a youth worker at ECPAT UK, says the motivation to achieve something notable for such a worthy cause far outweighed any inhibitions that she or the crew may have held. But no matter what the crew end up doing next Beadle thinks it likely and preferable that the task will be completed fully dressed. "We spent a lot of time rowing naked because when the sea water gets inside your clothes it increases friction against your skin which can cause sores," says Debbie Beadle, Skipper of the Row for Freedom team. As well as having to improvise to counter boils and sores, Beadle and her crew faced numerous other unexpected challenges during the course of their epic voyage. "We got to know each other very well," says Beadle as she recalls airing her sores in front of her ship mates after a particularly hard day of rowing.
