Robert De Niro played Burke as Jimmy Conway in the 1990 Martin Scorsese classic mafia film "Goodfellas," and Burke is likely best known as the alleged mastermind of the 1978 Lufthansa heist, an $8 million robbery at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which was the largest robbery in history at the time. But the source said that Burke and his cohorts, closely associated with top members of the Lucchese crime family, also were allegedly involved in a number of other activities -- so the search in Queens may not be related to the Lufthansa heist. According to public records, the house is now owned by Burke's daughter, Catherine Burke, who declined Tuesday to comment to CNN. Jim Margolin, a spokesman for the FBI's New York office, told CNN on Tuesday, without elaborating, that investigators were "conducting a search at a home in Queens in connection to an investigation." Investigators at Ozone Park in Queens finished the search Wednesday night for human remains possibly connected to a case that happened before 1996, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
