Flight tracking records show that the Asiana 214 flight descended from cruising altitude much more steeply and rapidly than previous Asiana flights on the same route. Flights were landing using visual flight rules. The runway's precision approach path indicator lights, showing correct flight approach altitudes, were working. Passengers onboard the aircraft describe the engines spooling up and the nose tilting up just before impact, and a preliminary review of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders appear to show the pilots attempted to abort the landing 1.5 seconds before impact. The debris field runs from the water, slightly right of the paved threshold and runway center, all the way to the stopped aircraft fuselage.
