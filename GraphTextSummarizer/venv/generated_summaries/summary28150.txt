This mob of Christian kids - remembered by historians as The Children's Crusade - was on its way to Jerusalem to liberate it from an infidel who, it was rumored, ate children. The glossily seductive "Kony2012" was explicitly designed for kids. In defense of his movie, Jason Russell said on CNN that he thinks of "Kony2012" as being owned by children because "the youth of the world" has funded it. But in what he calls "our new world of flattened time and space," I wonder if we are also seeing, alongside the radical democratization of time and space, the flattening of age. We can do that, it promises, by creating a network of millions of kids who will catch Joseph Kony, the Ugandan warlord described by Gavin, the deliciously blonde, four-year-old star of the movie, as a "big bad guy." "Kony abducts kids just like Gavin," the movie's narrator, Jason Russell -- who just happens to be Gavin's dad --- tells us.
