A London 2012 spokesman told CNN: "Keys being used by police officers on searches at Wembley Stadium were reported missing... The locks at London's Olympic football final venue Wembley Stadium have had to be changed, after police responsible for security at the world-famous sports arena lost their keys. These were internal keys, locks have been changed and the security of the venue has not been compromised in any way. A Metropolitan Police spokesman told CNN on Monday that officers at the ground first realized the keys had gone missing last Tuesday, July 24. The cost of replacing all the high-tech laser keys used at Wembley is expected to run into tens of thousands of dollars.
