Substitute Scott Williams' moment of late individual brilliance helped Wales come from 12-6 down, and a desperate try-saving tackle in the corner by fellow center Jonathan Davies condemned defending champions England to a first defeat under interim coach Stuart Lancaster. The last time Wales won a Six Nations rugby international at England's home stronghold, the team went on to claim the 2008 title and complete a grand slam of victories against all competing countries. Lancaster made a positive start with his new-look team, grinding out wins against Scotland and Italy, and four penalties from young new fly-half Owen Farrell gave the coach hope of another victory. England, however, had a disappointing time on and off the pitch, losing to France in the quarterfinals before an investigation into a series of incidents involving the players ended with 2003 World Cup winner Martin Johnson standing down as coach and ructions in the boardroom. We are over the moon to get the Triple Crown here," Warburton said after his team followed up victories over Scotland and Ireland.
