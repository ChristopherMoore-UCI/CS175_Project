-- American Webb Simpson has spoken about his delight at securing his first PGA Tour victory at the Wyndham Championship in his native North Carolina. " Former world number one and three-time major winner Vijah Singh finished in a five-way tie for fourth position, one-shot behind American Tommy Gainey on 14-under. Level with Singh were U.S. duo Jerry Kelly and Charles Howell III, South Korea's Kyung-tae Kim and Carl Pettersson of Sweden. Simpson, who caddied for his compatriot Neal Lancaster at a Pro-Am event ahead of the Greensboro tournament when he was a teenager, finished on 18-under-par, three-shots clear of fellow-American George McNeill. Simpson carded a bogey-free final round to seal his triumph and move into third position in the standings for the season-ending Fedex Cup.
