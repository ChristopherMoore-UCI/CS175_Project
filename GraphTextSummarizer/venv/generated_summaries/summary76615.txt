Though Carter was the first incumbent president to lose the presidency in half a century, "to many people, Jimmy Carter has provided Americans with an ideal model of post-presidential life." And he's not unique in that sense -- a Gallup poll released Thursday showed presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton all with an improved approval rating in retirement. And that prism generally makes them look better.. "History has a way of making presidents, in most cases, look better than they looked during their administration," said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. Dedicated to democracy and human rights, the center has helped Carter's reputation so much that Edward Berkowitz, professor of History at George Washington University, said that Carter may have more respect now than he had when he lost the White House. And for most former U.S. presidents, that appears to be true.
