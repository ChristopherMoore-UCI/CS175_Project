-- Hamas is pushing a different tactic in its conflict with Israel, urging Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas to go before the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders for war crimes. "Hamas has signed a document demanding Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) go to the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders as war criminals for massacres they committed against our people," Hamas spokesman and senior official Izzat al-Risheq said on Twitter. Also on Saturday, Al Aqsa, a TV station run by Hamas, reported that Israeli gunboats sank a Palestinian fishing vessel off the Port of Gaza. "We at Hamas political command do not know anything about the kidnapping; all information we have is from the Israeli investigation. A rocket from Lebanon struck an open area east of the town of Akko in northern Israel, though it wasn't clear who was responsible or if it had anything to do with Israel's fight with Hamas.
