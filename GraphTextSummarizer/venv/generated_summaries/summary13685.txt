" Finding happiness in mystical Bhutan With its contours built into the ridge 1,350 meters (4,430 feet) above sea level, Wangdue Phodrang is inaccessible on three sides save for a narrow path in the front, Dasho Karma of the Center for Bhutan Studies pointed out. Dzongs have had a history of fires, he explained, noting that butter lamps had been the culprit in the past. Bhutan is mourning the loss of Wangdue Phodrang Dzong, a four-century-old architectural wonder that had dramatically stood on a ridge at the confluence of two rivers before it burned to the ground over the weekend. Bhutan had only just submitted Wangdue Phodrang for World Heritage List consideration in March. "It's not just a Bhutanese architectural loss but for the whole Himalayan region," Dasho Karma Ura, president of the Thimphu-based Center for Bhutan Studies, said by telephone on Tuesday before visiting the site.
