-- Paula Newby-Fraser, widely known as "the Queen of Kona," has won 21 Ironman Triathlon titles and eight Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii -- more than any other athlete, male or female, in the 36-year history of the event. Years of experience have taught me how to keep perspective about competing. I fully understand that doing events is a celebration of hard work. My first triathlon was an Olympic distance event held in South Africa. She is working with Olympian Apolo Ohno for his trip to the 2014 Ironman World Championship.
