New Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo and his ministers met the king and took the oath of office Tuesday, the Belgian Parliament said. But in the long term, according to Matthijs, Belgium needs a central government to make massive mandatory budget cuts and introduce reform of public finances. "A government without power can't introduce new taxes," said Herman Matthijs, a professor of politics at the Free University of Brussels. -- The only country that has gone without a government for longer than post-Hussein Iraq ended its record-breaking run Tuesday. Di Rupo is due to make his first official statement as head of government on Wednesday.
