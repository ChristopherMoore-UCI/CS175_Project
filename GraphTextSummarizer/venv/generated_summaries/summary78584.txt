The parents of a New York Rangers player found dead in his apartment have decided to donate his brain to Boston University researchers studying the effects of concussion in athletes, a medical examiner's office said Sunday. Boogaard supported the Defending the Blue Line Foundation, a nonprofit that ensures the children of military personnel get the opportunity to play hockey. Dr. Robert Stern, co-director for Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, confirmed Sunday that the family has donated Boogard's brain to the VA CSTE Brain Bank for study. New York Rangers enforcer Derek Boogaard was found dead Friday in his Minneapolis apartment. The office has not released a cause of death, saying it was waiting for toxicology test results that might not be determined for several weeks.
