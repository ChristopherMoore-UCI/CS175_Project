According to a new poll by the Salt Lake Tribune, while most Democrats want to re-elect Obama, one in five of them aren't so sure. Just 37% of those surveyed -- Republicans, Democrats and independents --- are certain they want to give Obama another term. As recently noted by The Wall Street Journal, a recent Gallup poll of Republicans put support for Romney at 24%, and last month, his level of support floated between 22% and 25%. The problem is the same kind of enthusiasm gap that Romney is facing with Republican voters. Both groups still support Obama, and they certainly prefer him to every possible Republican alternative.
