Jonathan Otten and his brother Christopher are both on the list to become New York City firefighters, their mother said. Marion Otten and Quinn met for the first time the other day. She was walking on the beach, she says, "praying for peace and comfort" months after the sudden death of her 62-year-old brother, Michael O'Neill, a volunteer firefighter and captain on Long Island. " When the bracelet arrived, Otten's widow, Marion, didn't even know it was missing, she said. -- A worn metal bracelet inscribed with the name of a fallen 9/11 firefighter washed up 10 days ago on the shores of New York's Robert Moses State Park.
