Without access to the airwaves, "they're using social media to get out their message," WJZ reporter Derek Valcourt told viewers. Competitive tendencies abated for at least a few hours: WMAR staffers who witnessed the crash gave interviews to the other stations, and WMAR's website streamed a simulcast of WJZ's live coverage. He was apprehended shortly after 4:30 p.m. All the while, WMAR journalists could relay information only via Twitter and the station's website. "Right now we are using our Phoenix station to bring you this signal," Costello told viewers. Initially the staffers waited outside at a safe distance from the station headquarters; around 2:30 p.m., a yellow school bus arrived to take some of them to a Marriott hotel in Towson, Maryland, where they regrouped and began to plan news coverage for the rest of the day.
