On many of Iran's most sensitive and politically charged debates, Montazeri intervened in an unprecedented manner that marked a clear contrast with the ruling ideology of Iranian regime. Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, who died at 87, was the Iranian equivalent of South Africa's Desmond Tutu for politics. He was one of the key intellectual theoreticians of the concept of the "rule of the Islamic jurist" (velayat-e faqih), which formed the foundation of Iran's post-revolutionary constitutional order, thus ensuring clerical domination of Iranian politics. Yet he continued to write and issue bold statements of support to Iran's reform movement, essentially using his religious authority to give moral sanction to democratic forces in Iranian society. Born into a poor family in 1922 in the small town of Najafabad, Montazeri rose through the ranks of the religious seminaries to the position of a Grand Ayatollah (the most senior clerical position in Shia Islam) primarily because of his exceptional erudition and broad following as a source of religious authority.
