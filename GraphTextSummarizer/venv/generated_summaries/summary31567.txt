We have just returned from Lough Erne, which is situated about two hours west of Belfast in Northern Ireland, after spending some time with golf's biggest teenage sensation, Lough Erne's attached professional Rory McIlroy. But with such a rich tradition of superb golf courses in Northern Ireland like Royal Portrush, Castlerock and Royal County Down, how will Lough Erne compete? Just days after this year's Open Championship at Turnberry in Scotland, McIlroy will take on Ireland's greatest ever golfer, three times Major Champion, Padraig Harrington, in the inaugural Lough Erne Challenge, a one-day event scheduled for Wednesday, July 22. That coupled with the fact that golf tourism in Northern Ireland has been in steep decline, it's a testament to the people of Lough Erne Golf Resort that they're opening their brand new championship course this summer.
