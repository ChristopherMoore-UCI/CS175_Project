"ISIS is smart, and they're using social media to recruit as many Americans or other allies to come to Syria to be radicalized and trained to fight," Rep. C.A. "Dutch" Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, said Monday. ISIS, an extremist Islamist group, has been fighting to take over a swath of territory in Iraq and Syria where it wants to establish a caliphate or Islamic state. Turkey, the complaint notes, is a common transit point for foreign fighters from Western countries who travel to join ISIS. ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe.
