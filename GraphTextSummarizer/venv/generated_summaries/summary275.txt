-- Phillip Garrido was sentenced Thursday to 431 years to life in prison in the kidnapping and sexual assault of Jaycee Dugard, who was held captive from age 11 to 29 by Garrido and his wife, according to the El Dorado County, California, district attorney's office. A statement by Dugard's mother, Terry Probyn, was also read in court. His wife, Nancy Garrido, 55, was sentenced earlier in the day to 36 years to life in prison for her role in the abduction and rape, said Garrido's attorney, Stephen Tapson. Dugard was abducted from the street in front of her home in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991. During those years, the Garridos held Dugard in a hidden compound on their home's grounds in Antioch, California.
