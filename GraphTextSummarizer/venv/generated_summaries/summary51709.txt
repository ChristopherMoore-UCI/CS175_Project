Soldiers and sandbags Prime Minister David Cameron is promising government help for regions that have literally been under water for weeks now. " Efforts were under way to build flood defenses in the area, where nearby homes were damaged and riverside benches and trees were submerged in the water. -- Villages cut off by floodwater, rail links severed and huge waves pounding coastlines. In one area, Dawlish, high tides and stormy seas destroyed a sea wall, causing a significant stretch of railway to collapse into the sea. Britain has been hit by bad weather since early December, and swaths of southwestern England have been flooded in continuously stormy weather.
