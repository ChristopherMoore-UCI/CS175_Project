The condition of the World War I-era ship is "extraordinarily good," said Robert Hawkins, a project director with Fugro, a geotechnical, survey and geosciences company based in the Netherlands. Details of the Danton's discovery were released at a news conference Thursday in Milan, Italy, where the pipeline construction company, Galsi, is based. The French confirmed the identity of the Danton by comparing Fugro's data with design plans. The Vergniaud is a French battleship of the same class as the Danton, which is on the floor of the Mediterranean. -- A French battleship sunk by German torpedoes in 1917 is lying upright and almost intact at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, where it was found by an unmanned submarine surveying a proposed gas pipeline route between Italy and Algeria.
