-- Funeral services were held Sunday for Saudi Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, a hard-line conservative credited with pushing back al Qaeda. He was to be buried following the funeral in Al-Adel cemetery in Mecca, according to Oussama Nogali, Saudi foreign ministry spokesman. Nayef served as Saudi interior minister since 1975, overseeing the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts. Nayef led the crackdown against hard-line Islamists who took control of Mecca in 1979 and also oversaw the smashing of Saudi-based al Qaeda cells in the mid-2000s. Nayef, named crown prince in October by his brother the king, was heir to the Saudi throne.
