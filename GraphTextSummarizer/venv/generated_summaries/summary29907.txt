"President Medvedev congratulated President Obama on the Senate's approval of the new START Treaty, and the two leaders agreed that this was an historic event for both countries and for U.S.-Russia relations," a White House statement said. The treaty is considered a critical component of nuclear non-proliferation efforts and the Obama administration's attempt to "reset" relations between the United States and Russia. The accord "will strengthen our country's security (and) international stability, consolidate the non-proliferation regime, and become an additional factor encouraging positive trends both in our relations with the U.S. and on the international arena in general," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said during the debate that preceded the vote. "The link between strategic offensive and defensive weapons was documented in a legally binding form." President Barack Obama, who recently called the treaty "the most significant arms control agreement in nearly two decades," discussed the accord with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev during a phone conversation on Thursday. The pact "will enhance our leadership to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and seek the peace of a world without them," Obama added.
