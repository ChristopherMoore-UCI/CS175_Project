Dreaming up the sandwich Cathy first dreamed up his concept for a chicken sandwich after a poultry distributor wondered if there was a way to use leftover chicken from meals prepared for plane passengers. -- S. Truett Cathy, who grew his boneless chicken sandwich business from one store in Georgia to the Chick-fil-A chain -- a $5 billion company with more than 1,800 locations -- died early Monday morning. Chick-fil-A's leadership shares Cathy's religious beliefs, openly espousing biblical values not only in its operating principles but in its conservative definition of family as well. Deeply religious, Cathy made the decision when he opened his first store in Hapeville, Georgia, that it would stay closed on Sundays. In recent years, Cathy handed over the reins of the company to his son, Dan, and assumed the title of chairman emeritus.
