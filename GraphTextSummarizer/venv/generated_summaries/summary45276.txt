Lewis joined the cause in the early 1950s, and he gave it star power in 1966 when he became the host of what would be the charity's first of many telethons over Labor Day weekends. For 45 years, Jerry Lewis and the Muscular Dystrophy Association's annual Labor Day fundraiser have been synonymous, so much so that it's now known as the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon, in honor of the comic's tireless efforts. "As a labor of love, I've hosted the annual telethon since 1966," Lewis said in news release issued by the Muscular Dystrophy Association. This year's event, on September 4, will be shorter than many of years past at six hours. Still Lewis promised that it "will be spectacular, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it." Even as he steps down as host, Lewis said he will continue to serve as national chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
