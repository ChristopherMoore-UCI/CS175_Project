According to Vickery Bowles, the director of collections management, the Toronto Public Library has a system for processing requests to remove books from its collection, though fewer than 100 have been filed since 2000. Although it's unclear whether the removal request was filed by an actual Grinch or intended in jest, the complaint stated that the book should be removed because it "encourages children to use violence against their fathers." The protest of controversial books is nothing new, but one particularly sensitive reader in Toronto issued a challenge over something a bit less sensational. Among them was a children's book on dairy farming that had outdated farming information. In addressing the complaint, the library pointed out that the book is included on many "best of" lists for children and that Dr. Seuss is a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.
