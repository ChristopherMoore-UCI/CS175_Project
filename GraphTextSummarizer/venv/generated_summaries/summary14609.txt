When Stoughton's family auctioned them last month, collector and filmmaker Keya Morgan purchased about 15,000 of the images, including many showing private Kennedy family moments. It was the younger John Kennedy who first stirred Morgan's interest in Stoughton's photo archives in 1997. Morgan also claims the largest collection of Lincoln photos, but the numbers are minuscule compared to Kennedy's. "Cecil was with President Kennedy basically all the time and even in some fairly intimate moments," Morgan said. -- Thousands of photos taken during John F. Kennedy's 1,036 days as president remain unseen since White House photographer Cecil Stoughton printed and logged them in his darkroom five decades ago.
