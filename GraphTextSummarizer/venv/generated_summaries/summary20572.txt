"The water situation in Bangkok city is no longer a worry and today is the end of the high tide period," FROC spokesperson Wim Rungwattanachinda told CNN. Asia's wet and wild summer explained More than 500,000 square kilometers -- an area the size of Spain -- have been affected by the floods in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos, according to CNN meteorologist Jenny Harrison. The country's Flood Relief Operation Command (FROC) reported that flood defense measures in low-lying Bangkok have held and that the bloated Chao Praya River has not risen any further. However, Irrigation department director general Chalit Damrongsak warned the situation remained critical as water from low-lying areas north of Bangkok still needed to drain. Other manufacturing sites north of Bangkok, such as Rojana Industrial Park, were forced to halt operations as the floodwater hit.
