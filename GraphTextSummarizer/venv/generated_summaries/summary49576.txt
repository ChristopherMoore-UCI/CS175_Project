"It's true, I haven't pursued higher education but I have proved my competence, commitment, rigor and efficiency time and time again. Speaking of his candidacy, N'Dour said Senegal deserves better and is prepared to do whatever it takes to ensure that the country does not take the path of violence seen in other countries in the region during election period. N'Dour will run against current president Abdoulaye Wade, whose bid for a third term is proving controversial. Speaking on his television network TFM, N'Dour said his motivation to run for president was influenced by what he called "a supreme patriotic duty to do more for my country." Indeed, N'Dour is one of Senegal's most popular faces on the international stage, a celebrated musician who has won many awards including a Grammy in 2005. But perhaps the most difficult issue for N'Dour's presidential bid is how to deal with a constitutional clause that sets a minimum educational qualification of high school certificate to be able to run as president.
