The Dutch Cup tie abandoned last week after a fan ran on to the pitch to attack AZ Alkmaar goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado will be replayed on January 19 behind closed doors, the Netherlands football federation (KNVB) said Wednesday. In other football news Wednesday, Liverpool's former Ajax striker Luis Suarez has been banned by the English Football Association (FA) for one match and fined 20,000 pounds ($31,300) for a gesture made towards Fulham fans in the 1-0 defeat at Craven Cottage earlier this month. Uruguay international Suarez had admitted the latest charge of improper conduct, and Liverpool have also been fined the same amount for failing to control their players in the same match -- a charge related to the dismissal of midfielder Jay Spearing. That ban is currently on hold while Liverpool decide whether to appeal, but Suarez's new suspension means he will miss Friday's home game against Newcastle United in the English Premier League. It is a further blow for Suarez, who has starred for Liverpool since his move from Dutch football last season.
