William Balfour, 27, has been held at Stateville Correctional Center near Joliet, Illinois, since he was arrested in early December in what defense lawyer Joshua Kutnick called "a difficult position." "[Balfour] has exhibited, to me, patience," Kutnick told CNN after Tuesday's hearing. "He understands that this case is not going to be over this week or next week or next month," Kutnick said. Balfour is the estranged husband of Hudson's sister, Julia Hudson, and stepfather of one of the victims, 7-year-old Julian King. While Judge Laws ordered Balfour to be moved to Chicago, Kutnick said he expects it might just be for 10 days. "He's doing OK" despite "being incarcerated under a difficult position," Kutnick said of Balfour.
