The new Cloud Player service adds a new "Save to Amazon Cloud Drive" button for saving MP3s to the cloud, as well as an option to upload music from a hard drive to a user's Cloud Drive. Amazon's Cloud Player will certainly face a stiff challenge when they launch their own streaming music services, especially given Google's control over Android and Apple's control over iPhone and iTunes. Amazon has just entered the streaming music business with the launch of Cloud Player, a music player that lets anyone upload their music to Amazon's servers and play them via the web or Android. The most comparable service to Cloud Drive is probably Grooveshark, which also lets you upload your music, though Amazon has several major advantages in its MP3 store, its longstanding payment system and its stronger brand recognition. Cloud Player comes in two flavors, an app for the web and an Android app counterpart.
