UEFA president Michel Platini claims that goal-line technology is not needed in soccer, stating it would lead to "PlayStation football." World governing body FIFA will test possible goal-line systems in the coming months after reversing its stance on the widely-debated issue, but the head of the sport in Europe is not in favor of the prospective changes. The subject of goal-line technology has long been hotly-debated within football, and the issue came to the fore once again at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa when England's Frank Lampard had a goal not given against Germany despite the ball crossing the line. When asked about the potential use of goal-line technology during a visit to the city of Glasgow, the Frenchman referred to the popular video-game console when he told the Scottish FA website: "Then we will have PlayStation football." The 55-year-old also said the high media presence at modern-day games does not help match officials, with television cameras able to instantly see when mistakes have been made by referees. Platini, one of the world's top footballers during the 1980s, believes more help should instead be offered to referees, highlighting the use of two extra match officials in this season's Champion's League as a better way forward.
