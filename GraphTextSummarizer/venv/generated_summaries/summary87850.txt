Lloret de Mar, like many others in Spain, still caters to mass tourism. Summer, of course, is high season for tourism in Spain. Spain's economic crisis is in its sixth straight year yet tourism, worth 11% of GDP, is holding its own, one of the few bright spots on a bleak horizon. " The report said 57% of the country's coastal towns offer less than five square meters of beach per tourist and remain highly seasonal, with 85% occupancy in August but barely 35% outside of the summer months. Summer could not have come soon enough for Lloret de Mar, a tourist resort north of Barcelona that is brimming with young travelers from Britain, Germany, France and Russia.
