The free service lets users synchronize documents, photos and applications between Apple devices over the Internet. When iCloud drops this fall, Apple will join Amazon.com and Google, two major players that have already begun rolling out storage services. Apple will also have websites for accessing e-mail, calendar and other features, as well as allowing Windows-PC users to sync photos to a folder. Capping a slew of software announcements on Monday, Apple unveiled iCloud. Apple's iCloud provides 5 gigabytes at no charge for e-mail, documents and backup file storage.
