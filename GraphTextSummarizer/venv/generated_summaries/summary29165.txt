Birmingham, Norwich Manchester and Liverpool airports were closed on Sunday evening, controllers announced. -- London's two major airports were closed Monday as a cloud of ash from a volcano in Iceland moved east into England, British air authorities said. All flights into and out of Heathrow and Gatwick airports have been canceled for a six-hour period beginning early Monday, airport officials said. The Monday cancellations were the latest in a round of weekend closures of airports across the United Kingdom and into continental Europe. And if the volcano continues to erupt at current levels and weather conditions prevail, air travel in Britain could be disrupted between Sunday and Tuesday.
