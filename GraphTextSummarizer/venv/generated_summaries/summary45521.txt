Test your knowledge of cold and flu » Traditionally, influenza surveillance has involved physicians' reports of patients with flu-like symptoms, lab reports of influenza from nasal and throat swabs, and death certificates. In the 2007-08 flu season, Google accurately estimated current flu levels one to two weeks faster than published CDC reports in each of the nine U.S. surveillance regions, Google said in a statement. But there has been concern that influenza surveillance systems in place are not fast enough, and the new tool could be useful for the basic purpose of quickly detecting outbreaks, said Dr. Randall Stafford, associate professor of medicine at Stanford University's Prevention Research Center, who was not involved in the project. Watch CNN.com's Elizabeth Landau explain how Google Flu Trends works » The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with Google on the project, helping validate and refine the model, and has provided  flu tracking data over a five-year period, said Dr. Joseph Bresee, chief of the epidemiology and prevention branch in the CDC's influenza division. Now, it's putting that information together in a tool that Google says could detect flu outbreaks faster than traditional systems currently in use.
