Burning it for electricity creates sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. A modern society requires that nonstorable electricity be available at all times to meet electricity demand, without a significant threat of blackouts. For example, promising offshore wind projects have been canceled because of local environmental concerns. Moving toward a greener economy will further raise these costs, as it will become harder and harder to find green power sources. This green power, however, raises electricity bills about 15 to 20 percent.
