-- A second person survived a massacre in which 72 migrants from Central and South America were killed last week in northern Mexico, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa and Mexican officials said. Mexican officials returned the remains of 16 migrants to Honduras on Wednesday. The bodies of the 72 victims are being returned to their homelands, which include Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Brazil. Correa did not provide details other than to say the second survivor came from Honduras. For the same reason, officials said Wednesday, they will not reveal the person's identity.
