McKinney said Cherrie's case was included as a public service insert in a direct mail advertising campaign, one of the first times that approach was taken. The day Cherrie went missing she was bringing home annual school pictures. "It's like a black hole opened up and she fell in,'' said Cherrie's mother, Janice McKinney. Cherrie was especially close with McKinney's parents. Hanging in McKinney's dining room is a picture Cherrie drew of a rainbow, trees, birds and clouds.
