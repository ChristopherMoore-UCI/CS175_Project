Singh also questioned the CAG's methods of estimating the loss to the government and profit to private companies. -- India's beleaguered prime minister, Manmohan Singh, on Monday sought to defend allocations of coal fields without competitive bidding as opposition lawmakers called for his resignation over an audit report that says the exchequer may have lost up to $33 billion by not auctioning off the mines. "A part of this financial gain could have accrued to the national exchequer ... ," the CAG wrote, noting delays in adopting bidding as the process to award coal mines could have caused the loss. Singh was coal minister between 2006 and 2009, when many of the sales assessed in the CAG report took place. India depends heavily on coal for power, and with its rising population and industrialization, it is struggling to meet demands.
