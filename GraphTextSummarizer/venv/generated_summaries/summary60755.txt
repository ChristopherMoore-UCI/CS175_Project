Clever move, says Maffatt, who thinks the Mana concert will help re-energize Democratic Latino voters who might have become disappointed with the president's failure to pass immigration reform. Add that to Latino disillusion with Obama for failing to pass comprehensive immigration reform, and Romney ought to be able to grab a chunk of Latino voters, says Carlo Maffatt, who works on Latino outreach for the Republican Party. Many Latino voters will tell you "It's immigration, stupid," in the vein of the famously coined phrase on the economy during Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign. It's the 200-pound anchor on the Republican message, say experts in Nevada politics. Obama's sixth appearance in Nevada this year hit the jackpot with Latino voters, who showed up in droves if not to see him, then the hottest rock stars south of the border.
