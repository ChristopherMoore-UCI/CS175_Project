Back in January, Microsoft postured against Apple's trademark, and has asked the USPTO to void Apple's trademark request on the grounds that the phrase "'app store'" is generic for retail store services featuring apps and unregistrable for ancillary services such as searching for and downloading apps from such stores." Microsoft was moving to protect its plans for Windows Phone 7 app store sales, and seemed ignorant of the irony in its request--as you may recall, MS's best-selling product is dubbed "Windows," which would definitely seem an arbitrary label and has a very precisely-defined generic use in computing environments that long predates MS's use of it. It will operate under similar constraints, controls and profit sharing with developers as Apple's version, in the hopes that it will be distinguished from other Android app markets by being "safer" and containing higher quality apps. The move to defend Apple's trademark indicates that Apple will act to aggressively protect its App Store ecosystem from challengers, which may include any plans Amazon has to expand its Google Android efforts. Apple filed a trademark protection over the phrase "App Store" after the release of the iPhone 3G, making what an independent observer may deem a sensible business move -- especially since the App Store is now earning Apple a slight profit, and its archive of apps for iPhone and iPad (and now the Mac too) is an incredibly potent advertising lever. (Fast Company) -- Amazon just revealed its own specially curated version of the Android Marketplace, but has chosen to label it the "Appstore." Apple, in turn, has now sued Android for trademark violation.
