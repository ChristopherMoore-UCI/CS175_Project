There's already things which I've written so far in "Sandman: Overture," which when you go back and read the original comic, things will change. Now, Gaiman is back with the new series "Sandman: Overture," and the second issue is set for release on Wednesday. The scene at the end of the first issue of "Sandman: Overture" where we see all the different Sandmans from across the universe, all the different versions of Morpheus meeting at once. CNN: What made you resurrect "Sandman?" Gaiman: It was a combination of things. The stuff in issue 3 is the nearest "Sandman" has ever come to a spaghetti Western.
