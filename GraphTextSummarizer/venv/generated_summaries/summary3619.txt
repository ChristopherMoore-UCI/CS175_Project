The news is not surprising, said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University, given the sad state of the American economy right now. When people are unsure of their financial future, they tend to postpone having children," Cherlin told CNN. The birth rate, which takes into account changes in the population, fell to 13.5 births for every 1,000 people last year, from 13.9 births in 2008, and 14.3 births in 2007, according to a new report from the National Center for Health Statistics. -- The number of babies born in the United States dropped 2.6 percent last year, according to a recent study, the latest in a long list of falling indicators. Some of the women postponing having children now will have them later, Cherlin said, while others never will.
