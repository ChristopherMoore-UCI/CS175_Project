An affidavit filed in the case, written by an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agent, said Durcho went to the home of an acquaintance January 12 and said he had "choked" Summer Rust -- identified in court papers as Summer Garas -- to death and was leaving Oklahoma. All five bodies were found January 12 in Rust's apartment in El Reno, Oklahoma, about 30 miles west of Oklahoma City. Authorities believe Durcho killed Rust because she threatened to call the police on him, prosecutors said in court documents released Tuesday. Joshua Durcho told a friend he choked Summer Rust but said her children were elsewhere, an affidavit says. Joshua Steven Durcho is charged with five counts of first degree murder in the January deaths of Summer Rust, 25; her son Teagin, 4; and daughters Evynn, 3, and Autumn and Kirsten, both 7.
