Sex harassment in the military is defined as a "form of sex discrimination that involves unwelcome advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature" where the victim may perceive that rejection would hurt career advancement or impact their future pay. -- There were more than 1,300 complaints of sexual harassment in the military last year, according to a Pentagon report released on Thursday. The findings come two weeks after a separate report released by the Pentagon showed the number of military sexual assaults had increased sharply year over year. Like sexual assault, the military believes harassment is often under-reported. Of the complaints, 59% were considered substantiated, meaning that follow-up action confirmed a finding of sexual harassment.
