It marked the second time in two years the court has declined to review the constitutionality of requirements for most large employers to offer a range of health insurance coverage for their workers. They involve whether some companies can refuse on religious grounds to provide insurance for certain birth control and other reproductive health services, without a co-pay. It sought an exemption, believing Americans should not be required to purchase health insurance -- and employers forced to provide it -- if there are legitimate moral and religious objections to some provisions. The administration said last month it would delay online implementation of the employer mandate -- affecting companies with 50 or more workers -- for another year, to give those busineses more time to prepare for the new regulations and requirements. In 2012, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the health law's funding mechanism, the so-called "individual mandate" that requires nearly all Americans to purchase health insurance or pay a financial penalty.
