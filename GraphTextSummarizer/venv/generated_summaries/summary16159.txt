Under the power-sharing agreement that Tsvangirai and Mugabe signed in 2008, Zimbabwe is supposed to have a new constitution before general elections are held. Earlier this month, representatives of President Robert Mugabe's Zanu PF party and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change party agreed that it would not be possible to have elections this year. He agreed to form a unity government with Tsvangirai and Deputy Prime Minister Arthur Mutambara after African regional leaders refused to recognize the legitimacy of a runoff. Tsvangirai has said elections must be held only after democratic reforms -- including having a new constitution in Zimbabwe -- are completed. The commission was only given $8.5 million by the country's treasury, Zimbabwe Electoral Commission Chairman Simpson Mutambanengwe said, according to the Sunday Mail.
