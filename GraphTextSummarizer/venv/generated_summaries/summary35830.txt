Opinion: Bad laws could hurt good drones The United States doesn't allow for commercial drone usage at all, though that's expected to change in 2015, when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) aims to put a plan in place to integrate drones in U.S. airspace. Nine U.S. states have already passed laws restricting drone use, both in the hands of private citizens and law enforcement agencies. While Calo argues that the ease with which the government can spy on us "should be a concern", he also says that drones could be useful in starting a long overdue conversation about privacy law. As a result, he argues, drones "could be a catalyst for better privacy law." Drone usage around the world is definitely picking up in the public sector, but when it comes to commercial activity, many countries have strict limitations.
