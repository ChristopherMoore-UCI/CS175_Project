Kerry and Obama have emphasized, though, that the fight against ISIS is not a purely military effort and the Obama administration has been seeking out commitments from Arab states to cut off ISIS's financial pipeline and track the stem and flow of foreign fighters -- now numbered at about 10,000 -- now fighting for ISIS and other extremist groups inside Iraq and Syria. As President Barack Obama and U.S. officials have emphasized: every Arab nation has a stake in thwarting ISIS -- and it appears those countries are catching on to that realization, sending a strong message that ISIS is just as much a threat to Sunnis in the region as to Shiite-dominant Iraq and the Western world. So as the U.S. has played up regional fears about the growth of ISIS, partner Arab nations are now calling on the U.S. to help address the swell of extremism in the region, Arab diplomats tell CNN. And with U.S. officials predicting a long-term campaign to "defeat, and ultimately degrade" ISIS, as Obama has put it, it is still unclear whether Arab nations are committed to a drawn-out effort. With up to 10,000 foreigners-- most of them coming from the Middle East and North Africa -- fighting with ISIS in Iraq and Syria, Arab rulers are starting to fear how the return of those extremist fighters could threaten their countries' stability.
