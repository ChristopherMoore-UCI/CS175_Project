A: Because of the Aliens Tort Claims Act; it's an old piece of legislation which lawyers have been using to bring cases against human rights violations in foreign jurisdictions so there was that opportunity to use that Act because the corporations involved were incorporated in the U.S. and the provisions of ATCA as its called enables aliens to bring American corporations to trial for violations in foreign jurisdictions. A: It very clearly sets a precedent that corporations have to be very careful when they operate in places like Africa; this sets a precedent that you can be brought to trial in America for violations in Africa... But this case was purely about human rights violation. Yes, I think we're part of that collective... but remember part of the settlement gives the bulk of the settlement to a trust and that trust is going to fund some particular initiatives which are going to be development initiatives decided by Ogoni people themselves. Some of the demands that we wanted in the early 90s in the Ogoni Bill of Rights such as using Ogoni resources for Ogoni development, I think some of the settlement speaks to some of that.
