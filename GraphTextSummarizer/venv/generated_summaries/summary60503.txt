The relationship between the two countries is based on a long history of partnership, which started in 1818 when the first U.S. consulate in sub-Saharan Africa was established in the country, Myles said. -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived in Cape Verde on Friday, the final stop on her seven-nation Africa tour in which she emphasized good governance and urged officials to implement reforms. "Cape Verde enjoys a stable democratic system, high transparency and low corruption," said Marianne M. Myles, the U.S. ambassador to Cape Verde. She arrived at Cape Verde from Liberia, where she applauded the work of pro-American president, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first woman elected head of state in Africa. Hours before her arrival in Kenya, Prime Minister Raila Odinga said that Africa did not need another lecture on good governance.
