Broadcasting a message to the world on social networks like Twitter is not always ideal for many people in chaotic situations. Zello allows smartphone users to send short voice messages from person to person or to a limited group of people. Alexey Gavrilov, Zello's chief technology officer, confirmed to CNN that the app was blocked for users of CANTV, Venezuela's state-owned Internet service. "We believe the Venezuelan government is blocking the images," a spokesman for Twitter told CNN. Virtual private networking essentially reroutes Internet connections through another country, allowing users to see an unblocked connection from a country like the United States.
