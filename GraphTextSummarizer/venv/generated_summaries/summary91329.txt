A Creighton spokeswoman said a second female was undergoing surgery and was in critical condition Wednesday afternoon. One, a 61-year-old man who sustained a chest wound after being shot in the armpit, underwent surgery and remained in critical condition in the intensive care unit Wednesday night, said hospital spokeswoman Maggie O'Brien. Maruca Kovac said she was unaware Hawkins had any guns, although she said he knew a lot about them, as did his stepfather. Maruca Kovac told CNN that Hawkins left home Wednesday about 11 a.m., and called the house about two hours later, sounding upset. Police have identified the gunman as Robert A. Hawkins, 19, of Nebraska.
