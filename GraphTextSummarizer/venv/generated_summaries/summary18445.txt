Ware could be playing again in less than a year Team rallies around him Earlier Wednesday, Ware recounted at a news conference his distress the moment his leg broke and immediate support from his teammates. In a two-hour surgery, Ware's broken tibia was straightened and a rod was inserted into it, according to a statement from Kenneth Klein, senior associate athletic director for media relations at the university. A photo posted on the Internet shows Ware's jubilant teammates holding up his jersey as they celebrated their win over Duke. Ware has taken a peek at the replay, but turned away from the screen, he told CNN on Wednesday. "Everybody was in real shock, and just looking around and seeing that, it was devastating," said Ware, who was using crutches Wednesday.
