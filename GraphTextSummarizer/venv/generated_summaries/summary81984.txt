Witnesses said Mai Mai militias targeted civilians in Kiwanja, including those they accused of supporting Nkunda's forces, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch reported Thursday that Nkunda's rebel forces and the opposing government-backed Mai Mai militias deliberately killed civilians in Kiwanja, in North Kivu, on Tuesday and Wednesday in violation of Nkunda's declared cease-fire. Fighting broke out at the end of August between the Congolese army and rebel forces led by Gen. Laurent Nkunda. The conflict in Congo is complicated by outside forces and a variety of armed groups fighting both the government and each other. "Eyewitnesses in Kiwanja told Human Rights Watch that at least 20 persons were killed and another 33 wounded during a battle for the town and in the cleanup operations by Nkunda's forces that followed," the group said in a written statement.
