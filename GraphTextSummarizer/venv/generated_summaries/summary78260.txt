-- One by one, the beleaguered townspeople of West, Texas, filed into local churches Sunday to begin the healing process, following last week's deadly blast at the nearby West Fertilizer Co. plant. In Hillsboro, Texas, about 15 miles from West, hotels and storefront windows displayed fliers celebrating the life of firefighter Jerry Chapman, who was killed fighting the blaze, an indication that the mourning and sense of grief go far beyond the close-knit community of West. As parishioners streamed out of St. Mary's Catholic Church after Sunday's service, Father Boniface Onjefu hugged and consoled his congregants, and gave reassuring smiles and high fives to the church's youngest members. The week from hell CNN's Todd Sperry reported from West, Texas; CNN's Martin Savidge, John Murgatroyd and Eric Fiegel contributed to this report from West, Texas; CNN's Matt Smith and Mark Morgenstein contributed from Atlanta. A strict curfew and heavy state police presence control the areas cordoned off near the site -- almost the entire north side of town.
