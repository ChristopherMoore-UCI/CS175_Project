"We oppose the practice of finger-pointing among countries or strong-arm measures to force other countries to appreciate currencies," he told reporters last month. Summers said the upcoming meetings offer opportunities to engage China and other countries that have large trade surpluses with the United States. Lawrence Summers, director of the National Economic Council, told the CNN program "State of the Union" that major international meetings coming up, including a G-20 economic gathering that will include China, provide the opportunity to resolve trade differences that could be exacerbated if the exchange-rate report were released on April 15 as scheduled. "Everyone knows China is manipulating the value of its currency to gain an unfair advantage in international trade," said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, adding he was disappointed in the treasury secretary's decision. President Obama's senior economic adviser said Sunday the government was delaying a report to Congress in order to provide more time to address China's alleged currency manipulation.
