Meanwhile, Samsung said on an earnings call last week that it expected to debut phones with flexible displays in 2012 and that flexible tablets would follow. While the transition from newspapers, magazines and books to digital devices has led to a few compromises -- those tactile forms are all reduced to a rectangular square of glass -- flexible screens can mimic the paper they replace. In fact, the next innovation in screen technologies may be an even bigger leap forward than touch displays. The advantages of flexible displays are obvious: They're more durable, and they pave the way for new input methods, such as bending the display to zoom. But what I'm most excited about is something far more audacious: flexible screens.
