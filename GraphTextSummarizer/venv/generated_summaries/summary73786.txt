"Now I'm exposed to other infections." To combat the poachers, officials at Redwood National and State Parks in northern California have closed an eight-mile drive through the forests at night. While state officials say the damage is far from any Amazonian deforestation, they do rank the desecration alongside elephant tusk poaching. Under the cloak of darkness, bandits are poaching the burl from the old-growth redwoods in Redwood National and State Parks in California, and that lumpy feature from the tree base is then sold for thousands of dollars to make furniture, bowls and even souvenirs, officials say. -- Tree poaching conjures up the lawless Amazon jungle, but America's magnificent redwood forests now face a piecemeal but steady assault by poachers too, California officials say. The California Department of Parks and Recreation said smaller pieces of poached burl can sell for hundreds of dollars, and the larger chunks can fetch thousands.
