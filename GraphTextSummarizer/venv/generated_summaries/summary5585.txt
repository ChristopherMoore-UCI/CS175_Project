In the fall of 2004 I moved to Roswell, New Mexico, to attend Eastern New Mexico University. I am the owner of Tim's Place -- the world's friendliest restaurant, located in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I graduated in the summer of 2008 with certificates in food service, office skills and restaurant hosting. My Special Olympic sports are basketball, poly hockey, volleyball, golf and track and field. I shop for my own groceries, do my own laundry and pay all of my own bills.
