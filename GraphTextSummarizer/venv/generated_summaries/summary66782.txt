Debunking the termite The self-organization theory comes about a year after biology professor Norbert Juergens argued in a paper published in Science that fairy circles were the work of a species of sand termite, psammotermes allocerus. Spread across 1,100 miles of a narrow strip sit a smattering of barren polka dots, otherwise known as fairy circles. "The point is, fairy circles are still a mystery. "There is a high correlation between fairy circles and these termites, and therefore Juergens claimed that they're the cause. But it's just a correlation, and one of the most fundamental mistakes a scientist can make is to confuse correlation with causation," says Walter Tschinkel, a biology professor at Florida State University who specializes in both social insect behavior and fairy circles.
