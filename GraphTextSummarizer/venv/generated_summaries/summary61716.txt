"In the last year U.S. special forces destroyed almost 70% of the Taliban and other insurgents in Wardak province without causing any civilian casualties," said an Afghan political analyst in Wardak who asked not to be identified, fearing retribution. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai in February accused U.S. forces of "torture" and "murder" in the restive Wardak province. A deal struck between United States and Afghanistan in April 2012 gives Kabul the right to veto U.S. operations in the country. U.S. forces have carried out months of special operations to vanquish Taliban fighters in the province. In August 2011, the Taliban shot down a Chinook helicopter killing 38 on board, including 22 Navy SEALs and other members of U.S. special operations forces.
