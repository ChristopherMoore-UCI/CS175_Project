-- Philippine seismologists issued an alert on Mount Bulusan Sunday after the Luzon Island volcano erupted twice during a 24-hour period, according to a bulletin released by the nation's volcano-monitoring agency. However, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (PHILVOCS) said the eruptions posed little threat to the villages surrounding the Luzon Island volcano. In declaring an "Alert Level 1," the agency warned nearby residents not to enter the 4-kilometer "permanent danger zone" because of possible steam and ash explosions. Philippine volcanologists, according to the agency, aren't expecting Mount Bulusan to erupt again soon. Area residents were also warned of the possibility of flooding if heavy rains push sediment-filled streams out of their banks.
