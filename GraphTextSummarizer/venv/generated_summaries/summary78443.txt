The U.S. Senate failed Thursday to approve nearly $5 billion for a settlement between the Agriculture Department and minority farmers reached more than a decade ago, prompting finger pointing by members of both parties and outrage among many black farmers. "If Republicans cannot put aside their obstructionist tactics so that we can settle a non-controversial, non-partisan issue like this," Reid said, "on what will they agree to work with Democrats?" Boyd declined to lay blame at the feet of Republicans alone. "It seems like for the trains leaving the station in the Senate, they manage not to have the black farmers on them," Boyd said, calling on President Barack Obama to help break the logjam. Under a federal judge's terms dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. "Everyone that steps to the microphone says they support the black farmers," said Boyd.
