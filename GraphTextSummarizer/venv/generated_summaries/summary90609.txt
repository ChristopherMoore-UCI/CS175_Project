Together, they'll help voice assistants break out of single devices to be available anywhere in your house, car or workplace. "Building a high-quality voice assistant with broad capabilities is not trivial and typically requires the expertise and resources of big companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, with many Ph.D.s and machines and technologies," said Cheyer. Apple's Siri has an optional always-listening mode called "Hey Siri" but it only works when the device is plugged in. "Over the past decades, there has been a series of 'battles' to gain market share at the point where users interface with computers," said Adam Cheyer, the co-founder of Siri. Most small smart-device manufacturers wouldn't be able to make their own interface, but down the line they might be able to license existing assistants.
