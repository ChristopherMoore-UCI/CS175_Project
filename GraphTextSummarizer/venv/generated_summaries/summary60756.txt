"The more attacks on oil pipelines, the less of a chance Yemen has to recover from its economic woes," said AbdulSalam Mohammed, President of the Sanaa based Abaad Research Center. "Lost oil production due to pipeline attacks cost the government more than $1 billion in 2012, and cost the government even more in 2013," an Oil Ministry official told CNN on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media. Yemen crude oil exports are the mainstay of the impoverished country's economy, and halts in production pose a serious threat to stability. Security experts have warned that the government's inability to preserve state infrastructures may lead to a vote of no confidence and potentially to political instability. The attack halted oil production, and crews worked to fix the line, which links the Masila oilfield to port the port town of Shihr.
