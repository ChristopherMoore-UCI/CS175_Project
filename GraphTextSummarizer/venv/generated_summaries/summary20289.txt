Kassig, 26, grew up in that city, the only son of Paula and Ed Kassig. " Margaret Brabant, a professor who served as Kassig's academic counselor during his time at Butler, said all those who knew him are in mourning, but that even in death, her former student can serve others. And good will prevail as the one God of many names will prevail," Paula Kassig said at a church in Indianapolis. "I wanted more of a challenge, a sense of purpose." After receiving training in emergency medical skills, Kassig returned to the Middle East -- this time as an aid worker. The parents of Peter Kassig spoke to reporters Monday, asking for prayers and privacy.
