Also Saturday, response crews discovered tar balls on a beach on Dauphin Island, Alabama, and sent them to a lab to determine if they're from the Gulf Coast oil slick. The tar balls, which a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman described as "pieces of emulsified oil" shaped like pancakes, ranged in size from dimes to golf balls. The crystals also blocked the top of the dome, which would prevent oil from being funneled up to a drill ship. " If the hydrate problem is resolved, BP, which owns the well, hopes to connect the dome to a drill ship over the weekend and to begin sucking oil from the containment dome up to the ship by the beginning of next week, Suttles said Friday. Oil washed ashore Thursday on Louisiana's barrier islands and drifted west past the mouth of the Mississippi River.
