City under Manuel Pellegrini won the English League Cup at Wembley last weekend and are battling for the Premier League title, while Wigan have dropped to the second flight after being relegated following their own cup triumph. Hull accounted for Sunderland, who were attempting to reach Wembley for the second time this season after losing to Manchester City in last week's League Cup final. David Meyler, who was at the center of the head-butting incident with Newcastle manager Alan Pardew last weekend in the EPL, scored Hull's second in the 3-0 win. With fortunes revived under Uwe Rosler, who was a favorite son at Manchester City as a player, Wigan took the game to their illustrious opponents and led 2-0 through a first half penalty from Jordi Gomez and an early strike after the break from James Perch. "Obviously a lot of things have been written (about his return to City) and I kept my emotions under control and focused on the job in hand, but the players made it easy for me the way they performed," he told BBC Radio Five Live.
