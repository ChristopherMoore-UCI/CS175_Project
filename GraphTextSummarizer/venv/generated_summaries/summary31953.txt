The letter asked that Rahmon and other government representatives "intervene in this complex situation as we believe that a purposeful process of destabilization is taking place in the country by third forces." That tense peace was first interrupted two weeks ago, when government soldiers manning a checkpoint in the town of Bidurth -- north of Khorog -- shot at a civilian car, killing two occupants and wounding two others, the letter said. The incident occurred in the southeastern province of Pamir at 4 a.m., when government soldiers entered the house of Imumnazar Imumnazarov and killed him and two other men, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution. Islamic Renaissance Party national leader Muhiddin Kabiri said in a statement that even if even if the dead man was not Mamadrizoev, he should have been treated humanely. A peace agreement that had halted violence in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan was shattered Wednesday when a rebel commander who had given up his weapons was killed by government forces, neighbors and relatives said.
