The move follows a visit by Spanish Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Moratinos, who met with Cuban President Raul Castro and Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega on Wednesday. Wednesday's announcement also brought an end to a 134-day hunger strike by Cuban opposition activist Guillermo Farinas. Farinas stopped eating solid foods in February following the death of jailed hunger striker and political dissident Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who was protesting what he described as poor conditions in detention. Zapata's death sparked international condemnation from Europe and Washington and drew a rare statement of regret from President Castro. The 52 political prisoners Cuba plans to release are the remainder of a larger group of 75 dissidents who were jailed during a government crackdown on political opposition in March 2003.
