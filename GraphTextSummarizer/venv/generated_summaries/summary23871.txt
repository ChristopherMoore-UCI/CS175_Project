Dozens of people, including Murdoch protÃ©gÃ© Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, a former adviser to prime Minister David Cameron, already have been arrested and several have been charged with phone hacking and related crimes. Three police investigations were created to look into allegations of phone hacking, bribery of public officials and computer hacking. The hacking scandal prompted Cameron to set up an independent, judge-led inquiry -- named for Lord Justice Leveson, its chairman -- to make recommendations on journalistic ethics and examine the relationship of the press with the public, police and politicians. Rupert Murdoch: The last press baron Brooks and Coulson are both former News of the World editors. Police say Wednesday's arrests are part of a separate conspiracy to hack phones, primarily from 2005 to 2006, at the News of the World.
