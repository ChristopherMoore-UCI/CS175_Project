There is now the slow, painstaking work of removing the helicopter from the pub, piece by piece. And in the streets around the pub the police continue to go door to door asking finding out what people may have seen. One man who was there on Friday night came to lay flowers, his head fully bandaged, and with cuts on his face from injuries he received in the crash. She had decided not to go last Friday night. Moira, who turned up to lay flowers at the scene of the crash, told me she would regularly go there to hang out and hear music.
