Spanish club Malaga have brought in former Real Madrid, Sevilla and Arsenal striker Julio Baptista from Italian club Roma, with the Brazilian costing a reported $2.5 million. Genoa have signed Slovakia midfielder Juraj Kucka following the departure of Francesco Modesto and Raffaelle Palladino to Parma, who have also signed Spanish midfielder Tony Calvo on loan. Manchester United's 19-year-old Italian striker Federico Macheda has returned home on loan with Sampdoria, who needed a replacement after allowing Antonio Cassano to join Serie A leaders AC Milan. In Saturday's other transfer news, former City boss Mark Hughes boosted his Fulham squad with the signing of midfielder Steve Sidwell from Aston Villa on an initial six-month contract. He had been linked with Italian club Juventus and Manchester United, and his arrival could mean that Togo international Emmanuel Adebayor and Paraguay's Roque Santa Cruz leave City this month.
