-- After battling government forces, a Maoist guerrilla group in Peru has released 36 hostages it captured earlier this week, state media reported Saturday. Peru's Defense Ministry said that 1,500 government troops had encircled members of the Shining Path in southern Peru, the state-run news agency Andina reported. Masked attackers had kidnapped dozens of workers in the town of Kepashiato early Monday morning, Andina reported earlier. At its peak, the Shining Path spread terror in the country through a bombing campaign that targeted buildings and key infrastructure, such as electricity towers. After Peruvian authorities captured a longtime leader of the group in February, President Ollanta Humala said the group was "no longer a threat to the country."
