Dogs Trust said local authorities picked up 107,228 stray and abandoned dogs from British streets in the past year. Another possible reason for the jump: England and Wales last year changed the law to make local councils, not police, responsible for taking in stray dogs, Dogs Trust said. "You've got a lot of latchkey dogs that are just left to wander the streets," said Natalie Dexter, who works at the education center at Dogs Trust. Only five are reunited with their owners -- a number that could increase if more dogs were microchipped, Dogs Trust said. "The latest stray dog survey is very disappointing," said Clarissa Baldwin, chief executive of Dogs Trust.
