The aircraft went down around 4:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET) Friday at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California. The previous year, the Marines had at least three deadly incidents involving helicopter crashes in noncombat areas -- one off of Hawaii, another in the northern part of Camp Pendleton and the third on that same Southern California base. While missions in combat zones are obviously more dangerous, there are many examples of fatal U.S. military aircraft crashes during training missions as well. Six of those killed during what was called a routine training operation were based at California's Camp Pendleton, while the other was out of Yuma, Arizona, the Marine Corps said. The latter two crashes both involved members of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, like the one of Friday.
