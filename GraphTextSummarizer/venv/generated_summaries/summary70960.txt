The YouTube video shows the same collision that Japanese lawmakers watched on video last week, said legislator Hiroshi Kawauchi, of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan. Japan initially accused the captain of obstructing Japanese public officers while they performed duties. In September, Japan detained the crew of a Chinese fishing boat off disputed islands in the East China Sea. The man also says on the video, in Japanese: "We've ordered them to stop, in Chinese language, but they didn't stop. The Chinese government dismissed the video after Japanese lawmakers saw it, saying it had been edited and that it did not change the ownership of the islands.
