Not just New York City, but a liberal enclave in Brooklyn called Park Slope, where, depending on the time of day at the local playground, same-sex parents just might outnumber straight ones. And that's a salient argument against those who think that having gay parents is patently unhealthy for children. Most polls show that about 50 percent of the country is still opposed to legalized marriage for gay couples, and the lack of marital rights has a huge impact on financial and legal status once kids are brought into the mix. The U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study (NLLFS), which followed the children of 154 lesbian mothers over 25 years, reported that our teens had fewer behavioral problems and better school performance than their peers with straight parents. " "Polling clearly shows that Americans are more comfortable than ever with gay people becoming parents," says Jennifer Chrisler, executive director of the Family Equality Council, who has two kids with her wife, Cheryl Jacques.
