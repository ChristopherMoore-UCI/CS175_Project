The federal lawsuit was dismissed last week after one client dropped out after confusion over the date of the alleged incident and the second plaintiff fired attorney Okorie Okorocha and hired high-profile lawyer Gloria Allred. Two days before he was fired by John Doe #2, Okorocha told CNN that he believed Allred was trying to steal his client. Okorocha filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior court Monday contending that Allred illegally and unethically solicited the second client -- identified as John Doe #2. She told CNN Monday that she would file a defamation suit against Okorocha if he sued her. "Because both John Doe #1 and John Doe #2 contacted us," she said. An exhibit attached to his complaint is a screenshot of a cell phone text message exchange he said was with John Doe #2 two days before the client fired him and hired Allred.
