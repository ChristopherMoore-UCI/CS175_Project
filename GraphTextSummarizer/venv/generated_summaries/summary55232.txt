The announcement comes as the first week of U.N. debates wrapped up Saturday where delegates continued to outline their visions for peace and global security. "Countries in the Horn of Africa that are facing one of the worst droughts in more than half a century, causing mounting malnutrition, food insecurity, and displacement of people," the D.C.-based bank said in a statement on Saturday. -- The World Bank said that it is increasing funding to the war-wracked and drought-stricken Horn of Africa to $1.88 billion from more than $500 million, a generous gesture that coincides with a U.N. mini-summit on the devastated region. "In Somalia, famine has spread through large areas of the south." Ban said three-quarters of a million people are "at imminent risk of starvation" as a result of war, rising food costs and droughts that have continually plagued the region. " "Somalia will never be free of the threat of famine until it has peace and stability," said the U.N. chief.
