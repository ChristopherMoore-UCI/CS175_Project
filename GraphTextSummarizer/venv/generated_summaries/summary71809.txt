Musharraf resigned in 2008 as Pakistan's ruling coalition began taking steps to impeach him, and Asif Zardari, the widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, succeeded him. -- Former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf has returned to the political stage in Pakistan, which he describes as a "demoralized" nation that needs an injection of vigor and leadership. Once one of the United States' strongest allies in the fight against terror, Musharraf on Friday launched a new political party in Pakistan as an alternative to an administration he says is now beset with serious problems. "This is about leading, about support of the people and that's my strength," Musharraf said in a Connect the World interview with CNN's Becky Anderson. One of the issues in Pakistan is the war in neighboring Afghanistan and the fight against militants in northwestern Pakistan who have been involved in the Afghan insurgency.
