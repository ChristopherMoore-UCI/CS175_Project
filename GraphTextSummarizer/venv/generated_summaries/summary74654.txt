There is the image of President Obama as the naÃ¯ve professor, an out-of-touch egghead compromising national security by bringing in card-carrying members of the ACLU to interrogate terrorists. Here's what she said last night: "Energy independence is something that President Obama certainly has avoided. ... He has essentially handed over our interrogation of terrorists to the ACLU. The subject of energy independence also inspired Bachmann to reach for a bridge too far. Here, Bachmann reflexively reaches for the rhetoric of cold war weakness -- "unilateral disarmament" -- saying that he has "certainly avoided" any effort at "energy independence."
