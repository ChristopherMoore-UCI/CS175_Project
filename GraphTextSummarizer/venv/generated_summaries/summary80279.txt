Only 3% of the 87th Congress (1961-1962), according to Pew, was non-Christian. Cooperman said the under representation of unaffiliated Americans might be a political decision by members of Congress. "You could say that the religious diversity in Congress is concentrated on the Democratic side," said Alan Cooperman, director of religious research at Pew. One area where nationwide trends have not been reflected in Congress is with the religiously unaffiliated, the most underrepresented in the country. Fifty-seven percent of the 114th Congress is Protestant, while 49% of the country identifies as such today.
