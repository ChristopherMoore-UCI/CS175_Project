-- Commuters on the New York-New Jersey Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) rail system will have added security screening Wednesday as part of a month-long pilot program, according to a news release from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Riders of the New York-New Jersey PATH trains will see a new security system in place on Wednesday. The Passive Millimeter Wave "detects threats by analyzing the energy generated by the human body," according to TSA spokesperson Lara Uselding. The camera-like device displays an image for operators, and "an indicator produces a strength bar from green to red that indicates the presence/absence of anomalies that could have security implications, including the possible presence of explosives," according to the TSA Web site. The TSA and the Port Authority emphasize that the device is non-invasive and completely safe.
