The would-be robber apparently was looking to step up his weaponry -- he smashed a glass display case at Discount Gun Sales and pulled a handgun from the display, the Washington County sheriff's department said in a news release. Washington County deputies responded to the call and found the suspect on the floor when they arrived. Authorities in Oregon say a man who tried to rob a gun store outside of Portland was just so under-armed when he tried to pull off a heist Thursday afternoon. He was charged with first degree robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm, according to the news release. Derrick Mosley, 22, was being held at the Washington County, Oregon, jail, with bond set at $250,000, the sheriff's department said.
