Based on the 2002 nonfiction book "Queen Bees and Wannabes" by Rosalind Wiseman, actress and screenwriter  Fey was able to find the funny in what is often the victimization of young women in school. So, while you wait, and in honor of "Mean Girls," grab your Burn Book or whatever you use to trash people (around here we call it "the  comments section"), sit back and maybe revisit the movie. And for those who have witnessed the train wreck that has become the life and career of "Mean Girls" star Lindsay Lohan, it also serves as a bittersweet time capsule of the days when she was billed as one of the most promising young actresses of her generation. "I revisited high school behaviors of my own â€” futile, poisonous, bitter behaviors that served no purpose," Fey said. Whether it's because Tina Fey's script so authentically captures the high school experience or because of the multiple quote-worthy lines (admit it, you are glad "fetch" happened), the film about a group of teen girls who rule the school and the girl they sort of take under their wing is as popular now as it ever was.
