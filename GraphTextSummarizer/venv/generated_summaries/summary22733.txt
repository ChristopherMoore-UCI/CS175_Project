Haleigh's case received wide publicity as television crews made the short trip from Caylee's service in Orlando to Haleigh's home in Satsuma, east of Gainesville in northern Florida. Authorities have collected DNA samples from Haleigh's father, her mother and other people connected to the case, including the father's 17-year-old girlfriend, Misty Croslin, Schauland added. -- Relatives of missing 5-year-old Haleigh Cummings have given DNA samples, and the mobile home where she lived is no longer off-limits as a crime scene, authorities in Florida said Friday. Haleigh was reported missing on the same day a memorial service was held for Caylee Anthony, a Florida girl who had been missing for months before her remains were found in December. Family members of Ronald Cummings and Haleigh's mother, Crystal Sheffield, set up camp under tents near the police command post, going on camera to beg for the child's safe return.
