"It's not always possible to live off exclusively American made goods because some products simply are not manufactured here and other items are not native to our country," said Sarah Mazzone, founder of made in usa challenge, which shares resources and information for buying American-made products. The people he met on his journey underscored the fact that even products made in the United States are made of materials sourced from other countries. But the lessons learned are as relevant as ever, especially as the country looks for ways to boost employment and bring American manufacturing into the 21st century, he said. Checking product labels for country of origin is now a part of his shopping routine, he said. Miller had been vaguely aware that American manufacturing jobs were going away, but now he knew what that could mean for an entire community.
