The Belgian siblings have forged an impressive foothold in the international cinema scene over the past 15 years or so, with a brand of rigorous, concerted neo-realist tales like "Rosetta," "The Child" and "The Son" ("Le fils") that focus on marginalized, working class characters trapped by poverty and circumstance, but occasionally within spitting distance of something that can only be described as grace.
