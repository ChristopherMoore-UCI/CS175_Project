"There's nothing more noble than public service," President Obama says. -- Following this week's tough talks on the global financial crisis, President Obama on Friday shifted his tone to reflect upon his regrets, his frustrations and his hopes for the younger generation. "But -- having said all that, I truly believe that there's nothing more noble than public service," he said, adding that service doesn't mean one has to run for president. Obama pointed to Doctors Without Borders, the United Nations and community work as examples of other ways to serve. "That's a good question," Obama said at a packed town hall meeting in Strasbourg, France.
