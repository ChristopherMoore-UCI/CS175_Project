-- Al Qaeda militants seized control of a military base and two checkpoints during raids in southern Yemen on Monday in which at least 30 people died, security officials and residents said. Last week, Yemen poured thousands of troops into the country's south to battle al Qaeda fighters and tighten security, officials said. Hours of firefights erupted after the militants hit an army barracks in the Loder district of Abyan province in an assault that included heavy artillery, according to the officials. Yemeni warplanes bombarded al Qaeda hideouts all week in a series of U.S.-supported airstrikes in Abyan and Lahj provinces. Numerous other Yemeni soldiers were taken hostage, officials said.
