Infographic on the global state of aviation "This year won't be a show for aircraft debuts or actual hardware that we'll be seeing for the first time," Murdo Morrison, editor of Flight International magazine, told CNN. With the UK and other major European markets wallowing in recession or serious debt problems, industry experts warn the show -- now in its 64th year -- could lack some of the sparkle of its predecessors. Reports suggest Virgin boss Richard Branson will use the event to reveal design changes to the craft, which could be carrying its first passengers into orbit next year. Unconfirmed reports suggest the 787 may make a fly-past, ending Boeing's long absence from aerial display at Farnborough. U.S. defense giant Northrup Grumman is among several big names missing from this year's show.
