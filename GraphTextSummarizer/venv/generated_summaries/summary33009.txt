The traditional structure and dynamics of black churches, mostly led by black men, convey submissive attitudes to women, Cooper says, encouraging them to be patient -- instead of getting up and going after what they want. "The reason why black women who go to black churches are not married is because they are looking for certain values in a man," Weems says. " All in the numbers One of biggest reasons black women are single, Cooper says, is because of a lack of black men in the church. "But I do agree that some black churches teach women that they must only date a man that goes to church regularly." Watkins, who is African-American and whose father is a Southern Baptist minister, described his interactions with southern women who are devout churchgoers. Yet, according to relationship advice columnist Deborrah Cooper, it is this devout style of belief and attachment to the black church that is keeping black women like Davis -- single and lonely.
