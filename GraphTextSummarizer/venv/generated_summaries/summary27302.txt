Croatia have been hit by injuries to Mario Ancic and big-serving Ivo Karlovic, with Ivan Ljubicic coming out of Davis Cup retirement especially for this tie. They will need to be with Djokovic, newly installed as world number two, leading a Serbian team boasting Viktor Troicki, Janko Tipsarevic and doubles world number one Nenad Zimonjic. "Of course, it is hard to predict what will happen there, because being a host in Davis Cup matches is an advantage. The tie in Split gives Croatia home advantage, but in terms of world rankings Serbia, headed by Novak Djokovic, will start as narrow favorites to reach the last four. In other ties, defending champions Spain will be without world number one and Wimbledon champion Rafael Nadal as they take on France at Clermont- Ferrand.
