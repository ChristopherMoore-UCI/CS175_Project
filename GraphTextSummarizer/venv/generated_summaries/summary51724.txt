CHANG: Just like interstate highways transformed the United States, faster trains in China will bring infrastructure, investment and passengers to destinations deep in the countryside. Critics counter China is overbuilding and that tickets on fast trains are too expensive for average citizens. China is spinning a web of high-speed railways with faster connections than ever before. This quake left thousands of residents without food, without water, without electricity and other just basic services. Now, trains might sound kind of old school; you might think stagecoaches or something like that.
