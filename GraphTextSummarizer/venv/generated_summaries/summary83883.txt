Zuckerberg, the sister of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, will do a two-week stint in "Rock of Ages," the Tony Award-nominated musical that celebrates the glam-metal rock of the 1980s. I'm joining the cast of Rock of Ages on Broadway from March 14-28!!! As a New Yorker, a theater-lover, and a child of the 80s, I couldn't be more thrilled for the opportunity to perform in 'Rock of Ages' on Broadway. "Every performance, for the last five years, has delivered an incredible onstage and audience experience, earning the show its title as Broadway's Best Party. " Zuckerberg will play city planner Regina, whose numbers include Twisted Sister's "We're Not Gonna Take It" and Jefferson Starship's "We Built This City."
