Team Sky officials were delighted to add Wiggins to a roster that already features Geraint Thomas, Ian Stannard, Russell Downing, Peter Kennaugh, Chris Froome and Steve Cummings. The 29-year-old, who has won the last two Olympic individual pursuit titles and finished fourth at last year's Tour De France, has signed a four-year contract with Team Sky. "At Team Sky he can continue to develop, surrounded by some of the coaches and performance experts who have worked with him for years as part of the British Cycling set-up. He had been with Garmin for only one season, and needed to win a release from his contract for 2010 to join up with Sky, backed by broadcasting giant BSkyB. "Although we understand his strong desire to be a part of the UK's first-ever Pro Tour team, we would have loved to continue with him through 2010. "Brad will be at home in Team Sky.
