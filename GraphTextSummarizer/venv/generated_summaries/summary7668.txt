Stubb told CNN Europe was stuck in a "vicious cycle" between politicians, the media and the markets, which was hindering the speed of economic recovery. A victory for pro-European parties in the Dutch elections this month was also a sign that electorates in Northern European countries have not lost faith in the 17-nation currency bloc. Of such an idea, he said: "We do not have the time, nor can we introduce an element of further uncertainty." Such a stance runs contrary to that of European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, who told CNN Europe needed to be more unified. Stubb told CNN a combination of political action and monetary intervention in the eurozone over the last month had put Europe on the road to economic recovery. -- Europe's political and economic attempts to stem the eurozone debt crisis may finally be getting results, Finland's European minister Alexander Stubb has told CNN.
