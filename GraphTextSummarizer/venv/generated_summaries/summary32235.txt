De Lena is president of the local archeological society in the picturesque hamlet of Termoli, on Italy's Adriatic coast. " Since making the discovery, De Lena has made it his life's work to promote it, traveling across Italy with a meter stick in his suitcase to size up rivals. For the past four years he's also been self-appointed guardian of Termoli's claim of being home to Italy's narrowest alleyway. "We'll keep on saying that it's Italy's narrowest alley, or at least among its narrowest. " Termoli, a jumble of white cobbled streets and bright-colored houses covered in bougainvillea, is already a draw for visitors to Italy's Molise region.
