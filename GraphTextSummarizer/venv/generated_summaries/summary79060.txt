"The contrived food vs. fuel debate has reared its ugly head once again," the Renewable Fuels Association, which lobbies Congress on the behalf of the industry, said on its Web site, adding that "numerous statistical analyses have demonstrated that the price of oil -- not corn prices or ethanol production -- has the greatest impact on consumer food prices because it is integral to virtually every phase of food production, from processing to packaging to transportation."
