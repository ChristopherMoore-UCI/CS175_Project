If "Deathly Hallows" follows the Thanksgiving trajectory of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" -- the last Potter film to open in November -- the PG-13 movie should finish the weekend with about $50 million. In a surprisingly close race, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1" held on to its box-office crown Friday by grossing $20.8 million, according to early estimates. That's a 66 percent drop from the fantasy film's opening last Friday, which was inflated due to an enormous turnout at Thursday midnight screenings. "Tangled" is on pace to finish second this weekend with about $47 million, but again, it could very well upset Potter for first place.
