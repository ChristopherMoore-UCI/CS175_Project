A hearing is set for Monday in a case involving actress Lindsay Lohan after an arrest warrant was issued for her Friday, officials said. "Since her case was resolved, Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court," Holley said in a statement. Lohan "has the right to appear" at the hearing, said Alan Parachini, Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman. Mike Foxen said on Friday authorities were hoping Lohan would turn herself in. It apparently stems from Lohan's 2007 convictions for drunken driving, police said Friday.
