California's Los Altos Crier reported that the actor, a San Francisco Bay Area native, recently stopped by State Street in downtown Los Altos, where he bought four boxes of Girl Scout cookies and donated an additional $20 to the troop. The actor adored his "The Green Mile" co-star Michael Clarke Duncan. After Duncan died in 2012 following a heart attack, Hanks had those attending his memorial service in stitches with one of his favorite stories about Duncan. Now he can buy more Girl Scout cookies! The superstar won even more hearts when he surprised fan Sarah Moretti backstage after his performance on Broadway in "Lucky Guy."
