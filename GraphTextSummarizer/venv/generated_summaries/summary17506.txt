-- Lindsey Vonn suffered a mild strain to her right knee, a partial tear to her right ACL, and minor facial abrasions as a result of a recent fall, her spokesman said Wednesday. She had planned to return at the World Cup event in Beaver Creek, Colorado on November 29. She followed up her Vancouver victory with a stellar World Cup season in 2011-2012, winning 12 races and the overall title with a new record points haul. "She needs to rest for a few days and then will pursue aggressive physical therapy and will determine the next time she is able to compete after seeing how she responds to the treatment," said Lewis Kay, her spokesman. The U.S. ski queen crashed Tuesday during a training run at Copper Mountain in Colorado.
