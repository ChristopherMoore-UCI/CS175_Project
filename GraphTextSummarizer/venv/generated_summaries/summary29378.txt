Husien Shehada, at left with his brother, Samer, was shot dead by Miami Beach police on June 14. A study by the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice found that officers involved in fatal shootings can be affected for months afterward. Each of the nation's 20,000 police departments sets its own policy for police involved in shootings and fatalities. When he returned to street patrol, he was one of several officers who responded to a 911 call reporting that that a taxi driver had been pistol-whipped and his cab stolen. Four nights later, again in Miami Beach, Lawrence McCoy allegedly pistol-whipped a cab driver and led police on a chase.
