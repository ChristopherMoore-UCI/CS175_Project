Chestnut's win at Nathan's 98th annual International Hot Dog Eating Contest secured his title for the eighth consecutive year, but he was still a handful of wieners away from his world record 69 hot dogs in 10 minutes that he set last year. On a rainy Independence Day at Brooklyn's Coney Island, the San Jose, California, resident once again clinched the title at Nathan's hot dog eating contest before hundreds of umbrella-toting spectators at the annual celebration of gluttony. Chestnut sloppily devoured 61 hot dogs in 10 minutes -- edging his biggest competitor, Matthew Stonie, who placed second after swallowing 56 dogs. The hot dog eating contest was divided into men's and women's competitions in 2011. -- Joey "Jaws" Chestnut, reigning king of the world's most famous hot dog eating contest, may have had an extra boost of confidence Friday.
