Mayor anticipates protests in region where grand jury decides "In the days immediately following Michael Brown's death, peaceful protests were marred by senseless acts of violence and destruction," the governor said. "We understand that our son is gone, but the movement will be that -- we're trying to make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone else," Michael Brown Sr. told CNN. Though the grand jury has until January to issue its ruling on Wilson, the prosecutor's office has said a decision could come as early as mid-November. As Missouri governor, Jay Nixon believes the most important part of his job is keeping the people of his state safe. Brown's parents address U.N. Authorities, who drove armored vehicles and wore military gear, were roundly criticized by members of the media, other law enforcement officials and demonstrators for escalating the violence, rather than tempering it.
