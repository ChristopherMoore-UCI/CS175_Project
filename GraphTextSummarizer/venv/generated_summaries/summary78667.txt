(Mashable)  -- Popular restaurant recommendation app Urbanspoon has just launched a brand new version of its app, complete with a full redesign and the ability to rate and upload photos of your dishes. It has de-emphasized the "shake to find a random restaurant" home screen in favor of a menu system that lets you browse restaurants, see what your friends are recommending and reserve a table (a beta feature available in Seattle, Los Angeles and New York City). Urbanspoon has the vast resources of InterActive Corp at its disposal, while Foodspotting has raised just $750,000. The upgraded app puts it in direct competition with several heavyweights though, including Yelp and OpenTable. Moreover, the photos feature pushes Urbanspoon onto Foodspotting's turf.
