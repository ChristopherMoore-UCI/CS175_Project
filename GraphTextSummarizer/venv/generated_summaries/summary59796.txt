Their sons -- Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner  -- have become symbols of a raging national conversation about police brutality and racial injustice. President Barack Obama publicly addressed the Martin case, as he did last summer's shooting of Brown -- an unarmed teenager shot to death by white police Officer Darren Wilson. The death of Rice, a 12-year-old boy shot last month by a Cleveland officer after police allegedly mistook the child's air gun for a real firearm, has also drawn national attention. The case quickly drew national attention as weeks went by without formal charges. The mothers of these four unarmed black men and boys felled by bullets or excessive police force have no doubt their sons would still be alive if they were white.
