"It currently appears that there are no funds available to meet operational expenses so flights will be suspended immediately," the company said in joint statement Friday with its newly appointed administrators, KordaMentha. About 4,000 passengers in total have been left stranded in Hawaii, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia as a result of the suspension, said Michael Smith, a spokesman for KordaMentha. "Apparently, the straw that broke camel's back was inability to pay for airline fuel," said Michael Ilyine, an accountant from Geelong, Australia. -- Thousands of travelers have been left in the lurch around the world after the carrier Air Australia went into administration and grounded its fleet Friday. Ilyine and his wife were on their honeymoon in Thailand when they were left stuck at the airport in Phuket, he said, after their Air Australia flight was grounded with their baggage in the hold.
