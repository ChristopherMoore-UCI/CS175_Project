The Englishman, beaten in last year's final by compatriot Poulter, is drawn with Australian left-hander Richard Green. But having finished tied for 36th in his only other U.S. appearance at the Masters last April, he is expected to hold his own against nine-time PGA Tour winner Stricker, the event's 2001 champion. World No. 4 Phil Mickelson faces Australian Brendan Jones in the Ben Hogan bracket, where defending champion Ian Poulter takes on American Stewart Cink. Manassero, the European Tour's 2010 rookie of the year, faces a tough task on Wednesday against U.S. Ryder Cup veteran Steve Stricker, at 44 the second-oldest player in the elite 64-man field. Manassero has already won his first senior title, at the 2010 Castello Masters, and his rise has impressed fellow young star Rory McIlroy -- who reached the Match Play quarterfinals as a 19-year-old in 2009.
