Brazilian Rivaldo has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for Greek club AEK again next season. His deal runs out this summer and he has so far refused to sign an extension, prompting reports of interest from a host of European clubs. The Premier League club had an option to extend Brazilian Rochemback's deal by another two years, but manager Gareth Southgate has decided to let him go. "It was a difficult situation for a player of Gaizka's caliber to find himself out of the first team reckoning," added Southgate. He scored only twice in 11 starts and 18 appearances as a substitute and has not appeared for the first team since early February.
