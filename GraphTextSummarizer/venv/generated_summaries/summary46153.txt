Initially, Miles was going to appear during the Oscars' superhero segment along with Garfield. Rumor has it that the March 2 Oscars ceremony was supposed to include 5-year-old Miles Scott, aka "BatKid," but didn't due to rumored tension between the show's producers and "The Amazing Spider-Man" star Andrew Garfield.

Miles has become about as famous as the actor, thanks to his heroic efforts as "BatKid" last fall.
