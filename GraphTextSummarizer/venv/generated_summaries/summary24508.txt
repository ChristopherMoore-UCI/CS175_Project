In a poignant essay published in The Guardian, actor and comedian Russell Brand gave this assessment of Williams: "Hidden behind his beard and kindness and compliments was a kind of awkwardness, like he was in the wrong context or element, a fallen bird on a hard floor." Mindy Kaling, "The Mindy Project" star who has made a career of exploring American culture, shared a special connection with Williams and his place in pop culture. In addition to his unforgettable work as a comedian and actor, Robin Williams leaves behind close friends and family who loved him -- and also a tribe of fellow artists who hope to follow in his footsteps. "I am named after a character from a Robin Williams TV show when my parents still lived in Africa," she tweeted. As Hollywood and fans mourned the loss of Williams, who committed suicide at his California home Monday, a younger generation of comedic actors expressed their admiration for the legendary performer.
