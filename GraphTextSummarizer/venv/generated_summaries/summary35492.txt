That's why we got New Orleans native Judd Harris and his band Visible From Space to send us a little Fat Tuesday love, courtesy of the band's new music video, "If You Axe Me (A Love Letter to New Orleans). "The song is a musical allusion to one of the most quintessential New Orleans and Mardi Gras songs, 'They All Ask'd For You,' by the Meters," says Harris, who fronts the New York-based Visible From Space. Visible From Space will perform next on Feb. 16 at Ulysses Folk House, 58 Stone St., New York; +1 212 482 0400; ulyssesfolkhouse.com "The beauty of New Orleans is that you can walk into almost any club in the city and it'll be cookin,'" says Harris. " New Orleans never looked so good in a video that, filmed in November at multiple locations across the city, plays out like the most enticing Big Easy travel promo we've seen in a while.
