-- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's appearances in New York this week are part of a shrewd strategy that is aimed at enhancing his standing in Iran and the Middle East, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. "But we give it and him enormous attention and almost give Iran and Ahmadinejad free power." "The reality about Iran is that it's a middle-rank power, a regional power, and if not for Ahmadinejad's outlandishness, it would not deserve as much attention as we're giving it," Zakaria said. There have been reports that the clerical hierarchy in Iran has strong doubts, or fears, about Ahmadinejad? I think the biggest mistake we could make is to inflate the importance of Ahmadinejad, to inflate the importance of Iran, inflate the importance of this issue.
