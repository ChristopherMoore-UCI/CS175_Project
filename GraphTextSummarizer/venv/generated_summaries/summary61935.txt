Turkish authorities on Friday were investigating suspicious substances or objects at the Canadian, German and Belgian consulates in Istanbul, officials said. Canadian officials reported receiving a letter containing an unidentified yellow substance Friday, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu news agency reported. Authorities also are investigating security incidents at the German and Belgian consulates in Istanbul, the agency said without elaborating. A person who opened the letter was directly exposed to the substance, and six people nearby may have been indirectly exposed, but no one was exhibiting alarming reactions, a representative of Turkey's emergency management agency said. The office didn't elaborate about the object, but it said that Turkish authorities had been notified and that no one at the consulate came into contact with the object.
