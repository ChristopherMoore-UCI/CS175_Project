Twenty-five birds from a hatch of 20,000 born the week of July 10 were relocated to a small ranch outside of Modesto, California, said Yubert Envia, vice president of turkey and prepared foods for Foster Farms and this year's chairman of the NTF. This year's winners are Nicholas Strain turkeys, a breed that originated in California's Sonoma Valley. The annual turkey (and his alternate) will now be living a life of luxury, but moving to the front of the flock was hard work. The names were chosen from hundreds of submissions from students who participated in California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom, a program where they learned about how the turkey was raised. President Obama on Wednesday continued a tradition of sparing turkeys from the chopping block, as each of his predecessors since George H.W. Bush has done.
