The U.S. military has said five U.S. troops who were working with the Secret Service are under investigation for missing curfew and alleged misconduct at the Colombian hotel where Secret Service agents are said to have brought prostitutes. But a group of Secret Service members drew worldwide attention over the weekend for a different reason -- accusations of misconduct involving prostitutes. There was a dispute over payment between at least one Secret Service member and a woman brought to his hotel, U.S. government sources familiar with the investigation have said. Dan Emmett, a former Secret Service agent, said such allegations have never surfaced before, arguing that this is "a very isolated type of incident." "The president, since the beginning of the presidential protective division (of the Secret Service) in 1902, has been on hundreds and hundreds of overseas trips. U.S. government sources said the agents and officers under investigation were not part of the president's personal protective detail, and stressed that there was no threat to the president.
