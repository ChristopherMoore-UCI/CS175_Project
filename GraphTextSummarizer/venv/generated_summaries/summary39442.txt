-- A consortium of wealthy city businessmen is poised to make an audacious takeover bid for English Premier League champions Manchester United. "These guys are Manchester United supporters to the core and they are talking about putting in their own money in any possible bid," he said. The Red Knights include Jim O'Neill, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, who is reportedly a friend of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. " The Red Knights are joining forces with the influential Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST), who have mounted a vociferous campaign against the Glazers over their debt leveraged buyout of the club and fears about its future viability. "Manchester United is not for sale," said a spokesman for the family, who also own the NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
