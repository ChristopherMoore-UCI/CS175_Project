Three years after succeeding Pope John Paul II, Benedict is likely to address the sex scandal within the Catholic Church, the church's relationship with other faiths, the U.S.-led war in Iraq and the upcoming U.S. presidential election, said John Allen, a CNN Vatican analyst. "He's not the sexy media icon that John Paul II was, but what they've seen, by and large, they've liked." Of American Catholics polled by the Pew Research Center, 74 percent give Pope Benedict a favorable rating. "We try best-case scenarios and also try worst-case scenarios so our staff will know how to react," said Secret Service Special Agent Renee Triplett, who oversees Secret Service training. After he stepped off the plane, Benedict did not kiss the ground, as his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, often did during visits. Still a mystery Despite three years as the head of the Catholic Church, the pope remains a bit of a mystery to many American Catholics.
