After the 2013 Nairobi attack, the bureau worked with some malls last year to test the readiness of SWAT teams by staging fake attacks during hours when malls were closed, the official said. But after a video from terror group Al-Shabaab calling for attacks on shopping malls in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, how worried should shoppers be? A top Canadian official condemned the video, saying authorities there are monitoring threats and will take "the appropriate actions" to protect public safety. The intelligence assessment, the bulletin says, is that there is no credible specific threat to malls in the United States. "There will be enhanced security (at malls)," Johnson said, "but public vigilance, public awareness and public caution in situations like this is particularly important, and it's the environment we're in, frankly."
