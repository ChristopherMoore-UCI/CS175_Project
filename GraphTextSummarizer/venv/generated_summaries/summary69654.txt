-- A 22-year-old Boston University graduate who fell down an elevator shaft at Boston's Fenway Park remains in serious condition, and "her prognosis is uncertain," a lawyer for her family said Tuesday. She'd fallen "anywhere from 20 to 30 feet," fire department spokesman Steve McDonald told CNN affiliate WCVB. Elisabeth Scotland of New Jersey fell into the elevator shaft after a Red Sox game Friday, the day of her graduation from the Boston University's School of Management. Though the cause of the accident remains under investigation, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security said "extreme force" against the bottom of the elevator door probably caused a break of the "fasteners and metal back-up safety system" that kept the door in place. "The Scotland family appreciates the many expressions of concern and support that have come from the Boston community and the Red Sox organization," said a statement released by Patrick Jones, a lawyer for Scotland's family.
