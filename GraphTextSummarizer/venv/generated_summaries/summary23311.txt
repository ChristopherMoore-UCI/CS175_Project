Locals: Why Rob Ford 'has got to go' Ford threatens legal action The mayor recently confessed to purchasing illegal drugs in the past two years, while he was in office. " Doug Ford repeated that statement Friday night on CNN, adding that the media had been unfair to his brother, because Rob Ford represented blue-collar workers of Toronto. -- Toronto's City Council voted Friday to strip embattled Mayor Rob Ford of his ability to govern in an emergency and to appoint and dismiss committee chairs -- unprecedented moves aimed at reining in the controversial politician. The mayor's brother, Councilor Doug Ford, chastised fellow council members, saying they didn't have the "moral or legal authority" to strip an elected official of his responsibilities. "He's admitted to his faults, and I just wish other politicians would come clean like Rob Ford has," Doug Ford told AC360.
