Debt ceilings have been used since President Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s to enable conservatives to put limits on government spending. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton also signed debt limit increases tied to spending agreements. The concept of using the debt ceiling as a vehicle to force negotiations really took off under President Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. Under President Ronald Reagan, one of the most important changes in spending, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act, was attached to a debt ceiling provision. Of course, Obama himself has signed a debt ceiling increase with amendments attached to it.
