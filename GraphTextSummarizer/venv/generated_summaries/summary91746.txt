but Oscar Cardozo's penalty was saved by Spain captain Iker Casillas. -- David Villa came to Spain's rescue again to put the European champions into the World Cup semifinals for the first time with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Paraguay in Johannesburg on Saturday night as both teams missed a penalty. The South Americans felt aggrieved to have a 41st-minute strike by Nelson Valdez ruled out after Cardozo strayed into a marginally offside position, but wasted a glorious chance to go ahead after Spain defender Gerard Pique was booked for dragging on the arm of Cardozo. Villar was lucky not to concede another penalty as he clattered into Cesc Fabregas while trying to gather the rebound, but was helpless when Spain finally made the breakthrough. "We didn't play well mainly because we didn't get enough of the ball," Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque told reporters.
