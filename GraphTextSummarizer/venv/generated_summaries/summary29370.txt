Using dainty jewelry, a pastel color palette and perfectly tailored separates, costume designer Lyn Paolo said her plan for Olivia, played by actress Kerry Washington, was to "create a vision of femininity, but still show strength." Olivia's wardrobe will look more or less the same when the ABC series' second season premieres on September 27, Paolo said. " She'll don her standard Armani, Escada and Valentino threads -- on loan from the designers -- mixed with pieces Paolo finds at stores such as Nordstrom Rack, Bloomingdales and Loehmann's. " Olivia will continue sporting "the long necklaces that are in vogue right now," Paolo said, adding, she'll also have a new Prada purse and two new Movado watches, one in rose gold and one in silver, in addition to the gold timepiece she wore during season one. ' It's all about knowing what works on an actor's body, Paolo said, adding, "If you look at (Olivia) you'll see her silhouettes are fairly consistent. ... " To achieve Olivia's business casual look, Paolo suggests women look toward stores such as Zara and Ann Taylor "where you can get the feeling."
