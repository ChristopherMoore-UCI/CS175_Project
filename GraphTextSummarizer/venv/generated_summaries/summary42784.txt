States with damage caps gain more doctors than uncapped states -- and the difference is greatest in the most underserved counties within capped states. Capped states have 5.5 percent more OB-GYNs per person in their rural counties than do states without caps. Over the past decade and a half, states have reacted to abusive lawsuits by imposing various restrictions on personal injury awards. It's Section 2531 of the bill -- to be precise Section 2531(4)b -- and it provides as follows: The new health bill will empower the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to states that reform their medical malpractice systems. Texas' experience is dramatic, but consistent, with other reforming states.
