"It is very difficult to hate a company," said Hayward, conceding BP contingency plans were inadequate. "The confidence of the markets had been rattled," former BP CEO Tony Hayward said in his first interview since he resigned, indicating how close the company was to collapse. "BP, Halliburton, and Transocean are major respected companies operating throughout the Gulf," said William Reilly, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, "and the evidence is that they are in need of top-to-bottom reform." Referencing his own earlier remarks about "culture of complacency," Reilly said, "all three companies we heard from displayed it," Reilly said. The disaster began April 20 with an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig, which was completing the well for BP at the time of the blast. The director of a petroleum research laboratory at Louisiana State University testified that better training and drills could prepare rig workers for disasters.
