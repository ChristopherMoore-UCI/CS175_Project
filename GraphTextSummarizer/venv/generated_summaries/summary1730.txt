Djokovic celebrated by taking part in a group hug with his entourage -- which included coaches Marian Vajda and Boris Becker -- at the side of the court. "It's a great deal of happiness knowing what I've been through the entire season in order to get to where I am and finish the year as No. 1," said Djokovic, who became a dad and got married in 2014 but also lost his first coach, Jelena Gencic, and suffered a wrist injury. And when he forced a forehand error from Berdych on match point, Djokovic saw his winning streak indoors rise to 30 matches. But playing in London might help Djokovic. It was in London in July that Djokovic earned his lone Grand Slam title of 2014 on the grass at Wimbledon.
