The Spaniard oozed confidence after his victory as he bids for his second Australian Open title. " Nadal, beaten by Stanislas Wawrinka in a dramatic final in Melbourne last year, will face Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych in the last eight. The route to the final in that half of the draw has been eased by the upset exit of second seed Roger Federer to Andreas Seppi of Italy Friday. Berdych will doubtless prove a dangerous opponent and showed his intentions with a straight sets victory over Australian hope Bernard Tomic in their last 16 clash Sunday, but he has a 3-18 career record against Nadal. Murray had to dig deep to avenge his Wimbledon defeat last year to Dimitrov, rallying from 2-5 down in the fourth set before closing out a 6-4 6-7 6-3 7-5 victory.
