Europe's expected fall in production is in response to a steep decline in car sales throughout the continent since the 2008/09 financial crisis, with the problems causing severe difficulties at a number of large vehicle makers, notably France's PSA Peugeot CitroÃ«n, which is cutting almost 10,000 jobs and is lining up a â‚¬7bn rescue package for its financing arm with the French government. Mr Corwin also cautioned that even with a continuation of the recent rise of the car industry in China, many vehicle markers doing business there "are struggling to make much money" as a result of tough competition and the fact that the market is made up of large numbers of small cars, for which profit margins for manufacturers are small. China is in 2013 set to make 19.6m cars and other light vehicles such as small trucks compared with 18.3m in Europe, according to projections prepared for the Financial Times by five forecasting groups. Norbert Reithofer, chief executive of the German luxury carmaker BMW, said he expected conditions for selling cars in Europe would remain "very challenging" in 2013. China is poised to produce more cars than Europe in 2013 for the first time, hitting a landmark in the country's rise in the automobile industry and underlining the difficulties for the European vehicle sector as it faces a challenging 12 months.
