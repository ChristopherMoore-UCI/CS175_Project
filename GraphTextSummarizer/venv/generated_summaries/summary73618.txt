"A lot of people don't wear life jackets because they don't have intention of being in water," Barney said. Sean McGovern, 50, and Mellisa Morris, 52, said they'd fallen off their boat in Key Largo about 6 p.m. Friday. " About 8 a.m. Saturday, two Broward sheriff's office detectives, a Broward firefighter and one of the men's father-in-law noticed splashing in the water from their boat, the sheriff's department said. The fishermen passed them over to the Coast Guard, which carried them to the Fort Lauderdale Coast Guard Station.
