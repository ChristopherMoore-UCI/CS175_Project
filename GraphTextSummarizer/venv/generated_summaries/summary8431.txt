Earlier this year, out of frustration, Hughes said he turned his attention again to the place name inscribed on the pocket watch, Abersoch, a coastal town in north Wales. The watch inscription reads "Richard Prichard, Abersoch, North Wales, 1866." Prichard's only surviving relative is Owen Cowell, a retired dentist living in Pwllheli, North Wales -- incidentally, not far from Abersoch. But on a dark November night, in driving rain and gale-force winds, Jones took a wrong turn and found himself stuck in the Bristol Channel, along Wales' south coast. Jones probably intended to sail through St. George's Channel, between Ireland and Wales, on his way to Liverpool, Hughes said.
