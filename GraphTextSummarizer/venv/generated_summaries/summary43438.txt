The five-year mission "will determine how the sun's magnetic field is generated, structured and converted into violent solar events like turbulent solar wind, solar flares and Coronal Mass Ejections," according to the agency. Such events can put astronauts at risk, as well as aircraft flying over Earth's North or South Poles, and can also disrupt satellite communications, navigational systems and power grids, NASA said. The agency says the observatory will provide a better understanding of the sun and its role in space weather events such as solar flares, which can wreak havoc on Earth. The observatory is designed to deliver solar images with resolution 10 times better than high-definition television, according to NASA. "That's a direct impact on life and society," said Richard Fisher, director of NASA's Heliophysics Division.
