Martin Guitars was established in 1833 when C.F. Martin, along with his family, immigrated to New York from Germany. According to Chris Martin, the reason that Martin Guitars has been able to hold off the effects of the troubled economy is because of detailed records that date back nearly two centuries. The one thing is perfecting the art of guitar making, and, musicians say, Martin Guitars has done it better than most. Country music icons Hank Williams and Johnny Cash also were Martin men. Chris Martin says that although the plant has been modernized to produce more guitars, "there are factories in Asia that make as many guitars in one month as we do in one year."
