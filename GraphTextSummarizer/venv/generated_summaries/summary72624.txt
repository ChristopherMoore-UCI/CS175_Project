-- Actor John Ingle, who played patriarch Edward Quartermaine on ABC's "General Hospital," has died at age 84, ABC announced Monday. His dressing room door was always open, and many of us would find our way there to pick his brain and, in turn, he would lend an ear and offer his wisdom," said longtime fellow cast member Leslie Charleson, who has played Dr. Monica Quartermaine on "General Hospital." The network said his students included Albert Brooks, Nicolas Cage, Richard Dreyfuss, Joanna Gleason, Barbara Hershey, Swoosie Kurtz, Stefanie Powers, David Schwimmer and Jonathan Silverman. "John Ingle achieved great joy from playing the role of Edward Quartermaine," according to executive producer Frank Valentini. He joined "General Hospital" in 1993.
