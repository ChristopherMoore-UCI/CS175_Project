-- Three Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, police officers became the first department fatalities since 1995 Saturday morning while responding to a domestic dispute call, Police Chief Nathan Harper said. Neighbors reported that the family had caused trouble before and Harper said police had responded to calls from the home two or three times. The shootings triggered a standoff between Poplawski, who was shooting from his bedroom window, and law enforcement agencies from several jurisdictions, Harper said. Law enforcement from several jurisdictions respond to a shooting standoff at Pittsburgh home Saturday. "We have never had to lose three officers in the line of duty at one time at one call," Harper said.
