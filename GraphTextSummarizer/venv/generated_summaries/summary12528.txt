"A researcher I was speaking to recently reckons green walls in urban canyon environments (areas where walls are higher than the width of the road separating them) are more effective than trees at collecting particles because the way the wind eddies around and then moves down the wall," Laurence said. Aside from their pleasing aesthetic qualities, vertical gardens could also deliver more practical benefits says Mark Laurence, creative director at Biotecture, a UK company who design and build green walls. Some believe that in less polluted areas, green walls could be employed to grow food, which could aid urban food security. "The market is rapidly moving into looking at how they can provide eco-system services and green infrastructures for urban environments," Laurence said. There are various systems for DIY constructions with most requiring a compost-based system, he says, but homemade hydroponic systems can be made using plastic bottles.
