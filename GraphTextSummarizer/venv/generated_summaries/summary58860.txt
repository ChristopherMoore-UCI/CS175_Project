"Mob wanted police to hand them over the alleged blasphemer," said Hafiz Majid, the senior police official in Badami Bagh. The group accused police of arresting Christians in the incident "while those who went on a rampage and can easily be identified from television footage have gone scot-free. More than 100 homes of Christians were set on fire by outraged Muslims in the Badami Bagh community in Lahore on Saturday after police arrested Sawan Masih, a Christian in his mid-20s accused of speaking against Mohammad, officials said. He denies the allegations made by the two men who filed the blasphemy complaint against him with police on Friday, Majid said. But they have been criticized by human rights advocates who say the laws enable legal discrimination against religious minorities.
