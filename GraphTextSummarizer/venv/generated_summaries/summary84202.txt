This technique has been used in other games, but "Halo 4" raises the bar for others to emulate. From the opening scene with Catherine Halsey, the creator of the story's super-soldier program, to its climax, the tension between humans and machines runs throughout the story. The action begins with Master Chief in cryosleep and Cortana starting to undergo rampancy, a condition for older AIs in which they actually think themselves to death. The graphics of "Halo 4" are outstanding in their detailed depictions of characters and background environments. "Halo 4's" epic fight sequences require players to confront waves of enemies in one mission, then pick off bad guys one by one in another.
