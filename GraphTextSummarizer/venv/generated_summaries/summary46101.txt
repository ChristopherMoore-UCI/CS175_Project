The Justice Department is officially dropping its demand that New York Times reporter James Risen reveal a confidential source for a book and articles he wrote. The new Justice Department subpoena is now seeking that Risen verify that he wrote the book "State of War" and two articles in the New York Times in 2001-2002, that the published material is accurate, that he has a confidential source he won't identify, and that Risen verify that Sterling provided on-the-record quotes published in a New York Times article. The subpoena is for testimony in the leak prosecution of Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer, who the Justice Department accuses of providing information to Risen. Previously the Justice Department contemplated asking Risen to provide the time and location of where he was, when he received the leaked information, a prospect that risked indirectly identifying Risen's source. The information requested in the new subpoena appears to align with information Risen has said in court filings he is willing to provide.
