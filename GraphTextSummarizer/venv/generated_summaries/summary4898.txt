-- New York Mayor Bill de Blasio must have been in a hurry to get somewhere Thursday, according to a local media report that featured video of the mayor's two-car caravan speeding on city streets, blowing through stop signs and violating other traffic laws -- just two days after he announced a traffic-safety initiative. With that in mind, Mayor de Blasio is firmly committed to the traffic safety policies outlined this week," De Blasio press secretary Phil Walzak said in a statement. The alleged traffic violations came just two days after de Blasio unveiled his "Vision Zero" plan, an approach that combines "education, smarter streets, and strong enforcement to reduce dangerous and illegal behavior on our streets," according to the mayor's official website. The mayor's office released a statement Thursday in response to news reports about the mayor's speedy trip. The report by CNN affiliate WCBS, accompanied by the station's exclusive video, said the mayor's car was being driven by a member his security detail, with de Blasio in the passenger seat.
