Nelly Avila Moreno, 45, whose nom de guerre was Karina, said she and her longtime male companion made the decision jointly to abandon the FARC group, based in the jungle, at 5 a.m. Sunday. After 24 years with the FARC, Karina said she wants to reintegrate with society. "To tell them, what Karina has done is the road all the members of FARC should go down. Wearing a red sweatshirt and what appeared to be a diamond earring in her left ear, she said she once believed the FARC would rule Colombia. Asked about news reports of guerrilla operations she may have participated in, Karina admitted to nothing.
