The election is over, and it has already become easy to forget the election administration lunacy that plagued many communities this year: long waits for voting, changing legal rules even while the election was under way, misprinted ballots, incorrect instructions given to voters, and various machine breakdowns. We have no national election authority: states and counties are in charge of designing ballots, registering voters, adopting balloting technologies, allocating resources such as poll workers and voting machines and conducting the initial canvass of votes. Until we get one, we will continue to trade one series of election problems for another as we stumble toward the next 2000-style disaster. To some extent, this decentralization can counter partisan manipulation at the state level by busting the monopoly one party might have over election administration. The first problem is that we let openly partisan state and local officials run elections.
