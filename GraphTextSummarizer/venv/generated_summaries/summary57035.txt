But why? "This man -- whose sacrifice has been known to only a few -- provided America with the information that led us to arrest the network of Cuban agents that included the men transferred to Cuba today as well as other spies in the United States," Obama said Wednesday. Obama signals overhaul of Cuba relations RELEASED BY CUBA Unnamed U.S. intelligence agent According to the office of the Director of National Intelligence, this Cuban national provided the U.S. government with information that "was instrumental in the identification and disruption of several Cuban intelligence operatives in the United States and ultimately led to ... successful federal espionage prosecutions." Specifically, the U.S. intelligence office tied this unnamed spy to the conviction of one-time Defense Intelligence Agency senior analyst Ana Belen Montes, who was sentenced to 25 years after pleading guilty of spying for the Cuban government in 2002. He went on 54 combat missions, one of them as part of Cuban forces fighting against apartheid-era South African forces in Angola. His two-day, March 2011 trial took place behind closed doors, ending with his conviction for allegedly trying to set up an Internet network for Cuban dissidents "to promote destabilizing activities and subvert constitutional order."
