MacNeill, who had been on trial for 22 days in Provo, Utah, had pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and obstruction of justice. -- Utah doctor Martin MacNeill was found guilty of his wife's murder in a verdict read early Saturday morning. During his closing arguments Friday morning, prosecutor Chad Grunander pleaded with jurors to return a guilty verdict on both counts. He faces 15 years to life in prison for murder, and he could be sentenced to up to 15 years for obstruction of justice. In the end, jurors believed prosecutors' allegations that MacNeill drugged and then drowned his wife, Michele MacNeill, in the bathtub of their home on April 11, 2007, to be with his mistress.
