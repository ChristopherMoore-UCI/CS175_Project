An anonymous, wealthy California man is hiding up to $100 or so in public places in San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose and then posting clues to the money's whereabouts through his Twitter page, appropriately dubbed Hidden Cash. Still, solicitations flood his inbox: He's now overwhelmed by e-mails (his address is on the Twitter page) from people seeking money for a down payment, mortgage payment, child's college tuition or even dental work. The station showed Alex Doxie of San Jose running down the street, searching and then finding an envelope of $135 cash that was taped to the hydrant near the SAP Center, home of the NHL's San Jose Sharks. All you're doing is leaving money and putting clues on Twitter." The results have been a feel-good sensation in California: The Twitter page features selfies of joyous people who found the money -- flashing smiles and cash -- with testimonials of what they're going to do next.
