Navy: U.S. destroyer collides with oil tanker Iranian sailors chase off pirates attacking U.S. ship -- A U.S. guided missile destroyer was involved in a collision with an oil tanker near the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy announced. The Norfolk, Virginia-based ship is part of the U.S. 5th Fleet and left its home port on March 12. The Navy said the accident, which occurred Sunday at about 1 a.m. local time, was not combat-related. The 505-foot Porter is operating under its own power near the strait, a strategically important chokepoint for oil shipments from the Persian Gulf.
