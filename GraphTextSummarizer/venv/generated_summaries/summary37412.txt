Kareema Cross also saw babies or fetal remains in a toilet, a plastic box and jars, she told the court in the trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who is charged with eight counts of murder. Similar to testimony from other clinic employees, after a few months of working at the Women's Medical Society in August 2005 for $10 an hour, Gosnell had Cross working the ultrasound machine and assisting with abortion procedures, as well as other procedures she was not formally trained to do. Cross graphically described witnessing Gosnell cut the necks of several babies while she worked at the clinic. Also on trial is Eileen O'Neill, 56, a medical school graduate who worked as a doctor at Gosnell's clinic. When authorities searched Gosnell's practice, they found bags and bottles holding aborted fetuses scattered throughout the building.
