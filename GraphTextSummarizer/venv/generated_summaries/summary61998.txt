The film -- which focuses on the tumultuous time in the band's career 20 years ago -- shows how Bono, guitarist the Edge, drummer Larry Mullen Jr. and bassist Adam Clayton got back on track: After considerable infighting and "creative differences" while the four hunkered down at Hansa Studios in Berlin in 1990 to try to make an album, the song "One" finally and miraculously sprouted from the unfinished "Mysterious Ways. " Rolling Stone: The Best U2 Songs The day after the TIFF gala screening, Bono, the Edge and Guggenheim spoke at a press conference about the film. "Making Achtung Baby is the reason we're here now," Bono says early on in Davis Guggenheim's new U2 documentary, "From The Sky Down," which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on Thursday night. In addition to the tension, intensity and struggle that plays out in the film, there is a lot of levity too, including a satirical montage of bands that have imploded or lost members, references and demonstrations of Bono's unique gibberish singing, dubbed "Bongalese" and yes, the band in drag. "We've learned our craft -- and therein lies the huge danger, which is there's a giant chasm between the very good and the great, and U2 right now has a danger of surrendering to the very good." Guggenheim had earned the Edge's trust from the documentary they did together in 2008, "It Might Get Loud," alongside two other guitar greats, Jack White and Jimmy Page.
