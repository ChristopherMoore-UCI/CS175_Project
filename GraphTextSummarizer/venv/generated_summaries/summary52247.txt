The chief executive of English Premier League club Arsenal has urged the team's supporters to get behind under-fire coach Arsene Wenger. But the team have been below par this season, and are in fourth place only on goal difference, ahead of London rivals Chelsea, and 17 points off leaders Manchester City. The early-season sales of Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona and Samir Nasri to Manchester City helped Arsenal post such healthy profits. Gazidis confirmed there was money available to spend on players but said that UEFA's new Financial Fair Play regulations, which aim to make football clubs more sustainable and live within their means, would help moderate a voracious market. Ivan Gazidis told the north London team's fans that Wenger was the best man for the job on the day that Arsenal announced pre-tax profits of $78 million for the six months until the end of November.
