Another Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, said children at immigration hearings must have legal representation. It would stop requiring hearings but allow children to request one, which would have to take place within 72 hours. Democratic leaders oppose revising the law, saying the government can speed up immigration hearings without any changes. With almost no opposition, Congress passed a new law to protect immigrant children from sex traffickers trying to bring them to the United States. It contributes to the surge of child migrants from Central America overwhelming the U.S. immigration system.
