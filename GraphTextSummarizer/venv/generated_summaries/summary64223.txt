" Not all trees that are planted can protect against mudslides, but Hallum said pine trees planted on high mountain slopes can be most effective. "Deforestation -- or the absence of trees -- causes mudslides to occur," said Hallum, co-founder of the Alliance for International Reforestation, a nonprofit trying to help the villagers protect themselves from mudslides. Through her group's efforts, Hallum is inspiring villagers to stop chopping and, instead, use trees to safeguard their lives and crops against mudslides. " "I can go back to areas that were nothing but mudslides and soil erosion, and now I see forest," Hallum said. Hallum, a self-proclaimed nature lover, was not formally trained in agriculture, but she knew some basic facts about trees and food products that could be cheaply grown.
