Two days after peace talks began in Norway, an apparent FARC rebel attack killed five Colombian soldiers. Colombia's top rebel group, FARC, announced Monday it will temporarily halt its decades-old battle against government forces starting at midnight as a goodwill gesture amid peace talks with the Colombia government. "Heeding the overwhelming demand for peace from diverse sectors of the country, the FARC secretariat orders guerrilla units across the country to cease military operations and acts of sabotage," Marquez said The rebel cease-fire is scheduled to start Monday night and last until January 20, the rebel group said. FARC had signaled that it would pursue a cease-fire, even before peace talks, now being held in Havana, began in mid-October in Norway. The FARC continues to carry out kidnappings and attack security forces, though it has been severely weakened in recent years.
