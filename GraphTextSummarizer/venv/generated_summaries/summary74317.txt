Sarah received her first transplant lungs June 12, one week after she became eligible for adult lungs. -- Less than a month after two lung transplant surgeries to save Sarah Murnaghan's life, the 10-year-old has developed pneumonia in her second set of replacement lungs, her mother posted on Monday. Pneumonia is not uncommon after any type of lung surgery, CNN's Sanjay Gupta said. Her family had been told she had five weeks to live in May, and she had been on a transplant list for children's lungs for 18 months After the Murnaghans petitioned, the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network's executive committee approved a one-year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible to be on adult lung transplant priority lists. "But even with a setback like this infection, nearly 80% of people survive at least one year after lung transplant."
