CNN tried to reach Battle, but he did not respond to e-mail requests and his voicemail box was full -- perhaps an indicator of how busy and in demand Williams is. A faculty member in social work at a nearby school wrote to offer Williams "mental health support as he goes on this second-chance journey." In that release, Battle said he's been checking in with Williams over the years and offering assistance -- including occasional voiceover and concert announcement gigs -- "whenever he would let me." Doral Chenoweth III, the man who filmed Williams and was initially skeptical about Battle's role, has gotten to know the pair in recent days and shared stories he's gleaned of their history. On Wednesday morning, Williams appeared in the Columbus studio of WNCI, where he took to the airwaves on the nationally syndicated Dave and Jimmy radio show before taking off for the New York talk shows and into the stratosphere of fame. The two Columbus radio hosts, Dave Kaelin and Jimmy Jam, said they, too, are a bit worried about what all this sudden attention will mean for Williams.
