"The fact that Stasi spies had to try to look like ordinary people just shows that they had completely lost the connection to their citizens." According to Menner, thousands of bags of Stasi images and documents are yet to be archived. The sometimes ludicrous disguises and complex surveillance techniques used by East Germany's Stasi secret police to psychologically brutalize the population have been revealed, more than two decades after the fall of the Iron Curtain. In his book "Top Secret: Images from the Stasi Archives," Menner includes images that show the creative guises of Stasi personnel. "People are fascinated by surveillance and secret services, but the public has little access to picture material showing the act of surveillance," the Berlin-based artist told CNN.
