A look at Iran's nuclear capabilities UN nuclear inspectors head to Iran as compliance deadline nears -- The United States and Iran are adding a new round of senior-level talks about the latter's nuclear program, discussions separate from the so-called P5+1 process continuing in Vienna. Major disagreements on a comprehensive agreement remain, a senior administration official told CNN on Saturday. The increase of diplomatic effort comes as an interim agreement reached between Iran and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council nears its end. That deal eased some economic sanctions in return for Iran rolling back parts of its nuclear program, which the United States and others believe is designed to produce a weapon.
