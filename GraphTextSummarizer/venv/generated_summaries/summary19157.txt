-- One hundred thirty new cases of Ebola were identified during a three-day lockdown in Sierra Leone, Stephen Gaojia, the country's head of emergency operations, said Monday. The latest report from the World Health Organization, released Monday, says at least 2,803 people have died during the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. The WHO is also tracking the virus in Senegal and Nigeria, where a much smaller number of cases have been confirmed. The first Ebola case was documented in December. The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat.
