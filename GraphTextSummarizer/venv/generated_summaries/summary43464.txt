The charge is equivalent to a hate crime under Oklahoma law, according to Partners Against Hate, a joint project of the Anti-Defamation League, the Leadership Conference Education Fund and the Center for Preventing Hate nonprofit groups. On Friday, Tulsa County District Attorney Tim Harris filed, against both men, three counts of first-degree murder tied to the deaths of Bobby Clark, 54, Dannaer Fields, 49, and William Terrell Allen, 31. The district attorney notes that, according to Oklahoma law, that charge infers that a person has acted "maliciously and with the specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin or disability." Police have identified Watts and England as white, though a probable cause affidavit released Friday noted England was co-owner of a truck that had Cherokee Nation license plates. They appeared before a judge via a video link from jail to hear the charges against them, said Clark Brewster, England's attorney.
