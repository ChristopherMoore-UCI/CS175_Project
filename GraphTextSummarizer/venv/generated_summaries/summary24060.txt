-- The National Hurricane Center on Saturday warned residents of tall structures in the path of Hurricane Irene that the wind hitting upper floors will be stronger than those in most storms. Winds were at 80 mph Saturday evening. They are designed to withstand strong winds. Thunderstorms tend to bring the higher winds down to the surface, and with the lack of such activity the stronger winds are staying at higher levels. CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said the higher friction at the ground surface slows wind speeds.
