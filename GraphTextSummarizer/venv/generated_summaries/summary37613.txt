The three focal points of debt, delinquency and deficit represent the cornerstones of family financial strength. When church members testify on Sundays during the worship experience that they have paid off multiple credit cards or finished paying for a car, the entire congregation affirms them by celebrating their victory with handclaps and shouts. Late payments lower our credit scores and this causes us to pay higher interest rates even on good debt such as mortgages. Given the avalanche of bankruptcies, foreclosures and high-interest credit card debt that many people are experiencing, there may be no greater need than to understand the value and joy of debt-free living. The levels of family debt are threatening our ability to develop any meaningful wealth or to pass that wealth on to future generations.
