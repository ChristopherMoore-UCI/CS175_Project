-- Strong winds whipped up several wildfires in central Texas Sunday, threatening homes and forcing some residents to evacuate. It forced parts of state highways 71 and 21 to shut and additional road closures are expected, Maxwell said. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning Sunday across much of south, central and eastern Texas. The largest of the fires is in Bastrop County, southeast of Austin, said Lexi Maxwell, a spokeswoman with the Texas Forest Service. Texas is currently battling its worst fire season in state history.
