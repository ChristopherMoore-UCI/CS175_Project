Private employees generally have less workplace privacy than do government workers. Justice Department lawyers warned that a ruling against the government would jeopardize its ability to obtain necessary information from contractors and regular government staff members. All federal employees and applicants are subject to such background checks, and the government says that applies to contractors as well. The JPL case raised the question of rights enjoyed in the quasi-official world of government contractors. All civil servants and contractors are now issued special ID badges and cards after first undergoing fingerprint checks and thorough screenings of their professional and personal lives.
