As the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race set sail from London on Sunday, 670 amateur sailors will soon find out if they have what it takes to complete one of the most grueling sporting challenges known to man -- sailing around the globe. "For most people it will be the first time they're sleeping and living on a boat for a long period of time," said Nik Brbora, who completed the 2012 race. Then there's the weather -- in all your training you can't really experience your first big storm," added the 29-year-old IT engineer from London. "They'll have to get used to the uncomfortable conditions, lack of sleep, and shift work -- usually four hours on, four hours off. From 18-year-old students to 70-year-old retirees, the gutsy sailors taking part in this year's race will -- quite literally -- be thrown in the deep end.
