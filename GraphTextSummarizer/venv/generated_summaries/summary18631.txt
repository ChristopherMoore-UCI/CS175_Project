At a very basic level, the Sumatra rainforest is part of a ring of forests along the equator known as lungs of the world-- soaking up the carbon we produce and giving us precious oxygen. -- Traveling just below the equator, deep in the Sumatran jungle of Indonesia for CNN's new "Expedition: Sumatra" series, my team and I were on assignment to capture the story of a region at a critical crossroads, where rainforests that provide habitat to some of the most rare and endangered species in the world are being destroyed at an alarming rate by pulp and paper and palm oil industries as well as wildlife poachers. From toilet tissue and plywood to lipstick, detergent and margarine, and even condoms, many ordinary household products are routinely produced using raw materials sourced from plantations that have replaced Sumatra's rainforests. Not surprising when you consider between 1985 and 2007, the island of Sumatra alone lost 12 million hectares of natural forest, a 48% loss in 22 years. These native species are quickly disappearing as their habitat is lost to palm oil estates and pulp for paper plantations, as the plantations' roads give poachers ever better access to wildlife's last hiding places, and as some are poisoned by managers angry about elephants feeding in their plantations.
