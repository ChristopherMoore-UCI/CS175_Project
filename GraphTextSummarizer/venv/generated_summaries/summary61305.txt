(Feel free to add your own Internet translation tips -- and fun translation bloopers -- in the comments section at the bottom of the story): Facebook's human translation Many tech bloggers think Facebook's method of human translation seems promising. Also, Google lets people spot translation errors, suggest new wordings and translate its interface into languages Google's computers don't speak just yet. The update allows sites to install a translation gadget on their sites through Facebook Connect, a service that lets Facebook users sign in on other Web pages. Facebook and Google have added new translation tools, but they take different approaches. Also, Facebook's site is available in many languages, but its human translators don't touch wall posts, photo comments and other user-submitted items, which is a big con if you want to have friends who don't share a common language with you.
