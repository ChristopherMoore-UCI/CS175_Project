But New Zealand breached their defense regularly as Ben Lam, Tim Mikkelson, captain DJ Forbes and Sam Dickson crossed in a dominant display. In the earlier playoff for third place, Fiji gained some consolation for their semifinal setback by beating Australia 21-12. South Africa beat Wales 19-14 in the Plate Final and are the nearest challengers to New Zealand in the battle for overall honors, trailing by seven points in the standings, with Fiji in third. England, who beat two-time holders Fiji in the semifinal, were always on the back foot in the finale of the three-day tournament and scored a lone try through Tom Powell. The New Zealand triumph -- their fifth since 2000 in the prestigious event -- took them back to the top of the HSBC Sevens World Series -- with two rounds of the nine remaining.
