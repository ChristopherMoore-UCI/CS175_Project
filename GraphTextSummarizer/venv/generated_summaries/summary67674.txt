Only that the true story of Selma is much more than calling out racism. In it they joked about the kind of movie President Obama prefers and then began listing only those starring black people. "Selma" is a good film that told a great story, at least according to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters. But did those demographics play a role in how "Selma" was received? But I do not need her to win an Oscar to tell me how I should feel about "Selma."
