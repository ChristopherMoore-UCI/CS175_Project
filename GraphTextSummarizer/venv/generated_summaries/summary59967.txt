Human Genetics Alert, a secular independent watchdog, said it found defects among existing hybrid embryos which raise doubts about whether mixed embryos can produce useful stem cells. Advocates of hybrid cells say animal eggs from which a nucleus has been removed are simply "empty shells. Creating hybrid embryos is not the only way to develop useful stem cells, said Minger. "The use of animal eggs will provide a valuable resource to embryo research scientists," argued Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo. The revised bill now allows hybrid embryos for further research but specifies they may not be placed in a woman or an animal, the spokeswoman said.
