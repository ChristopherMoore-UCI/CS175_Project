Jackie Gingrich taught mathematics at high schools in South Georgia and retired around the time her grandchildren were born so she could spend more time with them, the funeral home said. -- Jackie Gingrich, the first wife of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the mother of his two daughters, died Wednesday in Atlanta, according to the funeral home organizing her arrangements. The Almon Funeral Home in Carrollton, Georgia, did not give her cause of death, but Gingrich had battled cancer for years. Jackie Gingrich was born Jacqueline May Battley on February 21, 1936, in Columbus, Georgia, the oldest of four children, the funeral home said. She earned a mathematics degree from Auburn College in just three years so her sister, Carol, could start college right after high school, it said.
