On Friday, Sergi released a statement saying that Williams "has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. Investigators took swab samples from Williams' hand to test him for gun residue, Williams' attorney, David Sergi, said. Earlier this month, Williams told North Texas TV station KXAS he understood why authorities would want to meet with him after the McLellands' death. "In the investigators' minds, they want to check with me to do their process of elimination." Williams said he has cooperated with law enforcement. Hours after Kaufman County District Attornney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead March 30 at their Forney home, investigators met at a local Denny's restaurant with Williams, his attorney told CNN earlier this month.
