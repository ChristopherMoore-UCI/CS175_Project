Asked about increased carbon emissions, Russ Girling said the report determined that "oil sands are gonna get produced anyway." "When you read the report carefully, it makes clear that blocking Keystone is an important component of climate sanity and we will find out if John Kerry and particularly Barack Obama  are ever willing to stand up to the oil industry or not," said environmental activist Bill McKibben, founder of 350.org. Jones noted that the oil from the tar sands was more carbon intensive than normal oil, producing 17% more carbon emissions. Environmentalists say that is why the project should be rejected, arguing that it would continue U.S. reliance on a dirtier foreign oil at a time when Obama has pledged action against climate change. In a speech last year on climate change, Obama said the pipeline should be approved only if it is basically carbon-neutral, meaning that approving it would have no more impact on climate change that not approving it. A long-awaited State Department environmental report on the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline indicates what the oil industry and its backers have been saying -- it won't have a big impact on carbon emissions that cause climate change.
