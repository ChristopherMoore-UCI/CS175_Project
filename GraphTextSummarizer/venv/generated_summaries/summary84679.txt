Successful teams across sports in cities like New York, Washington and Los Angeles are using this same multicultural business strategy to run winning franchises. And when Levenson and his partners realized that the arena was half-empty, the first questions Levenson should have asked are: Will sports fans pay money to watch this team play? But Levenson's brand of public hypocrisy is not just morally corrupt, it is bad for business. I say good riddance to Levenson and other NBA owners like him, of which I think there are few. "As Mr. Levenson acknowledged, the views he expressed are entirely unacceptable and are in stark contrast to the core principles of the National Basketball Association," Silver said in a statement Sunday.
