Murals found on cave walls in Afghanistan prove that painting with oil had been going on in Asia for centuries before artists used the technique in Europe, scientists said this week. Afghan murals show oil painting was going on for centuries earlier in Asia than Europe. "This is the earliest clear example of oil paintings in the world," said Yoko Taniguchi, leader of the team of scientists. Until now, art historians believed that oil painting started in Europe in the 15th century. Scientists found the murals in a network of caves where monks lived and prayed in the Afghan region of Bamiyan, according to a statement on the Web site of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, where the ancient paintings were analyzed.
