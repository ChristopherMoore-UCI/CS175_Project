In August, ISIS fighters massacred 700 members of the Sunni Shaitat tribe in eastern Syria, according to the Washington Post. None of us, sadly, can be surprised anymore at the brutality of ISIS, the insidious group that now controls huge chunks of territory in Syria and Iraq. ISIS has portrayed itself as the defender of persecuted Sunnis against sectarian Shia-led governments in Iraq and Syria and elsewhere, and embedded itself into the communities of cities like Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah. Moderate and radical Islamic clerics alike had called for ISIS to spare the life of Kassig -- also known as Abdul-Rahman -- a former U.S. Army Ranger who toured Iraq in 2007 and converted to Islam during his year in captivity. We need a bottom-up approach that addresses the legitimate grievances of poor Sunni communities in Iraq and Syria, and gives them a stake in their political future.
