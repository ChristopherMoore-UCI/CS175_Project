We asked readers to upload their photos to CNN iReport and tag their social media images of stickers #ivotedcnn, and we received more than 2,000 iReport submissions from all 50 states. Sticker-less iReporters printed out CNN's sticker or found other ways to tell us that they had voted. Share your story in the comments section below or post your photo on CNN iReport. But early voting has been especially big in 2012, and some polling places don't give away stickers. If you have photos or videos about the voting process itself, or of the sights and sounds of an Election Day event, please visit this link.
