At the partnership's inception, LucasArts gave BioWare the option to create games with characters from the films or set during another time, said Ray Muzyka, a BioWare founder who is now the general manager of its various studios. -- A long time ago, by technology standards, in this very galaxy, the founders of video game developer BioWare received a phone call. Already, BioWare execs have begun discussing new features they plan to add for teams and player battles, which may be released in quarterly updates, according to Muzyka. Execs are eager because BioWare has been preparing for this type of game for more than a decade. "It's kind of like building a whole bunch of [console games] and then building an Xbox Live service," Muzyka said.
