Arch-rivals Real Madrid opened their title bid with a 6-0 rout of Real Zaragoza Sunday and Barca were just as impressive once youth team graduate and Spanish under-21 international Lionel Messi then added a double for Pep Guardiola's all-conquering team who have already added to their trophy cabinet with victories in the Spanish Super Cup and European Super Cup before the start of their league campaign. Goals from new recruits Cesc Fabregas and Alexis Sanchez followed an opener from the promising Thiago Alcantara. Any hopes of a Villarreal comeback were snuffed out quickly after the break as Chile winger Sanchez used his pace to burst clear of the visiting defense and notch the third. -- Barcelona began the defense of their La Liga crown with a convincing 5-0 win over Villarreal in the Nou Camp Monday night.
