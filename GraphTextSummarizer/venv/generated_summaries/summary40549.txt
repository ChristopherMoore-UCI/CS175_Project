Rodman defiant in odd N. Korea defense Rodman to Cuomo: I don't give a s*** The last time we talked it was earlier this month while he was in Pyongyang for a basketball game on Kim's birthday. I am not looking to spar about his "friend," the much-maligned ruler of North Korea, or to debate the merits of basketball diplomacy in that country when I sit down to talk with him live Friday morning. Dennis can speak to an issue that is a bigger threat to our country than Kim Jong Un: addiction. I didn't intend to get into a joust with the former NBA star, but believe it or not, Rodman is the U.S. citizen with the most direct line to a dictator with nuclear weapons, and I needed to ask him some questions about the political nature of his trip. So I asked him about the plight of prisoner Kenneth Bae, and his antics made headlines.
