More recently, in September 2014, Lake Mary police said that a man claimed that Zimmerman threatened him during a road rage incident. George Zimmerman -- acquitted by a Florida jury over the death of Trayvon Martin -- was arrested in Florida on suspicion of aggravated assault and domestic violence with a weapon, local authorities said. In fact, it's his second arrest for alleged domestic violence against a girlfriend -- though Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett said this alleged "victim is not the same (woman) as in 2013. In April of that year, Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder, with an affidavit accusing him of profiling Martin and ignoring a police dispatcher's request that he wait for police. " Police first learned about it after coming "in contact with the (alleged) victim at a traffic stop" on Monday, Lake Mary police spokeswoman Bianca Gillett  said.
