The Death Penalty Information Center study found that death penalty costs can average $10 million more per year per state than life sentences. Florida, where two men have been put to death this year, spends an average of $24 million per execution. Kansas, New Hampshire and the U.S. military are the only jurisdictions that have death penalty laws but have not conducted any executions since 1976. Many death penalty proponents say part of the problem is that states have added unnecessary, time-consuming delays, and have been reluctant to carry out the death penalty that their own legislatures have enacted. That total is up from 37 for all of last year, but less than half of the high of 98, from 10 years ago.
