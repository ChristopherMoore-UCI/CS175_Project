Jenkins testified that she took Hernandez to a police station on June 18, 2013, and that he asked her to give Wallace money. The fianc√©e of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez said at a hearing Friday that she was asked to conceal a box and take it out of her Massachusetts home after the murder of Odin Lloyd in 2013. The prosecution has said Hernandez's high school sweetheart removed the weapon from their North Attleboro home after Lloyd was killed on June 17, 2013. Jenkins also told the jury that she met her fiance's two alleged accomplices in the killing of Lloyd and gave them $500 in cash as police were questioning Hernandez about the slaying. Hernandez, the ex-tight end who had a $40 million contract until he was charged with murder, has pleaded not guilty to orchestrating the death of Lloyd, a semi-pro football player.
