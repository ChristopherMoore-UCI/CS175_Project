Starting Thursday, Major League Baseball's opening day, contest winners Mike O'Hara and "wingman" Ryan Wagner will view the entire 2011 season in the brand-new "MLB Fan Cave," a Major League Baseball press release announced Wednesday. But this is not your average cave and the project has been under way since right after the World Series, MLB spokesperson Matt Bourne told CNN. "The MLB Fan Cave will give fans a creative new way to experience Major League Baseball," said Tim Brosnan, the Executive Vice President of Business for the MLB. In addition, these co-fanatics will spend their time, "chronicling their experiences and sharing their viewpoints on baseball and pop culture through Facebook, Twitter, a blog on MLB.com, custom videos and regular appearances on MLB Network," the release said. That means O'Hara and Wagner will view 2,430 regular season games, along with all post-season games, while stationed in front of three 60-inch TVs surrounded by a dozen 32-inch TVs, according to MLB.
