In the past three years, 10 babies in Kettleman City, California, have been born with birth defects, including cleft palates and heart problems. Now the residents of Kettleman City are fighting again, this time over a proposed waste site expansion, for which their local officials voted. The major concern for many people in Kettleman City, however, lies just four miles outside town. "We don't want an expansion because we feel like there are a lot of health problems in town and we're not necessarily attributing it to the dump, but we feel like with all of the other environmental factors we face, why add more to it?" In December, the Kings County board asked the state for a health investigation into the birth defects, but one week later they voted in favor of granting a permit to allow the waste site to expand. In a press release, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's office said he has "directed his State Department of Public Health and Environmental Protection Agency to expand their investigation into what could be causing an abnormal percentage of birth defects in the small farming town.
