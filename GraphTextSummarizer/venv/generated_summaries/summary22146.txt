Germany calls in U.S. ambassador over new spying allegation Germany investigating alleged U.S. surveillance of Merkel's phone India summons U.S. diplomat over report of NSA spying Germany and other friendly countries complained when Snowden's leaks last year revealed U.S. surveillance of foreign leaders as well as screening of foreign phone calls and Internet contacts in investigating terrorist ties. The German government said Thursday it is expelling a person it describes as the representative of U.S. foreign intelligence services based at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin. The call comes against the background of the current investigation by the federal prosecutor and questions that have remained unresolved for months about the activity of U.S. intelligence in Germany. Only last week, German prosecutors ordered the arrest of a German citizen on suspicion of spying for foreign intelligence agencies.
