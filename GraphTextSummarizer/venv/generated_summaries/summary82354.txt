"Tablets are a maturing market; there's not much competitors can do to differentiate at this point." said Sarah Rotman Epps, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. In what is becoming an annual rite of fall, tablet makers are rushing to release a fresh selection of devices this month in time for the competitive holiday-shopping season. But as rivals catch up to the once-dominant iPad and the marketplace gets flooded with new tablets, it's getting harder for competitors to set themselves apart. Let's start with market leader Apple, which is expected to unveil new iPads on Tuesday in San Francisco. At 1 p.m. ET, Apple CEO Tim Cook will take the stage in front of an auditorium of journalists and announce updated products with the help of some videos, other Apple executives and possibly a live product demonstration or two.
