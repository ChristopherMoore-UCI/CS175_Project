Some call for the Federal Communications Commission to pull Clear Channel's broadcast licenses if they keep Limbaugh on the air, because they believe that Rush Limbaugh does not "serve the public interest." Should the marketplace of ideas lose a stall because someone in it said some "naughty words?" Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote: "When men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas -- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. I realize that my work is difficult, and I may not even live to see Limbaugh's ideas repudiated. Free speech means tolerating views that you despise. -- I despise Rush Limbaugh.
