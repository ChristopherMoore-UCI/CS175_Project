Over the weekend, a total of 40 avalanches hit the area, said Bab Jan Hakimi, head of disaster response at the Afghan Red Crescent Society. CNN's Masoud Popalzai reported from Kabul, Afghanistan and journalist Naomi Ng wrote from Hong Kong. For almost a week, avalanches caused by heavy snowstorms have killed 196 people in the mountainous province of Panjshir, Afghanistan, officials said on Monday. Its residents are generally poor, earning their living as farmers, shepherds or operators of small businesses such as groceries. President Ashraf Ghani, who visited the area on Saturday, declared three days of mourning in Afghanistan for the victims.
