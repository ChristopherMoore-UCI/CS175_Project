Tanner was 95 and died of pneumonia, said Dick Darnall in a telephone interview. Tanner was also working with the ABC Orchestra, where for 16 years he played with the likes of Leonard Bernstein, Andre Previn and Arturo Toscanini, Darnall said. In addition to his wife and stepson, Tanner is survived by another stepson, Doug Darnall. His interests included early forms of electronic music, and he developed the Electro-Theremin in the 1950s, said Darnall. For the next few years, Tanner stayed in Hollywood, where he did studio work, Darnall said.
