Carraway Jr. saw the man walking toward him. While Richard and Carraway stood over Bedell, ensuring he was no longer a threat, Amos knew he had to make sure the shooter was working alone. Such an organization, the man said, "would use its powers to convert military, intelligence, and law enforcement bureacracies [sic] into instruments for political control and the domination and subjection of society, while discrediting, destroying, and murdering honest individuals within those services that work to root out corruption and faithfully serve their fellow citizens." Officer Colin Richards, who mans the booth with Carraway, looked up to see Bedell point his gun at his colleague and fire.
