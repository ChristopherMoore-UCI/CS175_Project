Last year, Microsoft made similar offers to developers that make apps trendy on other platforms. "We felt that with Windows Phone we had a greater chance of maintaining long-term differentiation," Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a former Microsoft executive, said at a conference in June. The premiere phone, which is codenamed Sea Ray and currently being field tested by company executives, will be Nokia's first to run Windows Phone 7, the year-old mobile operating system from Microsoft. A Nokia spokeswoman said the company offers app developers a variety of incentives, some in partnership with Microsoft, which include coding assistance and marketing. On Tuesday, Microsoft began distributing the new version of Windows Phone, which will run on the Nokia device.
