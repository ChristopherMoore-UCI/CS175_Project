Unemployment in the Elkhart-Goshen, Indiana, area was 15.3 percent in January, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported, the fourth highest of any U.S. metropolitan area. "Here in Elkhart, I've never seen things as bad as they are," lifelong resident Yvonne Sell said Tuesday. According to Sell and several other business owners and workers, it is. "I don't personally see how spending the amount of money [Congress is] talking about spending is going to stimulate the economy." Robert Dunlop runs a different kind of business, but he agrees with Sell. -- Surviving economically in downtrodden Elkhart, Indiana, may require doing some things you don't want to do.
