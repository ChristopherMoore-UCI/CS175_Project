"Senator Portman is a great friend and ally and the speaker respects his position, but the speaker continues to think that marriage is between a man and woman," said Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman. Gregory T. Angelo, executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, said in a statement "if there was any doubt that the conservative logjam on the issue of civil marriage for committed gay and lesbian couples has broken, Senator Portman's support for the freedom to marry has erased it." "(His) evolution on this issue highlights how personal it is for Americans -- whether they're the junior senator from Ohio or your next-door neighbor, all Americans have a gay friend, colleague or family member, and understand them to be as deserving as their straight counterparts of the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness that are the promise of the United States," Angelo continued. Top Republicans sign brief supporting same-sex marriage Hours after Portman announced that he had reversed his position on same-sex marriage, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said he would not second-guess him. One involves the federal the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman and was supported by Portman. Portman told CNN's Dana Bash that he wanted all of his children to experience the "joy and stability of marriage" that he and his wife have had for 26 years.
