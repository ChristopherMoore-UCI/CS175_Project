Her role as Sue Sylvester on the hit television series "Glee" has won her critical praise and accolades including a Screen Actor's Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award. If you missed her outrageous turn as a lesbian dog trainer in "Best in Show" or lampooning fellow funny lady Roseanne during a Comedy Central roast, you might have caught her as the voice of Calhoun in the recent Disney movie "Wreck-It Ralph." I'm glad there are kids living out there in not-so-friendly parts of the country who have "Glee" to watch. For her next adventure, Lynch moves from the screen to the page, hoping to entertain kids of all ages with the new holiday book "Elfbot." I think my work started to seem profound when I started making huge choices.
