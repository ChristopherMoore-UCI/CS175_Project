The tree Frank secretly admired through an attic window will be gone in five to 15 years, Anne Frank House officials say. The tree that reminded Frank of the promise of life still looms high above the courtyard behind the Anne Frank House, now a museum in Amsterdam, Netherlands, that just marked its 50th anniversary. Through a project and contest launched last year by the Anne Frank Center USA, a New York-based educational nonprofit working with the museum in Amsterdam, 11 sites in the United States will see Frank's tree blossom. The tree has been sick for 10 years; a fungus has left two-thirds of it hollow, said Anne Frank House spokeswoman Annemarie Bekker. Down South, a public school in Arkansas, the only in the nation to become a national historic site, will also see an Anne Frank tree bloom.
