And Galan stresses that European governments, not just Spain, should consider the impact of taxes on corporate cash flows and reinvestment. Galan, boss of Spain's largest energy company, said European governments are over-taxing the industry because they believe utility businesses are "too rich. Galan told CNN that today, less than 40% of the Iberdrola's business is dependent on the eurozone as the company diversifies its risk in other countries including the UK, U.S., Mexico and Brazil. -- High tax is hurting European competitiveness in the energy sector, according to Iberdrola chief executive Ignacio Galan. we are paying approximately 50% taxes when the American system is 10%." Spain -- where Iberdrola is headquartered -- is the eurozone's fourth-largest economy with unemployment at 26.1%, second only to Greece in the single currency bloc, according to Eurostat data.
