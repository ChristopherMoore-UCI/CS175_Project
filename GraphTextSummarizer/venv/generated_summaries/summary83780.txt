Moody and sinister, when Chuck Bass Types (CBTs) like you, it's as though you've been inducted into a secret society of two. Here are a few examples: Chuck Bass ("Gossip Girl"): Think of all the great TV twosomes we've seen over the years -- Lucy & Ricky Ricardo, Judy & George Jetson, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag ... but not all TV personalities set such a sincerely loving example. Don Draper ("Mad Men"): Why is it when unattractive people are quiet we just assume they're stupid and/or boring, but verbally challenged hot people get pegged as mysterious and smoldering? Hank Moody ("Californication"): Some boys take longer than usual to grow out of their Charles Bukowski-wannabe phase.
