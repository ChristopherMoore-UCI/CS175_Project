Alejandro Verges, regional director at the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety, said Thursday afternoon that officials are concerned there might be a third eruption. Authorities issued a red alert for the towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in southern Chile. The first eruption on Wednesday set off a bit of a panic in the region. About 23Â½ inches (60 centimeters) of ash fell in some places, according to the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety. The agency said it was evaluating the spectacular nighttime eruption, but indicated it was "stronger than the first one."
