-- Tropical Storm Gustav left 22 dead in Haiti and the Dominican Republic before it pulled away from the countries Wednesday, officials said. As of 11 p.m. Wednesday, Gustav's center was about 205 miles (330 km) west of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and 100 miles (161 km) south of Guantanamo, Cuba, according to the National Hurricane Center. Forecasters warned that Gustav, which was a Category 1 hurricane when it made landfall in Haiti on Tuesday, is likely to regain hurricane intensity by Friday. "Slow strengthening is forecast once Gustav moves away from Haiti, and the storm could regain hurricane strength within the next day or two," the hurricane center said.
