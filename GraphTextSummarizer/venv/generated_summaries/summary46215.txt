The magic of Katy Perry, by contrast, is that she'll show up to perform in a shiny blue wig with Bettie Page bangs wearing oversize spinning lollipops pinned to her breasts ... and damned if she still doesn't look like the girl next door. In the thrilling 3-D concert film "Katy Perry: Part of Me," there are a lot of things to love about Perry, from her sweetly sexy and pert beauty to her full-throated voice to the outrageous hookiness of songs like ''Teenage Dream'' and ''Last Friday Night'' (to me, her greatest track). The film also documents the breakup of her marriage to Russell Brand, and though it's glimpsed from the sidelines, Perry's despair is on full display.
