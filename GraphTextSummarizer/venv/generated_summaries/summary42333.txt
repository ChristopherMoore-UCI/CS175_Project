A police official initially told CNN the owner was suspected of attempted rape, but Agra District Police Chief Subhash Dubey later said the woman was complaining only of harassment. Doctors say the woman, traveling alone in Agra, might have ligament injuries but no fracture from her balcony-to-balcony escape, according to Dubey. The man has denied any intention to assault the woman, Dubey told CNN. Police said the men confessed to the crime, which allegedly took place in central India at a camping area near a forest in Datia district. The woman locked the door of her room when the owner, Sachin Chauhan, offered her what he said was a preplanned massage, Dubey said.
