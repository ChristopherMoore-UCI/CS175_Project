-- Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi began a year of community service for his conviction on tax fraud charges on Friday when he showed up at a senior center near his hometown, Milan. Last month, a Milan court ruled that Berlusconi could be assigned to social work at the elderly center as an alternative to house arrest. The former premier is expected to work with 20 residents with Alzheimer's disease in the home, run by the Sacred Family Foundation, Fondazione Sacra Famiglia, in Cesano Boscone outside Milan. Berlusconi continues to protest his innocence and says he has been persecuted by leftist magistrates. He was handed a four-year sentence last August -- commuted to a year -- for tax fraud at Mediaset, the large commercial broadcaster that Berlusconi founded.
