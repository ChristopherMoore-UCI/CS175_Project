-- Stolen medical files that may be those of Michael Schumacher are being offered for sale, Manager Sabine Kehm said the documents had been offered for sale for several days. " Medical files are confidential, and it is forbidden to buy or publish such data, Kehm said. " A spokesman for the German newspaper Bild, Tobias Frolich, told CNN that the tabloid was among a number of media outlets to be offered Schumacher's alleged medical records, but that "the editorial office decided to reject the offer." Schumacher has been undergoing hospital treatment since a skiing accident last year but is now out of a coma.
