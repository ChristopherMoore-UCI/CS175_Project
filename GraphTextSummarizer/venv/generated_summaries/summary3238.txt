Twenty-eight years and more than 12,000 participants later, the MDS has grown to become a major endurance event whose model has been copied by several other races. 'Crème de la crème' Yet despite such hostile conditions, the race's popularity is growing every year; due to high interest, competitors have to apply to enter MDS several years in advance. It may sound like insanity, but it's exactly what daring men and women of all ages have chosen to do by taking part in this year's iconic Marathon des Sables (MDS). Over the years, a diverse caravan of novice runners, amateur athletes, enthusiastic 16-year-olds, spry septuagenarians and even visually impaired and partially paralyzed people have all converged on the MDS to test their limits, mark an occasion or escape briefly from their regular lives. "It's the toughest race I've ever done," says British ultra-running champion Jen Salter, who's competed at the MDS four times so far.
