The contract seeks to prevent posts that "spread rumors, disrupt social order, or destroy social stability." -- Users of Sina Weibo, China's popular Twitter-like micro-blogging service, now have to abide by new rules aimed at preventing online rumors and other controversial posts. The new rules also seek to stop the use of code words or other expressions often employed by Chinese web users to refer to controversial people or events. "I think Sina are trying to be proactive and clean up the site and show the government they are taking steps to stop people from spreading false information or other posts that create trouble," he said. Doug Young, a Chinese media expert from Fudan University in Shanghai, said the steps are intended to ease Beijing's concerns about the spreading of false rumors.
