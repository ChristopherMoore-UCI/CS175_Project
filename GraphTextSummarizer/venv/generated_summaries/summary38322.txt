Last month she criticized another famous Venezuelan music star, conductor Gustavo Dudamel of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, and younger conductor Christian Vazquez for performing in Venezuela while the protests raged on the streets. -- Venezuelan pianist Gabriela Montero dedicated part of a London concert to those confronting the government in Venezuela, saying she felt "our sadness, our impotence, our frustration". Fighting back tears, the 40-year-old virtuoso, who is a noted critic of the collectivist policies of President Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez, improvised a piano piece which she said was her interpretation of the struggle in Venezuela of anti-government activists. She played at the inauguration of President Barack Obama in 2009 and now lives in the U.S. During a break in her concert, after taking requests from the audience and improvising on them, Montero told the audience Venezuela was facing a "very, very critical time". The audience was mainly English but dotted with Venezuelan flags and a smattering of her compatriots in caps and T-shirts in the starred yellow, blue and red colors of the Venezuelan flag.
