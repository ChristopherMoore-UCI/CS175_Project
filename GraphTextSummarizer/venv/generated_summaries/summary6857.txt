The families of employees at U.S. consulates in Tijuana, Nogales, Ciudad Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Monterrey and Matamoros are allowed to leave for 30 days "in response to an increase in violence along the Mexican side of its border with the U.S.," State Department spokesman Fred Lash told CNN. Authorities believe assassins targeted a pregnant woman and two other people connected with a U.S. consulate who were killed in drive-by shootings over the weekend, Ciudad Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Monday. The announcement was part of a warning to U.S. citizens regarding travel to Mexico. "During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area." Reyes, who received a death threat last week, said the shootings highlight a problem shared by both countries along their 2,000-mile border. The child has been turned over to U.S. consular officials, Reyes said.
