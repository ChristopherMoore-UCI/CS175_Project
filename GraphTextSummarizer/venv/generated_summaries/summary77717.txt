-- A state election board on Monday will announce Democrat Al Franken has defeated Republican incumbent Norm Coleman in Minnesota's U.S. Senate race, state officials told CNN Sunday. " "The effort by the Franken campaign, supported by the secretary of state, to exclude improperly rejected absentee ballots is indefensible and disenfranchises hundreds of Minnesota voters," Sheehan said. A board will say Al Franken won the U.S. Senate race by 225 votes, Minnesota's secretary of state says. During the recount, Franken's campaign alleged that thousands of absentee ballots had been improperly rejected and asked that they be counted. " Schumer also said it is "crucial" Minnesota's second seat in the Senate not go empty, implying Franken should be seated when the rest of the Senate convenes to be sworn in Tuesday.
