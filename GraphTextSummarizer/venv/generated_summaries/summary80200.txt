His love of the sea and ecology inspired Harvey to found the Guy Harvey Research Institute in 1999 which provides scientific information about fish protection and biodiversity. Ernest Hemmingway's novella, "The Old Man and the Sea" inspired Harvey's obsession with game fish and moved him to depict the famous fishing story in a series of pen and ink drawings a quarter of a century ago. Harvey also created a TV series, "Portraits of the Deep," to showcase game fish and their importance to the environment. -- Whether he's out on the ocean monitoring stingrays in the Caribbean, or back on land painting in his studio, Guy Harvey spends all his time surrounded by fish. Harvey fears other fish are at risk too.
