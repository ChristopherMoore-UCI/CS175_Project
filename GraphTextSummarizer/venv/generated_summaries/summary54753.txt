"Fajardo said his strategy was, for the first time, to put a lot of investment towards the most deprived areas," says Italian architect Francesco Orsini. The regeneration began under former mayor Sergio Fajardo, who pioneered a theory known as "urban acupuncture" from 2003, which focused on reclaiming areas from the cartels through strategic projects. As the city looks to its future, the hillside communities, together with the majority of the city's young people, are obvious areas of economic expansion. "It's a great opportunity to show the city we are building," says mayor Anibal Gaviria. Yet there is an undeniable sense of optimism and pride that the city seems to be on the right path through a commitment to innovation.
