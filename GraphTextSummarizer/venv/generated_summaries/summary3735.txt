There was no indication the tension was abating by Wednesday night, when the Internet appeared out and gunfire could be heard around the capital -- though it could not immediately be discerned where police or armed activists were responsible. Civic unrest over a spike in gas prices roiled Sudan for a fourth straight day Wednesday, with gunshots ringing out around the capital of Kharthoum and elsewhere as government forces tried to clamp down. Witnesses said some of these outbursts of public sentiment were accompanied by violence and destruction, including attacks on gas stations, damaging of buses and looting of stores.
