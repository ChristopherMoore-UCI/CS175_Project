"It basically looks like all pro-Kurdish media... have been targeted in this operation," said Emma Sinclair-Webb, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, who spent the morning watching police search the Istanbul office of the pro-Kurdish newspaper Ozgur Gundem. In a move that alarmed human rights organizations, journalists' associations and press freedom activists, police swept up a number of journalists in the raids. "These pressures and attacks on journalists and media organizations increase fear and the heavy climate of auto-censorship, while also putting Turkey in a second-class category internationally." "This ongoing clampdown is all about using terrorism laws very widely and indiscriminately against people who are not terrorists," said Sinclair-Webb of Human Rights Watch. Hours after the arrests, hundreds of Turkish journalists took to the streets in Istanbul, conducting a hastily organized protest march down the city's main pedestrian thoroughfare. "Thirty-eight colleagues have been detained," announced the Freedom for Journalists Platform, an umbrella group that represents dozens of Turkish journalist associations and unions.
