Panda birth in Washington: 'We are thrilled' The 4-ounce baby, the second offspring of Mei Xiang (pronounced may-SHONG), is believed to be the first birth in this city that wasn't used by politicians as a grim reminder of the future cost of college tuition, or by government actuaries to recalculate the pending bankruptcy of the Social Security trust fund. "She's such a fantastic mother," said panda keeper Nicole MacCorkle. Pandas are tri-racial (being both black and white and Asian in origin), non-denominational, and non-partisan, evoking neither the size of Republican elephants nor the temperament of Democratic donkeys. And hope that uptick in stuffed panda bears bring us out of our national doldrums. The zookeeper, listening to a monitor, "heard the vocalizations of the cub," Brandie Smith, a senior curator at the zoo told reporters Monday.
