A body was found in an exterior stairwell of the hospital, and the San Francisco medical examiner confirmed Thursday that it is Spalding, also known as Lynne Ford. When Lynne Spalding went missing from San Francisco General Hospital, her friends frantically searched and left messages on a Facebook page to keep each other hopeful. "Someone has died in a mysterious fashion at San Francisco General Hospital, an institution which is known for healing," Perry said. CNN's Lateef Mungin wrote and reported from Atlanta, and Dan Simon reported from San Francisco. Hospital officials and police say they are investigating.
