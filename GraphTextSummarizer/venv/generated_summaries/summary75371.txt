-- Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Janet Yellen has emerged as the leading candidate to replace Ben Bernanke as Fed chairman, a White House official tells CNN's Athena Jones. She has the support of a number of Democrats on Capitol Hill as well as many fellow economists. Bernanke's term ends in January and Obama plans to select a successor this fall. He was a key economic adviser during the president's first term and is a former treasury secretary. This comes after Larry Summers, after months of contentious debate, withdrew his name from consideration to head the central bank over the weekend in a process that some say has become unusually politicized.
