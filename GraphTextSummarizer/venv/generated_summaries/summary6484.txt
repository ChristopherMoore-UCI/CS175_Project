Of course, one could argue that the idea of balancing work with life may be harder for men than for women, who are the traditional breadwinners and the ones more likely to find self-worth through their work. The letter, which he said he wrote in part because, "so many people struggle to strike the right balance between work and personal life," has been held up as a manifesto for the "work/life balance" ideal that's become something of the new American dream. What does it say to all those women to whom we say that, with a little "leaning in" or "playing big" they don't have to choose between work and life? Similarly, a survey of Harvard Business School grads found that the pressure women put on themselves to balance work and family is causing them significant stress.
