The former world No. 1, who has won the other three grand slam titles, is among the favorites following the earlier exits of top seeds Caroline Wozniacki and Kim Clijsters. Australian Open runner-up Li equaled her best performance in Paris, in 2009, by beating Romania's Sorana Cirstea 6-2 6-2, while ninth seed Kvitova defeated American Vania King 6-4 6-2. The winner of their match will face either Russian 25th seed Maria Kirilenko, who had no problems in ending the run of Clijsters' young Dutch conqueror Arantxa Crus, or Germany's Andrea Petkovic. Petkovic, seeded 15th, overcame Australian No. 24 Jarmila Gajdosova 6-2 4-6 6-3 to reach the fourth round for a third successive grand slam event, having lost in the quarterfinals of this year's Australian Open. Fourth seed Victoria Azarenka is one of Sharapova's main threats to the title, and the Belarusian moved into the last 16 with a comfortable 6-3 6-2 win over Italy's Roberta Vinci.
