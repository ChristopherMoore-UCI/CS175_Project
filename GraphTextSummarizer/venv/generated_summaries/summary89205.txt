Speaking as a Washington state resident -- and not as government geologist -- Haugerud said reforms may be needed to ensure local officials impose stricter regulations in landslide zones. Though a state ordinance asks counties to map landslide hazards, it has not been translated into zoning restrictions, according to Miller. "This is a valley lined with landslides, going back 14,000 years when the glaciers left," Haugerud said. "I currently have no basis for estimating the probable rate or timing of future landslide activity," Miller's study states. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers spokeswoman Patricia Graesser said the study spoke to how people were living in the landslide area but the report wasn't a risk assessment of landslide hazards.
