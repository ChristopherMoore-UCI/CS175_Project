-- China's ambassador to Japan is rejecting Tokyo's protest over the patrol of Chinese navy ships near a group of islands disputed by Japan, China and Taiwan. Japan repels Taiwan activists near disputed islands China countered that it has been conducting regular patrols in Chinese waters and asked Japan not to interfere. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. China was outraged, as were protesters who marched through several Chinese cities calling for boycotts of Japanese products and urging the government to give the islands back. "We think the top priority for now is for Japan to stop all provocative actions it has been doing as sending ships and flights into Diaoyu islands sea and air space," Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said, referring to the disputed islands.
