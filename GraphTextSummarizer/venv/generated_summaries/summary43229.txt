I feel 10 feet tall." Vulliamy is the youngest of three children of Hughes and her late husband John Vulliamy and it was obvious from a young age she had inherited her mother's talent for words and pictures. Shirley Hughes will appear with Clara and her two sons Ed and Tom Vulliamy in a talk called "Keeping it in the Family" at Oxford Literary Festival on March 16. Now the mother-daughter team have collaborated for the first time on a new series called "Dixie O'Day", written by Hughes and illustrated by Vulliamy, with the first book to be published in September 2013. Undaunted by the success of her mother Shirley Hughes, whose creations include Dogger and the Alfie series, Vulliamy has followed her lead. But two weeks after her first child Jack, now 21, was born, Vulliamy began her new career as an author and wrote her first book, "Ellen and Penguin."
