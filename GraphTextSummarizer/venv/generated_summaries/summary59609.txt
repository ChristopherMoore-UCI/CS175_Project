The ex-wife of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra returned to Bangkok Friday to visit her ailing mother, a source close to the family told CNN. Pojaman Shinawatra, 51, and Thaksin went into exile in July, after a court sentenced her to three years imprisonment for tax evasion. Although Thaksin was removed from power in a coup in 2006, protesters have accused successive governments and the People Power Party (PPP) of serving as proxies for Thaksin. Anti-government demonstrators who closed down Bangkok's main airport for a week want Thaksin extradited and tried on the corruption charges. Thailand has been steeped in political turmoil since Thaksin was ousted in a 2006 coup and left the country.
