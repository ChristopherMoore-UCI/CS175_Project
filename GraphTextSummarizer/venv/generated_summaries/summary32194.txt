The way to calculate the date of Easter was determined at a meeting of church bishops and others called the Council of Nicea in 325  near Constantinople in what is now modern day Turkey. The 40 days of Lent are a time to remember and imitate the life and ministry of Jesus as Christians prepare to commemorate his death and resurrection at Easter. The Sundays during Lent are not prescribed days of fasting and abstinence, so meat is permitted. It closes with evening prayer on Easter Sunday. Starting on Ash Wednesday, more than 1 billion Christians around the world will enter the season of Lent, a time of solemn spiritual preparation for Easter, the culmination of the church's calendar.
