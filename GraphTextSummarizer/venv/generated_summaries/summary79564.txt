"The purpose of this review is not to establish culpability of individual band members in this particular case, but rather to determine whether there are patterns of behavior by the band -- or members of it -- that should be addressed at the institutional level," he said.

Though band members must sign an anti-hazing agreement, the practice continues, Fabre said.
