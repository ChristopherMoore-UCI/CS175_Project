In the case of close races, CNN will wait for actual votes to be tabulated and reported. Shortly after poll closing time, CNN may make projections using models that combine exit polls and actual votes. What a projection call means CNN analysts will make all projections for CNN broadcasts. Projections from exit polls also take into account the consistency between exit poll results and pre-election polls. In races that do not appear to be very close, projections may be made at poll closing time based entirely on exit poll results, which are the only information available when the polls close about how people voted.
