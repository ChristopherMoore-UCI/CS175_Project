"We started in business 10 years ago focusing on French chateaus initially, but launched Oliver's Travels in November, the focus being on more quirky and unique properties," says Oliver's Travels co-founder Oliver Bell. " The description provided by luxury travel company Oliver's Travels of its latest offering couldn't be more frank. From the artist's impression, there's an element of a Bond villain lair to the submarine, akin to the Atlantis home of the character Karl Stromberg, the villain in "The Spy Who Loved Me." "To me, it looks really, really cool but you can have it to whatever taste you like," Bell says. As part of the service, you choose how to deck out the submarine -- which is currently hired by a variety of different businesses for quirky brand launches -- exactly as you like from bedroom to bathroom, and bar to ballroom. Bell has yet to visit the submarine in question but, because of the increasing interest, he's planning a trip to the Caribbean to find out what's in store and how his customers can find love on the ocean floor.
