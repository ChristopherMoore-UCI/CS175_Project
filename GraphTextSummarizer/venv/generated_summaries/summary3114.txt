In January 2010, St. Petersburg police once again issued a missing person report for Mee. " St. Petersburg police described Griffin, who had no criminal record, as somewhat of a "social introvert" who lived with a cousin and was often on the computer. The victim "friended" Mee on a social networking site last week and the two exchanged messages in subsequent days, according to St. Petersburg, Florida, police. After telling family members around 10 p.m. that he was heading out to meet a woman, Griffin rode his scooter to a vacant home where he had his first face-to-face encounter with Mee, police said. Mee led Griffin around to the back, where Raiford and Newton were armed and waiting, according to police.
