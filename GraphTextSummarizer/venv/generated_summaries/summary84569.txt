-- Jose Mourinho has completed his widely-expected return to Chelsea after the English Premier League club ended weeks of speculation by confirming Monday that the former Real Madrid coach has agreed a four-year contract. After leaving Chelsea in 2007, it was not until 2010 that Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge as a visiting coach, winning a Champions League quarterfinal 1-0 in March 2010 to seal a 3-1 aggregate win for an Inter Milan side who would go on to lift that year's trophy. The Spaniard also took Chelsea to success in the Europa League, with the club having dropped to the second-tier competition after becoming the first Champions League winner to fail at the group stage the following season. He was unable to take Chelsea to the Champions League final, but guided the club to two successive EPL titles -- its first English championship successes since 1955. " His return to Chelsea was one of the worst-kept secrets in world football -- the English Premier League jumped the gun by announcing his reappointment Sunday before a deal has been done.
