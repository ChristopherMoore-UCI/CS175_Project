There are ongoing efforts by cognitive science laboratories and companies to develop cognitive assessment and brain training software that will function on mobile phones and tablets. This "noise in the system" erodes our performance on a wide spectrum of cognitive activities, including the ability to recall details in our lives. Cognitive control is our ability to focus on accomplishing a task in the context of competing demands. In addition, we might be able to play immersive apps that incorporate the best video game mechanics into brain training programs to enhance cognition, perhaps allowing people to correct neural deficiencies and even delay the development of dementia. This real-time data will be more powerful than what we currently obtain by using questionnaires and cognitive snapshots during stressful visits to the doctor's office.
