"The IRS acknowledges that it does not know the exact number of identity theft incidents or the number of taxpayers affected by identity theft," George said. It has also issued special personal identification numbers, or PINs, to identity theft victims when they are filing future returns. -- Criminals who file fraudulent tax returns by stealing people's identities could rake in an estimated $26 billion over the next five years because the IRS cannot keep up with the amount of the fraud, Treasury Inspector General J. Russell George said Tuesday. George said more should be done to ensure that fraudulent tax returns are not deposited into bank accounts. His projection of $26 billion is larger than any other estimate of identity theft tax fraud.
