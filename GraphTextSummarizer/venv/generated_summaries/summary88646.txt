Federal funding for state programs Obama's proposal would give states a huge break -- with the federal government picking up three-quarters of the cost of waiving community college tuition for the first two years, and leaving states to fund the rest. And Obama's focus on community colleges was also a welcome message, just one of the many steps the administration has taken to address college access and affordability, Asher said. Asked whether he would support Obama's proposal, Corker said "Oh no, no, no, no, no," instead urging other states to take the president's initiative, and do something similar themselves rather than create "a whole new bureaucratic federal program." Sen. Alexander, chairman of the Senate's education committee and the former education secretary, echoed that in a statement on Friday saying states should follow Tennessee's lead. For those willing to do the work and for states and local communities who want to be a part of it, it could be a game changer," Obama said. His plan is to partner with states and fund the first two years of community college for Americans "willing to work for it."
