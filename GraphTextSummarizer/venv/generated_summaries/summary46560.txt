If you didn't play the first game, "Portal 2" does start with some basic puzzles to help you understand how the game's physics, mechanics and portals work. The gun fires two types of portals that allow the player to get to hard-to-reach places. A white gel can be used to cover walls or floors that normally can't be used as portals, allowing one to be created. Steam, the online gaming platform, is supported on the PlayStation 3 as well as PC and Mac computers, so players on those platforms also can play co-op with one another. There are puzzles that will require one, two or all three gels to complete.
