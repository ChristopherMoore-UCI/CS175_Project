Since that time, both scientists and medical researchers have studied the remains to better understand how King Richard III lived and died. Leicester to be final burial place of Richard III "Richard's injuries represent a sustained attack or an attack by several assailants with weapons from the later medieval period," said Professor Sarah Hainsworth, one of the authors of the study. "We believe that this corresponds to contemporary accounts of Richard III being slung over the back of the horse to be taken back to Leicester after the Battle of Bosworth, as this would give someone the correct body position to inflict this injury." There were nine injuries to the skull in total and two elsewhere on the skeleton. Richard III was the last English king to lose his life on the battlefield.
