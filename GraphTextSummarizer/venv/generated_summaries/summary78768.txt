Several senior House Republican congressional aides acknowledge the political climate has shifted some since the House last considered ENDA in 2007, but they also believe most House GOP members would oppose it now. Little pressure on House GOP But House districts were redrawn in 2010 to make them more solidly red or blue so there are fewer "swing" districts like those Dent and Hanna represent, reducing leverage for supporters. "As far as specific House races are concerned, I can't see it being a main issue," one of the House GOP sources said in predicting that the issue "will kind of fade by Friday" without any real push by members for a vote. By tucking the measure into a must-pass bill that House Republicans support, any effort to oppose ENDA would mean adopting an amendment to strip it out. Dent believes outside advocates need to do some legwork to educate House Republicans, many of whom didn't serve in Congress the last time the issue came up for a vote.
