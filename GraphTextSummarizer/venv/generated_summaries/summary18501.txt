We had a number of provisions in the Senate bill to make sure that was not the case," said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. -- House and Senate negotiators Monday announced an agreement on a giant $662 billion defense authorization bill, including modifications to its detainee language they hope will address White House concerns about that section and avoid a possible veto by President Barack Obama. "We took significant steps to address the administration's concerns in those areas," said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee. "We felt there was ample assurance in the Senate bill that there would be no interference with civilian interrogations and investigations. We feel like we were able to satisfy, we hope, most of their concerns," said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.
