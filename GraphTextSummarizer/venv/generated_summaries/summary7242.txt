The curator of the show, David Worthington, says this is the way art can add to the environmental debate -- even without straightforward messages. "We can affect people's consciousness about environment on intellectual level, through campaigns and information," he says and points out environmental groups around the world. Called "Pertaining to Things Natural" the show at London's Chelsea Physic Garden puts together art pieces that respond to the environment and the current ecological debates. From the pioneer Friedensreich Hundertwasser, who designed underground highways lined by trees and rooftop gardens, to sculptures made of recycled materials, creative souls have long tried to send out the environmental message. The next big thing of environmental campaigning?
