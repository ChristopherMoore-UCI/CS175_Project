The first is an action sequence that occurs mid-way in the film, when Wolverine is being pursued on top of a bullet train. Based on Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's much-loved 1982 comic-book arc, The Wolverine is an existential (and at times soddenly heavy) story about our razor-taloned hero grappling with the burden of immortality and loss.
