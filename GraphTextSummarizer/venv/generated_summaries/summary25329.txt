-- A peacock that had escaped from the Central Park Zoo returned home on its own Wednesday morning, the Wildlife Conservation Society told CNN. The bird made its way to a Fifth Avenue apartment building near the park and perched on a third-floor windowsill, but it wasn't there on Wednesday morning. "We have recovered the peacock as anticipated this morning when it flew home at sunrise back into the Central Park Zoo," Zoo Director Jeff Sailer said. " The peacock wandered from the zoo in Manhattan on Tuesday, said Mary Dixon, society spokeswoman. Zoo officials did not say how the bird escaped or what type of enclosure he was in.
