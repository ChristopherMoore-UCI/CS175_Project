Galaxies formed more and more stars over time until about 10 billion years ago, when star formation rates began to decrease. Star formation Besides breaking the distance record, astronomers find the new galaxy exciting because it appears to produce stars at an unusually high rate, said lead study author Steven Finkelstein, assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin. Scientists established through previous research that in the first billion years of the universe's history, typical rate of star formation went up, Finkelstein said. The z8_GND_5296 galaxy converts hydrogen in the amount of 300 times the mass of our sun into new stars each year. By contrast, the Milky Way only produces stars at one or two solar masses per year.
