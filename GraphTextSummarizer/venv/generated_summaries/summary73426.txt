Al Jazeera journalists charged by Egyptian authorities, network says International media demand that Egypt release detained journalists Journalists Ian Lee and Heba Fahmy reported from Cairo. Correspondent Peter Greste, producer Mohamed Fahmy and producer Baher Mohamed were allowed outside a caged dock to address the court in a hearing Monday, each taking the opportunity to deny allegations that they were affiliated with the banned Islamist group Muslim Brotherhood. Human rights groups have criticized the trial, saying the arrests indicate authorities in Egypt are stifling dissent and freedom of the press. Fahmy told the court that he and his colleagues worked in public rather than in secrecy, and covered Egypt as they would other countries. The Egyptian government says they distorted their coverage in favor of ousted President Mohamed Morsy and the Muslim Brotherhood.
