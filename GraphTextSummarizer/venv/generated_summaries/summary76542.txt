-- Thousands of protesters rallied Saturday on a New York street where Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer put him in a chokehold, sparking national outrage just weeks before Michael Brown was shot to death by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The cause of Garner's death was "compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police," said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. Demonstrators carried signs with messages such as "Justice for Eric Garner," "Black Lives Matter" and "Hold Killer Cops Accountable." The marchers included members of New York labor unions and local politicians. Too many victims." Former New York Gov. David Paterson told demonstrators: "We will not stop until somebody goes to jail."
