Soon after, Greece's Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou announced tough cost-cutting measures to meet European Union and International Monetary Fund conditions on the deal. The package includes a promise by Greece to cut its budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product, as required by European Union rules, by 2014, according to Papaconstantinou. Greece had a choice between "destruction" and saving the country, and "we have chosen of course to save the country," Papaconstantinou said. -- Greek journalists walked off the job Thursday to protest tough government austerity measures. The reporters are specifically protesting reforms to the country's social security system as called for in the austerity package the government has put together to pull Greece out of debt.
