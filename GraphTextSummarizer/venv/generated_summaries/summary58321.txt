CNN -- Singer Paul McCartney and Michael Jackson "kind of drifted apart," but there was "no big bust-up" after Jackson bought the Beatles song catalog, McCartney told David Letterman Wednesday. The set included such Beatles and McCartney solo classics as "Get Back," "Band on the Run," "Helter Skelter" and "Back in the USSR." McCartney appeared on "The Late Show with David Letterman" to talk about his forthcoming concert at New York's Citi Field, the Beatles' 1964 appearance on "The Ed Sullivan Show" -- taped in the same theater -- and his relationship with Jackson. McCartney said the pair "fell apart" after Jackson secured rights to the Beatles catalog in 1985. McCartney's appearance on Letterman marked the first time he'd returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater for a broadcast network show since the Beatles made their stateside debut there in 1964.
