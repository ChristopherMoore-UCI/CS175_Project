But starting life anew has been that much tougher for Eman al-Obeidi, the woman who came to embody the cruelty of Moammar Gadhafi's regime in the midst of Libya's brutal civil war. She just wishes Gadhafi had met proper justice. If and when she returns home, it will be to a Libya without Gadhafi. She screamed that she had been taken from a checkpoint and held against her will for two days while being beaten and raped by 15 of Gadhafi's militiamen. She lives every day with the scars of the rape she alleges was committed by Gadhafi's thugs.
