Al-Shabaab has been waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia law. Al-Shabaab, a Somali militant group allied with al Qaeda, posted a statement on its website identifying the suicide bomber as Abdullahi Ahmed, a Somali-American from Minneapolis. -- One of two suicide bombers responsible for killing two African Union soldiers in Somalia was from Minnesota, the FBI announced Thursday. In recent years, approximately 20 young men have traveled from the Minneapolis area to Somalia to train with al-Shabaab, and a number of them have gone on to fight with the terrorist organization, U.S. officials said. Fingerprints showed that Farah Mohamed Beledi, 27, from Minneapolis-St. Paul, was one of the attackers, the FBI's Minneapolis field office said in a statement.
