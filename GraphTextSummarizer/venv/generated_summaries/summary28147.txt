A Florida medical examiner is working to determine exactly what caused the death of the adult and three children, who are believed to be two 6-year-olds and a 3-year-old toddler, Tallahassee police spokesman David McCranie said. McCranie said police found the bodies in a home in a "typical suburban Tallahassee neighborhood." "I really don't believe it, that I'm not going to see those little girls running around, up and down the street anymore," neighbor Darius Mount told CNN Tallahassee affiliate WCTV. -- Four people, including three children, were found dead inside a home in a peaceful, family-oriented northwest Florida neighborhood Saturday, police said. McCranie said that police are not yet identifying the relationship between the dead.
