The message has all the hallmarks of classic al Qaeda rhetoric, and experts believe the blood-soaked men wielding cleavers for the cameras in London are just the latest proponents of the "open-source jihad" that seems to have grown just as the U.S.-led "War on Terror" scattered the organization's terror cells around the world. The only thing more horrifying than the murder of a British soldier in a London street is the fear that there is little police can do in the age of "open-source jihad" to prevent these types of terror attacks. Yates says in order to prevent future attacks, counter-terrorism police must bolster their community engagement strategy -- making local people feel "free and able to provide relevant information at the right time. So this is the growing struggle facing police forces around the world today, say experts -- not more traditional terror cells, which are more likely to show up through traditional surveillance methods, but self-starters who become radicalized through online sermons and publications. "Nearly a decade ago there was a debate within al Qaeda about the future of the organization," according to Shiraz Maher, Head of Outreach at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation.
