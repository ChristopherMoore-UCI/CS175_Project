NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged Friday that "it's been a tough year" for him and his league after months' worth of news about everything from allegedly abusive players to ongoing concerns about concussions to deflated footballs. But the Patriots have fired back, with coach Bill Belichick denying wrongdoing and suggesting science could explain the air pressure issue and owner Bob Kraft suggesting the NFL may owe Belichick and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady an apology if its investigation finds no wrongdoing. On Friday, Goodell touched on a number of subjects, from instant replay to extra points to a possible franchise in Los Angeles. For the first time, the commissioner also addressed what's been dubbed Deflategate, which relates to the use of underinflated footballs in the first half of the New England Patriots' AFC Championship win over the Indianapolis Colts. But he couldn't get away from issues that have dogged his office -- chief among them how the NFL handles allegations of domestic violence by players.
