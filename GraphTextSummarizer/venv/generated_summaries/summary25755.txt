Fitted with a new pair of hearing aids for the first time in years, Chapman was sitting in a car with his close friends and remembers the moment vividly: "I was blown away by the beauty of it. " Now Chapman is blogging about his experience on his film website, ArtoftheStory.com, and on the social news site Reddit in a post entitled "I can hear music for the first time ever, what should I listen to? At one point of the song, it sounded like angels singing, and I suddenly realized that this was the first time I was able to appreciate music. Until this summer, Chapman, a 23-year-old filmmaker, was able to hear only a distorted version of music in the form of bass and mid-tones through his old hearing aids. " More than 14,000 responses came, with people sharing their favorite songs and recommending all kinds of melodies for Chapman to experience for the first time.
