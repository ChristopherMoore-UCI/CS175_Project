Los Zetas got their start as enforcers for one of Mexico's oldest drug trafficking groups, the Gulf Cartel, which traces its roots to the 1930s, said University of Texas-El Paso anthropology professor Howard Campbell, who has written extensively on drug trafficking. More violent prospects include the Sinaloa and Gulf cartels attacking Los Zetas in Northern Mexico in a bid to control Nuevo Laredo, "the crown jewel for cross-border flows for goods, services, guns, money, drugs and illegal aliens," Grayson said. " Where other cartels, including the rival Sinaloa Cartel, took part in a "patronage network," paying police and government officials for their assistance in illicit enterprise, Los Zetas preferred brutal takedowns of entire towns and regions, Campbell said. "This is probably the beginning of the end of the Zetas as a coherent, cohesive organization," said Alejandro Hope, a former executive for Mexico's civilian intelligence agency who now serves as security policy director for the Mexico Competitiveness Institute, a Mexico City think tank. Los Zetas revolutionized Mexican drug trafficking with their brutality, and that unprecedented level of savagery could mean the end of the cartel's nightmarish reign.
