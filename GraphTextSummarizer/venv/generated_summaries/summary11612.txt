Toyota recalled millions of cars in 2009-10, after years of doing little beyond changing floor mats in response to complaints to federal auto safety regulators about acceleration problems in popular models. Experts: Translated Toyota memo shows acceleration concern CNN Money's Chris Isidore contributed to this report. -- The Justice Department is set to announce as soon as Wednesday a billion-dollar agreement with Toyota to settle a federal probe of the automaker's handling of customer complaints related to unintended acceleration, people familiar with the deal said. Top company executives came under fire in two congressional hearings during that time in which lawmakers accused Toyota of not doing enough to respond to safety concerns. The Toyota agreement comes with Bharara's office just starting to look into a safety issue at General Motors.
