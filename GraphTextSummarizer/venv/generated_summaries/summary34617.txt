Some of the victims said they had consumed only one or two beverages before becoming ill, Cle Elum-Roslyn Police Chief Scott Ferguson said. -- Young women at a party attended by about 50 Central Washington University students and other young people were the primary target of spiked drinks, authorities said Saturday. Ferguson would not comment on the type of drug placed in the beverages. Friends of the victim told authorities to go to a residence in Roslyn, according to a statement from the Cle Elum Police Department. "Whatever occurred up there wasn't consensual," Ferguson told CNN.
