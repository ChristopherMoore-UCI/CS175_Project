-- A special court set up by Afghan President Hamid Karzai that had been prosecuting alleged electoral fraud by 62 parliament members has been dissolved, a presidential spokesman announced Wednesday. Karzai said in a written statement that the country's electoral commission has final say over election outcomes, noting that Afghan courts cannot change electoral results. Meanwhile, four police officers were killed in southern Afghanistan during an inadvertent clash between NATO forces and Afghan police, according to an Interior Ministry statement on Wednesday. NATO says it is aware of the incident and an investigation is underway, according to International Security Assistance Force spokesman Capt. Critics of the Afghan president have long suggested that the creation of the now-dissolved special court had been part of an effort to stack the lower house with Karzai supporters.
