"I hope that Third Day continues to explore new territories as a band and still keep our core sense of who we are." They say they were more focused on giving their fans an album with the Southern rock sound that has made the band famous in Christian music while trying to be a little more creative. " On the K-Love cruise, an annual event that has grown exponentially in popularity, the band gave fans a chance to see their new music DVD, a 75-minute production stuffed with concert footage and backstage scenes. Third Day has earned praise from mainstream publications but is still pigeonholed as "Christian rock." They have brought their families along and -- aside from playing two one-hour gigs -- have been able to be music fans, too. It's when there start to be 'heart moments' that Christian records really take off."
