On Sunday, Lifetime premieres "Liz & Dick," its Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton biopic starring Lindsay Lohan and Grant Bowler. EW: Now that you have worked with Lindsay, are you hoping other producers give her a chance? People who make movies have to understand the responsibility you have when you make a biopic. I've made the Duke and Duchess of Windsor movie [The Woman He Loved]. And now I've done Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.
