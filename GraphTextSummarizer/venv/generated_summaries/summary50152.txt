Taking Native American fashion 'Beyond Buckskin' and headdresses "Your event stereotypes and demeans Native cultures, collapsing hundreds of distinct tribal and cultural groups into one 'tribal' mish-mash, thereby erasing our individual identities and contemporary existence," Native American blogger Adrienne Keene said in an open letter to Paul Frank LA and Red Light PR on her blog, Native Appropriations. A powwow-themed party that critics called a "perfect storm of bad stereotypes" has led to collaboration between Paul Frank Industries and Native American designers on a new line of clothing and accessories. Elie Dekel, President of Saban Brands, which owns Paul Frank Industries, also reached out to Metcalfe and Keene to apologize for the brand's misrepresentation of Native American culture. "Subconsciously, people think we aren't around so we don't have a voice." Dustin Martin from the Navajo tribe will design graphic T-shirts incorporating Native imagery with the iconic Paul Frank character, Julius the Monkey. The "Paul Frank Presents" fashion collaboration will debut in August at an event during the Santa Fe Indian Market in New Mexico, the year's biggest celebration of contemporary Native arts and culture.
