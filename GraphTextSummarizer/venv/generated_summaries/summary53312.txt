Fifty years ago the majority of sports were organized on amateur lines, and even in professional sports the sums of money at stake were negligible. European leagues are also highly unequal in sporting terms, with a handful of clubs dominating competition at both national and European level. Sports capitalism has some unique characteristics. First, monopoly will not work -- teams and athletes need sporting competitors. Many people feel it unfair that nurses or firemen earn small salaries compared to sports stars, but their pay simply reflects scarcity.
