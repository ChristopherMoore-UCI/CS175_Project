-- Bitter cold weather was sweeping across the nation Thursday, putting the Midwest in a deep freeze. It was brutal in Ames, Iowa, on Wednesday. It was 17 in New York, which had a moderate snowfall Thursday that delayed flights a few hours on the ground at LaGuardia Airport. Forecasters said overnight temperatures will be accompanied by bitterly cold wind chills, possibly setting a record. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, it felt like 40 below because of the wind chill, CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said.
