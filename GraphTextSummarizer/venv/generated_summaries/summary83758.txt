Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson told CNN that the envelope and stationery came from Bristol County House of Corrections, but could not confirm whether Hernandez actually wrote it. -- Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez, jailed on a murder charge, declared his innocence as he responded to a fan letter, saying that "all the people who turned on me will feel like crap," according to a report. In the letter, Hernandez responded to the fan, "The world just makes things out of false accusations and it will all die down especially when they say NOT GUILTY......" At the end of the letter, Hernandez pleads for the letter not to be leaked to social media. However, the name "Aaron Hernandez," the identification number, unit and room number were listed on the outgoing envelope. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder and is being held without bail.
