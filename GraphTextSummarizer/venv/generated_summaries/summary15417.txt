Clinton tried instead to master local issues in granular detail, focusing on initiatives like getting New York into the Northeast Dairy Compact, addressing the economic divide between upstate New York and New York City, and championing the state's wine industry. When it comes to models for freshmen lawmakers, strategists often cite Minnesota Sen. Al Franken, the former comedian and 'Saturday Night Live' writer, and former New York Sen. Hillary Clinton as two who figured out a formula and stuck to it. To that end, she initially tried to fly under the radar, spending much of her time on constituent work, and making it clear that she knew her place as the junior senatorâ€”standing behind New York Sen. Chuck Schumer at the podium, for example, and waiting her turn to speak. (At a "New York Farm Day" hosted by Clinton in the Senate, she placed Boonville's Mercer's Dairy next to New York winemakers, inspiring wine-flavored ice cream that is now sold internationally). Others who came to the Senate as big names like New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker are still struggling to find the right balance.
