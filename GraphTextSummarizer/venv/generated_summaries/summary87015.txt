More: China plans banquet ban on shark fin Environmentalists say this wasteful practice puts several shark species at risk of extinction. The ban will apply to Cathay Pacific and its subsidiary Dragonair, both major players in the transport of air cargo to Hong Kong and China. "We believe that we now have compelling evidence that the majority of shark fishing is incompatible with our position on Sustainable Development," Cathay Pacific said in a statement. Stanley Shea, from the marine advocacy group Bloom Association, believes Cathay Pacific's move sends a message to other Hong Kong corporations. -- Cathay Pacific, the world's largest carrier of air cargo, will stop shipping unsustainably sourced shark products in a move marine conservation groups characterized as a big step forward in efforts to protect the animals.
