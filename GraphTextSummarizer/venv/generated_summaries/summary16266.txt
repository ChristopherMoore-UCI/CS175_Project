The Security Council voted in March to authorize the use of force to protect Libyan civilians from Gadhafi's regime. -- New NATO airstrikes shook Tripoli into early Tuesday after the alliance's secretary-general dismissed complaints that the allied campaign against longtime Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi had fallen into a stalemate. Misrata is the only city in western Libya held by the rebels, and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones, burns and amputations. Rasmussen denied that the situation in Libya had devolved into a "stalemate," insisting that NATO was "making progress" and had "taken out" a substantial part of Gadhafi's military capability. He said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end, but "It's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as Gadhafi remains in power." Despite the ongoing bombardment, Gadhafi's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of Misrata, survivors there have told CNN.
