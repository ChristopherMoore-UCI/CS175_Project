Commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery, the painting shows Prince Harry seated next to Prince William, who is standing to his left. William, 27, is now training to be a search-and-rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force, where he holds the rank of flight lieutenant. Part of a painting of the Queen Mother is visible above Harry's shoulder in the portrait, and paintings from her private collection are seen behind William. The first double portrait of Britain's Princes William and Harry went on display Tuesday at the National Portrait Gallery. It is the first portrait to show William and Harry together, the National Portrait Gallery said.
