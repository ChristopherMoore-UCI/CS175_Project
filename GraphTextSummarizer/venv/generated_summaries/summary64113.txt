-- The daughter of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani was arrested after police said she shoplifted items at a cosmetic store. Caroline Giuliani, 20, was charged with one count of petty larceny after the incident at a Sephora skincare and makeup store Wednesday, the New York Police Department said. Since his public divorce from Hanover and his marriage to Judith Nathan, Giuliani's relationship with his children has been strained, The New York Times reported in March 2007. Giuliani's office did not return calls Wednesday. And I don't comment on children because I want to give them the maximum degree of privacy.
