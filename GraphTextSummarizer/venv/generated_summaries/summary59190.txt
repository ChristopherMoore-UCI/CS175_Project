Facebook has begun a purge of fake accounts and "Likes" as part of a set of site improvements announced last month. In its post, Facebook said it has never allowed Likes to be sold, but that it has caught third-party vendors trying to use malware and other forms of deception to do just that. The result has been lower numbers on fan pages, including some of the site's most popular ones, but no actual loss of real followers. The company said pages that have been abiding by its rules should expect no more than a 1% dip in Likes. -- If it looks like lots of Facebook pages are shedding fans, it's because they are.
