" Politics may not be an easy topic for families with diverging viewpoints, but that doesn't mean it's off-limits, said etiquette expert Anna Post of the Emily Post Institute. Her relationship with her father-in-law in particular had always been fraught with tension, said Smith, who asked that her name be changed to preserve family relations. -- To help keep the peace with her in-laws during holidays, Julia Smith adopted a rule several years ago about talking politics: Don't do it, and don't take the bait if anyone starts in. But as election season heats up, politics becomes an increasingly common topic around the dinner table ... as if we needed more stress when visiting family. Something like "we'll have to agree to disagree" or "I'll consider what you said" are good ways to get someone to let go and move on, Post said.
