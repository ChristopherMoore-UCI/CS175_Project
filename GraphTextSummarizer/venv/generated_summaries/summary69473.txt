Susan Atkins is led from a Los Angeles grand jury room after her indictment in the 1969 "Manson murders." Suzan Hubbard, director of the Division of Adult Institutions, decided that Susan Atkins' request should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence. It also can recall her life sentence and resentence Atkins to a lesser term, allowing for her to be paroled. Last month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there. Atkins had been held for years at the Corona prison, which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law, and sent her request to the corrections department.
