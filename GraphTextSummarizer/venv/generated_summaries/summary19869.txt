-- When Prince William marries Kate Middleton with the whole world watching Friday, it will be a far cry from the private engagement at a rustic log cabin in the quiet African wilderness. Prince William and Kate Middleton secretly flew into the country in October and headed to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, where he had spent a year before going to the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Prince William and his bride-to-be stayed in the more spacious of the two log-cabins near the Lewa wildlife reserve, nothing like the lavish Buckingham Palace. "I think he wanted to share Kenya with his new bride, unknown to us at the time," Craig said. The couple was engaged at the Rutundu cabin on the northern slopes of Mount Kenya, a secluded getaway near a sprawling animal reserve where rhinos and giraffes roam freely.
