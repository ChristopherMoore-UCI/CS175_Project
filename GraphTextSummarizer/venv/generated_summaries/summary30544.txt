The United States has been pressing countries to refuse Snowden entry and hand him over to face espionage charges. The organization said that the documents it had submitted for the latest asylum requests "outline the risks of persecution Mr. Snowden faces in the United States." â€¢ France: Hollande, the French president, said he has "not received any particular demands from Mr. Snowden," according to French television reports. This needs to be examined thoroughly in the case of Mr. Snowden. The German news magazine Der Spiegel reported Sunday that information from Snowden detailed NSA bugging of European Union offices in Washington and New York, as well as an "electronic eavesdropping operation" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels, Belgium.
