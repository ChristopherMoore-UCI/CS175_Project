-- Bob and Mike Bryan kept U.S. hopes alive in their Davis Cup semifinal against Spain in Gijon on Saturday with a hard-fought victory over Marcel Granollers and Marc Lopez. In the other semifinal, Argentina's hopes of winning a first Davis Cup suffered a setback in Buenos Aires as Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic beat Carlos Berlocq and Eduardo Schwank in the doubles match on Saturday. Del Potro's replacement, Carlos Berlocq will face Berdych in the opening singles match, with Stepanek up against Juan Monaco in the second. The result means the match score is now 2-1 in the host's favor heading into Sunday's singles matches, and U.S. captain Jim Courier concedes his team face a daunting challenge against the defending champions. The world No.1 pairing ran out 6-3, 3-6, 7-5, 7-5 winners to record their 20th Davis Cup win in three hours 38 minutes.
