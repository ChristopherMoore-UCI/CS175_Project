Shourd was released in 2010, but Bauer and Fattal were freed last week after 781 days in captivity and a trial for espionage that Bauer said was based on "ridiculous lies." Fattal, Bauer and Bauer's now-fiancee, Sarah Shourd, were arrested after straying across the unmarked border between Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran in July 2009. He said security forces seized his files, including those regarding the case of Fattal and Bauer, and his computer's hard drive. Security forces questioned Shafiee about the two Americans, he said. Masoud Shafiee told CNN that security forces searched his apartment on Tuesday and took him to Evin Prison in Tehran for questioning.
