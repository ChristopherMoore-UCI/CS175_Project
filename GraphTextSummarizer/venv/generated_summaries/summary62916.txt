The explosions occurred in Patna, in Bihar state, ahead of an appearance by opposition politician Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janta party's prime ministerial candidate for next year's national elections. Modi, who is the chief minister of Gujarat state, is a powerful but controversial Hindu nationalist leader. He has been accused of turning a blind eye to the killings of hundreds of Muslims in the wake of the burning of a train carrying Hindu pilgrims in 2002 in Gujarat. But Modi has his share of detractors -- particularly in the state of Bihar, which has a significant Muslim population -- and many citizens think he could have been targeted. -- At least five people were killed Sunday in a string of blasts before the start of a political rally in eastern India
