Judge Peter Bogaard denied the request for high school tuition and current living expenses at a hearing Tuesday in New Jersey State Superior Court. Rachel Canning, 18, alleges in her lawsuit that her parents forced her out of their Lincoln Park, New Jersey home, and that she is unable to support herself financially. "They stopped paying my high school tuition to punish the school and me, and have redirected my college fund indicating their refusal to afford me an education," Rachel Canning stated in court documents. Canning, an honor student and cheerleader at Morris Catholic High School in Denville, says in court documents she had to leave her parents' home because of emotional and psychological mistreatment, alleging, among other things, that her mother called her "fat" and "porky" and that her father threatened to beat her. Once she learned of the punishment, Canning cut school again and then decided to run away, her father said in court documents.
