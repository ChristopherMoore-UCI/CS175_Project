Both jets are from Carrier Air Wing 17, the Navy said, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 94 and Strike Fighter Squadron 113. The two jets crashed about 290 miles (470 kilometers) west of Wake Island, Navy 7th Fleet spokeswoman Lt. Lauren Cole told CNN. "This is an exceptionally difficult time for the friends and family of the missing pilot and the Navy community," said Rear Adm. Christopher Grady, commander of the Carl Vinson Carrier Strike Group. The two F/A-18 Hornets were operating from the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, the Navy said. The Navy has suspended search and rescue efforts for a pilot who was involved in a plane crash over the western Pacific Ocean.
