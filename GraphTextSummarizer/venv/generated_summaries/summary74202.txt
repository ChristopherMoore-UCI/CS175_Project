In Crohn's disease, all layers of the intestine may be involved and there can be normal healthy bowel between patches of diseased bowel." The foundation is the largest voluntary nonprofit health organization dedicated to finding cures for inflammatory bowel diseases, a classification that includes Crohn's and colitis. The two most common surgeries for Crohn's disease are bowel resection surgery, which involves removal of the deteriorated portion of intestine, and fistula repair surgery. Crohn's disease is named after Dr. Burrill Crohn who, along with two colleagues, recognized and documented the symptoms in 1932. Left untreated, Crohn's spreads throughout the intestinal tract, causing more severe symptoms and a bleaker prognosis.
