According to police, the pair were contacted by a Colombian named "Enrique" in Palma de Mallorca through a tourism company that flew them to Lima and then to Machu Picchu. Melissa Reid, 19, from Scotland, and Michaella McCollum, 20, from Ireland, were arrested by Peruvian national police at Jorge Chavez International Airport in Lima on August 6. Archbishop of Lima Sean Walsh, an Irish-American bishop who's been in Peru for seven years, said he met briefly with the young women in the police cell where they are being held. They were stopped as they tried to board an Air Europa flight from Lima to Madrid after authorities allegedly found 11.59 kilograms (25.5 pounds) of cocaine in their luggage. The Ministry of Justice normally has an official translator present, said Walsh, who often visits foreigners held in jail in Lima.
