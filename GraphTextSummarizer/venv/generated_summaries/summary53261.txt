The Mandela family dispute has exposed differences between the culture and values of rural black South Africa and the country's modern legal and medical system. Away from the capital, in the rolling farmlands where Mandela was born and raised, many South Africans believe his precarious condition has been adversely affected by a messy public dispute between members of his family. Mandla Mandela is a chief, or traditional ruler, in this poverty-stricken corner of South Africa. Mandela then spent the bulk of his adult life, either imprisoned by the former Apartheid regime or struggling in freedom to establish democracy in South Africa. Makaziwa Mandela embraced her attorney when she won the case in a regional high court in South Africa's Eastern Cape Province.
