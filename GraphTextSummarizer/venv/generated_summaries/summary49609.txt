Richard Halstead, co-founder of Wine Intelligence, a consultancy on wine branding, says that China is a huge growth market for producers and there is a scramble for quality European brands. Halstead says the European crisis might even provide a boost in exports for wine producers as they seek new markets. He said: "If the Euro weakens significantly, if there is loss of confidence, actually that is something that wine producers might find positive because they'll be instantly more competitive in third party markets like the U.S. and Asia." CNN's Oliver Joy contributed to this report -- China's thirst for fine wines is buoying European producers as domestic consumption dries up. For Greek wine producers China represents a ray of hope.
