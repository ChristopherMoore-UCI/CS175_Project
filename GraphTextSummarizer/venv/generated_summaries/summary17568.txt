The accident occurred Friday in Bwabwata game park, said Tobias Günzel, acting director of Namibia's Civil Aviation Department. -- A Mozambique Airlines flight crashed in northeastern Namibia, killing all on board, a government official told CNN on Saturday. Namibia's aviation authorities have dispatched a police helicopter to the area, Günzel said. The location is a remote region near the Angolan border, Günzel said the plane started losing altitude at 38,000 feet and went down swiftly. "We could see it on our radar, and we could see it was descending very quickly, at a rate of about 100 feet per second," Günzel said.
