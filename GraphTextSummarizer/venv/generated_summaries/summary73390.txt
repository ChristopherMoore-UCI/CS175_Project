I say if the record companies are going to ruin the integrity of music by releasing crap, then download mainstream albums, but the underground world has plenty that a real music fan would enjoy. As for those artists that are not mainstream, there are plenty of bands I still buy albums from. Peter Gerr, outside of Boston, Massachusetts I plan on downloading the new Radiohead album as soon as it becomes available, and will pay 7 euros, which as of October 9, is about $9.87 in the United States -- $9.99 is the price of most albums on iTunes, and I think this is a fair price for what I expect will become a classic and favorite of mine, alongside every other Radiohead album I own. Albums that reflect excellent songwriting skills usually 100 percent of the time from the artists themselves. As for music that inspires me to crack open my wallet, there are tons of bands I would still buy an album from.
