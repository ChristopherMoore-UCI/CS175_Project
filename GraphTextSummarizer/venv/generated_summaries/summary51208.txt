The jockeying of movie-star egos, the drugs and sex (Michael Cera is the group's libertine nerd), Rogen and Franco brainstorming a sequel to Pineapple Express — it's all cheekily plausible. Rogen picks up his buddy Jay Baruchel (who's less of a star than anyone here — a running gag), and after getting stoned, they head to a party at James Franco's house. Sinkholes are sucking people into infernos, but inside Franco's house, the movie-star self-absorption gets raised to an insane new pitch of competitive backbiting. The two hustle back to the party, where most of the guests flee (or try to), and before long there are only five of them left in that house: Rogen, Baruchel, Franco, Hill, and Craig Robinson.
