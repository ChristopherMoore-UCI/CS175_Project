In other transfer news Thursday, Italian international midfielder Mauro Camoranesi's transfer from Juventus to Premier League Birmingham City is in doubt because of the English tax regime, his agent claimed. He is the third signing of the summer for United, who lost their English Premier League crown to arch-rivals Chelsea last season. -- English giants Manchester United have splashed out a reported $10 million on an unknown 20-year-old striker whose only previous professional experience is playing in the third-flight of Portuguese football. Bebe's displays for them attracted the attention of scouts from more prominent clubs and he was snapped up by Portuguese first division Vitoria de Giumaraes just five weeks ago. Tiago Manuel Dias Correia, known as "Bebe", has signed from Vitoria de Giumaraes and will be hoping to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani in making a big impression at Old Trafford.
