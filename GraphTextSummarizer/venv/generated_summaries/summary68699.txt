Crump remains pragmatic about her contribution to the industry -- arguing that while things are still not quite equal for female jockeys, they have come a long way since 1969. Speaking from her home in Linden, Virginia, feisty 63-year-old Crump explained half the battle, as she fought to ride professionally, was simply getting male jockeys to compete against her. Today there are several dozen female jockeys racing professionally in North America, compared with the hundreds of male jockeys who still dominate the sport. In the days before CCTV cameras, Crump did what any jockey would do and get away with -- she got out her stick and whacked him. As Crump explains, women simply weren't a part of the horse racing world in the 1960s.
