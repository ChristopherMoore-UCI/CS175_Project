"I've repeatedly made it clear that Russia must halt the flow of weapons and fighters across the border into Ukraine; that Russia must urge separatists to release their hostages and support a cease-fire; that Russia needs to pursue internationally mediated talks and agree to meaningful monitors on the border," Obama told reporters in the White House briefing room. Friday morning, after meeting with members of his Cabinet, Obama again appeared in the White House briefing room to state what many suspected -- the United States believed that the plane was downed by a missile shot from an area of Ukraine controlled by Russian-backed rebels. President Barack Obama wanted to drive down a virtual highway, talk about rebuilding infrastructure while standing in front of a bridge, and otherwise push his proposals to build middle class opportunity -- all rejected so far by Republicans. On three straight days, Obama ended up in front of reporters for previously unscheduled statements on the volatile developments halfway around the world that obscured the planned White House messaging. Such buffeting by world events adds to a perception driven by Obama's critics that he lags behind foreign policy issues instead of getting out front.
