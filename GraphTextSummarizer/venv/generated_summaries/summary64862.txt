This high-tech twist on the classic crossword board game can be played in one of four ways: against the game's artificial intelligence; versus a friend beside you in a Pass n' Play mode; over Wi-Fi (including social networking support, such as Facebook integration); or in a new Party Play mode, in which up to four players can manage their tiles on an iPhone or iPod Touch and then wirelessly play their words on the nearby iPad game board. Note: Most iPad games are not rated by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB), but please see our recommended age for each title below. "Pinball HD," as you'd expect, is a high-definition collection of pinball games for the iPad. See the entire table in the landscape mode (holding the iPad horizontally) or by toggling between a close-up "flying table" view and full table view when the iPad is held vertically (slide both your thumbs up or down the screen to toggle the camera view). Keep in mind the iPad will also work with most of the games already available for theiPhone and iPod Touch.
