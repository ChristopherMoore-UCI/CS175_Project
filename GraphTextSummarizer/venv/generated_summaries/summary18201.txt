"Ms. Chism's heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer," the statement from attorney Denise Regan reads. " Chism killed Ritzer in the girl's bathroom of Danvers High School with a box cutter he brought to school, a source close to the investigation said. Philip was arrested late Tuesday, accused of killing his 24-year-old algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer, and dumping her body in nearby woods. "She asks that you know that she cares for the world's hurt over this and greatly hopes for your prayers for the Ritzer family, the Danvers community, for her son, and all those affected by this tragedy. Ritzer was a favorite teacher to many at the high school and was known for her smile and positive spirit.
