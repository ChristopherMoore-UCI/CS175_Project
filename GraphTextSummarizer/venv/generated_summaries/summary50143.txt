African Union accuses ICC of bias, seeks delay of cases against sitting leaders The court -- set up in 2002 to try claims of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes -- has ordered Kenyatta to attend opening and closing statements, but has excused him from being at the trial otherwise. -- The International Criminal Court on Thursday postponed the beginning of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's trial on charges of crimes against humanity by three months to February 5, accepting a defense request for more preparation time. Kenyatta was charged last year with five counts of crimes against humanity, stemming from violence that plagued a disputed 2007 Kenyan presidential election, in which then-incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner. The ICC has also accused Deputy President William Ruto of orchestrating attacks. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has largely shunned an ICC warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes.
