On its website, which has no mention of the recent recall, Creekstone Farms boasts that it "supplies many of the nation's top grocers and restaurants with quality black angus beef products". The beef's final destinations remain unclear since they may have been repackaged into smaller packages for sale to individual consumers and sold under different brand names. Some 14,158 pounds of beef, in a handful of varieties, are subject to the recall, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said Tuesday in a press release. The recalled meat, sold in large packages and distributed in numerous states, comes from Creekstone Farms Premium Beef of Arkansas City, Kansas. Creekstone Farms' recalled products include: 40-pound cases of "beef fine grind 81/19" with 10-pound "chub" sub-packages, 40-pound cases of "beef chuck fine grind 81/19" with 10-pound "chub" sub-packages, 40-pound cases of "beef sirloin fine grind 91/9" with 10-pound "chub" sub-packages, 40-pound cases of "beef fine grind 90/10 natural" with 5-pound "chub" subpackages, and 60-pound cases of "beef fine ground 93/7."
