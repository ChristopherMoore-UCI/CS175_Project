-- Efforts to minimize the damage from the huge oil spill from a rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico are under way, but wildlife conservation groups say the oil could pose a disaster for Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida coastal areas. These local organizations also are gathering volunteers' information as they prepare for the environmental damage this oil can cause: The Alabama Coastal Foundation is collecting contact information from volunteers for cleanup efforts along the Alabama coast should the oil spill reach the state's shores. To report areas with oil ashore or to leave contact information to volunteer in the affected areas, call 1-866-448-5816. They are accepting volunteers and support to assist with spill recovery efforts. Elsewhere, Audubon said it was gearing up to mobilize volunteers and provide assistance as the oil reaches land in Louisiana and elsewhere.
