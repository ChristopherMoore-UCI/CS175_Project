Two suspects were arrested in connection with the explosions, which were caused by grenades, according to Nairobi Police Commandant Benson Kibuye. In retaliation, the terrorist group has launched a spate of attacks, including targeting bustling bus stations with grenades. -- At least 10 people were killed in two explosions Friday in central Nairobi, the Kenya National Disaster Operation Centre said via Twitter. Last year, militants stormed the Westgate Mall in Nairobi and held shoppers under siege for days. The explosions came after the United States, Australia and UK issued travel alerts for the African nation Thursday.
