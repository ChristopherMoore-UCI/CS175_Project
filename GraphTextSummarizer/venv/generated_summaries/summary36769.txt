The Obama administration has proposed rules to limit federal student aid funds to for-profit career colleges that do not prepare students for "gainful employment" in recognized occupations.

"The problem goes well beyond the for-profit sector; it permeates academia generally, including community colleges and four year universities," he said. In 2009, students at for-profit colleges received more than $4 billion in Pell Grants and more than $20 billion in federal loans provided by the Department of Education," the agency's summary said.
