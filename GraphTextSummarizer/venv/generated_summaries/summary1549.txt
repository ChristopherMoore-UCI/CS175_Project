We will continue to get wrongful identifications, wrongful convictions and worse, wrongful executions. I was used to looking at all kinds of photographs, even mug shots, which are an area of interest for contemporary artists and cultural critics. Until we understand what happens when people look at photographs they don't want to see, we will not get the data that will drive better policy. Each year, 75,000 witnesses identify criminal suspects. Yet, as the New Jersey Supreme Court has acknowledged in a recent landmark case, there is "a troubling lack of reliability in eyewitness identifications."
