Anderson was the direct supervisor of the rangers there, and many on that crew -- and elsewhere in the park -- needed more time before returning to work, said park spokesman Charles Beall. "It hurt to open the park up again," park spokesman Kevin Bacher told CNN affiliate KOMO in Seattle. A memorial service for Anderson is planned for Tuesday at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. Anderson was the first Rainier park employee to be a homicide victim. Areas within the park have been set up to celebrate Anderson's life and provide a space for staff and visitors to leave condolences and flowers.
