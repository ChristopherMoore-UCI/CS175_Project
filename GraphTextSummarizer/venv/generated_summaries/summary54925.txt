-- After celebrating his 75th anniversary last year and getting rebooted for the big screen, what would DC Comics do for an encore for the Man of Steel (at least until his next movie, "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice")? While there are limitations to redesigning Superman's costume, his costume will be destroyed eventually, because he's doing cosmic stuff. Bring in fan favorite writer and DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns and fan favorite artist John Romita Jr. ("Amazing Spider-Man," "Kick-Ass") for starters. This new supercreative team has built up anticipation among fans for "Superman" #32, which hits stores on June 25. The issue introduces Ulysses, who is something of an equal, and a reflection of Superman.
