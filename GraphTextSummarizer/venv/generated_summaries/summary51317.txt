Tomas Hinojosa, owner of Quitaque Riding Stables ([806] 269-1209 or [806] 455-1208; rides start at $35 per hour) in the nearby town of Quitaque (pronounced "kitty-quay") follows in the footsteps of explorers when he takes riders out to sections of the 64-mile-long path, which is part of Caprock Canyons State Park & Trailway. Caprock Canyons is about 100 miles southeast of Amarillo. Off the beaten path Hidden in the midst of sprawling ranches, Caprock Canyons doesn't lure as many visitors as its famous neighbor, Palo Duro Canyon (93 miles northwest). It means you can still find quiet times to catch a vision of the land not greatly changed from the way it was when millions of bison roamed the High Plains and wintered in hidden canyons. Then I dropped off the face of the High Plains into the heart of a wild place called Caprock Canyons.
