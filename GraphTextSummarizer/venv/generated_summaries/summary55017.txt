The Texas Department of State Health Services on Wednesday ordered Sangar Produce and Processing to immediately stop processing food and recall all products shipped from its San Antonio plant since January. State health authorities came to this determination while investigating 10 cases in which people with serious underlying health problems contracted listeriosis over an 8-month period. Four of those people died, as did one other person who authorities believe got listeriosis from another source not connected with Sangar products. The state said that it is contacting distributors, restaurants and others who may have received Sangar products. Sangar, however, sharply questioned the state's findings and strongly denied wrongdoing, saying it has had "an excellent record of safety and health" over the past three years.
