The United States has "deep concerns" over China's newly declared East China Sea air defense zone, Vice President Joe Biden privately told Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Beijing on Wednesday, according to a pool report citing senior administration officials traveling with the delegation. "We're happy to see that in the recent period, our two teams have worked actively to expand coordination and collaboration on bilateral, regional, and global levels," President Xi said in greeting Biden on his latest visit to China, according to a pool report. It has also fueled concern among U.S. officials about how far China is willing to go to pursue its interests in the Asia-Pacific region and push back against U.S. influence. Biden promises to press China on airspace dispute U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki reiterated this week that Washington does not recognize the air defense zone or China's demand to be notified of plans by jets from other nations to fly into the area. According to the pool account of a background briefing by the officials, Biden also told Xi that the United States doesn't recognize the zone -- which includes uninhabited islands that have been the site of tense disputes between China and Japan, both of which claim the lands for their own.
