-- North Korea will launch additional attacks on South Korea if it continues "reckless military provocation," North Korean state media said Thursday. Meanwhile, South Korea said Thursday that it will strengthen and supplement its rules of engagement in the Yellow Sea, following Tuesday's shelling by North Korea. "That said, it is meant to send a very strong signal of deterrence and also work with our very close allies in South Korea," Mullen said on CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS." The exercises were billed as defensive in nature and were a more measured response than the retaliation initially urged by South Korea after North Korea's shelling of Yeonpyeong. The attack on Yeonpyeong Island was the first direct artillery attack on South Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953.
