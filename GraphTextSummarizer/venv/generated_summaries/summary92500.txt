-- Assessment tests seem to be everywhere, measuring everything from intelligence to personality, ability, leadership potential -- you name it, they test it. " Maersk's findings are in line with what most experts say -- that intelligence tests are fairly good at predicting people's performance across a range of jobs. Robert P. Gandossy, one of the world's foremost experts on developing talent and leadership, and author of several books on the subject, says IQ tests can be notoriously problematic - especially when identifying leadership ability. "Experiments have shown that people can effectively fake personality tests when they want to," says Arnold. " "Remember that jobs have personalities too", says Robin Wood, president of Predictive Index (PI), Europe, who are behind the personality test Maersk uses.
