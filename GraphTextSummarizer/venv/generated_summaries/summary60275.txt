In the women's Fed Cup final Saturday, Petra Kvitova gave holders Czech Republic a 2-0 lead when she beat Serbia's Jelena Jankovic 6-4 6-1 in the second singles. Defending champion Roger Federer, who will officially lose his No.1 ranking to Djokovic Monday, heads Group B with fourth seed David Ferrer of Spain, Argentina's Juan Martin del Potro and Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia. He will play Ferrer, who beat another Frenchman, Michael Llodra, 7-5 6-3 in the second semifinal. French Open champion Rafael Nadal is the only player in the top eight of the rankings to be absent in London, still recovering from his knee problems. The towering Janowicz beat Murray from match point down in the third round and once again showed his potential with a comfortable win over the home favorite at Bercy.
