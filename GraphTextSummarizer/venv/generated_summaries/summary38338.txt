McGillvary is being held in Philadelphia pending extradition to New Jersey, Romankow said. To New Jersey prosecutors, Caleb Lawrence McGillvary is simply a murder suspect, and a dangerous one at that. Police spotted McGillvary at a nearby Greyhound bus terminal minutes later and arrested him without incident, Romankow said. Galfy and McGillvary had exchanged text messages in recent days, and investigators know McGillvary spent Sunday night at Galfy's home, Romankow said. While authorities say they don't know a possible motive, investigators believe McGillvary and Galfy had a sexual relationship, Romankow said.
