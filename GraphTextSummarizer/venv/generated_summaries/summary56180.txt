Other renewables such as wind, wave, solar and even hydroelectricity depend in large part on seasonal and climatic features, tidal turbines, meanwhile, get two regular tide changes a day. Energy companies in Scotland and Wales are seeing the potential from underwater turbines which tap a constant and predictable source of energy, are invisible and can produce as much electricity as a conventional wind turbine. "These are really cut down versions of wind turbines, such that most of the electrical equipment is onshore so that if something goes wrong, we can get a Land Rover and drive to the substation rather than having to get a boat and pick them up. "But these rotations of the blades are quite slow in comparison with wind turbines and the theory is that they can just get out of the way. Concerns over the impact on marine life were also raised during the planning process, but Pearson said the simple fact is the turbines move so slowly -- at between 12-18 RPM -- that experts believe most sea life would be able to either ignore or get out of the way of the blades with ease.
