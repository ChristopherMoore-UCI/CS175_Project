-- Born and raised in the Philippines to a businessman and a socialite model, Monique Lhuillier is today one of LA's most celebrated fashion designers, with a clientele that includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Kristen Stewart, Reese Witherspoon, and Scarlett Johansson. She launched her first bridal collection in 1996 and today, her atelier also produces ready-to-wear evening gowns, linens and tableware, fine paper and home fragrances. Her dresses, which sell for $1,500 to $16,000, are stocked at Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue and, in a few months, she will open a flagship store -- her third outlet -- and a new showroom in New York City. A graduate of LA's Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, Lhuillier began designing wedding gowns while shopping for one for herself. When I looked at what was out there, I felt that there was a lack of fashionable options for young women so I said, 'This is what I want to do: I want to start with wedding gowns'.
