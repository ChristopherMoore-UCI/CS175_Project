Like other business groups, Business Roundtable didn't fully embrace Obama's executive action, though the group didn't rebuke it as Republican leaders did and the group's policy director on immigration has said he's hopeful Obama and Congressional Republicans can work together to pass immigration legislation. The official did not mention immigration reform, but the topic could come up as he takes questions from a group of business leaders during the event that comes just weeks after Obama announced his executive actions to reform the immigration system and give legal status to more than 4 million undocumented immigrants. And Obama will need to keep business leaders on his side over the public fight over Obamacare that is sure to flame up as the employer mandate kicks in at the beginning of next year. Obama will tout economic gains in the private sector at a meeting of the Business Roundtable in Washington, where he's also looking for support to advance issues like tax reform, trade and infrastructure, a White House official said. President Barack Obama is going to a top group of American business leaders Wednesday, where he's hoping to make his pitch for his agenda to the business community ahead of an incoming Republican majority in Congress.
