Dan Jones, partner in the Sport Business group at accountancy firm Deloitte, told CNN that relegated Premier League clubs received a "parachute payment" of $18 million (Â£12m) for each of the next two seasons -- which in many cases was enough to help them bounce back up to the top-tier. In England's Premier League, for example, at the end of each season when competition points have been accrued, the three bottom-ranked teams will be relegated (demoted) to the level below (in England's case the second-tier Championship). The latest victim of the relegation sword is English Premier League team West Bromwich-Albion. For the relegated West Brom side which faces next season in the second-tier competition, their plight doesn't necessarily mean complete club failure. Promotion/relegation systems similar to the English Premier League's model work in many football leagues around the world, and have allowed dreams to come true for many aspirants, while they have also crushed the hopes and futures of others on the decline.
