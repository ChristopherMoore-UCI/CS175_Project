Cavendish has endured a couple of miserable days, missing out on a 25th stage win on Tuesday, while slipping 103 points adrift of green jersey leader Peter Sagan. While it is thought to be the first time a cyclist has been assaulted in such a way during the Tour, there have been other instances where riders have been abused. His Omega Pharm teammate Tony Martin won the 11th stage with Chris Froome retaining the yellow jersey, but it was Cavendish who was again in the limelight. -- The Tour de France remains one of the few prestigious events where spectators can almost reach out and touch the riders -- or throw urine on them as Mark Cavendish found out Wednesday. But the German revealed he began to worry when Froome appeared to be challenging for victory.
