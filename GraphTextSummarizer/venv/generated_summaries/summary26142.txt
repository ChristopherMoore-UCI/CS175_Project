The president and his Department of Education deserve credit for keeping the heat on student loan and college cost issues, and not just at campaign time. Private loans would decrease, and the federal government, facing a potential liability of $100 billion a year, would have a reason to get more serious about college costs and productivity. This week President Obama did a swing through some college campuses talking about student loan debt. But the larger problem -- mounting college costs and a cumulative $1 trillion in student loan debt â€” remains untouched. Student loans are seen by some as the president's chosen key to regaining their hearts.
