Thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act, to claim disability is to ask for reasonable accommodation -- accessible buildings, more time on tests, audible formats for books, Social Security disability payments, and more. Who knows how many people with invisible disabilities, managing pain, enjoying the concert, were forced to their feet by the glare of Kanye West and the peer pressure of the shouting crowd? The parking lot, with its handicapped spots, can be particularly fraught for people with invisible disabilities. Invisible disability also gets people in trouble with the law. Every day, in every context, people with disabilities get challenged to prove how disabled they are.
