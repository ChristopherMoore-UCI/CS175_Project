"Following the engine failure on one of our aircraft last week, and after reviewing routine maintenance procedures, we are completing a proactive and voluntary check on our aircraft engines overnight as a precautionary measure," wrote Spirit spokeswoman Misty Pinson, in an e-mail to CNN. "Some did lose their tempers, but it was all worked out amicably," airport spokesman Greg Meyer told CNN via e-mail. Hernandez told CNN affiliate CBS4 in Miami that authorities escorted him out of the terminal after he lost his temper. They didn't leave until Thursday morning at 8:08 a.m., according to airport flight departure records. Denver-bound Flight 355 was scheduled to depart Wednesday night at 8:56 p.m., but didn't leave until more than 10 hours later, on Thursday morning at 7:29 a.m.
