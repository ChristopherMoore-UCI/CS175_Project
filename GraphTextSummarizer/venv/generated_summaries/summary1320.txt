The British ambassador to France, Peter Ricketts, told reporters in Annecy, "I think it's our joint conviction that we have got to do everything possible to find the perpetrators of this terrible crime." Asked about police's failure to find the 4-year-old girl sooner, he said French authorities were doing a professional job. British Prime Minister David Cameron said he and French President Francois Hollande discussed the "terrible killings of ... the British family" during a meeting Thursday in London. He promised British authorities will cooperate "very closely with the French authorities" to "help those poor children" and "get to the bottom of what happened in this clearly very tragic and awful case." "Both a French and a British family have been impacted by this terrible event, and we will do our utmost to identify the perpetrators," added Hollande in a joint press conference after the two leaders' meeting. The girl, who was not physically harmed, will be questioned only with British consular officials present, Maillaud said. We are working with the French authorities to confirm that British nationals were involved," a Foreign Office spokesman said.
