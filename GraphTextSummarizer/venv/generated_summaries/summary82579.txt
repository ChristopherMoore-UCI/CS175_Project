British TV host Piers Morgan said taking over for retiring Larry King is like replacing Frank Sinatra's Las Vegas show. King announced this summer that he was stepping aside from CNN's "Larry King Live," a show he began hosting in 1985. "Piers has made his name posing tough questions to public figures, holding them accountable for their words and deeds," said CNN-US President Jon Klein. " Morgan will replace King's longtime show with "a candid, in-depth newsmaker interview program," CNN announced Wednesday. " Morgan's show, which was not named in the CNN news release, will air live on CNN-US at 9 p.m. ET and will air worldwide on CNN-International in more than 200 countries, the network said.
