"Technologies being tested in the program include advanced guidance, navigation and control, thermal protection systems, avionics, high temperature structures and seals, conformal reusable insulation, lightweight electromechanical flight systems, and autonomous orbital flight, re-entry and landing." The X-37B "is designed to demonstrate reusable spacecraft technologies for America's future in space and operating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth," an Air Force statement said. "Officials anticipate multiple missions will be required to satisfy the test program objectives, but the exact number of missions has not been determined," a statement said. The X-37B is expected to land at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, the Air Force said. The base did not give an exact time for the landing, but a notice to aviators and mariners on the Federal Aviation Administration's website Tuesday said airspace around the Southern California base would be closed from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT Wednesday.
