Wenger recently persuaded Arsenal captain Cesc Fabregas to stay with the club for another year after Spanish champions Barcelona tried to sign the 23-year-old. -- Arsene Wenger has admitted he rejected several offers from other clubs before committing his future to Arsenal. Fabregas was part of Spain's World Cup winning squad and joined Arsenal from Barcelona as a teenager. The French coach signed a three-year contract extension before his team opened their English Premier League season with a 1-1 draw at Liverpool on Sunday. Wenger's contract had been due to expire at the end of this season but now his stay at Arsenal will be extended to 18 years if he sees out the new deal.
