Former President Bill Clinton, who has been campaigning for President Obama and taking on the GOP, went off-script several times. At some levels, the contrast in the views of Obama and Clinton is yet another chapter in the extraordinarily tense personal relations that began with the 2008 Democratic primaries, when then-Sen. Hillary Clinton competed with Obama. This was the kind of campaign Obama has always promised voters he would not run. When some of Obama's supporters charged that Bill Clinton was subtly playing on racial tensions in the South Carolina primary to stir up white voters, the anger between the two camps intensified. The other kind of campaign, the campaign of "triangulation," is one that Bill Clinton mastered in 1996.
