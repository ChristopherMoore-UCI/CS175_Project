But following training runs on Wednesday and Thursday at Canada's Lake Louise course, she is aiming to get back in the groove this weekend ahead of February's Winter Olympics. " Vonn, who won the World Cup overall titles in 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2012, is three race victories shy of matching the record of 62 set by Austria's Annemarie Moser-Proell. She underwent surgery for knee reconstruction. There she will aim to emulate the feat of fellow American, Picabo Street, who came back the season after reconstructive surgery to win gold at Nagano in 1998. Vonn was airlifted to a hospital in February after landing heavily on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria.
