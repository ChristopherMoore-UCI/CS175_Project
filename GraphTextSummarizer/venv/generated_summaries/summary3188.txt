The report that Branson was involved in a Led Zeppelin reunion appeared in The Daily Mirror this week and claimed that Branson was eager to cart the band around in one of his jets as part of a tour that would hit London, Berlin and New Jersey. -- Robert Plant has called reports of a Led Zeppelin tour "rubbish," and now Richard Branson is doing the same. On his blog Wednesday, the Virgin Group founder said he's "dazed and confused" by rumors that he offered an $800 million (Â£500 million) contract to see Led Zeppelin re-form for a reunion tour. " Legends like Led Zeppelin are once-in-a-lifetime creators, but that doesn't mean they should be restricted to simply rehashing their old stuff; Page and Jones also have their own projects in the works, Branson pointed out. "I'm proud of how so many artists from my generation, whether it is Led Zeppelin, Mike Oldfield or Peter Gabriel, are still being so creative and inventive," Branson said.
