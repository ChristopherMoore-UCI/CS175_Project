European Champions League quarterfinal draw: Barcelona vs. Atletico Madrid Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund Paris Saint-Germain vs. Chelsea Manchester United vs. Bayern Munich Bayern are looking to become the first team to defend the Champions League title, while United's task has been made harder by the loss of Robin van Persie for the tie. PSG will be relying on the mercurial talents of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who has scored 10 goals in seven Champions League appearances this season, while former Chelsea defender Alex also plays for the Parisian club. Manager David Moyes has struggled to get the best out of his team since replacing Alex Ferguson, the Scottish coach who masterminded United's win in 1999 and also its Champions League final victory over Chelsea in 2008 as well guiding the club to 13 English league titles before retiring in May 2013. The two teams contested one of the most dramatic matches in football history, and now Bayern Munich and Manchester United will meet again in the quarterfinals of the European Champions League.
