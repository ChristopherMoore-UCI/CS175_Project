In superhero comics, both men and women are portrayed with near unattainable bodies; men are massively muscular while women can make lingerie models look bashful. Of course, neither characterization is accurate; gender is about men and women just as comic books are also for men and women of all ages. The study of gender is as misunderstood as comic books are; while gender is thought of as a topic for women, comic books are thought of as a boy's club. Comic books can be powerful, and I argue that the way comics represent women affects the way people view women and how they view themselves. The difference, of course, is that superhero men in comics look like body builders and athletes while most female superheroes today look more like porn stars.
