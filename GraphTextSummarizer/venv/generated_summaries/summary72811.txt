" Nairn will return with the rest of the "Game of Thrones" cast in April, when season four bows on April 6. -- Actor Kristian Nairn -- aka Hodor on "Game of Thrones" -- was never in the closet. " Nairn told Winter Is Coming that the crew on HBO's fantasy series "have been great," and he's quite appreciative of the gay community's support. "(W)hen you talk about 'the gay community,' you are talking about MY community," Nairn said when questioned about his gay fan base. But as a firm believer in the need to "stand up and be counted," Nairn has confirmed he's gay in an interview with "GoT" fan site Winter Is Coming.
