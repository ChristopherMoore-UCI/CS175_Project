The only other new release to reach the top ten was Fox Searchlight's post-college flick "Post Grad" starring Alexis Bledel. Warner Bros. had a much harder time with its release "Shorts" from auteur Robert Rodriguez.

It's the third week in a row the box office was up after four weekends of unimpressive results. (Entertainment Weekly) -- Score a personal best at the box office for Quentin Tarantino this weekend.
