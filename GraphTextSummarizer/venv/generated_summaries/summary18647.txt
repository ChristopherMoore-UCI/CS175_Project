Dube faces a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison for the kidnapping charge, as well as 20 years to life for the murder charge, William Stokes, Maine deputy attorney general and chief of the criminal division, told CNN. Kyle Dube, 20, of Orono, Maine, was indicted Wednesday on kidnapping and murder charges in the death of 15-year-old Nichole Cable, according to Tim Feeley, special assistant to the Maine attorney general. Dube is accused of posing as a friend of Cable's on Facebook and repeatedly requesting to meet with her in person. Dube's brother also told police that Kyle intended to kidnap Cable and he planned to "find" her later in an attempt to look like a hero, according to the affidavit. According to the affidavit, the man also said Dube wanted to have sex with Cable, but that she had refused his advances.
