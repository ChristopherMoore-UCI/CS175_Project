" While critics say al-Assad has used the Arab League mission as a cover to continue suppression of protests in Syria, Phillips says it was important that the League be seen to be acting on the Syrian crisis before taking the issue up with bigger organizations. "While it seems likely there is going to be some internal negotiation (on a resolution) taking place, it certainly seems very unlikely Lebanon or Iraq -- states who are allied effectively to Iran and Syria -- will ever join calls for Assad to stand down," said Phillips. "The presence of monitors served to galvanize the opposition, and we saw an increased number of demonstrations and anti-government activity during that time period," Middle East professor Chris Phillips from Queen Mary, University of London told CNN. The Arab League monitoring mission in Syria has been criticized for failing to stop the al-Assad regime's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests across the country. Nothing will happen in terms of military intervention in Syria unless Russia changes its current stance, according to Phillips.
