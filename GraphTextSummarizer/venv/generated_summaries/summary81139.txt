In a meeting of monarchies, FEI leader Princess Haya of Jordan presented the Queen with the award at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace on Wednesday -- watched on by a former FEI president in the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Phillip. "The Queen has an incredible in-depth knowledge of breeding," said British Equestrian Federation chairman Keith Taylor, who attended Wednesday's ceremony. The Duke of Edinburgh dabbled in carriage driving and played polo -- as have Princes Charles, William and Harry -- alongside his 22 years as FEI president. Now, the Queen has been honored with the inaugural lifetime achievement award from the world governing body of horse sport, the International Equestrian Federation (FEI). "The bond between the Queen and horses is truly extraordinary and I can't think of anyone more fitting to receive this very special award."
