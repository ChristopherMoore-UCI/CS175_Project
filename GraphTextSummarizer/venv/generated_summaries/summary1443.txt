Khartoum, Sudan -- A YouTube video of Sudanese police officers laughing as they publicly flogged a pleading, fleeing woman has sparked outrage, prompting dozens of demonstrators to protest Tuesday outside the Justice Ministry in downtown Khartoum, authorities said. Local human rights organizations have long accused police of abusing their authority to mistreat women. The judiciary authority said it would investigate the manner in which the "execution of a punishment went against legally established guidelines according to criminal publications. " In a recent meeting organized by the Sudanese Journalism and Publications Council, Al-Agib said the video was recorded in July 2009, but was recently released "to coincide with International Human Rights Day in order to bring on more international pressure on the country," he said. Local news accounts have reported that the flogging took place in Omdurman, Khartoum's twin city across the river, at the Kajabab Police Station, which is in a poor neighborhood notorious for brothels and the illegal sale of the local moonshine "aragi."
