Authorities have talked with Emile Decker from Afghanistan via phone and are trying to arrange a video conference with him, DiBenedetto said. When her husband, Emile, was home on leave in January, the couple went to Hawaii to visit her father and then stayed with her grandparents in Maryland after they returned, DiBenedetto said. Emile Decker returned to Afghanistan the first week of February and some members of her family saw him off at the airport. "Bethany Anne Decker, 21, was last seen on January 29, 2011, according to witnesses in the case, including family," a statement from the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office said. She was last seen January 29 and was reported missing by her family about three weeks later on February 19 "after repeated attempts to make contact with her."
