-- Federal officials are investigating a "potential conflict" between two planes at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, which happened shortly after Vice President Joe Biden's plane landed. The incident took place shortly after Biden's plane landed at the airport for the inauguration of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board will look into the incident Monday morning between an ExpressJet plane taking off from one runway, while a SkyWest jet was preparing to land on an intersecting airstrip, an official told CNN Homeland Security correspondent Jeanne Meserve. "It has nothing to do with Biden's plane," a Federal Aviation Administration official said. The flights were being handled by different air traffic controllers, according to the official, who said there was "no operational error" -- a term used when flights get too close to each other.
