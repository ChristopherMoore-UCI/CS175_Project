Famine was not a familiar term to McLaughlin then but Live Aid, organized by Irish musician Bob Geldof to raise money and awareness of hunger in Ethiopia, opened her eyes to human suffering. She's been in the aid business now for 18 long years, but McLaughlin was shocked when she visited Kenya and Ethiopia in the last few weeks. McLaughlin said donations for the Horn of Africa total only a fraction of what was collected after the earthquake in Haiti or the tsunami in Japan. Food prices fuel hunger in Kenya McLaughlin and Laprade visited areas in Ethiopia that are teetering on famine but are still off the international radar.
