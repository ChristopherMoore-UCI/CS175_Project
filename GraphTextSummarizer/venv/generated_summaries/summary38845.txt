The Swiss maestro has won a record equaling seven singles titles at Wimbledon, staged in the British capital, while he has also won the season-ending championships twice since it was moved to London's O2 Arena in 2009. Reigning Wimbledon champion Andy Murray misses out after failing to recover from a back injury in time to play, but David Ferrer, Juan Martin del Potro and Tomas Berdych will take part. "[It's] the absolute pinnacle of our sport," Federer, who will equal Ivan Lendl's record of 12 consecutive Tour Finals appearances, told the ATP website before booking his place in London. "He is enormously popular here in London, where he has also won seven Wimbledon titles, and we're delighted to welcome him back to the O2. A second round win over South Africa's Kevin Anderson at the Paris Masters ensured current world No. 7 Federer would line up at the showpiece World Tour Finals, which he has won on a record six occasions.
