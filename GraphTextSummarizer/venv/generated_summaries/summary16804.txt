Specifically, inflation should have generated a lot of gravitational waves -- that is, it would cause propagating ripples of space itself. It has infinitely more ways to be open or closed, with strong curvature, weak curvature, or anything in between. BICEP2 scientists searched for that special pattern of polarization in the cosmic microwave background that would show the evidence of inflation, working for several years analyzing and reanalyzing their data. Specifically, the idea is that, at the very beginning, the universe must have inflated enough to stretch the fabric of space until no trace of curvature remained. Objects in space are not hurtling outward: Space itself is becoming bigger over time.
