Paul says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market, not to meet local needs. While the story of the world's old-growth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction, forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas, such as the northeast region of the United States and parts of Europe. "Northern New England is the only place in the eastern United States where you have the potential for large-scale wilderness where wolves, lynxes, cougars, woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored," according to Michael J. Kellett, executive director of RESTORE: The North Woods. In Brazil in recent years, the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the Amazon's destruction. But forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side.
