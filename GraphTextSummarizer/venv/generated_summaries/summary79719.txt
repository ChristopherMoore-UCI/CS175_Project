Gaga's music videos hold three spots in the 65-video 100 Million Club - one for "Poker Face" (374,606,128), one for "Just Dance" (272,941,674) and one for "Bad Romance" (360,020,327). Video analytics company Visible Measures - the one we work with to put out our monthly top 10 webisodes chart - curates a list of video called the "100 Million Club." She won't occupy the club alone for long, though; the Twilight saga is close behind with 980 million and Soulja Boy is at 860 million. A Facebook group of more than 100,000 people initiated National Lady Gaga Day about a month ago, and her latest Internet hit is her "Telephone" music video with Beyonc√©. The pop star has attracted Internet attention elsewhere, too.
