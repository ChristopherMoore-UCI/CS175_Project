Merkel: Relations with U.S. 'severely shaken' over spying claims Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced Friday that Madrid had summoned U.S. Ambassador James Costos over the matter, a day after Germany summoned the U.S. envoy to Berlin over its concerns. Asked about these claims, U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said her agency does not "comment publicly on every specific intelligence activity. The latest is a story in the German magazine Der Spiegel that -- citing a secret U.S. intelligence file -- claimed Merkel's phone had been monitored for more than 10 years, stretching back before her current post. The same database indicated the United States was spying on many others in Berlin's political district, at least up to when U.S. President Barack Obama visited Berlin this year, Der Spiegel reported. "We understand that German officials plan to travel to Washington in coming weeks, and the U.S. government looks forward to meeting with them," she said. 'Significant challenges' U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki referred to the leaks from Snowden in comments Friday in Washington.
