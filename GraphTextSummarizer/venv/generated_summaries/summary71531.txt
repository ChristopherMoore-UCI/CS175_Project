"It's a one-of-a-kind item," said Chris Ivy, director of Sports Auctions for Heritage Auctions. They ended up sweeping the Cardinals in four straight games, setting off a wave of euphoria in Red Sox Nation, and finally ending the "Curse of the Bambino." Siegal, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, said he and his business partners have bought many items over the years and hope to open a museum about the history of baseball. Although the auctioned item was worn in the World Series, the blood-stained sock that Schilling had worn five days earlier is arguably an even bigger part of Red Sox lore. It was the sock worn by Curt Schilling during Game 2 of the 2004 World Series. A loss would have sent the Red Sox home for the postseason -- without a championship, as had been the case since 1918 -- while a win would put them on the verge of an unprecedented postseason comeback from a 3-0 deficit, assuming they could take Game 7.
