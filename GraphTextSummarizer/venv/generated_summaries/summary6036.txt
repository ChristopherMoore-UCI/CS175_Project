A new al Qaeda emerges After reuniting in Afghanistan, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri appeared together in early 1998 announcing the formation of the World Islamic Front for the Jihad Against the Jews and the Crusaders -- formally merging the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and al Qaeda, bin Laden's group. Back in Afghanistan, al-Zawahiri continued to work with bin Laden and al Qaeda. -- Ayman al-Zawahiri emerged from a privileged upbringing in Egypt to become one of the world's most wanted terrorists and now, the leader of the most notorious terror group: al Qaeda. The bespectacled 59-year-old surgeon formally merged his group, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, with al Qaeda in 1998, becoming then-leader Osama bin Laden's personal physician and closest confidant. Others date al-Zawahiri's wrath to 1998, when U.S. officials pushed for the extradition of a number of Egyptian Islamic Jihad members from Albania to stand trial in Egypt for terrorism.
