If you weren't lucky enough to win a seat at the table for dinner tonight with George Clooney and President Barack Obama, fear not. Asked why she is so active, Longoria said, "I support President Obama because he is on the right side of issues that matter to Latinos and women." While Obama's donor list does include longtime Democratic contributors like Steven Spielberg, Kris Kristofferson and actor Danny DeVito, the list is also studded with celebrity names that are new to politics. According to Opensecrets.org, as of April celebrity bundlers have already contributed some $6,950,000 to Obama's campaign. Kukowski says involving celebrities in Obama's campaign the last time did work, but she believes with the bad economy, voters are in a much different place.
