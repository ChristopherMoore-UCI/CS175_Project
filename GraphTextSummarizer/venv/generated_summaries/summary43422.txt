LinkedIn launched its long-awaited iPad app late Wednesday, along with revamped versions of its iPhone and Android apps. More than 22% of LinkedIn traffic comes from mobile devices; a year ago, that figure was 8%. LinkedIn expects you'll use it over breakfast, when you're torn between work and news, as well as take it to meetings. "This was a chance to go back to the drawing board," says Mario Sundar, LinkedIn's social media manager. LinkedIn has 150 million users, and the iPad is the fastest growing device on the network.
