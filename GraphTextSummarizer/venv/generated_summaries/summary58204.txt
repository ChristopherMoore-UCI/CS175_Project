Real Madrid fell to a lacklustre 1-0 defeat at the hands of Athletic Bilbao Saturday, potentially handing the La Liga advantage to arch rival Barcelona. Lyon will return to the Ligue 1 summit should it dispose of Montpelier Sunday. Real are now without a win in two league games while the 4-0 February hammering at the hands of city rivals Atletico Madrid, the clubs biggest derby defeat since 1947, is still fresh in the memory. Gareth Bale struck a post with an extraordinary shot from close to the halfway line as full time approached while Arduriz almost doubled Bilbao's lead with another headed chance late on. The result means second placed Barca can now take top spot should it win at home to mid-table Rayo Vallecano Sunday.
