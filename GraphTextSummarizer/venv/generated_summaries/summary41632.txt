-- "Django Unchained" actress Daniele Watts defended her refusal to show her ID to Los Angeles police before they handcuffed her last week. " The couple posted a short video clip and several photos showing Watts in handcuffs talking to police. "Somebody called, which gives me the right to be here," the unidentified Los Angeles police officer is heard saying to Watts. "Two people were briefly detained, but it was revealed no crime had been committed." Watts' boyfriend -- Brian James Lucas, better known as celebrity chef Cheffy Be*Live -- wrote in a Facebook post that police "saw a tatted RAWKer white boy and a hot bootie shorted black girl and thought we were a HO (prostitute) & a TRICK (client). Legal experts said the officer had the right to request identification if he suspected illegal behavior, but audio of part of the encounter with police, published by TMZ, revealed that Watts did not believe so.
