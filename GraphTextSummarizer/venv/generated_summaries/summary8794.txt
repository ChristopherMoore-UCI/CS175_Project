Cabinet War Rooms, London Across the Atlantic, another secret underground bunker got a lot of use as the nerve center of the British war effort in World War II. Now declassified, the fallout shelter could have accommodated more than 1,100 people behind 25-ton blast doors; today, it's a time capsule of Cold War hubris. Mother Nature knows what she's doing when it comes to creating cool underground attractions. Occupied by ministers, military personnel, and Prime Minister Winston Churchill from 1939 to 1945, the Cabinet War Rooms -- part of the Churchill War Rooms museum -- preserves many of the day-to-day artifacts used in that period, from large maps full of pinpricks indicating changing front lines down to the swivel chair Churchill used while presiding over the War Cabinet. Just ask the Mexican miners who discovered a sweltering cavern filled with crystals as tall as apartment buildings, or the Brazilians who first gazed into Po√ßo Encantado, a cave with a lake so clear you lose all sense of perspective looking into its depths.
