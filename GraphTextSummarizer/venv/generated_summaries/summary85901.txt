Cianci announced Wednesday on his weekday radio show that he intends to seek a third go as the mayor of Rhode Island's capital and biggest city, feeling he's the best bet for Providence's future regardless of his own past. -- Vincent "Buddy" Cianci has been mayor of Providence, Rhode Island -- twice. "Today with a sense of humility, contrition and confidence I announce to you my candidacy for mayor of Providence," the 73-year-old Cianci said on WPRO 630. That stemmed from an incident that year at his Providence home, in which he used his hands and a lit cigarette to assault a man he accused of having an affair with his estranged wife, with a uniformed policeman nearby -- an account detailed in court records and documented by then-Providence Journal reporter Mike Stanton. He pleaded nolo contendere, or no contest, the following year to one count of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault, according to court documents.
