In an interview with Anderson Cooper that aired on "60 Minutes" and CNN that year, Avila denied the charges against her and blamed Mexico's government for allowing drug trafficking to flourish. A document signed by Avila as part of the plea agreement in U.S. federal court says she provided "financial assistance for travel, lodging and other expenses" to Espinosa from 2002 to 2004 "with the intention of preventing or hindering his arrest for his drug trafficking crimes. In 2011, authorities in Mexico City said they were investigating a tip that prison medical personnel had allowed a doctor to give Avila a Botox injection, an accusation that Avila denied, according to Notimex. This week Avila -- one of the most well-known women accused of ties with Mexico's drug trade -- pleaded guilty in a Florida court to a charge connected to a cocaine trafficking case. A Mexican judge convicted her on money laundering charges but ruled that Mexican prosecutors hadn't provided enough evidence to convict her of drug trafficking.
