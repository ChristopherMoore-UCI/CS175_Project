-- A man caught on camera beating a woman in front of her child has pleaded not guilty to first-degree attempted murder, Essex County prosecutors say. Custis is also charged with first-degree robbery, second-degree burglary and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, said Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. He was taken to the Essex County Detention Center, where he remained until his arraignment Tuesday. Custis was arrested Friday in New York City by the FBI Fugitive Task Force and detectives from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. The woman who was beaten told CNN affiliate News 12 New Jersey that she made a conscious decision to try to remain silent in an attempt to protect her daughter.
