World champion Casey Stoner won the Valencia MotoGP, the final race of the season, after a thrilling battle with American Ben Spies all the way to the line. Spies, who won his first ever MotoGP at Assen in June, had to settle for second place with Italian Andrea Dovizioso third. The race was the first since the tragic death of Marco Simoncelli in a crash in Malaysia a fortnight ago and, prior to racing, riders from the MotoGP, Moto2 and 125cc categories united to perform a lap of honor to remember the late Italian. Dovizioso's third place ensured he claimed third in the overall standings with 228 points, ahead of Pedrosa on 219 points and Spies on 176. Spies told reporters: "We tried to just be careful on the last lap as it had started to rain quite heavily.
