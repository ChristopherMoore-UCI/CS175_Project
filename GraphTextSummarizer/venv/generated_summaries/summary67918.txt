"The issue in this matter was one of whether the video was curriculum-based, educationally-related, and age-appropriate for a class of prepubescent 13-year-olds," Alexander County school board attorney Joel Harbinson told CNN on Thursday. The incident occurred last week and the teacher is back on the job at West Alexander Middle School, Harbinson told CNN. Macklemore, who did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment this week, did publish a response last November when a Michigan middle school teacher was suspended for the same offense. " "Same Love" won the 2013 MTV Video Music Award for best hip-hop video with a social message last month. -- A North Carolina middle school teacher was suspended for three days for showing students the rap video "Same Love," Macklemore's song promoting equal rights for gays.
