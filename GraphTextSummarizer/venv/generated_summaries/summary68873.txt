Relations have been tense in recent weeks as anti-government protesters have taken to the streets of Manama and Iran has condemned Bahrain's violent crackdown. "The arrests, some of which occurred during pre-dawn hours, appear part of a broader government crackdown involving nighttime raids on the homes of those viewed as supporting pro-democracy protesters," Human Rights Watch said. Meanwhile, Human Rights Watch urged Bahrain on Monday to end its "campaign of arrests" of doctors and human rights activists. "Such subversive designs are not however possible, whether in Bahrain or in any other GCC country, thank goodness," he added, according to a report by the Bahrain News Agency. Several members of the council have sent troops to Bahrain to help Manama quell the protests.
