Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska announced Tuesday that he will not run for re-election next year. President Barack Obama commended Nelson for working with both parties during his career, saying in a statement it was "a trait far too often overlooked in today's politics." Jim Manley, the former long-time spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Nelson was often a "thorn in Harry Reid's side." A Senate Democratic leadership aide, speaking on condition of not being identified, told CNN that party officials are reaching out to former Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey to possibly run for Nelson's seat. According to the Senate Democratic leadership aide, Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, tried to convince Nelson to stay in Congress after Nelson told a local newspaper a few weeks ago he was still deciding on whether to run. A former two-term governor of Nebraska, Nelson narrowly won election to the Senate in 2000 and easily won re-election in 2006.
