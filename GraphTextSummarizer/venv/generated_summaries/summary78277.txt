"We've had reports of brief touchdowns as the storms near Sioux City, Iowa," said National Weather Service Meteorologist Todd Heitkamp said. Multiple tornadoes pummeled a region in northeast Nebraska Monday, killing one and causing damage that was still being assessed as the sun went down. Wisner is in Cuming County, and Pender in Thurston County. "We're still digging people out," said Sanford Goshorn, the emergency manager in Stanton County, where Pilger and Stanton are located. The state emergency management agency reported "severe damage" across the affected counties.
