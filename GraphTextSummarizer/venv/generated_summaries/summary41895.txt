-- Japanese authorities arrested the last fugitive suspected in a deadly 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway, police said Friday. During the morning rush-hour in March 1995, members of the Aum Supreme Truth cult released sarin gas that led to the deaths of 13 people and sickened more than 5,500 commuters. He was caught in front of a comic book cafe in Tokyo after its staff alerted police of the presence of a man resembling the suspect. A fingerprint test positively identified the man as Katsuya Takahashi, 54, the only suspect in the gas attack case who remained at large, a spokesman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police said. Thirteen, including Shoko Asahara, the cult's blind guru, were sentenced to death.
