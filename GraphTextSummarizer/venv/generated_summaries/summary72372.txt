WCBS news anchor Rob Morrison is facing charges of allegedly choking his wife, CBS MoneyWatch anchor Ashley Morrison, according to Connecticut authorities. Rob Morrison was taken into custody early Sunday at the couple's Darien home when police responded to a "domestic violence incident" called in by Ashley Morrison's mother, according to a statement from the Darien Police Department. In a joint statement released Monday, the couple's attorney, Robert Skovgaard, said, "Rob and Ashley Morrison are cooperating fully with the authorities to insure that all of the information necessary to properly evaluate this unfortunate incident is made available." While being processed, Rob Morrison made verbal threats to further harm his wife, according to the police statement. Morrison is scheduled to be in court Tuesday on charges of second-degree strangulation, second-degree threatening and disorderly conduct.
