Personal care is the fastest-growing category for global consumer goods companies, especially in emerging markets, and the Alberto Culver acquisition will allow Unilever to have more products across a broader range of price points. These will complement Unilever's existing portfolio of iconic brands like Dove, Clear and Sunsilk in hair care and Pond's and Vaseline in skincare, and will help build on our strong global positions in both the hair care and skin care categories. "It further skews Unilever to high-growth, high-margin personal care categories, gives a more rounded category presence in hair care and makes it global leader in hair conditioning, number two in shampoo and number three in styling." "We are delighted to be acquiring Alberto Culver," Paul Polman, Unilever chief executive, said on Monday. In the most recent quarter, Unilever's sales of personal care goods rose 7.8 percent to â‚¬3.6bn, compared with growth of only 3.5 percent for ice-cream and beverages, and 0.5 percent for savoury foods, dressings and spreads.
