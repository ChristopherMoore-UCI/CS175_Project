CNN: Your music showcases a number of styles -- the fairly basic sound of the early records, the early-'70s infused stuff from "1972," and then there are songs like "Miserable South" that would sound comfortable coming from Otis Redding or Al Green. On joshrouse.com, Rouse's Web site, he sells his "Bedroom Classics" -- dozens of songs Rouse recorded live or in random locations (hotel rooms, apartments) available to fans. Aside from Rouse's rough, intimate voice, that album sounds little like 2003's "1972," which features songs such as "Love Vibration" and "Comeback (Light Therapy)" and has a funkier, more upbeat production to match. In 2004, the Australian newspaper The (Melbourne) Age noted Rouse was going to have dinner with Edie Brickell, the "What I Am" singer who is married to Paul Simon. CNN: In the album notes, you mention that you write best when you're in motion -- getting ideas for melodies in taxicabs, for example.
