But Gates said civilian casualties are down in Afghanistan compared with last year, while U.S. and allied casualties are up by 75 percent. Gen. David McKiernan is being replaced as commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan. "The president was grateful for and impressed by the leadership that Gen. McKiernan demonstrated in calling for additional resources for the fight in Afghanistan," the White House said in a written statement. "This change of direction in Afghanistan in no way diminishes the president's deep respect for Gen. McKiernan and his decades of public service." The United States replaced the top allied commander in Afghanistan on Monday, deciding "fresh eyes" are needed to reverse the course of the seven-year-old war there, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said.
