Police discovered documents appearing to be Air France checklists and flight plans in Jeannard's briefcase, according to Jones' complaint. Air France spokesman Cedric Leurquin described it as a bad fake of an Air France crew badge. Jeannard was wearing a white button-down shirt with an Air France logo over the pocket and a black jacket with four gold stripes on the epaulets, similar to one worn by pilots, the complaint said. Jeannard entered the cockpit, where two pilots were performing preflight duties, and told the pilots he was an Air France Boeing 747 pilot, it says. It said Jeannard admitted to having falsified his mother's Air France identification card, which the airline said was real.
