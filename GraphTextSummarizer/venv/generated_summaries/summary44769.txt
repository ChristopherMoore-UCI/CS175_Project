The Gulf Cooperation Council countries (which besides Bahrain include Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) also cannot allow Bahrain to have more democracy and freedom because it will pressure other countries to do the same, and they do not want that. Considering the world's attention on Syria and Egypt as well as other Arab nations that have experienced uprisings, do you think that the world has forgotten about Bahrain? Dhaif: The situation in Bahrain is unpredictable and chaotic just like all the arbitrary arrests and fabricated charges. A resolution will take place if the allies agree to give the regime in Bahrain the right to undergo reforms. Bahrain's allies (Great Britain and the United States) do not want to interfere in what is taking place because Bahrain has been a good ally for them in the region.
