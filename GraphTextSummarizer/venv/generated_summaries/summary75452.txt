NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the crash occurred before 8 p.m. around 25 to 30 kilometers (15 to 18 miles) east of Kabul International Airport. A source from the Afghan air force said the cargo plane took off from Bagram air base and was landing at Kabul airport, which amounts to a 30- to 45-minute flight. An ISAF statement said the plane was not an ISAF aircraft, and Lt. Col. John Dorrian, ISAF spokesman, said the aircraft was from Uganda. Preston Murray, president of Michigan-based National Air Cargo, said he could not specify the nationalities of those on board, but did not believe any to be American. National Air Cargo received reports "that the plane was on the radar and then it wasn't," Murray said.
