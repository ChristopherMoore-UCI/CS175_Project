In what was a bizarre, disturbing scene at Wimbledon, Serena Williams withdrew from her doubles match with sister Venus Williams on Tuesday due to a viral illness. "Unfortunately Serena has been feeling unwell for the past few days and she just couldn't play to her potential today," Venus Williams said. The Women's Tennis Association said in a release that Serena Williams, a five-time Wimbledon champion at doubles, had a viral illness. At that point, the Williams sisters retired from the match, down 3-0. Both Williams sisters have been eliminated from singles' competition.
