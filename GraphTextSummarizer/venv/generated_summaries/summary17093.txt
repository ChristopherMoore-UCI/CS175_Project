A jury in New York convicted Aafia Siddiqui on seven charges, including attempted murder and armed assault on U.S. officers, in 2010. Five years of rumor and false leads ended in 2008 when news emerged that Aafia was in U.S. custody, accused of crimes for which she was later imprisoned. Speaking exclusively to CNN from her home in Karachi, Pakistan, the sister of Dr. Aaifa Siddiqui said the jailed neuroscientist's family wanted "no violence in Aafia's name. Siddiqui has never been charged with a terror-related offence, though U.S. authorities made the link long before her capture. The papers included descriptions of various U.S. landmarks and military assets, excerpts from the "Anarchist's Arsenal," and a number of chemical substances in bottles and glass jars, the documents said.
