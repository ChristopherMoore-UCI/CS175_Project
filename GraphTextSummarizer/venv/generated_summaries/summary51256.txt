Nine things to know about the plan to salvage the Costa Concordia The Costa Concordia salvage by the numbers How the Costa Concordia was raised 'We'll die without that boat:' What the Costa Concordia leaves behind in Giglio -- The wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship has begun its final voyage. Salvage crews refloated the ship last week so they can move it from its resting place off Giglio Island to the Italian port of Genoa to be dismantled. It's been more than 2Â½ years since the ship ran aground off Giglio Island with more than 4,200 passengers aboard, killing 32 people in a disaster that drew global attention.
