Joseph Mayotte, 50, sexually abused his daughter over a five-year span, starting when she was 8, according to a news release from prosecutor Joseph D. Early Jr. Mayotte was convicted in August on 11 charges -- including rape of a child aggravated by age difference -- and was sentenced Monday to 16 to 20 years in prison. The 49-year-old became pregnant with her adopted son's child when he was only 15, according to Paul Jarvey of the Worcester County District Attorney's Office. "Let them burn in hell," is what the son, now 21, said of his former parents in an impact statement read in court today, according to Jarvey. The two adopted children -- along with the child to whom Linda Mayotte gave birth -- were adopted by other families. -- A Massachusetts husband and wife were each sentenced to prison Monday after being found guilty last month of raping their two adopted children.
