" Bush added that Ukraine already contributes to NATO missions, specifically in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. In remarks last month, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer told the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe that NATO "has long made clear that any decision regarding membership is between NATO and the country concerned, and not subject to veto by any third party." Russia is not a NATO member but works with the alliance via the NATO-Russia Council. Before leaving Tuesday for Bucharest, Bush said that Russia will not be able to veto Georgia's or Ukraine's inclusion into NATO. Pifer said last month that NATO should strive to maintain good relations with Russia, but "should not allow Moscow a veto, either explicit or tacit, over relations between the alliance and third countries." Russia's concerns also align with those of some NATO members who oppose welcoming Georgia and Ukraine into the fold.
