"We are glad the court has granted the stay because it provides current stability in Nebraska's marriage licensing process," Attorney General Doug Peterson said in a statement. Nebraska was set to begin offering marriage licenses to same-sex couples on Monday. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday issued a stay of U.S. District Judge Joseph Bataillon's decision this week to end the ban. "The discrimination enshrined in our constitution hurts our clients and countless other Nebraska families,"  the ACLU of Nebraska said on its Twitter account. The number of states offering same-sex marriages has surged since the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in 2013 that invalidated part of the federal Defense of Marriage Act.
