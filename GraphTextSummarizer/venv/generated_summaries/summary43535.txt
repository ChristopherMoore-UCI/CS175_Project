Few want to touch Iranian crude A source familiar with the U.S. sanctions strategy says banks have been made aware of the potential price of doing business with Iran -- even indirectly. International shipping companies are now much more reluctant to call at Iranian ports or unload Iranian oil. " Confusion over sanctions Platts reports that Asian buyers of Iranian crude are struggling to find vessels willing to call at Iranian ports because of the lack of insurance cover, but it quotes industry sources as saying that Indian and Chinese owners "have no issues" with loading Iranian crude. A bill that passed the U.S. Senate Banking Committee this month would ban any foreign bank from handling transactions by Iranian oil companies and would seek to block Iranian access to the system that enables international banking transactions. This month, at least two cargoes of Iranian crude were sitting at the Sidi Kerir terminal in Egypt, but no one wanted to handle them for fear of falling foul of European sanctions, according to the leading industry publication Platts.
