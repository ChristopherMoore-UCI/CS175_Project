The Israeli military conducted airstrikes Sunday night in the area between Israel and Syria, targeting a group of militants allegedly trying to plant a bomb on the Israeli border. Three of the alleged attackers were killed, Israeli media reported, citing IDF sources. "A group of armed terrorists approached the border with an explosive device, which was intended to be detonated against IDF forces," the Israeli military said. The Golan is regarded internationally as occupied territory despite Israeli governmental control. The Israel Defense Forces said the airstrikes were carried out in the occupied Golan Heights against four militants who crossed into the area from Syria.
