Air travel still hobbled after Chicago fire Veteran employee Howard had worked at the center for eight years but was facing a transfer to Hawaii, according to an affidavit filed in U.S. district court in Illinois, obtained by CNN affiliate WLS. Other control centers have handled many of the Chicago flights while repairs are made. After the fire, air traffic controllers initially had to transfer flight data manually rather than by computer, said Doug Church, spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. Suspect sent Facebook message: 'I am about to take out' FAA facility Calls for investigation Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois is calling for an investigation into whether security was breached. Thousands of flights into and out of Chicago's two major airports have been delayed or canceled since Friday's fire.
