Castro was sentenced to life imprisonment but was later found hanging in his prison cell. Captives in similar situations draw strength from each other, Reed said, just as the three women who escaped this year after 11 years of sexual abuse in Cleveland, U.S., did. Many of those victims have endured sexual abuse in brothels, forced labor or domestic servitude.
