The beats, by young comers like Hit-Boy and Kenoe, are taut and lively, a good match for Minaj's manic spirit and comic zingers -- and comic anti- zingers. But Minaj is also in the Gaga lane, the Bowie lane, the Missy Elliott and Gary Glitter and Katy Perry and Betty Boop lanes. "Roman Reloaded" opens with Minaj -- a biracial woman from Queens via Trinidad -- ranting in the voice of her (Polish?) homosexual "twin brother" alter ego. With her, the point is plenitude: more boasts, more hooks, more craziness, more shape-shifting, more cognitive dissonance, more pleasure. Beginning with Track 10, the thumping "Starships," "Roman Reloaded" veers into radio pop, serving up club anthems, clobbering ballads and, on the Dr. Luke-produced "Young Forever," the most shameless Rihanna-wanna-be song ever recorded, a tune worthy of the ambition.
