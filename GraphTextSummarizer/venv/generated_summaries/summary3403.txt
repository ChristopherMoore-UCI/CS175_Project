Casualties mount at alarming rate in Iraq Monday's attacks come as Iraqi security forces are conducting a large-scale operation, "The Revenge for the Martyrs," which is attempting to track down al Qaeda members in and around Baghdad. An al Qaeda group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks in July on two Iraqi prisons that a lawmaker said freed more than 500 inmates, including some senior members of the militant group. July was the deadliest month in Iraq since the peak of sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007. According to figures released by the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, 1,057 Iraqis were killed and another 2,326 were wounded in acts of terrorism and violence in July. The deadliest incident was in the southeastern part of Mosul, where a car bomb exploded by Iraqi army convoy.
