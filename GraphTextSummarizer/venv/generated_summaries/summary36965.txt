When the couple were growing their family, a neighbor's dog killed their 3-year-old son, Jon Setzer's former law partner George Cate Jr. told CNN affiliate WZTV. Setzer attended law school at night and eventually joined Cate to form a partnership that lasted for 12 years in Nashville. Jon Setzer and his son-in-law were business partners, the affiliate reported. Jon Setzer had a background in journalism and was working for a Methodist publishing house when he met Cate in the Army Reserve, Cate told WZTV. "They were just sweet people," said the Rev. Mike Ripski, pastor at First United Methodist Church in Lebanon.
