A military grand jury is investigating charges that he mishandled classified information in a way likely to cause injury to the United States. Manning is charged with illegally leaking classified information and faces 52 years in prison if he is convicted of the charges against him. Manning is accused of disclosing classified information to WikiLeaks, including diplomatic cables and military logs of incidents in Afghanistan and Iraq. That vote was postponed on Thursday, pending more information on Manning's involvement. He is a national committee member of the War Resisters League, member of Courage to Resist Organizing Collective, an organization that supports GI war resisters, and a member of the steering committee of the Bradley Manning Support Network, which raises money for Manning's defense.
