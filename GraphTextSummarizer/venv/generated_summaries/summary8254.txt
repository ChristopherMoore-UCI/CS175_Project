"The distinctive thing about Justice Stevens that's going to be hardest to replace is his attention to the individual case and his willingness to decide it in a way that really isn't determined by ideology," said Christopher Eisgruber, a former Stevens law clerk and author of "The Next Justice: The 112th justice, by most measures, will have a tough act to follow, as he or she seeks to navigate the complex dynamics of a divided bench and gain a measure of the level of influence Stevens enjoyed for the past two decades and more. -- When the nation's capital was turned upside down Friday with the announcement that Justice John Paul Stevens was retiring after 40 years on the federal bench, he was miles away from the political circus -- literally and figuratively. When the chief justice is on the losing side of a case, Stevens -- as senior associate justice -- gets to assign who writes the all-important opinion. I think he's likely to appoint somebody who's more on the center left, someone like Sonia Sotomayor who the president believes really shares his values as a judge, but doesn't generate the kind of political heat that would disrupt politics over the summer.
