Paras Shah allegedly fired several rounds at Rubel Chaudhary, a Bangladeshi national and the son-in-law of Nepal's deputy prime minister Sujata Koirala, after an argument Saturday in a wildlife resort in Chitwan, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of Kathmandu, according to reports. "The ex-prince took out a pistol and started to open fire, accusing the Koirala family of conspiring to abolish the monarchy in this country," Chaudhary said Monday, according to media reports. He was arrested in the tourist resort of Pokhara, about 200 kilometers (124 miles) west of Kathmandu, and police were questioning him, according to Ramesh Kharel, superintendent of police. There have been previous reports of his using firearms in public places in the past. However, Tuesday was the first time police have arrested Shah, who splits his time between Kathmandu and Singapore.
