"If counterfeits appear on our site, we take them down swiftly," eBay spokeswoman Sravanthi Agrawal said. " eBay said LVMH was trying to crack down on Internet auctions because it was uncomfortable with its business model, which puts sellers rather than brands in control. -- A Paris court has ordered eBay to pay $63 million damages to luxury goods company LVMH for allowing copies of its goods to be sold on the Web auction site. Today's ruling is about an attempt by LVMH to protect uncompetitive commercial practices at the expense of consumer choice and the livelihood of law-abiding sellers that eBay empowers every day." Louis Vuitton took eBay to court for selling a range of fake luxury goods online.
