For many, watching the spectacle of giant art works burning with a crowd of thousands gasping in awe in union is a major highlight of AfrikaBurn. Its worldwide fame is growing too -- each year more international participants travel to this remote corner of South Africa just to attend the festival, including Americans, many of whom declare that AfrikaBurn is how Burning Man was two decades ago, before it became so big. Once a year, if you drive just several hours north of Cape Town into South Africa's arid Karoo semi-desert, you'll come across a tented town in the middle of a vast expanse of nothing, like a surreal mirage. For many participants, attending AfrikaBurn is a life-changing experience -- it's hard to come out of a week in the desert without looking at the world in a different way. This is AfrikaBurn, Africa's most unique, unusual, exhilarating and mind-blowing festival.
