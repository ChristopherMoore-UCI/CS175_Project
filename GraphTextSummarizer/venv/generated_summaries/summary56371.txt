Train operator Austin Wuennenberg, 21, was killed in Sunday's monorail crash. -- Three Disney monorail workers have been placed on paid leave just days after two monorail trains crashed at the Orlando, Florida, theme park, killing one of the train's operators, according to a Disney spokeswoman. Additionally, six passengers on Wuennenberg's train were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Walt Disney World spokeswoman Zoraya Suarez said the action was "part of an investigative process, not a disciplinary action." The Pink train was instructed to go back through a track switch that would take it from the monorail's Epcot loop to the Magic Kingdom loop.
