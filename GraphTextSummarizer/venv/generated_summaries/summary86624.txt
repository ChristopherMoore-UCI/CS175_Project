-- A series of power failures at New Jersey's New Meadowlands Stadium brought Sunday night's game between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys to a temporary halt. The power incident lasted about 12 minutes, Fox announcers said on air, adding that some players briefly hit the ground during the blackout. The Cowboys ended up beating the Giants 33-20. "Pitch black stadium with a lot of people," a Fox TV announcer said after play resumed. "Power was lost when one of the two feeders to the stadium experienced a power interruption."
