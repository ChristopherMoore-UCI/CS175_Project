Shot-by-shot testimony in Bulger trial makes jurors squirm Rakes had alleged that Bulger forced Rakes to sell his South Boston liquor store to him in the 1980s. Steve Davis, a brother of one of Bulger's alleged murder victims and a friend of Rakes, said that Rakes learned Tuesday that the prosecution had dropped him from its list of potential witnesses. Last Monday, former Bulger associate Kevin Weeks testified that "it wasn't your regular extortion," adding that Rakes offered to sell his store to Bulger. Expletives fly between Bulger and Kevin Weeks Rakes later told the media that Weeks was a liar and that his liquor store was "never for sale. " Weeks turned state's evidence after he found out Bulger was an FBI informant and led law enforcement to a quarry of shallow graves in Boston tidal marshes.
