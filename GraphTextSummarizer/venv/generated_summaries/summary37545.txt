-- Christopher Schwarzenegger, the 13-year-old son of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver, was hospitalized after a serious surfing accident in Malibu, California, over the weekend, a source close to the family said. "On behalf of our entire family, we want to sincerely thank the paramedics and lifeguards who responded so swiftly as well as the doctors, nurses, emergency room and hospital staff who have cared for our son," the family statement said. Patrick, his 17-year-old brother, posted a Twitter message Friday morning indicating that Christopher is doing well in the hospital.
