Float through the air with Napa Valley Balloons as you experience ultimate tranquility thousands of feet above ground. If you're looking for just a day of fun, try the Introductory Experience package, a full day of instruction that involves ground training and flying from small hills about 10 to 15 feet high. Kids who are small enough can even ride the llamas," said Rich Beattie, executive editor of TravelandLeisure.com. Train lovers can find fall rides across the country in states from Connecticut and West Virginia to Indiana and beyond. The typical ride starts with a continental breakfast provided by Napa Valley Balloons and a brief pilot orientation.
