Known as the "clown prince" of Italian politics, Beppe Grillo is a 64-year-old comedian turned politician whose Five Star Movement (M5S) is winning the hearts, minds and votes of Italians fed up with mainstream parties. -- Italian voters may finally be losing their appetite for Silvio Berlusconi's off-color "jokes," but if the rise of Beppe Grillo is any indication, there's still more than enough room in Italian politics for another showman. "We have a lot of trouble right now, and he's a different way to do politics, to change things from the ground," said Grillo supporter Martina Paladino. While there is little doubt Grillo can entertain a crowd, questions remain over whether he can destabilize mainstream Italian politics. What seems clear after the election is that Grillo's movement will a force to be reckoned with in Italian politics for the foreseeable future.
