With NATO troops scheduled to pull out of Afghanistan by the end of the year, and following the refusal of Karzai to sign a bilateral agreement -- the so-called Status of Forces Agreement -- with the U.S. to keep some troops in-country, Afghan security is in the hands of the next man to be sworn in. Abdullah Abdullah An ophthalmologist and former Northern Alliance medic in a previous life, Abdullah was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power and although he was a previous Karzai ally, serving in his government as foreign minister, he has in later years been a thorn in the side of the man who has ruled Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001. "Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah are campaigning on the implicit message that they will bring change," Martine van Bijlert, Co-director, Afghanistan Analysts Network (AAN) told CNN from Kabul. The third election since the fall of the Taliban in 2001, it marks the first democratic handover of power in the fragile country, with incumbent Hamid Karzai -- who is constitutionally bound to step down -- handing over the reins. As with many countries, both democratic and otherwise, loyalty along ethnic lines matters a great deal in Afghanistan.
