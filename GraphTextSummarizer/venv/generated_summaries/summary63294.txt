With the advent of more precise navigation, more precise onboard automation and more exact ground-based air traffic control systems, the separation limits have decreased, allowing for more flights between North America and Europe. Before the latest computer technology became prevalent, oceanic controllers would track airplanes manually based on verbal pilot position reports at designated degrees of longitude. That was a question facing pilots in airspace over the United Kingdom on Friday, when Shanwick Oceanic, a part of the UK's NAT system of air traffic control, developed a computer glitch. So when Shanwick develops a computer glitch, air traffic arriving and departing into the United Kingdom is most affected. Radar signals don't have the capability of traveling out to the middle of the ocean, so before airplanes enter the North Atlantic track system, from either east or west, a specific speed is assigned along with a specific altitude.
