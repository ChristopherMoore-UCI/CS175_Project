As well as attending the prizegiving dinner at the Atlantic Council, Prince Harry is also expected to meet British and American athletes who have taken part in the Warrior Games, a paralympic sports tournament for armed services personnel, in Colorado. Other high-profile guests whose work will be recognized by the council on May 7 are U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, violin virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter, and Unilever CEO Paul Polman. St James's Palace says he will use the event to pay tribute to the work of British and American charities which help to rehabilitate wounded servicemen and women, and to reintegrate veterans into civilian life. A spokeswoman for the palace told CNN the trip -- Harry's first to the U.S. since he took part in Apache helicopter training in the deserts of Arizona and California last year -- was likely to be a flying visit, lasting less than 24 hours. The Atlantic Council is a non-partisan U.S.-based think-tank which promotes transatlantic cooperation and international security.
