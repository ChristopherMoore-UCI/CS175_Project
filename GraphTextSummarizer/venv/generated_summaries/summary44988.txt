With his team safely through to the next stage of the competition, Messi will hope to inspire Barcelona to Champions League glory following a disappointing campaign last year. Awesome Aguero Messi wasn't the only Argentina striker to hit a hat-trick on Wednesday as Sergio Aguero's triple propelled Manchester City to a 3-2 win over Bayern Munich. Just days after breaking the record for the top scorer in Spanish football history, Messi went one further, establishing himself as the leading marksman in the history of the European Champions League. Messi's record of 253 will no doubt be extended in years to come as will his exploits in the Champions League. Messi, who won the prestigious Ballon d'Or four times between 2009-12, netted in 21 consecutive league matches last season which enabled him to score against every other club in the Spanish top flight.
