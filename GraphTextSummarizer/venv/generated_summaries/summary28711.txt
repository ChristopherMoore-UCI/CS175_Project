In addition, it would be a welcome development to see the proliferation of organizations akin to neighborhood watch groups -- cyberwatch groups, if you will -- where people can routinely report suspected attacks and receive immediate feedback. Making things worse, even some people who suspect a deception open such emails anyway because of flawed assumptions about the security of their devices and operating systems. Simple actions such as frequently checking email or Facebook status updates have become part of the daily rituals of Internet use. The human brain overtime automates such routines, which leads to people clicking on hyperlinks, opening attachments and providing credentials without really paying attention to what they are doing. But lost in the reporting is another fact: We are, in a very real sense, responsible for such attacks.
