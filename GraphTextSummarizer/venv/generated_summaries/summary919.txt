Ligety, who topped the giant slalom podium in Sochi, recorded his sixth victory at Kranjska Gora in Slovenia, the first man in World Cup history to achieve that feat at the same venue in the same discipline. Ted Ligety and Mikaela Shiffrin continued to bask in the golden glow of Olympic triumph as the American pair recorded impressive World Cup victories Saturday in their specialist disciplines. It wrapped up the overall slalom title for Shiffrin, who becomes the first woman to win eight World Cup races before the age of 19. Marcel Hirscher of Austria claimed fourth spot to maintain his 50-point lead over Ligety in the discipline's overall standings ahead of the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide next weekend. Ligety also had to protect a big lead from the first leg and came under pressure from Austrian veteran Benjamin Raich and Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway, who finished 0.18 and 0.25 seconds behind in second and third.
