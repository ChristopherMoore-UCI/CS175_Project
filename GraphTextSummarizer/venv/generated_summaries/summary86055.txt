-- Second seed Roger Federer won his first title of 2009 after stunning world number one and clay-court king Rafael Nadal in straight sets in front of his own fans in the final of the Madrid Masters on Sunday. Nadal, despite his epic match on Saturday, was quickly into his stride as he sought a sixth title this year and he created two break points on separate Federer service games early on. However, the emotion of that success was clear to see on Sunday and the Mallorca-born 22-year-old was no match for his old foe, as Federer took the game to his opponent to beat Nadal for only the second time in 10 meetings on clay and end his long wait for another title.

The Spanish ace failed to make the most of either of those chances though, and when Federer's first opportunity came along in the ninth game of the first set he was not so profligate.
