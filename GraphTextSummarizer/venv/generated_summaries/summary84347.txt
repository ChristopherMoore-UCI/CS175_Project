At the heart of the debate: Would such quarantines on health workers who just came back from treating Ebola patients in West Africa help prevent the spread of the virus, or would they discourage medical aid workers from helping fight the global crisis? Cuomo, Christie clarify policy on Ebola health worker quarantines Would home quarantines even work? The concerns are twofold: One, it could deter doctors and nurses from traveling to West Africa to help rid Ebola; and two, it could greatly impede the livelihoods of health care workers. Cuomo added that if employers don't pay quarantined workers for the time they are absent while under quarantine, "the government will." New York, New Jersey and Illinois say anyone returning from having direct contact with Ebola patients in West Africa will have to be quarantined for 21 days.
