"A lot of visitors miss out on street food because they go back to their hotel between 6 and 8 p.m. for dinner," says guide Gail Leonard, who runs food tours of Fez, the culinary capital of Morocco. Food in souks is sold by weight and a decent portion costs around MAD 10 ($1.18). Or you can pop into Caf√© Clock in Fez for one of their famous camel burgers served with fries and salad (MAD 95/$11.23); 7 Derb el Magana, Talaa Kbira; +212 535 637 855; www.cafeclock.com. Particularly good is beghrir (spongy bread, a bit like crumpets), harsha (buttery bread made of fine semolina) and rghaif (flaky, layered flat bread). Brochettes are served with khobz, harissa (red pepper sauce), red onion, cumin and salt and cost around MAD 20-30 ($2.36-3.55).
