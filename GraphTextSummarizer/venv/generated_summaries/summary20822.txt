He said that the mission was possible because Iraqi forces, which were built with billions of dollars in US funding, and partially folded in the face of the ISIS advance, had "stiffened" their spines. The requests are based on an assessment of Iraqi security forces made by US Central Command, said Pentagon spokesman, Rear Admiral John Kirby. He said that ISIS fighters were afraid to congregate in any sizable formation in Syria and Iraq amid fears they could be target by US and allied aircraft. It includes $1.6 billion to establish a fund to develop and support Iraqi and Kurdish security forces as they gear up to mount a counter offensive against ISIS, which has carved out a so-called caliphate in vast swathes of Iraq and Syria. President Barack Obama is sending up to 1,500 more soldiers to Iraq to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight ISIS, in a deployment that would almost double the total number of American troops there to 2,900.
