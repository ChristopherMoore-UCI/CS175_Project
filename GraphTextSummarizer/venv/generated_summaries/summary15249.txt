The two main candidates are incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan and retired general Muhammedu Buhari. The ruling party, the Peoples Democratic Party, refutes the accusation, saying the election was "credible and the result reflects the overwhelming wish of the people of Rivers state to support President Goodluck Jonathan. And if the opposition believes it has been rigged out of victory by the ruling party, then the protests in Rivers state could spread to northern Nigeria. Protesters fired gunshots and torched a local electoral office in Nigeria's oil-rich Rivers state as they marched to protest national elections held to elect Nigeria's next President. "We are concerned by what seems to be happening," said Attahiru Jega, Nigeria's election chairman, about events in Rivers state.
