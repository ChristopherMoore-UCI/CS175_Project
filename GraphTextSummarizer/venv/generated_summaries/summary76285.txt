On Thursday Ireland's Insolvency Service set out monthly spending limits for people seeking debt deals from their creditors, highlighting the impact austerity is having on Irish spending habits. Alan Shatter, Ireland's minister for justice, warned banks that they could face heavier losses if they did not agree debt deals with struggling mortgage holders, who might instead choose to declare bankruptcy. Unlike in some US states, mortgage holders cannot escape debt obligations by surrendering their property to the bank. Unlike many other EU countries, including the UK, Dublin has included secured mortgage debt within its insolvency regime, in an effort to encourage banks to negotiate long-term restructuring deals with debtors. "But nor does it mean that people should be punished and live only at subsistence level," In most cases, people seeking debt deals will also have to give up private health insurance and their cars, although they will be able to keep their vehicles if they do not have access to public transportion.
