"The oil can cause rashes and even blistering," warns Jerome Z. Litt, M.D., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland and the author of "Your Skin from A to Z." Unfortunately, "no study shows conclusively that eating yogurt cures or even lessens the severity of yeast infections," says Michele G. Curtis, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Medical School at Houston. In fact, douching can cause yeast infections, Curtis says, especially if you're using yogurt; its sugars could actually help yeast grow. While U.S. studies haven't conclusively proven that black cohosh works, Curtis says it can't hurt to try the herb -- just consult with your doctor about the dosage first, and stick with it for 12 weeks, she says. Indeed, research has shown that taking 600 milligrams of calcium twice a day can reduce PMS symptoms.
