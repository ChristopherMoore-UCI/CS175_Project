The Taipei-based activist, who remains the second most wanted man in China for his role in the Tiananmen protests, says he is not surprised by the Chinese leadership's continued refusal to re-assess the movement, even though its official description has been watered down to "political disturbance between the spring and summer of 1989. But it's unlikely to be "Nothing to My Name," a rock song by Chinese superstar Cui Jian about the dispossessed youth that became the unofficial anthem for Tiananmen Square protesters a quarter century ago. Mass demonstrations started in Beijing in April that year as university students gathered in Tiananmen Square to mourn the death of an ousted liberal Communist Party leader. Tiananmen Square, a major tourist attraction, remains off limits to foreign news outlets, especially around June 4. By the time I left China for the United States in 1993, the Tiananmen protests had become a distant memory in my mind thanks to the government's strenuous effort to erase the events from national consciousness shortly after the bloody crackdown.
