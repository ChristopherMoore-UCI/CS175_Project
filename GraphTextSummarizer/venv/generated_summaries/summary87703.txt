Existing colleges and universities, flush with federal dollars, have already created all the essential building blocks for National U. Anyone with an Internet connection can log on to Coursera, edX, saylor.org, and many other websites offering high-quality online courses, created by many of the world's greatest universities and taught by tenured professors, for free. National U., moreover, wouldn't be limited to courses from existing colleges. Instead, National U. would hire teams of leading scholars to evaluate and approve courses. In other words, Uncle Sam ultimately decides who gets to be an American college and grant college degrees. Instead, lawmakers chose to rely on state governments and religious denominations to build and finance new colleges and universities.
