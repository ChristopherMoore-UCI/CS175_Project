Don't be a jerk en route to dinner "The year-end holiday season remains the least volatile of all travel holidays as Americans will not let economic conditions or high gas prices dictate if they go home for the holidays or kick off the New Year with a vacation," said AAA President and CEO Robert Darbelnet in a statement. "Primary economic indicators all show modest improvement from last year and AAA is projecting an increase in the number of Americans stuffing their stockings with airline tickets and hotel reservations," said Darbelnet. Travelers are also planning to spend more: AAA predicts median spending of $759 this year, an almost 6% increase over last year. Some 90% of U.S. travelers (84.4 million) say they expect to drive to their destinations this year, a 1.3% increase over last year. This year, AAA defines the holiday period as Saturday, December 22, to Tuesday, January 1, 2013.
