Fatah, the Palestinian political party, said Sunday it will scrap a series of events to commemorate the death 10 years ago of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. In September, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas blasted Hamas, claiming it was running a "shadow government" in Gaza and rendering the unity government "helpless." " In April, Hamas and Fatah announced an agreement to form a unity government, a development that Palestinian lawmaker Mustafa Barghouti hailed as the "end to the division between the Palestinian people." But the Fatah spokesman nevertheless accused Hamas of "cheap lies" and said that Fatah officials had "expected a united government to cater to the interests of our nation. The explosions took place as Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah was preparing to visit Gaza.
