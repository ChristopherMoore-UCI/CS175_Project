The room assignment is just one example of how life will be different for Democrats after a long eight years in the majority -- so long, in fact, that most current Democratic senators have never served in the minority. Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, who last year chaired the influential Budget Committee, agreed that "not setting the agenda" will be the most frustrating part of not being in the majority. " It was only after walking in on a roomful of lunching Republican senators that the Democrats, to their chagrin, realized that when they lost the majority, they also lost many of the perks of power -- including use of the spacious room that's hosted Democratic caucuses for the last eight years. Gone too are committee slots for Democrats, as Republicans beef up GOP control of the committees that will vote to cuts taxes, slash spending, ditch government regulations, and approve other measures that many Democrats oppose. When Democratic senators arrived for their policy lunch this week, several came off the elevators in the Capitol and turned instinctively towards the Mansfield Room, a large and elegant meeting space just off the Senate floor.
