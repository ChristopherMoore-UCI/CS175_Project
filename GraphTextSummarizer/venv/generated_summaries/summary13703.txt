Thai Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told MCOT on Saturday that one recent clash began after Cambodian troops fired into Thai territory. In a letter to the U.N. Security Council on Friday, Cambodia's deputy prime minister said Thai troops had engaged in a "large-scale attack with many types of weapons," targeting areas around temples "deep inside Cambodian territory." Cambodian Lt. Gen. Chhum Socheat claimed Thai troops shelled and damaged temples, and flew over Cambodian territory with spy planes, Cambodia's state-run Agence Kampuchea Presse reported. The Cambodian defense ministry on Saturday blasted what it called Thailand's "repeated deliberate acts of aggression," including firing heavy artillery weapons and flying military planes deep into Cambodian airspace. He disputed reports that Thai forces had used poisonous gas or flown over Cambodian territory, except for helicopters trying to airlift out wounded soldiers.
