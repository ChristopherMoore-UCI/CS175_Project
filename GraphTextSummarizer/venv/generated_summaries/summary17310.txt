The co-pilot of the flight became concerned about Osbon's bizarre behavior early in the trip from New York to Las Vegas, according to an FBI affidavit issued shortly after the flight. -- A group of passengers who were aboard a March 27 JetBlue flight out of JFK Airport that was diverted because of erratic behavior by its pilot have filed suit against the airline and pilot. The lawsuit alleges that Osbon caused significant distress to the passengers, specifically by yelling obscenities and things such as "Say your prayers," "We're all going down," "I'm going to show you Iraq and Iran right now" and "There's a bomb on board." JetBlue Airlines does not offer comment on pending legal matters. According to court documents filed April 18 by his attorney, Dean Roper, Osbon plans on using an insanity defense. As the Airbus A320 was climbing out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, Osbon talked about his church and needing to "focus," the affidavit says.
