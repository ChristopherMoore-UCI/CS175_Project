A customer like Katchpole might have reacted to Bank of America's new fee by changing banks, but there would have been no way for her to connect to hundreds of thousands of other disaffected customers to enact a coordinated response. Katchpole's campaign also inspired dozens of other people to start their own petitions on Change.org challenging their own banks to drop new proposed fees. A Bank of America executive personally called Katchpole to try to address her concerns and its CEO had to defend his consumer-unfriendly plan on national television as complaints mounted from bank customers and others. It's not just that companies are now forced to publicly face concerns expressed by mobilized customers; it's that the knowledge that any significant decision will be exposed and could result in coordinated backlash is causing companies to pre-emptively change their policies to better reflect the interests of their customers and stakeholders. With hundreds of new campaigns started every day on Change.org, we see this impact up close.
