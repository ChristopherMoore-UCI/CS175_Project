"The 2008 Olympics has left many legacies to Beijing, which includes experience and sufficient infrastructure," Beijing Sports Bureau chief Li Yingchuan told Xinhua. Beijing would stage the ice events, reports the country's state-run news agency Xinhua, while snow-based competitions would take place in Zhangjiakou. The 2008 host, along with the northern city of Zhangjiakou, is vying with several European cities after having officially entered the bidding, according to the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC). There are plans to build an express railway line to cover the 174 km distance from Beijing to Zhangjiakou, which is in Hebei Province. Since Pyeongchang won the 2018 bid, Beijing as another Asian city will face a daunting task to beat the odds," Li said.
