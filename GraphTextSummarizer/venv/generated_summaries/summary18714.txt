Air France and British Airways stopped Concorde service in 2003 because the flights did not make money. -- A French appeals court on Thursday cleared Continental Airlines of criminal responsibility for the Air France Concorde crash that killed 113 people in 2000, but affirmed a civil judgment against the U.S. carrier. An investigation revealed that the Concorde jet struck a small strip of titanium and blew a tire during takeoff from Charles de Gaulle airport on July 25, 2000. The titanium strip allegedly fell off a Continental DC-10 which took off just before the Concorde.
