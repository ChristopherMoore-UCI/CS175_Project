For star Hough, who's made the transition from Dancing with the Stars pro to fledgling country singer (remember?) to Hollywood leading lady, Safe Haven represents her best-ever opening weekend following underwhelming debuts from Burlesque ($11.9 million), Footloose ($15.6 million), and Rock of Ages ($14.6 million). Close behind in third place, Relativity's $28 million Nicholas Sparks adaptation Safe Haven opened with $21.4 million. Relativity did a great job of marketing Safe Haven as the top choice for Valentine's Day couples, and the built-in cachet of Nicholas Sparks continues to prove irresistible for many moviegoers. (Meanwhile, 2013′s top four highest-grossing movies — Identity Thief, Mama, Warm Bodies, and Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters — all feature women in leading roles.) Prognosticators certainly expected bigger business on opening weekend, and it remains to be seen whether it can match Live Free or Die Hard's $134.5 million finish, but Fox can rest easy thanks to Die Hard's strong international performance so far.
