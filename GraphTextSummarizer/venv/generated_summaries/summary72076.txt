-- Embattled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe signed a power-sharing deal with the opposition party's breakaway faction, his party said Tuesday, though Mugabe's opponents denied the claim. Mugabe's party said the deal, which promises cabinet positions to the splinter group of the Movement for Democratic Change, does not involve MDC head Morgan Tsvangirai. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe leaves a hotel where negotiations had been taking place Tuesday. Welshman Ncube, spokesman for the MDC splinter group, also said his party has not signed a deal with Mugabe, though Mugabe's party said the deal was signed with the group's chief, Arthur Mutambara. The MDC has wanted the prime minister to be in charge of government and Mugabe to be in charge of the state, the official said.
