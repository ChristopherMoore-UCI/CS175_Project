The so-called "piggyback" operation allowed the donor heart to do the work while Hannah's heart rested. Doctors theorized that the donor heart had allowed Hannah's heart to rest, recover and grow back stronger. As with any organ transplant, Hannah's body was likely to reject her new heart and she had to take powerful immune suppression drugs. Teenager Hannah Clark's heart has healed itself more than a decade after she received a donor heart. Those drugs allowed her body to accept the donor heart but also led to cancer and yet another medical battle for Hannah that lasted for years.
