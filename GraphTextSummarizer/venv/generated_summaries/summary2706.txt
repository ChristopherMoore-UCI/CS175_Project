-- Chelsea and England defender Ashley Cole has been charged by the Football Association (FA) after he called them a "bunch of twats" during a Twitter rant on Friday. It went on: "The Commission [has] considerable doubt as to whether the request to amend paragraph 4 of Mr. Cole's statement, to include the word 'black', was based on Mr. Cole's own personal recollections, or as a result of discussions that he had had with Mr. Barnard. Cole was responding to an independent report into an allegation of racism against Chelsea captain John Terry, in which the panel cast "considerable doubt" over the 31-year-old's evidence. Cole's initial evidence in the days after the incident occurred was amended in November 2011 when Chelsea secretary Dave Barnard asked the FA to add the word "black" to the former Arsenal defender's original statement. The FA panel said: "We are driven to conclude not just that it is 'highly unlikely' that Mr. Ferdinand accused Mr. Terry on the pitch of calling him a 'black c***', but that he did not."
