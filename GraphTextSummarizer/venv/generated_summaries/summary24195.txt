Both bodies were inside a plastic bag, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said. There are tentative plans to begin the autopsy tomorrow said Ryan Bridges, spokesman for the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office. The mother of the children was apprehended at a separate location, and was later arrested on child abuse charges, pending the "results of the medical examiner's report," a release from the police department said. Police in Detroit made a gruesome discovery Tuesday. A bailiff performing an eviction on a home on the east side of Detroit called 911 after discovering the body of a female child inside a freezer.
