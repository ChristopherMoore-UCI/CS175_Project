While Shin stands by his allegations of torture and abuses by North Koreans, his admission stirred controversy about truth and trauma among defectors. The text of the book, "Escape from Camp 14" won't be corrected, according to the Washington Post, which was the newspaper where its author, Blaine Harden worked when he initially interviewed Shin. But the author also acknowledged the role of psychological trauma for Shin, who is missing part of his right middle finger and bears scars of torture. In October 2014, North Korea uploaded videos on YouTube featuring Shin's father who disputed his son's widely publicized life story. The video raised suspicions among other survivors of Camp 18 who questioned Shin's story.
