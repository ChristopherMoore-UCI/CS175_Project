"The loss of Officer Collier is deeply painful to the entire MIT community," MIT President L. Rafael Reif said on the university website. "Sean was one of these guys who really looked at police work as a calling," MIT Police Chief John DiFava said in a statement posted on the university website. I'll always remember that," Kristina Lozoya, a student volunteer with the MIT emergency medical service, told CNN. On Thursday night, when news emerged that an MIT officer had been shot, King sent Collier an e-mail "to make sure he was OK." Collier died a police officer, shot to death in his squad car on the MIT campus.
