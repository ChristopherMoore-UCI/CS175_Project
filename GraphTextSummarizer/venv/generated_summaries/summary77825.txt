Among the Americans charged in the case is Sam LaHood, director of Egypt operations for the International Republican Institute and the son of U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. In December, Egyptian authorities carried out 17 raids on the offices of 10 organizations, including the U.S.-based Freedom House, National Democratic Institute and the International Republican Institute. Members of Congress say Egypt's action could mean the end of $1.3 billion in U.S. aid. Clinton has met repeatedly with Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohammed Amr in recent days in London and Tunis, and other senior administration officials are also involved, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. They sat in a caged section of the courtroom, which is customary in Egyptian courts, and were not in detention.
