After expressing the usual gratitude to cast and crew of Richard Linklater's "Boyhood," best supporting actress winner Patricia Arquette took a moment at the end of her acceptance speech to call for equal pay for women. Reese Witherspoon, who was nominated for best actress for her role in "Wild," advocated for the hashtag #AskHerMore, which encourages red carpet presenters to ask more thought-provoking questions instead of the usual appearance-driven ones like "Who are you wearing?" Graham Moore gave an emotional speech after his win for best adapted screenplay for "The Imitation Game." Sean Penn rubbed many the wrong way when he joked "Who gave this son of a bitch his green card?" as he presented Mexican director Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu the best picture award for "Birdman." Iñarritu seemed unperturbed and devoted the Oscar win to his fellow Mexicans, saying, "I just pray they can be treated with the same dignity and respect of the ones that came before and built this incredible, immigrant nation." Between light-hearted moments like Benedict Cumberbatch taking a swig from a hip flask and Neil Patrick Harris parading on stage in his underwear, it was all about activism and controversial topics at the 87th Academy Awards. And lastly, J.K. Simmons got preachy about a topic that hits close to home for many: The winner of best supporting actor for "Whiplash" encouraged viewers to #CallYourMom.
