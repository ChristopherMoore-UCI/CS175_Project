"Winter weather in the Midwest & Southeast has impacted travel to, from, and through Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky," said an advisory Wednesday on the website for Delta Airlines, the largest carrier in Atlanta. The low pressure system laid down an icy path across northern Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi on Wednesday.
