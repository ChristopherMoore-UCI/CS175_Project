Snowden and others have contended that he did America and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs, which they say wrongly impinge on people's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the U.S. government. Commenting on New York Times reporting based on leaks related to confidential surveillance programs involving Iran, the poster compared the newspaper to WikiLeaks -- which enraged U.S. officials by disclosing thousands of confidential diplomatic cables. U.S. officials have accused China of deliberately letting Snowden leave. Obama hadn't talked to leaders of China and Russia about Snowden -- who actually turned 30 a few days ago -- in part because he didn't want to amp up the issue and have to start "wheeling and dealing" in order to get the fugitive in U.S. custody. While he didn't offer specifics, Ventrell did say he'd expect "grave difficulties" in relations if Ecuador granted Snowden asylum.
