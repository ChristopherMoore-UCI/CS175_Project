Barry Rand, AARP'S CEO, told committee members that the organization has been nothing but transparent, in contrast to the "Behind the Veil" report's implication that the organization had an ulterior motive for supporting health care reform. The hearing "amounts to nothing more than a political witch hunt to punish an organization that spoke out in favor of health reform," he said, adding that the Republicans aim is "to discredit AARP in the minds of seniors." And Rep. Bill Pascrell Jr., D-New Jersey, noted that "the sixth-largest social welfare organization" with the type of nonprofit classification AARP has "is a tax-exempt race track and casino which operates in Iowa. Some members called the hearing "political payback" for AARP's support of Obama's health care reform efforts. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-Louisiana, also argued Friday that the AARP has strayed from its original mission of protecting seniors.
