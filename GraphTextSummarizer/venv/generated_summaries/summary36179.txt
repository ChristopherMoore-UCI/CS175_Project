The incident spawned research on the so-called bystander effect: a set of brilliant experiments conducted by John Darley and Bibb LatanÃ©, who showed in their 1968 study that as the number of bystanders goes up, the probability of any individual bystander intervening goes down. We must ask ourselves, however, how we will respond in more mundane situations that present us with fellow human beings who are in need. It is true that cultural differences exist in many aspects of human behavior, and many of these differences are not trivial. For example, in a situation in which several bystanders need to band together to overwhelm a perpetrator, they will be more likely to act collectively than to act alone. If an incident occurs in a foreign country or culture, it is easy -- maybe tempting, as we grapple with something so baffling -- to conclude that the particular culture is to blame, that it is being callous, uncaring or egotistical.
