-- The state of North Carolina filed an appeal Friday to a judge's ruling that license plates with the words "Choose Life" on them are unconstitutional because the state does not offer an alternative for supporters of abortion rights. " "It's unfortunate that the state has chosen to prolong what is really a very clear-cut First Amendment issue," said Chris Brook, legal director of the ACLU's North Carolina Legal Foundation. During the fight to get the bill passed, North Carolina lawmakers voted down amendments that would have created alternatives for abortion-rights supporters such as "Trust Women. The action comes less than a month after U.S. District Court Judge James Fox ruled: "The State's offering a Choose Life license plate in the absence of a pro-choice alternative constitutes viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment." The legislation also mandated that money raised from the sale of the specialty plates would go to a nonprofit group that supports crisis pregnancy centers, CNN affiliate WRAL reported.
