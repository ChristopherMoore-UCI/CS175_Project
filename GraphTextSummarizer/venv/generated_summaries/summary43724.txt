As Republicans raise the idea of a court challenge against President Barack Obama's immigration action, White House spokesman Josh Earnest argued Friday that the President's executive orders stand on solid legal ground. Earnest reiterated a point the White House has fervently tried to make in recent days, that previous presidents have used executive authority on the issue of immigration.
