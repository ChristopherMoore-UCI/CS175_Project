Leaders at drug distribution points inside the projects often pay children to move drugs, according to the National Drug Intelligence Center's 2011 report on Puerto Rico. But there's one thing that Romero says there isn't enough of in Puerto Rico: funding from the U.S. government for the fight against drug trafficking. "The problem can't be controlled only with policing measures," says Jorge Rodriguez Beruff, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico who has researched drug trafficking in the region. Analysts once calculated that there were nearly 100 criminal organizations that were connected with drug trafficking in Puerto Rico, he says. In 2010, an FBI investigation into whether police provided protection for drug dealers led to the arrest of 89 law enforcement officers in Puerto Rico.
