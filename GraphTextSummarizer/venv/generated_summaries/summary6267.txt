" Maria described a cross-border trade in young children and babies -- with orders coming in regularly from the U.S. "They stole the children and one of the gang members took a six-year-old kid that I had to look after for three hours. While a prisoner, Maria witnessed a sickening trade in human life and recalls how young girls were drugged, forced into prostitution and then murdered. Mexican authorities accompanied Maria on her trip to Houston to work alongside U.S. authorities on the case. -- Even before her 18th birthday, Maria had already been enslaved by a gang of human traffickers and held in captivity for four months in her homeland of Mexico. "I want to tell the story so that in the near future, other girls don't go through the same," Maria said.
