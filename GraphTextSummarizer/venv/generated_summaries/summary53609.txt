Only Knox and Sollecito themselves may know which it is -- because nearly four years after Kercher's death, incontrovertible evidence about whether Knox and Sollecito were involved remains maddeningly elusive. Police scientists argued that a knife found at Sollecito's home had traces of Kercher's DNA on the blade and Knox's DNA on the handle. No end to Knox as pop culture obsession Knox and Sollecito do not have airtight alibis for the night of November 1, 2007, when Kercher's throat was slashed, her semi-naked body left under a bed cover. There was no physical trace of them in the room where Kercher died, Knox and Sollecito's lawyers insisted. That means that either Knox and Sollecito were the victims of a miscarriage of justice then, or that Kercher is now.
