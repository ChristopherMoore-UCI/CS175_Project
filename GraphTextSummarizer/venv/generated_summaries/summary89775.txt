First civilians evacuated The U.N.-led operation to help civilians wishing to leave the Old CIty of Homs started Friday with the evacuation of 83 women, children and elderly civilians after an agreement between the government and opposition groups for a cease-fire that was also intended to allow humanitarian aid to reach the city on Saturday. " "Today's events serve as a stark reminder of the dangers that civilians and aid workers face every day across Syria," said Amos, who applauded "the courage and tenacity" of U.N. and Red Crescent aid workers. But workers managed to deliver some aid to the thousands of people in the besieged section of the city known as the Old City of Homs, where rebels battle government troops and each other. Valerie Amos, the U.N. humanitarian chief, lamented Saturday that the "three-day humanitarian pause agreed (upon) was broken today and aid workers (were) deliberately targeted. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency had reported that four Syrian Arab Red Crescent workers were wounded Saturday by gunfire from "terrorist groups" while trying to deliver aid.
