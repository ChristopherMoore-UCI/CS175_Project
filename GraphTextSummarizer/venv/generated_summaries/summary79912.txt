On Friday, the Nobel Committee awarded the peace prize to three women activists: Liberians Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first African woman elected head of state and Leymah Gbowee, who campaigned for peace during the nation's brutal civil war and anti-government protester Tawakkul Karman of Yemen. -- Kenyans gathered in the nation's capital Saturday for a state funeral honoring Nobel laureate Wangari Maathai, marking a final journey for the first African woman to win the peace prize. She was the first African woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2004 for her years of environmental conservation. Crowds gathered at the main park in Nairobi for a state service that included President Mwai Kibaki, Prime Minister Raila Odinga and other government officials. The first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize died weeks before another milestone in the continent she fought for.
