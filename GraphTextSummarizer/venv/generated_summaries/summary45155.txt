We are pretty new to the youth sports world—my son is five—and I've already seen crazy parents and coaches and kids who are being pushed against their will. And as a mother to kids who will likely be playing plenty of sports, stories like this Rutgers debacle stay with me and make me think. He was obviously poking fun at the youth sports culture we live in where kids start playing younger and get ultra competitive way too soon. The thing is, a good coach can be the most amazing mentor to young kids, someone whose words they'll remember forever. I have long been dubious of big-time college sports and what it does to the self-esteem and psyches of young people.
