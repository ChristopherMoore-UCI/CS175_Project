"At a time when hopes of moving towards political reform and accountable governments elsewhere in the Arab world have been dashed, Tunisia is the only country where the aspirations of the Arab uprisings may yet be fulfilled in the near future," Anthony Dworkin of the European Council on Foreign Relations wrote at the time. Fast Facts: Tunisia The revolutions that spread throughout the Arab world began in Tunisia when a poor 26-year-old who could not find a job had a run-in with police and then set himself on fire in front of a government building in December 2010. Long-time politician Beji Caid Essebsi won the country's runoff with about 55% of the vote, beating outgoing President Moncef Marzouki's 44%, state-run media reported Monday. " "The idealism engendered by the Arab spring has mostly sunk in bloodshed and extremism, with a shining exception: Tunisia," the magazine wrote. As a candidate, Essebsi promised to restore the state's prestige after the chaotic years since the 2011 revolution, when the country's dictator, President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, was ousted.
