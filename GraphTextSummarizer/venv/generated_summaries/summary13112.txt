"It says that out of anger, out of frustration, Mr. Ward pulled a gun and shot his wife in the face," she said of the verdict. "What I would like to do is appeal to one thing, and one thing only: your common sense," fellow prosecutor Ken Lewis told the jury during the rebuttal phase of closing arguments Thursday. The prosecution pointed out that Ward called 911 the night of the shooting and said, "I just shot my wife," then offered shifting stories as the call progressed and later in his conversations with relatives and colleagues. When the verdict was read, the 63-year-old Ward showed little evident emotion, though his daughters continued to cry. Soon after entering the Orlando courtroom late Saturday morning, Ward went to a back row and sat between his two visibly distraught daughters, one of whom had testified that she detected no animosity between her parents.
