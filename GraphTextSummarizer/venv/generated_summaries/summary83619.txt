Earlier in the day Laura Trott added to the gold she won in the women's team pursuit with triumph in the omnium event, but home crowd favorite Victoria Pendleton was beaten to gold by Australian Anna Meares in the individual sprint. In the women's individual sprint final Meares gained revenge for defeat in the same event four years ago, as Pendleton had to settle for silver in her last race before retiring. "I wanted to win gold in front of my home crowd. It denied Pendleton a fairytale ending to a career in which she won two gold medals, including the women's keirin at the London Games. Behind Hoy and Levy, New Zealand's Simon Van Velthooven and Dutchman Teun Mulder could not be split by a photo finish and were both awarded bronze medals.
