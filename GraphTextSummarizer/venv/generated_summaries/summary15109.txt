The call that came into the fire station was from the house next to Cosgrove's, leading firefighters to think that's where the fire was, Selden Fire Chief Joseph Leavens said. Last year, Cosgrove was named firefighter of the year for rescuing a man from a burning building as he waited for other firefighters to arrive. The impact engulfed both the truck and house in flames, Suffolk County Police said. -- When the call came in that a pickup truck had slammed into a house, igniting a fire, volunteer firefighter Michael Cosgrove and his fellow firemen in the New York hamlet of Selden rushed to the scene. "He realized it was his address that was actually on fire," Cosgrove's neighbor Nelson Ortiz told CNN affiliate WCBS.
