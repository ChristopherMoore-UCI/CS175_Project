After the hearing, CIA spokesman George Little issued a statement clarifying Panetta's remarks: "As Director Clapper made clear, and as Director Panetta agrees, any decision about what might happen if Osama bin Laden and other terrorists are captured would be a decision for policymakers, and would have to be informed by the circumstances of his capture. The officials were defending intelligence community efforts at the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, during which Chairwoman Diane Feinstein, D-California, questioned whether the CIA and other agencies were adequately following clues in social media in the lead-up to popular revolts that deposed the leaders of Tunisia and Egypt and have sprung up in other countries. Panetta was asked what would happen if al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden or his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were captured. A senior counterterrorism official also said, "The odds of Bin Laden and Zawahiri being captured alive are about as good as vodka losing favor among Russians." Two years ago, President Barack Obama announced his intention to close the facility, a policy which has been heavily criticized by Republican members of Congress. A number will be sent to other countries if arrangements can be worked out.
