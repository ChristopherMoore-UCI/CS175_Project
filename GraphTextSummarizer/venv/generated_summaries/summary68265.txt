To tackle the mounting federal deficits and national debt, Obama has called for a comprehensive agreement that would cut spending, reform entitlement programs and increase tax revenue. In his remarks, Obama said the issue of the most immediate concern to most Americans and to financial markets was the slow pace of recovery from economic recession. Republicans oppose any kind of tax increase, and many reject increased tax revenue even if the tax rates remain the same or are lowered. "That threat, coming after a string of economic disruptions in Europe, Japan and the Middle East, has now roiled the markets and dampened consumer confidence and slowed the pace of recovery." "Over the next several months, there will be tremendous pressure on Congress to prove that S&P's analysis of the inability of the political parties to bridge our differences is wrong," said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said in a memo to GOP members.
