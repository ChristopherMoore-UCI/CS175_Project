With sales of camera phones and digital cameras growing exponentially, one can easily speculate about hundreds of billions of digital photos being snapped and "trapped" on memory cards and hard drives around the world. If Zink's thermal printing process sounds familiar, it differs from D2T2 (dye diffusion thermal transfer), or dye sublimation technology, used by other companies such as Kodak, Canon or Sony, in one crucial aspect -- Zink paper is an advanced composite material with embedded yellow, magenta and cyan dye crystals that change color when heated. "The source of heat conveyed to the printer head is similar," says Steve Herchen, one of Zink's original inventors and present chief technology officer. If the combo-device doesn't appeal immediately to all die-hard digerati, it might be more likely to win over Polaroid Instamatic nostalgics, or anyone keen on wallet-sized snaps and Japanese-style "purikura" photo-sticker booths.
