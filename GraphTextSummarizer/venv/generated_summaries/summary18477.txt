-- In-demand Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas has revealed that his future has still to be decided, amid continued reports linking him with a return to boyhood club Barcelona. However, speaking at a promotional event in Madrid, Gunners captain Fabregas -- a member of Spain's Euro 2008 and 2010 World Cup winnings squads -- said: "I haven't yet spoken to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The 24-year-old Fabregas has made no secret of his affection for Barcelona and that came to a head after the last year's World Cup victory, when he admitted he wanted to rejoin the club he left in 2003. Fabregas left the Catalan giants to sign for Arsenal as a 16-year-old, but has been linked with a return in recent years, speculation that has intensified with the London club now six seasons without winning a trophy.
