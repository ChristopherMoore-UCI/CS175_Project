-- He may have written his name into national folklore less than a week ago but Germany's World Cup winning captain Philipp Lahm has decided to go out at the top by announcing his retirement from international football Friday. Team manager and former international Germany international striker Oliver Bierhoff added: "Philipp is an absolute role model as a player and person. He informed Germany coach Joachim Low of his decision on Monday over breakfast. This was a role he played in the early games of the 2014 World Cup before reverting to right back after injury to Shkodran Mustafi. Lahm made his debut for Germany in a 2-1 victory over Croatia in February 2004 and became German captain prior to the 2010 World Cup after injury to then captain Michael Ballack.
