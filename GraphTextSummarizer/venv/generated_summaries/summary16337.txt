" Other committee probes The Intelligence panel, along with several other House committees, has spent the past two years interviewing witnesses and examining evidence about the Obama administration's response to the attacks and the related controversy that has been a flashpoint between Republicans and President Barack Obama over his conduct of foreign policy. "There is more work to be done and more to be investigated," a spokeswoman for House Select Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy told CNN on Wednesday. The GOP-led House Select Committee on the Benghazi terror attack shows no sign of backing down despite a report from another congressional panel that, according to a top Democrat, found no intelligence failures around the deadly 2012 assault. CNN reached out to Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers for comment on the panel's report but did not receive a response. The plan now is to declassify the Intelligence Committee report and make it public.
