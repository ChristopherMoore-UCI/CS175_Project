Juniper and Violet are best friends who are both battling the same rare form of cancer. When Make-A-Wish decided to grant Juniper's wish to go to Disneyland, asking Violet to break the news seemed the obvious choice. Violet always wanted to meet Mickey Mouse and Juniper is a huge Minnie Mouse fan. Dressed in the same glittering Cinderella costume she wore on her own Make-A-Wish trip, Violet twirls around her bedroom, bubbling with excitement. Ouellette says Juniper's trip to Disneyland helped her heal after the emotional and physical toll of her cancer treatment.
