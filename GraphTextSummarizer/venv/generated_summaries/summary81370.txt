-- Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki has fired Spanish coach Ricardo Sanchez after just two months and decided to return to working with her father Piotr. This year's entry list includes new No. 1 and Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka. Christensen said Wozniacki is also now facing criticism from a vocal minority of Danish tennis fans who find it hard to identify with her lifestyle. Christensen said the tactical advice Sanchez gave Wozniacki during last month's Melbourne grand slam appeared to be ignored by the 21-year-old. " Wozniacki will look to return to winning ways at this month's WTA tournament in Qatar, where last year she lost in the final.
