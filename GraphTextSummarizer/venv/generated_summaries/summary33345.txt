" "Republicans' blind obedience to the shadowy billionaire Koch brothers is on full display today," Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said in a statement. "Senate staff receive publicly funded salaries for the performance of official duties and no campaign or electoral activities should take place on Senate time, or using official Senate equipment or facilities. "Nothing says 'Republicans are the party of the top one percent' like lashing out with meritless complaints as a screen to defend the Koch brothers as they rig the system to benefit billionaires like themselves. A spokesman for Sen. Harry Reid dismissed as "meritless" an ethics complaint filed Wednesday by Republicans that charges the majority leader improperly used his government-funded website and Twitter account for partisan political purposes. Moreover, criticism the Koch brothers is akin to criticisms of other public figures or organizations that are the focus of public officials from those producing violent video games to corporate welfare complaints."
