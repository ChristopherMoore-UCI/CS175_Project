-- The leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- collectively known as the fast-growing BRICS economies -- began arriving Wednesday in New Delhi amid protests from Tibetan groups against the arrival of Chinese President Hu Jintao. A Tibetan demonstrator who set himself ablaze in protest against Beijing died of his injuries Wednesday, officials at New Delhi's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital said. Authorities in New Delhi banned protest gatherings around the city's key government and embassy district where the BRICS summit will be held. South Africa was asked to join last year, although many economists -- including O'Neill, who coined the term -- question whether South Africa has the global economic importance of the other four emerging economies. President Barack Obama nominated an American to lead the World Bank, despite calls from BRICS for the U.S. to break with tradition and nominate a bank chief from the developing world.
