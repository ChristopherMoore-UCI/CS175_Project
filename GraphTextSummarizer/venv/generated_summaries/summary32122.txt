As many as 37 others were wounded as militants, one of whom was disguised as a police officer, battled security guards and police in and around the high-security complex that houses Parwan governor Abdul Basir Salangi, according to provincial council head Ahmad Zaki Zahid and Mer Alam, a local hospital spokesman. NATO gunships circled overhead as Afghan security forces responded to the strike, according to Capt. It comes just as international forces are drawing down and transferring security responsibilities over to local and national control. NATO helicopters also supported local security forces in responding to that incident, which left 19 people dead and 37 wounded. Salangi is alive and the gun-battle between insurgents and security forces has ended, said Roshan Khalid, the governor's spokesman.
