The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday approved the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to become the nation's fourth female Supreme Court justice, setting up a final confirmation vote by the Senate. "Elena Kagan is one of this country's leading legal minds, and has shown throughout this process that, if confirmed, she would be a fair and impartial Supreme Court Justice who understands how decisions made by the Court affect the lives of everyday Americans," President Barack Obama said after the vote. Among other things, the committee's Republicans highlighted Kagan's role in limiting military recruiters at Harvard Law School because of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which bars openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service. " Kagan has demonstrated a "keen intellect," "judicial modesty," and respect for legal precedent, said Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wisconsin. Graham -- also the lone committee Republican to back Justice Sonia Sotomayor's nomination last year -- said he had "100 reasons" to oppose Kagan's nomination on philosophical grounds.
