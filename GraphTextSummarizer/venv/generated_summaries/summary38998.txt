The MV Frigia, a Turkish-owned and Maltese-flagged cargo vessel, had been headed east from Port Said in Egypt to Kaousichang in Thailand. The waters off the Somali coast -- the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean -- have been plagued by Somali pirates. Also, the Bermuda-flagged and Virgin Islands-owned MV Talca was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden, EU NAVFOR said. -- A pirate was killed and several others were detained after a security team thwarted an attack in waters off Somalia, authorities said Wednesday. The ship had been heading from Sokhna, Egypt, to Busheir, Iran.
