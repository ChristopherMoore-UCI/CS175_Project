Photographer Laurence Rasti, the Swiss-born daughter of Iranian parents, flew from her home in Geneva, to Denizli to explore her fascination with identity issues in Iran. " Rasti, whose yearlong project was part of her studies at Ecole Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne, said that when she first went to Turkey, it was difficult to get people to pose. Many come to Turkey, and the small town of Denizli is host to hundreds of gays and lesbians from Iran who are now in limbo. When people are afraid of something or don't accept something, I think we should talk about it." Laurence Rasti is a Swiss-born Iranian photographer based in Geneva. "I couldn't understand that in Iran (homosexuality) isn't accepted," she said recently by phone from Geneva.
