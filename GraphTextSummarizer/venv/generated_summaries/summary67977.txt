Former Tampa police officer Curtis Reeves is in custody, accused of shooting Chad Oulson at the Wesley Chapel, Florida, movie theater on January 13. Chad Oulson's wife, Nicole Oulson, appeared on ABC's "Good Morning America" Thursday to give her recollections of that day. "The real pain is in my heart and that will take a long time, if ever, to get over." Reeves, 71, got into an altercation with Chad Oulson because he was texting the couple's babysitter during the previews for "Lone Survivor," police said. According to the incident report, Reeves told police he was hit with an "unknown object" in the face, and then, fearing he was being attacked, pulled a handgun from his pocket and shot Chad Oulson. A defense attorney, who tried and failed to get a judge to grant the Reeves bail, said that the former police officer was the victim and that Chad Oulson was the agressor.
