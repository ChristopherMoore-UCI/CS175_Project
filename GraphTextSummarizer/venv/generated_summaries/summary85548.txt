Maybe we can help our friends in Africa and ourselves by supporting African LGBTI in their efforts to strike at the Western roots of "African homophobia." While Africa is not alone in this apparent trend, the vehemence of some of the homophobia, and the way it is being linked to pan-African struggles against Western imperialism, is striking. Their triumph in that case will surely be a bigger blow for the global cause of human rights than cutting off aid or imposing other sanctions on African people. Many of the factors contributing to the recent homophobic turn in African politics have their roots outside of Africa. There has been an explosion of culturally sensitive scholarship by an emerging generation of African researchers that undermines homophobic claims.
