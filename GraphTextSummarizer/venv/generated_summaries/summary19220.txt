Guinness editor-in-chief Craig Glenday traveled to the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu, where he oversaw the official measurements of Chandra at medical clinic. "I'm very happy that I'm being recognized by Guinness World Records and that my name will be written in book," Chandra said after he was awarded the two Guinness certificates. A forest contractor who was cutting timber in Rhimkholi brought Chandra's height to the attention of local media, Guinness said on its website. According to Guinness, Chandra lives in Rhimkholi, an isolated mountain village some 400 kilometers west of Kathmandu. Chandra Bahadur Dangi, who says he's 72, earned the title with a height of 54.6 centimeters (21.5 inches), Guinness World Records announced Sunday.
