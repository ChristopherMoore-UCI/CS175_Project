The service said it planned to complete 7,000 extra delivery routes Sunday, bringing packages, cards and letters to a million homes and addresses in an effort to catch up on deliveries during what it calls Britain's coldest December in decades. -- Britain's Royal Mail has added nearly 14,000 extra rounds for its postal deliverers, hoping to clear a huge holiday backlog caused by winter weather woes. "This is already the worst December weather the UK has seen for almost 30 years," Mark Higson, managing director of Royal Mail, said in a statement. About 6,500 extra deliveries were made last Sunday in the areas hardest hit by the severe weather, Royal Mail said. Tuesday is the deadline for first-class mail and packets that customers want to arrive in time for Christmas, Royal Mail said.
