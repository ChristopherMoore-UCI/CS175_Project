-- Three bombings targeted Shiite pilgrims Monday in and around Karbala, Iraq, killing at least 33 people, officials said. Earlier, at least 13 people died when a car bomb exploded in a Karbala bus station crowded with Shiite pilgrims, who had traveled to the city for a religious observance, according to the Interior Ministry. An hour after the bus station bombing, a roadside bomb targeting Shiite pilgrims exploded in Karbala, wounding six people. The dead and wounded included women and children, and were among the hundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims who have gathered in Karbala for the observance. A suicide car bombing in the small town of Twareej, just outside Karbala, killed at least 20 people and wounded 35 others, Interior Ministry officials said.
