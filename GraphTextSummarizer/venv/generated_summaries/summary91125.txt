If you weren't standing inside the Ford booth at the Detroit Auto Show, you'd think you were looking a new luxury car -- probably an import -- not the all-new, full-size 2010 Ford Taurus. AOL Autos: 2010 Ford Taurus photo gallery Even though the Taurus is a full-size car, the amount of passenger room still surprised us. On the safety front, the 2010 Taurus is well equipped with standards including six air bags (including two-row side canopy units), electronic stability control, ABS, traction control, automatic high beams, rain-sensing wipers, plus a post-crash feature that unlocks all doors, flashes the emergency flashers, and sounds the horn in an event of an airbag deployment. Ford engineers promise more roll stiffness and more responsive steering. One especially interesting option is what Ford is calling multi-contour front seats.
