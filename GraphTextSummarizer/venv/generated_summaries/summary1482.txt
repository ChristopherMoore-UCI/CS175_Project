Dewani's attorneys argued last year at the High Court in London that extradition to South Africa would breach his human rights under European law. Dewani is accused of hiring a crew of hit men to kill his wife, Anni Dewani, 28, during a taxi ride in Cape Town in 2010. " Radebe said the ruling is also a vote of confidence in the ability of Valkenberg Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Cape Town, and the correctional services to ensure Dewani is cared for in South Africa. But he said the ruling would not mean that Dewani would immediately be returned to South Africa, since he has further legal avenues to explore. -- A British man accused of orchestrating his wife's murder by hit men while they were on honeymoon in South Africa should be extradited to face trial, a London court ruled Wednesday.
