The death toll from earthquakes that rocked southwest China rose to 80 on Saturday, after the tremors destroyed roads and communication lines, and forced tens of thousands of evacuations, state media reported. Premier Wen Jiabao, who will direct rescue efforts, inspected stricken areas Saturday and visited the injured. Large rocks blocked roads, and communication lines and other infrastructure were downed, hampering rescue efforts. About 100,000 people have been evacuated and 100,000 others are in need of relocation, state media reported. More than 800 others were injured in the Friday quakes, according to Xinhua news agency.
