What else he has written: Mott is the author of two previous poetry collections, "We Call This Thing Between Us Love" and "...hide behind me..." Before he was a novelist: Mott worked for several years as a customer service representative for Verizon Wireless, fielding complaints in New York from angry customers. As his first novel hits shelves, Mott, who lives in rural North Carolina, says he's terrified and excited by his newfound fame. On a national level and on a personal level, I think it's everyone really trying to understand life and who they are versus people who have passed away. It's been fascinating, fun and a little bit scary at times. There were other people who had similar answers who had moved forward in life.
