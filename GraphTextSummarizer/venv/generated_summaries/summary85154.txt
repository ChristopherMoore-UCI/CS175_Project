White, the last defense witness in Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial, challenged the assumptions used by prosecution anesthesia expert Dr. Steven Shafer to conclude that Jackson's death was caused by an infusion of the surgical anesthetic propofol set up by Murray. The prosecution theory of how Jackson died requires "an incredible coincidence of circumstances" using a "befuddling" IV drip configuration and an "irrational" assumption about how Murray injected sedatives, Dr. Paul White testified. -- Michael Jackson probably died after he rapidly injected himself with a dose of the surgical anesthetic propofol on top of a large dose of sedatives he swallowed when Dr. Conrad Murray was away, the defense's propofol expert testified Friday. White also questioned Shafer's computer model conclusion that Murray gave Jackson at least nine four-milligram injections of the sedative lorazepam at regular intervals from 1:30 to 5 a.m. the day he died. Brother Jermaine Jackson's daughter, Autumn, and Randy's son, Randy Jackson Jr., also sat in court.
