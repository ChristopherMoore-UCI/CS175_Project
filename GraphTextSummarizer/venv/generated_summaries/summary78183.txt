As Spain prepares to play Honduras on Monday -- after losing to Switzerland in the first group game -- he talks to CNN about his heroes, football memories and fitting in games while doing promotion work. The second goal he scored against England [in 1986 World Cup) was so, so magnificent. Worst was the 2002 (World Cup). I would rather Spain wins the group and plays Portugal or Ivory Coast. My album "Euphoria" comes out in July and that means I am promoting it in all June and July.
