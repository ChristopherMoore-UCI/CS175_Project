In the field of conflict resolution, mediators help disputing parties peel back layers of difference until they reach common ground on which both parties can agree. But they also met faith leaders and civic activists of great vision and courage. In the Middle East, that common ground is our common ancestor Abraham. Rabbi Michael Melchior, the founder of Mosaica Center for Inter-Religious Cooperation and a former member of the Israeli Cabinet, is working with Dr. Abdul Rahman Abbad, the secretary general of the Muslim Council of Religious Leaders in Palestine, to moderate the views of extremist religious leaders.
