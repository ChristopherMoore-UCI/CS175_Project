Zimbabwe's rainy season peaks in January or February and ends in late March, and Zimbabwean Health Minister David Parirenyatwa warned the epidemic could get worse during the rainy season. The epidemic has been aggravated by erratic water supplies, shortages of water purification chemicals, broken water and sewer pipes and uncollected garbage. Children can be seen playing on heaps of uncollected garbage in the suburbs of most urban areas in Zimbabwe. The country already was wracked by an enormous economic crisis, with a hyperinflationary economy and shortages of all essentials including food, fuel, cash, foreign currency and electricity. The number of cholera deaths in Zimbabwe is now approaching 3,000, the World Health Organization says.
