"It would create a bizarre anomaly to immunize corporations from liability for the conduct of their agents in lawsuits brought for 'shockingly egregious violations of universally recognized principles of international law,'" wrote Judge Judith Rogers in a detailed, 112-page opinion. -- Global energy giant Exxon Mobil Corp. will be forced to face a lawsuit over alleged murder and torture committed by company agents in remote Indonesia, after a federal appeals court said Friday that corporations cannot claim immunity from liability. The plaintiffs alleged company officials in Indonesia were aware the military had committed past human rights violations. A key sticking point in the legal fight was the level of control Exxon Mobil officials in Aceh had over the actions of the Indonesian military. The issue may eventually reach the Supreme Court, since lower federal courts have disagreed on the liability of conduct by U.S. companies operating around the world.
