Adding to Friday's better-than-expected growth figures, China's industrial production increased to 10.3% year-on-year versus expectations of 10.2% growth. Retail sales rose 15.2% year-on-year, also a 0.1% point increase over expectations. Last quarter, China's economy grew at a pace of 7.9%, slightly better than analyst expectations and breaking a pattern of seven straight quarters of decline. While such growth would be the envy of most nations, China's economy has grown at an average rate of about 10% each year for the past 30 years. China's growth rate had been steadily falling since the fourth quarter of 2010, when economic output grew 9.8%.
