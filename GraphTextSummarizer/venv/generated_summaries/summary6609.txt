Eliasch says Head is "suffering" from a depreciation in the yen, following Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the Bank of Japan's implementation of a $117 billion stimulus package to boost growth. After Europe's long winter, Head reported a 13.1% decline in sportswear sales in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the previous year. Eliasch tells CNN that the weather has more ability to cast a shadow over business than financial markets. -- While the eyes of the corporate world remain fixed on the financial markets, the boss of sportswear giant Head just needs to look skywards to forecast if business will be sunny or gloomy. But while results disappoint off the court, the summer months have brought Grandslam success on-court with British tennis player Andy Murray using a Head racquet to win Wimbledon and end Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion.
