Ratagarama first became involved with mountain gorillas in 1990, when he worked as a plant researcher for the Karisoke Research Centre, in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda. The sheer numbers of displaced people could have spelt the end for Volcanoes National Park, but it was Ratagarama's persistent efforts and intense lobbying that ensured huge areas of wildlife were preserved, as the country struggled to resettle more than two million people. You would see the bodies of dead people, thousands of people. Ratagarama and his team are at the forefront of eco-tourism, with the money they make going towards the preservation of mountain gorillas and the neighboring communities near the parks. -- Scientist and conservationist Eugene Ratagarama has spent 20 years protecting Africa's endangered mountain gorillas in war-torn Rwanda.
