Seal gives shark the slip in great white photo Waddington said while the oarfish's carcass is still being preserved in ice, Catalina Island Marine Institute has been sending some of its tissues and other samples to marine scientists, including Dr. Milton Love, a fish expert from University of California at Santa Barbara, to study its DNA and diet habits. " "It is believed that oarfish dive over 3,000 feet deep, which leaves them largely unstudied, and little is known about their behavior or population." Waddington, who has been with Catalina Island Marine Institute since 1994, said it remains unclear why the oarfish was found in shallow water this time, but it appeared to have died naturally. "I was first a little scared," said Santana, who has been working for Catalina Island Marine Institute since January. Waddington said Catalina Island Marine Institute will likely to keep the fish's skeleton for educational purposes. "It's so rare to find in Southern California, especially in surface water," Kohin told KGTV.
