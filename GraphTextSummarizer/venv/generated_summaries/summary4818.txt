"If they did shoot the tires out, the car can keep moving." Maki Haberfeld, chairwoman of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, added that police would have had no way of knowing whether Carey posed a threat as she got out of the car, and therefore the shooting was justified. On October 3, Carey approached a White House checkpoint and was approached by Secret Service officers. Carey put the car in reverse, hit a police car and drove away as officers fired at her. Carey panicked when she was stopped near the traffic circle and surrounded by officers with their weapons drawn, the suit alleges. Carey had passport, foreign currency in her car Police likely feared terrorism Law enforcement analysts said in the days after the shooting that officers were right to shoot.
