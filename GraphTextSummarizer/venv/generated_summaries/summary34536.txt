Google Street View, the interactive panorama feature within Google Maps, has shared eye-level images of Antarctica, gone inside NASA's Kennedy Space Center, floated down rivers in the Amazon and strolled the halls of famous museums. "Until we make coral reefs and the important ecosystem in the ocean relevant to people on the planet, we're not going to get action." "If you want to reach millions of people worldwide, the first place you knock on the door is Google," said Richard Vevers, project director of the Catlin Seaview Survey. Google has used cars, trikes, snowmobiles and people outfitted with custom cameras to capture 360-degree images around the world. The company on Wednesday added panoramic undersea images of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the waters off the Apo Islands in the Philippines and underwater life around the Hawaiian islands.
