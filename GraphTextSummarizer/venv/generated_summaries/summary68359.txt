-- Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb army commander who went on trial Wednesday for crimes against humanity, is a notorious name synonymous with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Balkan wars of the 1990s and the bloody assaults on Sarajevo and Srebrenica. Interpol called Mladic "Europe's most wanted war crimes suspect" while Amnesty International's law chief Widney Brown said "at last the people who suffered have hope he will be brought to justice." In the court room at The Hague last year Mladic appeared to have lost none of his visceral dislike of his enemies. A French policeman who collected evidence from Bosnian Muslims, Jean-Rene Ruez, told The Hague tribunal in 1996 that Bosnian Serb forces killed and tortured refugees in Srebrenica at will. Key dates in hunt for Mladic U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a "historic day for international justice.
