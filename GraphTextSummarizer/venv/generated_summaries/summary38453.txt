Lorenzo, 24, is guaranteed second place in the world championship due to the 48-point lead he holds over third-place Honda rider Andrea Dovizioso. This weekend's race will be the first since Italian rider Marco Simoncelli was tragically killed in a crash in Malaysia on October 23. In addition, riders will gather on track prior to Sunday's season-ending race to their own tribute to Simoncelli -- who raced for the Honda team. "Lorenzo continues to make good progress in recovery following plastic surgery to repair damage to the ring finger of his left hand sustained in Phillip Island three weeks ago," read a statement on the sport's official website. "The Mallorcan's injuries require further recovery time to allow him to ride at a competitive level."
