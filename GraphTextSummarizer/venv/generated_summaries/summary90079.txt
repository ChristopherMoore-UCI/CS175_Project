A shark researcher made the determination after examining the body of Francisco Javier Solorio Jr., who was bitten on the left side of his upper torso Tuesday, the statement said. Solorio, who was from Orcutt, just two miles from Vandenberg, wasn't affiliated with the military base, said a Vandenberg spokeswoman. The shark attacked when the 39-year-old was riding waves with three friends off a beach at Vandenberg Air Force Base. Ransom was a junior at University of California at Santa Barbara and was majoring in chemical engineering. -- A great white shark was responsible for killing a surfer in Southern California this week, authorities said Wednesday.
