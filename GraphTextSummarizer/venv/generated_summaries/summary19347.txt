Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho might also be seeing red after his side's first Premier League defeat in 265 days. Manchester City ticked off a 1-0 victory over Everton to close to within three points of league leaders Chelsea with 15 matches played. German champions Bayern Munich remain unbowed in the Bundesliga, Paris St Germain are unbeaten in Ligue 1 while, in Portugal, FC Porto are yet to be defeated in Primeria Liga. Newcastle held on to a satisfying 2-1 home win despite seeing Stephen Taylor sent off for a second bookable offense and a late header from Chelsea striker Didier Droga. Until Saturday's knockout blow at Newcastle, Chelsea had been included in a select band of European sides to make a flawless start to their league campaigns.
