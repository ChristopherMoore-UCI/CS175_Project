Police sources said the former Democratic congressman refused to reveal passwords to encrypted files, which officials said contained pornographic material. -- A court in Zimbabwe sentenced former U.S. Rep. Melvin Reynolds to a $100 fine or five days in prison, coupled with immediate deportation, after he pleaded guilty Friday to flouting the country's immigration laws. A magistrates' court cleared Reynolds of a second charge of being found in possession of pornographic material after the prosecution failed to produce authority from the prosecutor-general to proceed with the case. He resigned three years later, shortly after his conviction on charges of criminal sexual assault, obstruction of justice and solicitation of child pornography in a case stemming from his relationship with a 16-year-old campaign worker. Reynolds was first elected to represent Illinois' 2nd Congressional District in 1992.
