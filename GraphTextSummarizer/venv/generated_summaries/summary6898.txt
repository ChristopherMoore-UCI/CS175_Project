On Sunday, defending champion and 11th seed Kim Clijsters saved four match points as she overcame the opponent she beat in last year's Australian Open Makarova's two previous grand slam appearances -- at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year -- ended with losses in the first round as she faded from a career-high 29th in the rankings -- a position she reached with last-16 appearances in Melbourne and at the French Open. Fifth seed Li took full advantage of Clijsters' discomfort by taking the first set, but the Belgian showed typical resilience when she leveled the match after a dramatic tie break, during which she faced match point four times. It was their first meeting since last year's Wimbledon semifinals, when Sharapova also won before losing in the final. I know that I can play a hundred times better than I did this whole tournament." Sharapova, the 2008 champion, secured her place in the last eight as she came from behind to beat German 14th seed Sabine Lisicki 2-6 6-2 6-3 in the late match.
