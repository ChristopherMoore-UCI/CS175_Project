Anelka, who has hit 11 goals in 42 international appearances, suffered a thigh injury in Saturday's 6-0 thrashing of the Faroe Islands and has returned to his English Premier League club for treatment. LONDON, England -- French Euro 2008 qualification hopes were dealt a blow on Monday when Bolton striker Nicolas Anelka was ruled out of the critical midweek qualifier against Lithuania in Nantes. France must win their final two Group B games -- they complete their program away to Ukraine on November 21 -- if they are to be sure of a place in next year's finals to be jointly hosted by Austria and Switzerland. Les Bleus are currently in third place one point behind Italy and two points adrift of group leaders Scotland who play in Georgia on Wednesday. Bolton striker Anelka celebrates his goal in Saturday's 6-0 victory against the Faroe Islands.
