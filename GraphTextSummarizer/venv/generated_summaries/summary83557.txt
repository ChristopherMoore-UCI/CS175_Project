The four groups jointly calling for charges to be dropped are Amnesty International, the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), Front Line Defenders and Human Rights Watch. All were arrested on the heels of a recent decision by the UAE's government to dissolve the elected board of directors of the Jurist Association, a prominent civil rights organization in that country, and replace it with state appointees, according to Human Rights Watch. The groups accuse UAE authorities of misusing the defamation charges "as a pretext" to punish the activists for peacefully expressing their opinions, they said in a statement. " Human Rights Watch has accused UAE authorities of acting against its own free speech guarantees as well as those propagated by regional and international provisions. He is a "leading human rights activist who had publicly called for political freedoms and an elected parliament," Human Rights Watch said.
