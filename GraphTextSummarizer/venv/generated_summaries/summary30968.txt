Earlier this week, Jean challenged media reports that he would not be eligible to run, but also entertained the possibility that he would be declared ineligible, telling CNN on Thursday that he would continue organizing Haiti's youth to push for education reform. Jean's name was not on the list of 19 approved candidates released by Haiti's Provisional Electoral Council on Friday night. Port-Au-Prince, Haiti -- Haitian election officials have rejected hip-hop singer Wyclef Jean's bid to run for president of the Caribbean nation. "I want to assure my countrymen that I will continue to work for Haiti's renewal; though the board has determined that I am not a resident of Haiti, home is where the heart is -- and my heart has and will always be in Haiti," Jean's statement said. Jean's eligibility had been under question recently after claims that he had not lived in Haiti for five consecutive years before the election, a requirement in the nation's constitution.
