Some told WZTV that officers went house to house Monday night to check mailboxes for devices. "It doesn't make sense at all," family friend Ken Caldwell told CNN affiliate WTVF. His wife, 72-year-old Marion Setzer, was seriously injured and airlifted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. "Of course it makes us a little anxious to go check our own mailbox when we see something like this happen, because normally boxes are delivered and mail is delivered, and you don't question it," neighbor Tony Dedman told the affiliate. The agency said mail bombs often have similar characteristics, such as a fake or non-existent return address.
