NBA star Shaquille O'Neal praises Karen Earl for her efforts on behalf of domestic abuse victims. " For more than two decades, Earl has helped give victims a way out through the Jenesse Center, which provides shelter, education, outreach and legal services to more than 8,500 victims of domestic violence every year. As executive director of the Jenesse Center, the oldest domestic violence intervention program in south central Los Angeles, California, Earl is a "tireless and fearless" champion of women and children living in abusive situations, O'Neal said. Earl has heard countless stories of domestic abuse and has seen a range of tipping points before victims seek help. "She takes women that have been involved in domestic abuse situations and gives them a place to come rest their head."
