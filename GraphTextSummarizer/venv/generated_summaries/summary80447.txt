This is a Flaming Lips video which features Erykah Badu and her sister Nayrok and is not meant to be considered an Erykah Badu or Nayrok statement, creation, or approved version." The "heady fwendship" between Erykah Badu and Wayne Coyne, formed on the grounds of her guest feature on "The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends" Record Store Day LP, has hit a rough patch. "First: You showed me a concept of beautiful tasteful imagery (by way of vid text messages). In the video, Badu soaks naked in a bathtub singing the airy lyrics, interrupted by shots of her little sister Nayrok getting deluged by liquid corn starch, gold glitter and a milky substance. While Badu first called "The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" video "cosmic" in a tweet, she criticizes Coyne for releasing an unapproved version of the visuals, and she went as far as calling him "self serving" in the TwitLonger message.
