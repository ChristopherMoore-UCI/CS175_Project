A post Friday on its Facebook page said that the Traumatic Stress Response Team (Mental Health Support) and Emergency Family Assistance Control Center (EFACC) had been activated at the base chapel. Buckley AFB in Aurora, Colorado, is the closest military base to the scene of the shootings. About 10,000 troops -- including members of the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps -- are stationed at Buckley. -- U.S. troops were among the casualties in the shooting rampage at the Colorado movie theater, including a sailor who was listed as unaccounted for, the Pentagon said Friday. The DoD statement also said that the suspect, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces.
