-- Bolivian President Evo Morales plans to sign legislation Friday scheduling a May 4 referendum on a new constitution, the Bolivian Information Agency reported. "Now it is the Bolivian people who will decide with their vote whether to approve or reject the new constitution," said Vice President Alvaro Garcia Linera, according to the Bolivian Information Agency. The proposed constitution would strengthen the country's indigenous majority but has faced fierce opposition from nonindigenous Bolivians, including those in four provinces whose governors have declared autonomy. Watch as the crowds block the opposition Â» Congress made its decision to hold a referendum "with a reduced presence of opposition lawmakers," the Bolivian news agency said. Hundreds jammed streets Thursday outside the congressional building in La Paz to prevent opposition legislators from entering.
