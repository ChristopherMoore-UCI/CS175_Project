A Georgia truck driver has been charged in a New Jersey wreck that left comedian Tracy Morgan in critical condition and another man dead, authorities said Saturday. Christopher Thompson, spokesman for limo owner Atlantic Transportation Services, said driver Tyrone Gale, who is part owner of the company, was shaken up. Thompson said he thought the limo bus was heading to drop Morgan off in New Jersey. " Morgan, 45, was a regular on "Saturday Night Live" for seven years and received an Emmy nomination for his role on "30 Rock," in which he played Tracy Jordan, an exaggerated version of himself. The prosecutor's statement said Morgan and two others, whose identities have not been formally released, remain hospitalized in critical condition.
