If a California judge overseeing the divorce of Frank and Jamie McCourt orders that the Dodgers be put up for sale, Los Angeles Councilwoman Janice Hahn is prepared: she has already introduced legislation calling on Major League Baseball to give fans an opportunity to buy the team.

In another landmark, mellifluous broadcaster Vin Scully this year entered an unprecedented 62nd season announcing Dodgers baseball. The truth is that this team belongs to the fans; and we should have a chance at purchasing the Dodgers if they are sold," said Hahn, who added that her late father, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, was responsible for bringing the team to Los Angeles in the 1950s. Los Angeles, CNN  -- As one of the most successful franchises in Major League  Baseball history, the Los Angeles Dodgers opened the 2011 season with a victory over the World Champion San Francisco Giants.
