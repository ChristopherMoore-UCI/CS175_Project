See all of CNN Living's New York Fashion Week coverage Fall 2014 will be all about Americana and wild, wild West inspiration with fringe scarves, frayed edges, equestrian-inspired boots and blanket coats leading the charge, says Sheila Aimette of fashion forecaster WGSN, the official trend sponsor of the biannual Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. (Chanel's MÃ©tiers d'Art collection for 2013/2014 even took place at Fair Park in Dallas). On a similar wavelength, Aimette expects a rise in heritage fabrics like plaid, houndstooth and gingham, but re-colored in bright hues. Despite more impending snow and ice potentially impacting attendees' footwear flair, New York Fashion Week will take place February 6-13.
