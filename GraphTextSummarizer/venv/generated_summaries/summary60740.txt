Other e-mails among those released were purportedly from Holmes, usually signed with "Cheers, James Holmes." -- Thousands of e-mails released Wednesday by the university once attended by the Colorado movie theater shooting suspect reveal James Holmes may have once had a romantic relationship with a fellow graduate student and possibly had two badges for the campus at the time of the attack. The University of Colorado at Denver, in response to media requests for Holmes' records, released more than 3,800 e-mails that were sent or received by Holmes or mentioned his name in the text. "She knows, and is pretty freaked out." Also Wednesday, CNN affiliate KMGH reported sources said Holmes began to fantasize about killing "a lot of people" in early June, nearly six weeks before the shootings. Many of the ones that weren't were sent between university officials in the aftermath of the killings, including one sent about seven hours later with the subject line "Horrible News." The professor who wrote the e-mail wonders if the suspect is the James Holmes she knows and asks others if they think it would be wise to meet with the students who may have had class with him.
