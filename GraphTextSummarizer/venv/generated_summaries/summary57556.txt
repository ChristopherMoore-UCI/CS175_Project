-- Between 20 and 25 employees of NBC's "The Tonight Show" have been laid off and host Jay Leno has taken a substantial pay cut, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told CNN on Saturday. O'Brien now hosts a show, "Conan," on TBS that, like CNN, is a division of Time Warner. Leno replaced the legendary Johnny Carson as host of "The Tonight Show" in 1992, a job he held for 17 years when he left in 2009 to helm "The Jay Leno Show" with a 10 p.m. start time. The Massachusetts-raised comic's venture into prime time three years ago was pitched as an attempt by the network to parlay his proven popularity into a commercially successful show. The actions were taken as NBC seeks to move the show to a cost structure typical of late-night programming, as opposed to prime-time shows, according to the source.
