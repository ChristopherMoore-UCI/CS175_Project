My early days in the mobile revolution Does it matter much whether it's night or day, spring or fall, home or the office? In a blended world, work does tend to win out over other parts of life. This melding of work and home, of course, is an old story. In frantically integrating work and home, we stray perilously close to diluting both. Shattering my romantic views on what it was like to live a few easy steps from work -- literally over the store -- the family's elderly patriarch told me that his parents couldn't wait to move to the suburbs and put some distance between family and work.
