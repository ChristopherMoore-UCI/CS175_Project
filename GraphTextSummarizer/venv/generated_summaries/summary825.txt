Panetta urged Karzai to work closely with Allen to strengthen ISAF-Afghan cooperation to counter the threat, "including augmented counterintelligence measures, even more rigorous vetting of Afghan recruits, and stepped up engagement with village elders, who often play a key role by vouching for Afghan security personnel," Little said. On Sunday, three ISAF service members were also killed in an improvised explosive device attack in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF said. Even as NATO blamed the majority of attacks on personal grievances rather than an infiltration by insurgents, ISAF commanding Gen. John Allen ordered all troops in the country to carry loaded weapons around the clock. The attacks come at a critical time for the United States, which has picked up the pace of training Afghan forces as it prepares to withdraw troops by the end of 2014. The telephone call between the two leaders came the same day a NATO airstrike killed a senior Taliban leader in the Kunar province, along Afghanistan's northern border with Pakistan, ISAF said in a statement released Sunday.
