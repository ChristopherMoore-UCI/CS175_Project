So we're going to do everything we can to make sure that when our troops come home they come home to new jobs and new opportunities and new ways to serve their country." Under the blueprint, the administration will award $166 million in grant money to communities that show a preference for hiring post-9/11 veterans for new law enforcement positions. Among the president's few jobs proposals to clear Congress last year were new tax credits for businesses that hire recent veterans. That initiative, to be overseen by the Department of Interior, would put veterans to work in visitor and tourism-related jobs as well as positions that will assist in general upkeep and maintenance roles throughout the country's public parks and nature preserves. In addition, $320 million in grant money will be awarded to various fire departments who pledge to hire and train new veterans.
