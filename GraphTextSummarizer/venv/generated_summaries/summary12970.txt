Pipeline operator TransCanada says on its website that the $13 billion pipeline "will play an important role in linking a secure and growing supply of Canadian crude oil with the largest refining markets in the United States, significantly improving North American security supply.

Michael Brune, the Sierra Club's executive director, said from the rally that he felt the activist push against the pipeline is surging. -- Thousands of protesters held hands and encircled the White House grounds on Sunday, demanding President Barack Obama reject a proposed oil pipeline that would stretch between Canada and Texas. "Folks in Nebraska, like folks all across the country, aren't going to say to themselves, 'We're going to take a few thousand jobs if it means our kids are potentially drinking water that would damage their health,'" Obama said.
