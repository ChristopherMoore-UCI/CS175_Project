In the national memory, the townsman or townswoman would always say: "Who was that masked man?" In reality, the exact words would vary from episode to episode. The producer and his take-no-prisoners lawyers went relentlessly after Clayton Moore, telling him that he could no longer wear the Lone Ranger mask in public, threatening him with harsh and dire legal sanctions. The Lone Ranger -- played by the incomparable Clayton Moore -- would have finished doing laudable deeds and fighting injustice in whatever Western town to which that week's plot had taken him and Tonto. Eisenhower was a person who instinctively understood the Lone Ranger ethos -- he knew that if a man has done his work well enough, he doesn't have to proclaim it. But the real service they will be providing to the country is if they have had the good judgment to emphasize the best lesson the Lone Ranger taught.
