Detectives say they want to speak to a cab driver who picked him up in Bishopsgate, in London's financial district, at 1900 GMT on Tuesday, and drove him to Byng Street, where he got out of the taxi shortly before 1930 GMT. German Gorbuntsov, 45, was shot several times last Tuesday evening, as he walked into an apartment block on Byng Street in the Isle of Dogs, near the Canary Wharf business district. Authorities in London want Russia to extradite Andrei Lugovoi, suspected in the killing, but Russia has repeatedly refused. London's Metropolitan Police say they are treating the shooting as attempted murder. No arrests have been made and police have not revealed details of the weapon used in the attack, though Russia's Kommersant daily reported that Gorbuntsov was shot with a sub-machine-gun.
