Muhammad Taman, a spokesman for the January 25 Coalition, told CNN the diverse collection of political groups are demanding Egyptian authorities bring ousted president Hosni Mubarak before a court for his alleged role in the deaths of hundreds of activists last January and February and on corruption charges. Some of the officers addressed the demonstration, demanding Egypt's ruling military council be replaced by a presidential committee of civillians. He was shown on Egyptian television Friday being escorted to a vehicle by uniformed Egyptian police while bystanders chanted, "Thief, thief!" An army lieutenant colonel and a military police officer tried to walk to the center of square, where they were surrounded by demonstrators who chanted "get out, get out," said journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who witnessed the incident. Demonstrators are protecting 15 army officers and soldiers who broke ranks with the Egyptian military and joined Friday's Tahrir Square protest, ignoring a warning from the top military brass that any uniformed troops participating in the rally would be arrested.
