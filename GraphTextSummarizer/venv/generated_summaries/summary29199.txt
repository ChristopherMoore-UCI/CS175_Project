It was taken by Louis Daguerre, the French photographer famous for pioneering the daguerreotype, an early type of photo produced on a silver plate or a silver-covered copper plate. That distinction belongs to a photo by Joseph NicÃ©phore NiÃ©pce, one of Daguerre's partners, who used a crude camera to capture the view from a window at his French estate in 1826 or 1827. The street appears deserted because while the two human figures were relatively still, other pedestrians and horse-drawn carriages were moving too fast to register on the plate. The photo shows the Boulevard du Temple, a then-fashionable area of shops, cafÃ©s and theaters. The image has been posted online before, but it gained a higher profile after news site Mashable published a full-page version on Wednesday in partnership with Retronaut, a website that archives photos from the past.
