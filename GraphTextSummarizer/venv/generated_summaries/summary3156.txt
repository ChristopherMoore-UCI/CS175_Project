Currently at the Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island, New York, the massive particle storage ring is scheduled to travel to another DOE facility at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in the suburbs of Chicago, where scientists hope it will help more accurately measure the properties of subatomic particles called muons. Should that value be substantially different from the value current equations predict, it could usher in a new era of particle physics, scientists say. -- A 50-foot-wide, 15-ton magnet is about to set out on a 3,200-mile barge-and-truck tour down the East Coast of the United States, around Florida and up from the Gulf to Chicago before going to work to measure one of the smallest particles known to science. The voyage, scheduled to begin on Saturday and end in July, will send the metal behemoth on a journey on trucks and barges. For safety, when it is on the road it will be traveling about 5 mph, so most of the highway portion will happen at night to limit traffic interference.
