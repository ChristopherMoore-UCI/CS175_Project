Their Italian restaurant, Tosca, is famous for creative Italian cooking and recently received one Michelin star after Pino Lavarra took over as executive chef. Lavarra says the idea of recreating gourmet restaurant experiences in the air will only ever be a concept. Cathay Pacific's partnership with Pino Lavarra and Tosca runs until July 31, 2014, on various long-haul and regional flights departing Hong Kong. He went one step further: Lavarra is serving the same in-flight meal at Tosca as a special four-course "first class menu" costing HK$1,400 ($180) per head. On a flight, it's a shorter meal, with Lavarra's special main course competing with other regular offerings.
