-- He overcame his nerves on Saturday, but Trevor Fisher Jnr. will have to do it all again if he wants to win his first European Tour title. Chris Kirk was third, another shot back on 11-under 203 after carding 64 on Saturday, while joint halfway leader Patrick Reed dropped to fourth following a 67. Schwartzel, the Joburg champion in 2010 and 2011, is looking for his third successive title after December victories at the Asian Tour's Thailand Open and the co-sanctioned Alfred Dunhill Championship held in Malalane near Kruger National Park. It was the ninth successive round in the 60s for last year's FedEx Cup winner Snedeker, seeking his first victory since September's Tour Championship win, which earned him a $10 million jackpot. The 33-year-old will have a shootout with fellow South African Richard Sterne at their home Joburg Open on Sunday after moving out to a five-shot lead over the rest of the field.
