I can recall that morning in Prague, watching Germans leave the crowded embassy grounds and board buses for their trip to West Germany. The next year they began allowing East Germans on Hungarian soil to leave for Austria as well. By November 4, the border was opened for East Germans, even while it still stood as a barrier to the citizens of Czechoslovakia themselves. -- I was a young traveling correspondent in the closing months of the Cold War, stunned like any other visitor from the West at the cruel tyranny that had endured for so many years in so many countries, amazed at how quickly it was toppled. The people of Prague stopped in their tracks to watch them take that coveted journey to freedom.
