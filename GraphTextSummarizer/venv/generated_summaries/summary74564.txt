"I view fashion as a means to present yourself before you open your mouth," said Weiss, the self-proclaimed "apparel chair" of his Alpha Tau Omega chapter. "Mentioning the Earth tones and cuffed trousers: He was aware that that little, two-inch strip of cloth at the bottom of your legs was somehow important, that that cuff somehow separated the men from the boys, the well-dressed from the not-well-dressed, the knowing from the not knowing." Understanding fashion is what Weiss feels he can contribute to Alpha Tau Omega. With colorful scarves and sport coats, the Ivy League elite pioneered casual, stylish men's fashion, said Boyer, who co-curated a recent exhibition of Ivy League fashion at the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. The young man's fashion takedown might seem like a bold change from the "Animal House" fraternity stereotype (and a bold move for a new brother), but according to G. Bruce Boyer, a contributing editor to Town & Country, the looks Weiss advocates have roots on campus. The current revival of Ivy League style, and the broader Americana look, is driven by close, fitted Italian tailoring and Japanese fashion sense, Boyer said.
