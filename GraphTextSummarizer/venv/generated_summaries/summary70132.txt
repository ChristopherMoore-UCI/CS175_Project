The ICC has called for al-Bashir's arrest on 10 counts of genocide and crimes against humanity, accusing him of masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in the Sudanese territory of Darfur in a campaign of murder, rape and deportation. The human rights group Amnesty International urged Egypt before the visit to either cancel the Sudanese leader or arrest him. In a statement issued Friday, Amnesty warned Egypt would become "a safe haven for alleged perpetrators of genocide" unless it took the Sudanese leader into custody. -- Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy met with Sudan's wanted President Omar al-Bashir in Cairo on Sunday as the Egyptian government dismissed calls for the visiting leader's arrest. The International Criminal Court has demanded al-Bashir's arrest on charges of war crimes.
