In Mexico, the Interior Ministry issued tsunami warnings that reflect a "moderate risk" for the country, warning tourists and fishermen in coastal areas. -- Tsunami waves that raced across the Pacific Ocean triggered warnings in more than 50 countries and territories Friday, but there were few immediate reports of major damage outside of Japan. Ships docked in open ports were heading back out to sea to avoid being hit by tsunami waves, the ministry said. The quake, which struck near the coast of Honshu, Japan, on Friday afternoon local time, unleashed powerful pulses in the Pacific. Tsunami waves can travel at speeds of 800 kilometers, or nearly 500 miles, per hour.
