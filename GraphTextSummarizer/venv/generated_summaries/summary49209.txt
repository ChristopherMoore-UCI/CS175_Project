Group: 31 Syrian troops die in bomb attack Beirut-based Middle East analyst Rami Khouri told CNN that Sunni jihadist groups have grown rapidly in the past decade and now threaten "everybody in the region. " CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Beirut; Matt Smith wrote from Atlanta. Tuesday's attack is the latest in a series of bombings, rocket attacks and killings that have spilled over from Syria's three-year civil war, which also has left Lebanon straining under the weight of more than 818,000 refugees, according to the United Nations. -- A pair of suicide bombs detonated outside the Iranian Embassy in Lebanon's capital Tuesday, killing nearly two dozen people in a bloody new ripple from neighboring Syria's civil war. In August, a pair of bombs ripped through neighborhoods near mosques in Tripoli, Lebanon, with ties to Syrian rebels.
