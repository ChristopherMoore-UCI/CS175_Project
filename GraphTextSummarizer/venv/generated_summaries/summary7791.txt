-- LeBron James led the much-vaunted Miami Heat to a morale-boosting Christmas Day victory over two-time defending NBA champions Los Angeles Lakers. "That's Miami Heat basketball," James told AFP. James notched 27 points with 10 assists and 11 rebounds for the 31st triple-double of his career in the 96-80 win in the heavyweight clash on the Lakers' home court. A disgruntled Bryant was kept to 17 points, clearly losing is battle with fellow superstar James and the tension was evident at the end as they exchanged words. Bryant's take: "I just asked him what he got for Christmas." Spain's Paul Gasol also scored 17 for the Lakers with Lamar Odom adding 14 points and nine rebounds, but they were well beaten.
