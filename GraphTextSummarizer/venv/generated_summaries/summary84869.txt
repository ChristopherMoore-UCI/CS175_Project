Moreover, there is growing evidence that the recent increase in cancers of the head and neck are also associated with HPV infection. By the summer of 2012, more than 46 million doses of the vaccine had been given in the United States -- almost all to girls because of early awareness of HPV's link to cervical cancer -- and adverse events from vaccines are closely monitored. It's important to remember that vaginal intercourse isn't the only type of sex that can result in HPV infection. We need to do a much better job of protecting women from HPV, and cervical cancer associated with HPV. A recent study of more than 1,300 patients with oral cancer found that more than 55% of them were infected with HPV.
