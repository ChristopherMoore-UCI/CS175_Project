The penalty followed serious crowd trouble during Partizan's 6-1 win at Bosnian rivals Zrinjski Mostar in last week's UEFA Cup first qualifying round first leg. BELGRADE, Serbia -- Partizan Belgrade are unlikely to appeal against their ban from the UEFA Cup, the Serbian first division club's deputy general secretary Gordan Petric said on Thursday. Earlier on Thursday, UEFA took the most drastic action against a Serbian club to date, banning them from European competition for one year and fining them 50,000 Swiss francs ($41.259). Police used tear gas to separate the home fans from departing Partizan supporters. There is little for the Partizan players to celebrate after UEFA's verdict.
