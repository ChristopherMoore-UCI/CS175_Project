-- A North Korean rocket slated for launch sometime early next month can be clearly seen in a satellite photograph taken Sunday, the Institute for Science and International Security said Sunday. The satellite imagery, obtained by the ISIS from DigitalGlobe, is said to show the rocket at the Musudan-ri launch site in northeastern North Korea. Gates said that impending missile launch is a clear demonstration of the failure of the recent six-party talks to disarm the North Korean regime. it says a lot about the imperviousness of this regime in North Korea to any kind of diplomatic overtures. The North Korean government says it will launch a commercial satellite atop a rocket sometime between April 4 and April 8.
