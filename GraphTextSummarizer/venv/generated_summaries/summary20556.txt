Nobody really knows, and the uncertainty has fed massive volatility in both the credit and equity markets across the world, driving the costs of global stocks dramatically lower and pushing both Europe and the U.S. -- which is also facing massive financial problems -- toward another recession. Black Wednesday was seen as proof a monetary union and European currency could not work, says Hans-Joachim Voth, research professor of economics at Barcelona's Universitat Pompeu Fabra. In 2009, Greece admitted its deficit would be more than 12% of gross domestic product -- far higher than previous estimates and more than four times the requirements of entry into the eurozone. Portugal followed, then Greece returned for more financial help. While the countries which have been bailed out have specific problems -- Greece's lax tax collection, and Ireland's black hole of a banking system, for example -- the problem has been exacerbated by a currency which shackles the weak to the strong, economists say.
