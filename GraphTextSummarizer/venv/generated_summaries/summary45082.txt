Indeed, a short while later, we heard loud gunshots as rebels hunted down Batista officials and supporters door-to-door. I remember a few days after the announcement of Batista's defeat, Castro started his procession down from the mountains and along Cuba's central highway to the capital, Havana. " Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista had fled the country in the middle of the night. Pardoned under a general amnesty in 1955, Castro fled to Mexico, where he continued to plot against Batista. Adopting guerrilla warfare tactics, Castro and his followers were able to inflict stinging defeats on Batista's army, which was mostly composed of young, untrained and unmotivated soldiers.
