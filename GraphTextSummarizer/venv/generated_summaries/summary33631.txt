The charges in the University of Florida case were filed Monday, two days before charges were announced against 13 people tied to an investigation into the case of Florida A&M University drum major Robert Champion -- The executive director of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc. said at the time that a cease-and-desist order was issued against the local chapter and stressed that "hazing is dangerous and illegal and must stop!" "It's not in the realm of seriousness on the far end of things, when you think about what could have occurred with hazing, and we want to stop it now," Kratzer told CNN. By contrast, the hazing charges in the University of Florida case are all misdemeanors, said Spencer Mann, a spokesman for 8th Judicial Circuit State Attorney William Cervone's office. In February, days after the case came to light, university President Bernie Machen announced in an e-mail to students that Alpha Phi Alpha was being temporarily suspended in light of what he called a "serious physical hazing incident."
