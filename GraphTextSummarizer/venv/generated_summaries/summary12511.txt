"There was a little bit of inconsistency today, but first matches can be tricky. -- Third seed Maria Sharapova was stunned on her return to action at the Western and Southern Open, losing to American starlet Sloane Stephens. The match was Sharapova's first since hiring U.S. legend Jimmy Connors as her coach and, while quick to credit Stephens, she was disappointed she was unable to continue the form she showed in the match's opening set. The fifth seed, playing for the first time since losing to Kohlschreiber's compatriot Daniel Brands at a clay-court event in Gstaad, Switzerland, is bidding for a record sixth win at the Ohio event. " Second seed Victoria Azarenka had no such problems, beating American Vania King 6-1 7-6 (8-6).
