The District of Columbia voted May 5 to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere, though it does not itself give marriage licenses to same-sex couples. And the fight among conservatives and religious groups will probably heat up as more states begin to examine marriage rights. The legislation would allow same-sex couples in the state to enter into civil marriages and enjoy the same rights afforded to heterosexual married couples. California had been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples since the state Supreme Court ruled in May 2008 that the unions were legal. But there was a large gap between the opinions of younger and older people, with younger people far more likely to approve of gay marriage.
