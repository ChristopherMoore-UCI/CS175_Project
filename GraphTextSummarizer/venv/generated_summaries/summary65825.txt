Today, many Syrians -- the activists, the organizers, those who are being sought by the Syrian government and those who are wounded -- find their way to Lebanon by fleeing through illegal crossings. Though life in Lebanon is not easy, many Syrians say they left their country for their children, and that the decision to go was a matter of life or death. When she tried to cross illegally back into Lebanon, a Syrian security agent -- aware that her husband was being sought by Syrian authorities -- fatally shot her, according to Abdul-Rahman. -- A young mother with 6-month-old triplets, a laborer still fearful of reprisals, a preacher whose wife was shot dead at an illegal border crossing, wounded in hospitals, a man living in a converted classroom -- these are among the 5,000 or more Syrian refugees living in Lebanon. But the growing tide of Syrian refugees is not a happy one.
