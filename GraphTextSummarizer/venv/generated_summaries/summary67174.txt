Novartis AG, another large pharmaceutical company, announced June 12 that it had produced the first batch of H1N1 vaccine weeks ahead of expectations, using cell-based manufacturing technology. Ferrets are often used in flu research because the animal's respiratory tract responds to flu viruses in much the same way as a human's. "The technology has advanced in recent years to a point that we believe it could help meet a surge in demand for U.S.-based vaccine for seasonal and pandemic flu," HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius said in a statement last week. The company is producing 100,000 doses of vaccine per week, said Daniel Adams, CEO of Protein Sciences Corp. They will also be ready for human use if the FDA issues an emergency authorization to start distributing swine flu vaccines.
