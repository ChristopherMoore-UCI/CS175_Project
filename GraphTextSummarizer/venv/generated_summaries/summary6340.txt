Politicians should remember that global innovation is not a zero-sum game: China's rise does not have to come at America's expense. It is wise to invest during economic recessions in those few thingsâ€”like education, smart infrastructure and researchâ€”that are the essential enablers of longer term innovation, productivity and higher economic growth. The Chinese government is investing tens of billions of dollars into science and engineering research and education, and lavishing tax breaks and subsidies on technology firms and clusters, in an effort to leapfrog the country to the cutting edge of innovation. Cheap China is fading fast, and innovative China is emerging. If America wants to stay at the top, it needs to gear up on innovation.
