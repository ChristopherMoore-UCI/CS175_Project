Gloria, one of three children the couple adopted from Africa, died in January of last year. Referring to the same reports as the prosecutor, he said the girl had an inflamed pancreas and lung, that her stool showed traces of food that was one or two days old, and that her bladder retained liquid. He said that in intentionally neglecting to take the girl to a doctor when they found out she had not eaten for days, the couple caused her death. The attorney also said that Gloria always had water bottles in her room and, even if not, she had access to water from the bathroom in her room. -- Final arguments were heard Wednesday in the case of a California couple accused in Qatar of deliberately starving their 8-year-old adopted daughter to death.
