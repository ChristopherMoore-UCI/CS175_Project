After spending 21 years as the country's best hospital, according to U.S. News & World Report, Johns Hopkins Hospital relinquished its crown to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston in 2012. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia made the Honor Roll list for the first time. UPMC-University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Pennsylvania Northwestern Memorial Hospital made the biggest jump on the list, rising six spaces from No. 12, while Barnes-Jewish Hospital/Washington University in St. Louis had the largest loss, dropping nine spots. New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Cleveland all have more than one Honor Roll hospital on the list. If a hospital is considered one of the best in at least six specialties, it earns a spot on the coveted Honor Roll list.
