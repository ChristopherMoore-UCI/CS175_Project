The crash occurred near a normally packed sidewalk next to the TKTS booth at 47th Street and Seventh Avenue at Times Square, police and fire officials said. -- Prosecutors say for now, they won't be charging the driver of a double-decker tour bus that collided with another bus in Manhattan's bustling Times Square Tuesday, injuring more than a dozen people. " Dalambert was driving a bus that struck another double-decker bus on Seventh Avenue, police said.
