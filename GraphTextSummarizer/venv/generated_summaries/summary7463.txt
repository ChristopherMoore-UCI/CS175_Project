The direction of federal pot policy could be determined by upcoming midterms and the 2016 presidential election as states weigh whether to legalize marijuana. Rubio opposes legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana for recreational use but recently told the Tampa Bay Times that he is open to learning more about medical marijuana. "The long-hair, tie-dye types cut their hair and put on Armani suits and got very serious about pot," Sabet said adding that opponents worry marijuana could become "the next big tobacco" with billions of dollars at stake for a product they feel has serious health concerns. It said the White House opposes a national move to decriminalize pot despite Obama's personal views on marijuana use. A CNN/ORC International poll last month showed that just over half the country â€” 55% â€”supports marijuana legalization.
