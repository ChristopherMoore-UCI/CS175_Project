Police identified the dead as Indiana residents Lindsey Williams, 27; Arielle Goldman, 3; Yazmin Goldman, 5; Amado Mangual, 49; and Atlanta residents Jamin Osborne, 5; Jasmin Osborne, 7; and Yvette Williams, 35. Preliminary reports indicate the accident Thursday night occurred when the Jeep stopped behind a tractor-trailer near a work zone. A tractor-trailer behind the Jeep failed to stop, rear-ending it and sending it plowing into the semi in front. CNN affiliate WLS said they were all family members, but did not specify how they are related to one another. Seven relatives died when their SUV was crushed between two big rigs during a traffic backup in Indiana, leaving the vehicle in a burning, mangled heap.
