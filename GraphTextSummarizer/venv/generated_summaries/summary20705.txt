The body of Ethan Stacy, who had never wanted to leave his father in the first place, was flown back to Virginia last week. "I don't have a good answer for you," Layton police Lt. Garret Atkin, one of many law enforcement officers in Davis County, Utah, who are grieving for the boy who lived among them so briefly, told me. Judge Smith said that Ethan's parents had worked out a settlement, including shared custody, and that the finalization of their divorce last month was "cut and dried." Part of the decree was that Ethan would live with his dad during the school year, and with his mother during the summer. What allegedly happened next is described in affidavits prepared by the Layton Police Department: Ethan, his mother and her fianc√©, Nathan Sloop, began living in their Layton home. Police said Nathan Sloop took a hammer to Ethan's face and teeth, in an effort to make him unrecognizable should anyone ever find him.
