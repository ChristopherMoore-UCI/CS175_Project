This month, the State Department issued a statement calling on the Qatari government to "immediately" lift the Huangs' travel ban and bring the case to an "expeditious and just conclusion." The Huangs are appealing their conviction, which has garnered international attention and raised questions in the media about the prosecution and overall fairness of the Qatari justice system. after a Qatari prosecutor told a court that Matthew Huang and his wife, Grace, had let their daughter starve to death. Advocates for the Huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the Qatari judiciary for a formal investigation has gone unanswered. "The Huangs have been through enough." Al Kuwari, the Qatari ambassador, said the case is "not a political issue" and the government cannot interfere with the court.
