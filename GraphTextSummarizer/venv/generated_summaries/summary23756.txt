The offender in question is 6-year-old Trig Palin, who became an instant target of supposedly tolerant liberals when he wound up being born to mother Sarah, one of the most popular political figures for conservatives and a constant thorn in the side of liberals. Palin struck back by zeroing in with the real reason that groups like PETA have lost influence and credibility: the double standard they employ, denouncing certain behavior by the people they oppose while excusing the same behavior by people they support. It was considered bad form to just weave an attack out of whole cloth, counting on the fact that the mark was so despised by a segment of society that people would be anxious to believe the worst. That's when Seth MacFarlane, creator of the Fox animated comedy, "Family Guy," thought it would be a hoot to air an episode that demolished all the preaching that liberals have done over the years about tolerance and the importance of defending those with special needs. Now the little guy is at it again, teaching us that liberals are creative enough to make smears out of thin air.
