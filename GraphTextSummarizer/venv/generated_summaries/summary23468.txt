TS: You need two images and through the images you can interpolate the architectural spatial design which creates a 3D model... that technique also comes into film because it is photogrammetry, (a way of measuring 2D or 3D objects from photo-grammes or photographs as well as electronic imagery.) We record some action with five cameras... from these five images they recreate the actors as 3D objects and then project according to which angle. When we think about our childhoods or watching "Star Trek" - seeing people being beamed - there's so much cool stuff and ideas...
