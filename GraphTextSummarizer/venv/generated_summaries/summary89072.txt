Professor Peter Haynes, head of the university's department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, said: "Professor Hawking is a remarkable colleague, we all hope he will be amongst us again soon." At Cambridge, he holds the position of Lucasian Professor of Mathematics -- one of the world's most prestigious academic posts which was held from 1669 to 1702 by Isaac Newton, who laid the foundations of modern physics by discovering the universal law of gravity. He also said if he had the choice of meeting Newton or Marilyn Monroe, his choice would be Marilyn. -- Distinguished scientist Stephen Hawking was said to be in a "comfortable" condition Tuesday after spending the night in hospital, Cambridge University said in a statement. Hawking -- a physicist, cosmologist, astronomer and mathematician -- is considered by many to be the greatest scientist of recent years. Hawking was born in Oxford, England, on a date auspicious for his future career: January 8, 1942 -- the 300th anniversary of the death of astronomer and physicist Galileo Galilei.
