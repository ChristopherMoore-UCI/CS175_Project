The committee said it discovered the error while comparing final seating configurations at Olympic and Paralympic venues against the millions of ticket orders placed. "We are exchanging their synchronized swimming tickets for tickets in other sports that they originally applied for," a London 2012 spokesman said in a statement. Olympic organizers said Wednesday they oversold thousands of tickets for the synchronized swimming events at this summer's Games. It was not immediately clear whether the committee discovered oversold tickets in other events. The newly-built Aquatics Center, with its giant wave-like roof, is located at the Olympic Park and will play host to synchronized swimming and other water sports, including swimming and diving.
