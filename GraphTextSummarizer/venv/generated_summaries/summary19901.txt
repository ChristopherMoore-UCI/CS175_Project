" Not much about the Roman Catholic church's official stances on LGBT issues has changed since Argentinian Bishop Jorge Mario Bergoglio became Pope in March 2013. This became evident a few months after Francis' election, when he was asked during a wide-ranging news conference about his stance on gays and lesbians, including gay priests. A few months later, Francis said church officials have the right to express opinions but not to "interfere spiritually" in the lives of gays and lesbians. That's the treatment the roughly 50 members of the Maryland-based group got -- much to their surprise -- for Pope Francis' weekly address Wednesday in St. Peter's Square, according to Francis DeBernardo, the group's executive director. So, too, was their special seating Wednesday -- on the same level as the Pope, something they didn't know about until they got their tickets (which were arranged by Vatican officials) on Tuesday night.
