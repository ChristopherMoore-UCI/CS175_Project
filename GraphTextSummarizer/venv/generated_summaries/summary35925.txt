Ribery sees red but Bayern beat Cologne The Poland striker opened the scoring in the seventh minute after being set up by young Japan international Shinji Kagawa, but Jan Rosenthal leveled on 34. Kagawa and Grosskreutz then helped Lewandowski to wrap it up with 20 minutes to play as Freiburg dropped below Augsburg on goal difference. Greek defender Kyriakos Papadopoulos added the fourth on 67 from Jose Manuel Jurado's cross, and Huntelaar scored his 15th league goal of 2011-12 with 20 minutes to play with a lob over goalkeeper Tim Wiese. Schalke joined Dortmund on 34 points after veteran striker Raul netted the opening three goals against fifth-placed Werder Bremen. He completed his third treble for the club since joining from Real Madrid in mid-2010 with a header just after the hour from Christian Fuchs' cross, taking his Bundesliga tally this season to double figures.
