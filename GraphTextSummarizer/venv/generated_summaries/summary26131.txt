But despite the reverence in which this iconic moment is held -- he was the first Frenchman to win it since 1946 -- and the fact that Noah's defining career moment happened at Roland Garros, it isn't a place he relishes returning to. Having performed in front of thousands of expectant fans -- no more so than on court at Roland Garros in 1983 -- he was used to the acute demands it would bring. "In France if I go to Roland Garros there is just too much love, I cannot walk around so I cannot watch a game, I cannot watch, I like to walk around, have a beer, it's impossible. " The time that has flown since has yet to produce a Frenchman capable of assuming Noah's mantle, or bettering his highest world ranking of No. 3. but I am the happiest father -- how happy can you be when your son is fulfilling and living his dream?" says Noah, whose father was a footballer from Cameroon who played for French clubs.
