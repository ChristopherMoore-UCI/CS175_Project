Users can submit presidential debate questions on YouTube until Saturday. At CNN, a small group led by Senior Vice President David Bohrman and CNN Political Director Sam Feist is looking over the questions. Instead, YouTube and CNN should let YouTube users decide what the best questions are, and then use those questions in the debate." At 7 p.m. ET Monday, the Democratic candidates for president will face questions sent in via YouTube. "We're out there to actually see how people who want to be president think and handle issues and questions and people that are slightly outside of their comfort zones." "There are questions that we, the journalists, we, the mainstream media, would never think to ask in the presidential debate," Bohrman said.
