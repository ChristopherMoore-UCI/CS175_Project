The craft smashed into a living room, stopping just 8 inches from a couple who were sleeping in an adjacent bedroom in the 1.5-story brick house just southeast of the airport, Chicago Fire Department official Michael Fox said. The pilot of the Aerocommander 500 cargo plane reported engine problems and asked controllers to let him return to Midway shortly before the craft slammed into the house about a quarter-mile short of a runway at 2:42 a.m., Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Elizabeth Isham Cory said. They were in a bedroom next to the living room, and the living room is gone," said Fox, the fire department's chief of special operations. The pilot was trying to land at Midway when the crash happened, said Tim Sorensen, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. A twin-engine plane crashed into a Chicago house shortly after takeoff from Midway International Airport early Tuesday, killing the pilot and narrowly missing a couple who were sleeping in the residence, officials said.
