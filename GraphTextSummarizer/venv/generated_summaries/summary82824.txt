With church bells in the background, we discuss all things chocolate, such as cocoa bean origins and cocoa percentages. Unexpected ingredients I'm instantly hooked on Lotti's Best -- one of Rousset's suggestions -- a crumbly nougat feuilletine with tonka bean and a pinch of fleur de sel, covered with Criollo de Venezuela 65% and milk chocolate. Rousset is a New Yorker with bright eyes, an unbelievably slim figure and a constant smile fueled by chocolate. As well as feeding our chocolate-buzzed minds with facts about the world of cocoa, Rousset also tells us how she began leading tours of Zurich's sweet spots. Tasting instructions We ask Rousset to share her expertise on the art of proper chocolate tasting.
