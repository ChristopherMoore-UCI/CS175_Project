The measure was imposed following the 1979 Islamic Revolution because the idea of mixed crowds was deemed un-Islamic. FIFA president Sepp Blatter has told Iran to end its "intolerable" ban on women attending football matches. A collective stadium ban still applies to women in Iran, despite the existence of a thriving women's football organization. Hence my appeal to the Iranian authorities -- open the nation's football stadiums to women. Hoardings advertising the World Cup throughout Tehran that summer had featured no pictures of women.
