While the total number of U.S. troops in Iraq will continue to diminish throughout 2011, the withdrawal rate will be "calibrated and adjusted based on conditions on the ground," according to presidential national security adviser John Brennan. Iraqi officials, however, have noted a recent campaign of bombings and shootings in Baghdad, where gunmen have attacked traffic police and checkpoints, killing Iraqi troops. -- The number of U.S. troops in Iraq has fallen below 50,000 -- the lowest level since the U.S-led invasion in 2003, the military said Tuesday. On Monday, Vice President Joe Biden said that the overall level of violence in Iraq has now declined to the point that some early U.S. veterans of the conflict "would not recognize" the country today. The Iraqi government had been pushing to increase security ahead of the U.S. drawdown.
