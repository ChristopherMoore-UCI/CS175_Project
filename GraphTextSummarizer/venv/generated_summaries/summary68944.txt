Khan, who serves as the administrative chief of all districts in Chittagong region, said rescuers from the army, police and fire services are assisting in the operations, which were taking place in many of the affected areas. "We've recovered 95 bodies so far, and the death toll may go up as many people, as claimed by the relatives, are still missing," Divisional Commissioner of Chittagong Mohammad Serajul Huq Khan said. "At least 37 died in Cox's Bazar, 36 in Bandarban and 22 in Chittagong city." Aslam Alam, secretary of the Disaster Management and Relief Division of the Ministry of Food and Disaster Management, said in Dhaka that many people were evacuated and the government was sending food relief to the affected areas. Most of the victims died in landslides caused by torrential rains and flash floods in the port city of Chittagong, the tourist destination of Cox's Bazar and the hilly Bandarban district.
