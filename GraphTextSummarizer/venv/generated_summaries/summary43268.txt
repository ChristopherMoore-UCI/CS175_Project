-- Two-year-old Lakshmi Tatma, an Indian toddler born with four arms and four legs, made her first public appearance Tuesday, a week after surgeons in India successfully removed her additional limbs. It had a torso and limbs but no head, and was joined to Lakshmi at the pelvis. Doctors said Lakshmi was recovering well as she appeared Tuesday at a news conference. Doctors said that without the surgery, Lakshmi would have been unlikely to survive beyond early adolescence. When Lakshmi was born into her poor, rural Indian family, villagers in the remote settlement of Rampur Kodar Katti in the northern state of Bihar believed she was sacred.
