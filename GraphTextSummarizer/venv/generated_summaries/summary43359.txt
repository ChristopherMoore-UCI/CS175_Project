The Israeli Supreme Court has upheld the deportation of Nobel Peace Prize winner Mairead Maguire, who had tried to visit Israel and the Palestinian territories last week, a spokeswoman for the Israeli judiciary said Monday. Those aboard the Rachel Corrie say the ship was seized in international waters, but Israel says it took the ship in Israeli territory and told those aboard they would not be allowed to return to Israel. She landed there Tuesday with a delegation of other high-level women's rights activists from around the world, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said, but was denied entry because of her participation in efforts to run the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said. "There will be peace in this country, I believe it, but only when Israel ends apartheid and the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people," Maguire told reporters before Monday's hearing. The Rachel Corrie's mission came just five days after Israeli commandos raided a similar flotilla in an incident that left nine passengers aboard the Turkish-flagged vessel Mavi Marmara dead.
