Fellow Premier League team Everton also ran into trouble against lower division opposition in their FA Cup tie. Arsenal's eight-year trophy drought looks set to continue as Arsene Wenger's men crashed out of the English FA Cup on Saturday losing 1-0 to Championship side Blackburn Rovers at the Emirates. David Moyes' side looked to have succeeded where their Merseyside rivals Liverpool had failed in the previous round, as they led 2-1 into injury time against Oldham Athletic. The Gunners, whose last silverware came in the same competition in 2005, were undone by a Colin Kazim-Richards' goal in the 72nd minute to send the former Premier League side into the quarterfinal draw. But they will need to pick themselves up smartly with Bayern Munich arriving at the Emirates on Tuesday for the first leg of their last-16.
