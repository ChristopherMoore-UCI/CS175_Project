Renault have now joined Ferrari in saying they will not race in 2010 unless proposed changes are dropped The decision comes in the wake of plans by the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to introduce optional cost-caps and technical restrictions for competing teams. " Are Ferrari and Renault right to serve the FIA with an ultimatum? President of the team, Bernard Rey, added: "We remain committed to the sport, however, we cannot be involved in a championship operating with different sets of rules. " The controversy centers on plans for an optional cost-capping policy to operate next season which the FIA argued, in an April press release, would allow technical innovation to flourish without promoting a "spending race." It would mean that teams operating within a budget cap of $60 million would be free of technical restrictions, while those over this amount would not. The FIA believed this would attract new teams to join the sport and stated in April  "interest has been extraordinarily high from both existing teams and potential new entrants" to the idea.
