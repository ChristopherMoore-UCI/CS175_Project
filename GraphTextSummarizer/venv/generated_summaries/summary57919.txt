A lot of the film is devoted to showing how the cult of technology and the human element don't need to be opposed; they can, and should, work hand in hand. And when the army of interns gets divvied up into a dozen competing teams, only one of which will ultimately land jobs there, Nick and Bill are stuck with the social outliers that no one else wants â€” the geeks among geeks. It needed more spin, more Googliness. They're Nick (Wilson) and Billy (Vaughn), designer-watch salesman who lose their careers in what seems like the tick of a second hand. The leader of the internship program is Mr. Chetty (The Daily Show's Aasif Mandvi), a po-faced corporate guru who lights up whenever he extols the virtues of ethereal concepts like ''Googliness.''
