Though the price may put mobile phones out of the reach of most Cubans, they are affordable for many of those who have access to U.S. dollars -- typically either sent from relatives abroad or earned internally by tourist workers. Bush said he is making the change since President Raúl Castro "is allowing Cubans to own mobile phones for the first time." After being elected president in February, Raúl Castro announced that Cubans who can afford them could buy cell phones and DVD players and stay in hotels previously reserved for foreign tourists -- overturning bans from the Fidel era. President Bush announces the U.S. policy allowing cell phones to Cuba at the White House on Wednesday. The United States will allow Americans to send mobile phones to relatives in Cuba under a change in policy that President Bush announced Wednesday.
