Does "Silver Linings Playbook" trivialize depression and mental illness? Nothing if not an actors' movie, "Silver Linings" provides De Niro with his juiciest comic role since the first "Meet the Parents." Released from the hospital after several months, he returns to live with his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver) and determined to win back the love of his life -- hopefully without encroaching on the restraining order. Putting the "antic" into "romantic", "Silver Linings Playbook", is a comedy about clinical depression. A blind date with his best friend's recently widowed and equally traumatized sister-in-law Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) furnishes the manically overoptimistic Pat with a co-conspirator, and, he hopes, a back channel to his ex.
