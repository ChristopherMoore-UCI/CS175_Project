The Italian government said it would halt the construction of a controversial landfill near Naples, but the assurance was not enough for protesters who clashed with police Saturday night, injuring six police officers. He told reporters that the government would put the second landfill on hold and the current landfill will be analyzed for any dangers to people or natural resources. Some 500 protesters were blocking the road that leads to the landfill, though police estimated that only 20 or 30 people were involved in the clashes with police. Protesters hurled rocks, firecrackers and Molotov cocktails at police. Last week, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi promised that "within 10 days, the situation should be brought to normality."
