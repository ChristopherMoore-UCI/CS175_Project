That next challenge is likely to be 31st seed Julien Benneteau of France who plays U.S. teenager Dennis Novikov later on Friday. Defending champion Novak Djokovic dropped just five games as he progressed to the third round of the U.S. Open on Friday. Earlier, America's Steve Johnson booked his place in the third round with a four-set (6-7 7-6 6-3 6-4) win over Latvia's Ernests Gulbris, as did fourth seed David Ferrer. Andy Roddick will be looking to delay his impending retirement when he plays Australia's Bernard Tomic later on Friday. The Spaniard, a semi-finalist at Flushing Meadows back in 2007, was a comfortable 6-2 6-3 7-6 (14-12) winner over Dutch qualifier Igor Sijsling.
