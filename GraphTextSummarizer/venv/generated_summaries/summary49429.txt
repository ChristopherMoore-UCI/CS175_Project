The girl, named Carrie, introduced herself to Wagner backstage at a November 4 concert in Boca Raton, Florida. Sources told TMZ that the two embraced at the Florida concert and, at a later performance, Wagner introduced her to the entire audience. (PEOPLE.com) -- There may be an extra place setting around Jack Wagner's dinner table this holiday season -- and not just because he and longtime girlfriend Heather Locklear are no longer together. Less than two weeks after the encounter, Wagner and Locklear announced they had called off their engagement, saying planning their wedding was not allowing them enough time to spend with their children. Wagner, 52, discovered earlier this month that he has a long-lost 23-year-old daughter from a "fling" he had with the girl's mother in the late 1980s, TMZ reports.
