" On Wednesday, ISIS claimed that "Abu Abdullah al-Australi," along with four other foreign fighters, had been killed while carrying out suicide attacks during an offensive launched on the city of Ramadi in Iraq. The claim, issued on a Twitter account associated with the Anbar provincial division of ISIS, was accompanied by a series of 20 images, including a photo of a young man who looked like Bilardi. Victoria police said Bilardi first came to their attention when his family reported him missing last year.
