Novak Djokovic beat 17th-ranked Frenchman Richard Gasquet 7-5 6-3 to set up a last-eight clash with Spanish fifth seed David Ferrer, who won 6-3 6-3 against 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro. The win also ended eighth seed Na's recent superiority over Sharapova, with the Chinese player having won their last four previous meetings in straight sets -- including in the semifinals at Roland Garros last year. " Wozniacki's reward is a clash with second seed Maria Sharapova, who crushed French Open champion Li Na in straight sets. Serena Williams bemoaned the amount of unforced errors she made after suffering a quarterfinal defeat to fellow former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki at the Miami Masters. In the men's section, 2010 champion Andy Roddick failed to capitalize on his shock win over 16-time grand slam winner Roger Federer as he stumbled to a 7-5 6-0 defeat to Argentine 22nd seed Juan Monaco.
