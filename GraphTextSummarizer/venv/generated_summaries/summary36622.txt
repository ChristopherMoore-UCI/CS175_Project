"I think searchers are so willing to do it because they think, 'What if it was my child?' " said Lt. Garret Atkin of the Layton, Utah, Police Department. The searchers know that at the bottom of every gully, behind every tree, they may come upon a cause for utter elation -- a frightened child waiting to be found -- or a cause for utter despair: a lifeless boy or girl. "Some people here have gone out and looked on their own," said John Miller, the editor of the Hickory, North Carolina, Daily Record. It takes a lot to make searchers give up. For nine days searchers looked frantically for the children.
