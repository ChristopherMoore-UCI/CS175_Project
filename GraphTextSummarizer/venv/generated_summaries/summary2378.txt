See photo gallery of rescued penguins Â» Magellanic penguins are warm-weather birds that breed in large colonies in southern Argentina and Chile. While occasionally a few birds show up so far north, the unusual sight of hundreds of wayward penguins posed a challenge for animal conservation groups. "We are overjoyed to see these penguins waddle back to the ocean and have a second chance at life," said veterinarian Dr. Valeria Ruoppolo of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the group that oversaw the rescue. Ruoppolo, who is also the emergency relief officer for IFAW, has a lot of experience saving penguins and other animals injured in oil spills. Almost 400 lost Magellanic penguins march back to the sea after being rescued by animal-welfare groups.
