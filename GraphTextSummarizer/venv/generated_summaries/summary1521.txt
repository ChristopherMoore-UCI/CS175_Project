What the Keystone XL pipeline clearly would do is divert investment away from renewable energy â€” and investments in renewable energy produce more bang for the buck. In other words, if America builds the Keystone XL pipeline, not only are we not getting a lot of short-term jobs out of the deal and risking the economic cost of crude spills, but we're failing to put investment into green energy opportunity that will yield far more jobs now and in the future. In 2008, in its original application to the State Department seeking pipeline approval, the company TransCanada said the Keystone XL pipeline would involve "a peak workforce of approximately 3,500 to 4,200 construction personnel." Projects like the Keystone XL pipeline are championed by conservatives not because they make any rational or economic sense but because they are convenient symbols for protesting climate science and President Obama. Then the thick tar sands crude would go into the 1,179 mile long Keystone XL pipeline, winding past family farms and playgrounds and lakes and water reservoirs as it makes its way from Canada to Texas.
