The new battleground in Iraq appeared to be spreading to the south and west of Kirkuk, where ISIS fighters occupied four towns to the south and west of Kirkuk, according to Hisham al-Hashimi, a researcher at the Journalistic Freedom Observatory. The vehicles are believed to have been seized by ISIS after it routed Iraqi troops in northern Iraq. Also, there were reports that ISIS fighters were advancing south and west of Kirkuk, about 240 kilometers (149 miles) north of Baghdad. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki gave up the fight Thursday to keep his post, clearing the way for a new leader that many hope can hold Iraq together as the country battles brutal extremist fighters. The move comes at a critical time in Iraq as Sunni fighters with the so-called Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, force hundreds of thousands from their homes as they seize large swaths of land.
