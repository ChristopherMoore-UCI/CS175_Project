Auction house Osenat describes it as the first letter the French emperor wrote in English on St. Helena, after he was defeated and exiled to the British island to live under military guard. Learning English behind the backs of his captors "was a sort of revenge, a historical revenge" for Napoleon, said Jean-Christophe Chataigner of Osenat. "I think that French people who learn English today make lots more mistakes than Napoleon at the time, so it's a letter which is relatively well-written," he said. A rare letter written by Napoleon Bonaparte in English will go to the auction block in France on Sunday. "He was imprisoned by the English... and he wants to continue to have a certain degree of independence, of freedom, and to be able to learn English without his jailers knowing it was a great motivation for him," Chataigner said.
