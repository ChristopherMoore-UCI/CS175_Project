Using pennies means an increase in zinc and copper mining, an increase in energy use and pollution at these mines and an increase in energy use and pollution as the government, banks and businesses put rolls of pennies into sacks and lug them from place to place. Earlier this week, President Barack Obama asked Congress for permission to change the mix of metal that goes into making pennies and nickels. Thus, for many people, time is more valuable than this money, and increasingly we throw away pennies, lose them, don't bother to collect them to return to the store or let them pile up in jars. Stores pay out more pennies than they receive, so the order goes down the line to make more pennies, which are often lost and ignored -- repeating this vicious cycle. Unfortunately, the U.S. Mint won't find a miracle metal that will make pennies worthwhile.
