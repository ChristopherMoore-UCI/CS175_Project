On the men's European Tour, home player Joost Luiten captured the Dutch Open at Zandvoort after a playoff with evergreen Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez. But World No.1 Park Inbee of South Korea, was never in serious contention as she strove to become the first player to win four majors in a season. It was Luiten's second win of the season and came after he tied with Jimenez on 12-under in regulation play. Ko, who broke records when she won the Canadian Open last year at 15 years and four months, refused to be downhearted. He only needed to two putt for a par at the first extra hole to seal an emotional triumph as 49-year-old Jimenez overhit his birdie attempt and missed the six-foot return.
