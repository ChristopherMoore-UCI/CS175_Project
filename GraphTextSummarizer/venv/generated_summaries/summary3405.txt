Meanwhile, about 3,000 parish residents remained in one area close to an 8-foot tall West Bank levee that waters were threatening Wednesday evening, according to Jindal's office. The family was coping with the latest weather disaster in Plaquemines Parish, where dozens of people were rescued Wednesday and as many as 800 homes suffered significant water damage. Wednesday, Duplantier said, a couple of inches of water were evident in her redbrick home and in her parents' residence nearby. Parish president Billy Nungesser said Wednesday evening that crews will travel to the area Thursday morning by air boat to study the situation. Kim Duplantier's three-story colonial plantation-style home survived Hurricane Katrina, albeit with 3 feet of unwelcome water on the bottom floor.
