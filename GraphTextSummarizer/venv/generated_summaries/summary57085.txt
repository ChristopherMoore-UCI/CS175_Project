Lt. Col. Rupert Thorneloe, 40, was killed along with trooper Joshua Hammond, 18, Wednesday as they were traveling along a canal in Lashkar Gah, in Afghanistan's southern Helmand Province, the British Ministry of Defense said. Watch Prince Charles speak Defense Secretary Bob Ainsworth called Thorneloe's death a "hard blow" to the army and the military's operations in Afghanistan. Lt. Col. Rupert Thorneloe was killed when a roadside bomb denotated in Helmand province. Hammond enlisted in the army when he was 16 and deployed to Afghanistan a month ago, said Lt. Col. Marcus Simson, his commanding officer. "I knew him myself, as a man of incisive thought, enormous professionalism and the greatest decency, who could not wait to leave the high-profile post in the Ministry of Defense where he had performed so impressively in order to take command of his battalion on operations," Ainsworth said in a statement.
