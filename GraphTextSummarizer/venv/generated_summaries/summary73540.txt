There's not as much help for (veterans) who weren't injured in Iraq and Afghanistan. I really wanted to create a group that could show people that there's thousands of veterans right here in our midst that could use help. Beatty was honored as a CNN Hero this year for his work helping veterans. But both also bear mental and physical scars from their military service in Iraq: Beatty lost his legs to an anti-tank land mine, and Gallina suffered a traumatic brain injury. When my community was helping me, it really showed me the potential power and the effectiveness of groups within communities, especially when we're talking about veterans.
