The measure would also ban strikes for all public workers -- rather than just those involved in public safety -- but was recently amended to allow state employees to negotiate salaries, according to state Sen. Shannon Jones. -- Wisconsin protesters geared up for a third week of demonstrations on Monday as Democratic lawmakers were again missing from the state capitol, protesting a bill that would curb collective bargaining rights for most public workers. In Ohio, a budget bill supported by another GOP governor, John Kasich, prompted thousands of labor-backed demonstrators to descend on Columbus to protest a proposal that would curtail union bargaining rights. "We're allowing unions to negotiate terms that should be the employers' decision." Mauk said Republican lawmakers view the measure as "long-term reform to restructure state government." Meanwhile, some of the hundreds of demonstrators who had filled the Capitol building -- gathering inside the rotunda in daily protest of the proposed legislation -- had left the building by Monday at the request of state police, said Department of Administration spokeswoman Jodi Jensen.
