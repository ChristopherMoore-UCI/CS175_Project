Now I realize if I had married him to begin with, I wouldn't be so against marriage, but we are happy the way things are and neither of us want that to change." I fear that things like paying for a wedding would add stress, and since I was just laid off from my job, we do not need anymore stress." I fear that marriage would do the same thing to my current relationship of 11 years." Things are fine the way they are, so why change this? During the 17 years they just lived together, things were great.
