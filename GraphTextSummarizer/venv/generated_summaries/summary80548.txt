According to Pew, here are the types of local information that mobile users reported they've been getting: Weather: 42% Local restaurants and other businesses: 37% General local news: 30% Local sports scores and updates: 24% Local traffic and transportation: 22% Local coupons and discounts: 19% News alerts: 15% The growing trend in mobile local news and information isn't strictly a matter of civic consciousness; weather, dining and shopping did top the list, after all. Despite conventional wisdom that young people don't care much about news or community, people ages 18 to 29 were by far most likely (70%) to access local information online -- and nearly half of these younger adults specifically report obtaining local news via their mobile devices. In fact, Pew discovered that the only real difference between users of local news mobile apps and other adults is that local news app users tend to be generally more into high-tech. In particular, in the coming year, Qualcomm's deal to make Opera Mini the default browser on feature phones powered by its popular BREW MP platform will vastly improve the Web browsing experience for a large portion of feature phone users. About half of U.S. Hispanics (52%) and African-Americans (51%) reported getting local mobile news or information.
