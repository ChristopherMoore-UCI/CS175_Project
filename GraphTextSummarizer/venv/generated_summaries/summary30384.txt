The newly announced shows will bring the tour to Cleveland; Columbus, Ohio; New York; Wallingford, Connecticut; and Boston. Dripping with tiger blood and coursing with warlock power, fired "Two and a Half Men" star Charlie Sheen has announced five more stops on his tour, "My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not An Option Show." Warner Bros fired Sheen from "Two and a Half Men" last week after he conducted a long-running rant against the show's producers. Warner Bros is owned by Time Warner, which is also the parent company of CNN. Lately he has been known for a bizarre series of rants, especially on his immensely popular Twitter account that logged 2.8 million followers in a few week's time.
