Soccer legend Pele has been moved out of intensive care but remains in a Sao Paolo, Brazil, hospital following treatment for an infection, the hospital said Saturday. "I expect to keep bringing pride and joy to Santos fans all around the world." Even after retiring from football, Pele has remained in the public eye as a product pitchman, ambassador for the sport of football and advocate for Brazil's poor, having grown up among them in the inland city of Tres Coracoes. Pele went on to star on two other World Cup title teams as well, in 1962 and 1970, in addition to a breakthrough career with the Brazilian club Santos and later with the New York Cosmos of the now-defunct North American Soccer League. Pele posted a message to his Twitter followers Friday telling them not to worry. He burst onto the scene as a teenager, helping lead his native Brazil to the 1958 World Cup championship.
