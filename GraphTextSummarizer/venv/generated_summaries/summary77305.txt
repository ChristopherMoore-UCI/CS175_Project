-- Thousands of protesters battled riot police in downtown Seoul early Sunday morning after a rally opposing South Korea's decision to import U.S. beef turned violent. Animals more than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease, which can be transmitted to humans. Until the 2003 ban, South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters. Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during a visit to visit to Seoul as part of an Asian tour, emphasized Saturday that American beef is safe and that her government will continue efforts to win consumer confidence.
