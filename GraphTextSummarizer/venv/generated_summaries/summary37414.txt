But there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in Yemen, particularly in the south, where there's a long-running secessionist movement, and in the oil-rich province of Marib to the east of Sanaa. The government only finally got parliamentary approval in December, said U.S.-based Yemen analyst Sama'a Al-Hamdani. The Houthis are Shiites from northern Yemen who make up about 30% of the population. "The safety and security of U.S. personnel is our top priority in Yemen," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Al-Hamdani, the Yemen analyst, said she didn't see an immediate need to pull U.S. personnel out of Yemen.
