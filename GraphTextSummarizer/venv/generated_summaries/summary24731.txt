John Skelton, the father, told police that he dropped the boys off Friday morning with a woman he identified as Joann Taylor, in part to ensure that they did not witness his suicide. Skelton told police that Taylor was supposed to take the boys to the boy's home in Morenci, a southern Michigan town of about 2,400 people about 40 miles west-northwest of Toledo, Ohio, around 3 p.m. Friday. But the boys -- 5-year-old Tanner Skelton, 7-year-old Alexander William Skelton and 9-year-old Andrew Skelton -- never arrived and police aren't sure whether John Skelton's story is true. The police chief asked for the public's help with information regarding Skelton's blue 2000 Dodge Caravan, later discovered by police, that was believed to be carrying the boys between 2:30 p.m. Thursday to 1:30 p.m. Friday. "There is no established relationship between he and the person that he described to us as Joann Taylor," Chief of Morenci Police, Larry Weeks, told reporters.
