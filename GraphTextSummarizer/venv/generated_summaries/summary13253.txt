Amnesty's researcher James Lynch added: "While some of the measures announced today are positive and if implemented would improve conditions for workers, they do not go nearly far enough." Ali Al-Khulaifi, Director of Planning and Quality Department at the Ministry of Labor, said that minimum wage would continue to be determined by the individual agreements between Qatar and home countries of migrant workers. "It is alleged that employers / sponsors are using this [Exit Stamp] authority to prevent migrant workers from leaving Qatar thus giving rise to circumstances of apparent forced labor," DLA Piper's report said of the requirement for employers to issue an Exit Stamp. -- The tiny Gulf state of Qatar will amend its labor laws in an effort to improve the living standards of migrant workers, its Interior and Labor ministries said Wednesday. DLA Piper's report said the old restrictions could "result in a situation where migrant workers are 'trapped' in Qatar, with an abusive employer, and without means of exit or the ability to legally transfer to another employer for months. "Proposed reforms announced by the Government of Qatar fall far short of the fundamental changes needed to address systemic abuses against migrant workers in the construction, domestic and other sectors," it said in a statement.
