So I reached out to a number of infectious disease experts, people who have no financial or political stake in the debate other than to ensure the safety of our children, to ask them one simple question: Why should parents vaccinate their kids? When people don't vaccinate their children, they increase the risk for people in the population who can't be vaccinated, such as infants under age 1, children and adults with weak immune systems and people with cancer. " Do you think children should be vaccinated? " More disease = more vaccinations Sadly, what may get more people to get on board and start vaccinating their children is more disease itself. Other children are at risk A mother who is vaccine-anxious, though still vaccinating her children -- albeit on a very spread out time line -- told me she should have the right to do what she wants regarding her children.
