In a speech on Internet freedom and security, Clinton also urged China to investigate a wave of cyber attacks against Google and other companies. Clinton has said that Google's allegations of censorship and online attacks by China raise "very serious concerns," and her agency has said it will file a formal protest over the company's complaints. Clinton made the comments as search-engine giant Google threatened to shut down its operations in China, five years after agreeing to allow some censorship in exchange for the right to work in that country's massive emerging technology market. Citizens and businesses must be able to rely on the security of information networks, Clinton said. Countries such as Vietnam and China have used similar tactics to "restrict access to religious information."
