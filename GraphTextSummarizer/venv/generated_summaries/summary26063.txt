For this trade to end, there need to be incentives for poachers to stop poaching -- as well as for pangolin consumers, primarily in Vietnam and China, to stop eating pangolin meat as a delicacy. I found pangolin meat easily available on restaurant menus in Hanoi, Vietnam, and am told by activists that little is done to stop pangolin consumption. When I went to Vietnam and Indonesia earlier this year to report undercover on the pangolin market, I came across a number of reasons the trade continues unabated. " I'm saddened by this week's news about the size of the pangolin trade and that it now involves all eight species. "A vital first step is for the Chinese and Vietnamese governments to conduct an inventory of their pangolin scale stocks and make this publicly available to prove that wild-caught pangolins are no longer supplying the commercial trade.
