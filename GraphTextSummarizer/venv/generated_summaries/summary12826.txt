Although Oktoberfest began 200 years ago, this year's festival is only the 177th, since it wasn't held during the two World Wars and during a cholera outbreak, organizers say. This year's Oktoberfest runs from September 18 to October 4. According to Muhlbauer, over 9,000 people from clubs or "trachtenvereins" across Europe are taking part in this year's festival. But of course beer is the most important part of Oktoberfest, and organizers say around six million liters will be consumed this year. It's only over the last 20 years that young people won't go to the festival without wearing traditional lederhosen."
