When first questioned about the Denison case in early November, Biela refused to submit DNA samples and provided an alibi to police, claiming that he'd been with his girlfriend. -- A call to the Secret Witness tip line helped police break CNN's first featured cold case: the slaying of college student Brianna Denison, investigators say. Police said at the news conference that they found DNA matching Biela's on the rear door of  the off-campus house where Denison was staying with friends. Police say Biela's associates told them he left Reno in a hurry in March, shortly after Denison's body was found. Denison, who attended Santa Barbara Community College, vanished January 20 while visiting friends at the University of Nevada's Reno campus.
