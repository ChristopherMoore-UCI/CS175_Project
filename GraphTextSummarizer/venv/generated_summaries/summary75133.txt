She is lobbying for a law in Washington state that would provide not only compensation for exonerated prisoners but also counseling, job training and other benefits that are currently available only to guilty former prisoners, not exonerees like Northrop. Exonerees denied right to benefits "There's sort of a gut reaction that this is a horrible injustice," said Innocence Project Northwest attorney Lara Zarowsky, who helped free Northrop. According to an Innocence Project study, Northrop is among the 40% of exonerated prisoners nationwide who received nothing from authorities for their time behind bars. For years, prosecutors denied the project's requests to use more advanced DNA testing on the evidence in Northrop's case. A jury agreed, sentencing Northrop, a father of three children under age 6, to 23 years in prison.
