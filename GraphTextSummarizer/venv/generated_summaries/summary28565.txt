The main difference between today's South China Sea dispute and that of two decades ago is that China is immensely more powerful. China has built administrative and naval facilities on several islands, bullied vessels from other nations in dangerous and provocative manners not consistent with principles of good seamanship, and marginalized regional body ASEAN's role in attempting to address the dispute. China insists on negotiating bilaterally with other claimant states, dismissing the claims of other nations made in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), insisting that China exercises "indisputable sovereignty" in the area without fully defining the status of the nine-dashed line. Most fundamentally, China's behavior has created a window for the U.S. to return prominently to the region and shore up fraying alliances, giving the Philippines and other nations more leverage to stand up to China, as China inadvertently pushes the nations of the region toward the United States. There is much China and the Southeast Asian maritime nations can learn from how Norway and Russia have handled Svalbard and the Arctic.
