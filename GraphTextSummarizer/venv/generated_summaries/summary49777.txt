He spoke at student rallies, held press conferences with youth organizations and ensured that his staff kept an open and accessible ear to the interests, concerns and needs of those of us who worked full time to engage young people. Beyond his role in advocating policies with clear implications for young people, he consistently exemplified the hope for an open, just and inclusive America -- the platform that young Americans overwhelmingly supported during the election. He worked to reauthorize the Higher Education Act in 2008, which expanded federal grant aid, put new regulations in place to prevent abuse of student lending, simplified the student application process for federal aid and established debt forgiveness for public service. It was in this way perhaps, greater than any other, that the current generation of young people identified with and appreciated the work of Ted Kennedy. He championed the Serve America Act, signed into law just this year, which created 175,000 positions in public service in AmeriCorps and other organizations that work on education, health care, energy and veterans services.
