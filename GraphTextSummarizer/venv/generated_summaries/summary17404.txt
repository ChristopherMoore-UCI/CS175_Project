Nigerian police told CNN that Boko Haram, an Islamist sect that has challenged Nigeria's government, is responsible for the attacks, which they described as an attempt to intimidate voters who this month re-elected President Goodluck Jonathan, an ljaw Christian from the south. Concerns about ongoing violence led Nigerian election officials last week to delay the planned gubernatorial elections in two of Nigeria's 36 states. -- Bomb blasts Monday in Nigeria's northeastern state of Borno killed three people and wounded dozens, raising fears that an Islamist group will step up attacks against voters on the eve of national governorship elections, police said. This month's election of Jonathan, who is from the majority-Christian southern part of the country, sparked violence in the Muslim-dominated north last week. The explosions occurred a day after the Nigerian Red Cross reported that rural villages had held mass burials in northern Nigeria.
