Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. -- A French magistrate is investigating Airbus for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean, according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster.
