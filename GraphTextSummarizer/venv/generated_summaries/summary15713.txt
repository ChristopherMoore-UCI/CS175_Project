Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, 87, was doing "absolutely fine" after the operation last week, spokeswoman Gillian Penrose said Friday. Thatcher retired from public life after a stroke in 2002 and suffered several strokes after that. Thatcher missed a reception in honor of her 85th birthday hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron in October 2010 and skipped the unveiling of a statue of Reagan in London in July last year. She enjoyed a close friendship and working relationship with the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan, with whom she shared similar conservative views.
