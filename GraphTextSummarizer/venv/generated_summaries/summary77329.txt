Job killing you? 8 types of work-related stress After crunching the numbers, they made two initial conclusions: personality type is associated with job stress and health, and a large portion of the differences in personality type -- nearly 45% -- can be attributed to genes. Taking the analysis one step further, the researchers estimate that genetic effects are responsible for 32% of the person-to-person variance in job stress, 35% of the variance in job satisfaction and 47% of the variance in health problems. The various combinations of shared genes and upbringings allowed the researchers to parse the connections between genes and environment, job satisfaction and stress, and physical health. "We're not saying job stress makes no difference, or there aren't things that cause stress," says lead author Timothy Judge, a professor of management at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. According to a new study of Swedish twins, the relationship between job stress and health problems is influenced in part by differences in personality and temperament, such as how optimistic, confident or self-critical a person is.
