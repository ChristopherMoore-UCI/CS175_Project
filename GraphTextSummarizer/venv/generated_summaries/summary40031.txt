Breed found "numerous errors" in vetting each student claims, such as the lack of signatures verifying information, lack of Social Security numbers, and the wrong names when compared to school classroom rosters, the lawsuit claims. School spokesman Rossall said he was speaking on their behalf. When asking about the legal fees, school spokesman Rossall said the Miramonte case "is a different size of scope in litigation than is typically seen. The lawsuit, by former chief risk officer Gregg Breed of San Bernardino, accuses the district of corruption, lawyer cronyism and incompetence in the way it settled the lawsuit against former teacher Mark Berndt of Miramonte Elementary. "It's really unfortunate that he would choose to do this and impact the families that are already impacted by the incident in Miramonte and take this money from our students and schools with baseless allegations," Rossall added.
