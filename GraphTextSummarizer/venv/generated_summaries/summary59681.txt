Whether Beckham can achieve his dream of taking his three sons to watch World Cup matches in England in 2018 will rest on the decision of 22 members of the FIFA executive committee. Beckham, who has played in three World Cups, joined by forces with British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Willliam in a last-minute lobbying offensive of FIFA executive members. England's bid was believed to have been adversely affected by allegations of corruption made against FIFA officials by British media organizations, but the former Manchester United star believes that has been neutralized. "I think everybody knows how passionate I am about our country and about playing for my country, but to be able to bring the World Cup to England, it gives me goosebumps just thinking about it." Beckham, who is now playing for Los Angeles Galaxy in the MLS, believes England deserve to host their first World Cup since 1966 on the strength of their technical bid. They must decide between early frontrunners England, Russia, Spain and Portugal and Belgium and the Netherlands.
