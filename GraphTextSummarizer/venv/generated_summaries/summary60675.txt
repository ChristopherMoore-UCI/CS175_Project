"When someone seeks to profit from tragic disasters and attempts to trade on other peoples' misfortune for personal gain through lies and deceit, they will be held to account for their actions," said U.S. Attorney George Holding of the eastern district of North Carolina. Charlette Johnson pleaded guilty to two counts of submitting false claims to a federal agency, two counts of aggravated identity theft and eight counts of wire fraud in Raleigh, North Carolina, on Monday, prosecutors said. For some of the time Johnson committed the fraud, she was on active duty with the Army and was stationed at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, court documents said. A North Carolina woman pleaded guilty to filing fraudulent claims for relief from the Gulf oil disaster, authorities said. Johnson also goes by the first name Charlotte Johnson.
