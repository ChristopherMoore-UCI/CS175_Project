Underground power lines make up about 18% of U.S. transmission lines, according to the federal Energy Information Agency. How to stay sane "Buried power lines are protected from the wind, ice and tree damage that are common causes of outages, and so suffer fewer weather or vegetation-related outages," it concluded. But it noted that underground power lines cost five to 10 times more than overhead wires, don't last as long and cost more to replace. "But buried lines are more vulnerable to flooding, and can still fail due to equipment issues or lightning." Nearly all new residential and commercial developments have underground electric service, the agency said.
