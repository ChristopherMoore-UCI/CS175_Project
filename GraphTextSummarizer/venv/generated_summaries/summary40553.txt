The A.V. Club, which was also frustrated by a lack of Davis screen time, believes that the series has promise. After catching the pilot episode, most critics agree that the students may be an integral part of the story -- which, despite not being created by Rhimes, certainly has her trademarks -- but it's Davis viewers will come back for. The Oscar nominee stars in ABC's much-anticipated new drama from the house of Shonda Rhimes, and it debuted Thursday to critical applause and solid ratings. Did you agree that the pilot needed more Davis and less focus on the students? But the group of students we meet in "How to Get Away with Murder" wind up facing a much bigger test when there's a dead body involved.
