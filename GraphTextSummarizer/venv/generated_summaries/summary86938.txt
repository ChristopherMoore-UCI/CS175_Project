"The feasibility of locating bodies of personnel in the forward part of the submarine is also very remote, as the explosion and very high temperatures, which melted steel within, would have incinerated the bodies, too," it warned. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh reported from New Delhi, and Khushbu Shah from Atlanta. -- Navy divers have recovered five bodies so far from an Indian navy submarine that exploded and sank in Mumbai this week, authorities said Saturday. But divers will scour through submarine until all the bodies are recovered, the ministry said. Their task has been complicated by poor visibility inside the stricken submarine's passageways, which are full of oily, muddy water and wreckage.
