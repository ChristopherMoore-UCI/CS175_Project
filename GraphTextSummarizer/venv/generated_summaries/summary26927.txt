He said the Catholic Church has deplored the failings of its adherents, begged forgiveness for actions that "contributed to the scourge of anti-Semitism and anti-Judaism," and looked forward to warmer relations between Catholics and Jews. The Vatican says Pius XII worked behind the scenes to save Jews from the Holocaust, but it has refused to open archives from his tenure to show proof. He said many Catholics helped Jewish fugitives whom the Nazis were "hunting down" for deportation to concentration camps. That rankled the Jewish community in Rome, where Nazis rounded up Jews on Pope Pius XII's watch, said Lisa Palmieri-Billig, the American Jewish Committee's liaison to the Holy See. Pope Benedict XVI visited the main Jewish synagogue in Rome on Sunday, a trip that unfolded amid heightened tension between Catholics and Jews.
