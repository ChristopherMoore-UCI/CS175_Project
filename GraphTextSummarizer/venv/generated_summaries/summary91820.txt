Four civilians were killed by a gunman in the hostage standoff before police stormed the market, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins told reporters Friday. Hayat Boumeddiene, a 26-year-old woman, allegedly was the accomplice of Amedy Coulibaly, 32, in a hostage-taking incident at a kosher grocery store in eastern Paris. A massive hunt was launched Friday for the only surviving suspect from the two standoff scenes in France, who may have escaped, police union spokesman Pascal Disant said. The Kouachis, who were brothers and the suspects in the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo magazine office Wednesday in Paris, had been cornered at a printing business in the town, according to the mayor of a nearby town. At almost the same time, the other pair of suspects, Cherif Kouachi, 32, and Said Kouachi, 34, were killed in a police operation in Dammartin-en-Goele, near the Charles de Gaulle Airport northeast of Paris.
