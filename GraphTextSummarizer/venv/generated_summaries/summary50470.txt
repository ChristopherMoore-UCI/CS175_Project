That's because older laws require stores to collect sales tax only on goods shipped to states where they have a physical presence, such as a distribution center or a physical store. States that collect sales tax often have different rates depending on the type of goods being sold. People in states that do have sales tax will pay the same amount of sales tax as you would buying an item in person at a local store. There are still a few hurdles before states can start collecting sales tax on online purchases. Because people are already technically required to pay for unpaid sales tax, proponents of the bill argue that it isn't a new tax at all but a more efficient way of enforcing existing tax laws.
