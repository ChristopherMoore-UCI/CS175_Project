Other scandals include October's news that Air Force Maj. Gen. Michael Carey, who oversaw nuclear weapons, was relieved of his duties after he boozed, fraternized with "hot women" and disrespected his hosts during an official visit to Russia, Air Force officials said. Also in October, Navy Vice Adm. Tim Giardina, who also oversaw nuclear weapons forces, was formally relieved of his duties as deputy chief of U.S. Strategic Command, according to Rear Adm. John Kirby, the Navy's chief of information. And in April, an Air Force commander stripped 17 of his officers in Minot, North Dakota, of their authority to control and launch nuclear missiles after they did poorly in an inspection. In August, the same missile unit at Malmstrom linked to the test cheating scandal failed a safety and security inspection "after making tactical-level errors -- not related to command and control of nuclear weapons," the Air Force Global Strike Command said. There are approximately 190 officers overseeing readiness of nuclear weapons systems in Montana, meaning the scandal has touched nearly 20% of that force.
