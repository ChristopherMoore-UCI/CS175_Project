Defeat the Label spokeswoman Lila Lazarus said, "Our goal is to end bullying â€” to get people to wake up and stand up against the bully, not just in Detroit, not just in Michigan, but across the nation." "I can't believe that people can be so cruel to other people ... by being a part of this, I hope I can change people's opinions in school and other places," she said. Davis, who co-wrote the report, said it's these small day-to-day actions that are needed to reduce bullying. Jessica Jarrell, a rising singer who also performed at the Detroit show, said she supports Defeat the Label because she was bullied in middle school and mean things were said to her. Entertainment manager, speaker and philanthropist Ken Kragen made a special appearance at the concert to announce Defeat the Label's plan to have every student in the country stand up against bullying on May 4, 2012, at 12 p.m. ET.
