Pyongyang said last week it may back out of the reunions of the families -- who were separated by the Korean War in the 1950s -- if South Korean forces participate in annual joint military exercises with the United States later this month. In September, North Korea canceled a previous round of family reunions with only a few days notice, accusing Seoul of souring ties between the two countries. -- North and South Korea will hold a "high-level meeting" Wednesday ahead of planned family reunions of people from the two countries South Korea and the United States have rejected the North's calls for this year's joint drills to be called off. The annual military drills, which are due to start on February 24, anger the North Korean regime, which says it views them as a prelude to an invasion.
