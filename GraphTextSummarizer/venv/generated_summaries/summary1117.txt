-- Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button secured a McLaren one-two in a dramatic  Turkish Grand Prix on Sunday as they took advantage of a collision between Red Bull pair Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel. It was the McLaren team's second one-two of the season, with Button leading Hamilton home at a rain-hit Chinese Grand Prix on April 18. Webber, who looked set for this third straight victory, had to pit to have a new nose cone, leaving Hamilton, who had been strongly challenging in third, to take the lead from Button, the reigning world champion. The pair then engaged in their own private duel, with Button briefly heading his fellow Briton, before Hamilton took the lead for the final time to secure his first win of the season. Webber completed the podium and the third place helps him maintain the lead in the title race, five points clear of Button, with Hamilton moving up to third place, four points further adrift.
