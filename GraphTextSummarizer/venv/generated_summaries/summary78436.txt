"It is a signature building which speaks to the foresight of the emirate," said Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon al Nahyan, the chairman of the building's owner, Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company. The Capital Gate building in the desert kingdom's capital, Abu Dhabi, has been certified by Guinness World Records as the "World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower." The 35-story Abu Dhabi building has an 18-degree slope, compared with four degrees for the freestanding bell tower. It is featured in a new National Geographic documentary, called "Megastructures." Nearly five times farther than the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy.
