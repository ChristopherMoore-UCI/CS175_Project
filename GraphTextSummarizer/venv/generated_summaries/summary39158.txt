ET] Al Qaeda is linked to a terror threat that has prompted the State Department to direct its embassies in key Middle East nations, including Egypt and Israel, to close Sunday, U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, R-California, told CNN's "New Day" Friday. [Previously published story, 8:56 p.m. ET] A terror threat prompted the State Department on Thursday to direct its embassies in key Middle East nations, including Egypt and Israel, to close on Sunday with the possibility they could remain idle longer. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said the agency was taking the steps at diplomatic sites out of an abundance of caution. Officials said the time frame comes with the approaching end of Ramadan and the one-year anniversary of the terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. President Barack Obama met with Yemen President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi at the White House on Thursday.
