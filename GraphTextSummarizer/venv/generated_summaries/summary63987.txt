In the Arlington incident, the officer had been dispatched to an apartment complex to check out a report of domestic assault, city spokeswoman Tiara Richard told reporters. "Any time you lose an officer who  is working in the line of duty -- or not in the line of duty -- it's hard on the  department," Richard told reporters. Officer Craig Story was killed when his motorcycle struck a school bus about a mile away from Tuesday's shooting scene, CNN affiliate WFAA reported. In January, another Arlington police officer died in the line of duty, Richard said. Meanwhile, Georgia officials have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of the state trooper late Monday.
