Information from "several witnesses" led to charges against Autry, Gwyn said. Jason Wayne Autry, who is already in prison for an unrelated assault conviction, was indicted on especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder charges by a special grand jury on Tuesday, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn said. -- A second man charged with murder in the 2011 disappearance of Tennessee nursing student Holly Bobo told a judge he was innocent Wednesday. The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee. Autry, 39, was a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, 29, who was indicted last month on the same kidnapping and murder charges.
