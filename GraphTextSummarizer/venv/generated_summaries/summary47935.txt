-- Television cameras are to be allowed into courts in England and Wales for the first time, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke announced Tuesday. Lawyer and broadcaster Mark Stephens, of the law firm Finers Stephens Innocent, praised the move, saying England and Wales were among few countries in the world still to have a blanket ban on cameras in court. The ban on filming in courts in England and Wales dates back to 1925 and will require the passage of new laws to overturn, the Justice Ministry said. "It will have the effect of instilling a greater -- and justifiable -- sense of pride in, and comprehension of, the way in which our justice system works," Stevens said, adding that cameras would boost public scrutiny of judges and court proceedings. The aim is to "improve transparency and public understanding of court," Clarke said.
