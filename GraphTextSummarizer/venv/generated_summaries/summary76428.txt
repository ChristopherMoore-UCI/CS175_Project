Unfortunately, if you have been watching these Republican presidential debates, your first impression, along with that of many other viewers, is that Rick Perry does not have the best grasp of the issues and he has a difficult time answering questions. Because of his poor first impression, Perry was the candidate who could least afford a slip-up of this magnitude. And since many in the public have an unfavorable first impression, Perry's performance fed right into that. First, I've been evaluating debates for 20 years, and can tell you -- if you doubted it for a second -- that Perry's mental block was very, very bad. One of the things I tell my communications classes is that people cling to first impressions.
