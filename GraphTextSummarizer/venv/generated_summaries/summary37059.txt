According to Autodata, car sales have plummeted since last year. The ad speaks to the desperation of car dealers as Big Three auto manufacturers beg Washington for billions in bailout dollars to combat sales that keep dipping to all-time lows. The government can help boost auto sales in many ways, Sykora said, citing two proposed tax incentives: one that would make interest payments on car loans tax deductible and another that would encourage consumers to upgrade their older cars for more fuel-efficient models. About 700 dealerships, most of them selling cars from U.S. automakers, have shut their doors since the beginning of the year. In the United States, the number of sales of passenger cars and light trucks in November 2008 was down 36.7 percent from November 2007 -- from about 1.18 million to 747,000.
