The fracking process injects water, sand and chemicals deep into the ground, cracking the shale and unleashing natural gas. It can be absorbed into the body by inhalation, ingestion, eye contact and skin contact. There are concerns that the chemicals used in fracking have caused illnesses, gas leaks, even tap water catching fire -- something covered extensively in media reports and in the Emmy-winning natural gas documentary "Gasland." -- Crews sprayed foam Wednesday to extinguish pockets of fire remaining at a Texas chemical plant two days after a massive blaze sent bright flames and thick plumes of smoke high into the sky. Employees and visitors of the plant evacuated safely, plant officials said.
