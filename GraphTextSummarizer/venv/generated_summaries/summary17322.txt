The 32-year-old Stepanek, world-ranked 54, sealed his place with a comfortable 6-3 6-3 success over American Donald Young. "It has been a year and a half since I was in a final, so definitely I'm very pleased about that," said Stepanek, who has won four career titles but has not reached a final since losing to Andy Roddick in Brisbane last year. -- Top seed Gael Monfils saved a match point before edging past American John Isner to reach the final of the Legg Mason Classic in Washington on Saturday. Radwanska, who has been suffering from a shoulder injury, last reached a final when losing to Svetlana Kuznetsova here last year. Monfils will face Czech Radek Stepanek, the oldest player in the world's top 100, in the final.
