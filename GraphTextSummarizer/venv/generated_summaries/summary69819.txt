-- Protesters in Kuwait clashed with security forces on Saturday, the second straight day of unrest in the tiny Persian Gulf nation. Hundreds of protesters calling for greater rights for longtime residents who are not citizens of the country demanded the release of people arrested in demonstrations Friday. On Friday, more than a thousand protesters clashed with security forces in Al-Jahra province, north of Kuwait City. The demonstration occurred in Sulaibiya, just north of Kuwait City, witnesses and a government official said on Saturday. A spokesman for the Interior Ministry, Col. Adil Al-Hashash, told CNN that the security forces called on protesters to stop demonstrating and to take their grievances through legal channels.
