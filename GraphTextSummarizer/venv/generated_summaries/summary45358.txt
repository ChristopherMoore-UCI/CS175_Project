The Agriculture Department Sunday ordered the recall of 143 million pounds of beef that came from a California processing plant. As of Thursday afternoon, officials had located 15.2 million pounds of the 143 million pounds of recalled beef. A congressional panel on food safety plans hearings next month on the beef recall and will have questions about inspections and the level of voluntary compliance with rules on animal processing. -- The Humane Society of the United States is partly responsible for the magnitude of the largest beef recall in the nation's history, Agriculture Secretary Ed Schafer said Thursday. The newly appointed agriculture secretary, in a briefing with reporters after remarks at a farm conference, declined to list additional retail outlets that may have bought and distributed the recalled meat products, some of which went to public school systems across the country.
