Saturday's doubles rubber will see Michael Llodra and Arnaud Clement of France take on Serbian duo Nenad Zimonjic and Viktor Troicki, but Djokovic could be drafted in at short notice to bolster the home team. Djokovic hit a blistering 62 winners for his sixth win out of six in singles ties for Serbia this year as they bid for their first Davis Cup title. Gael Monfils put France ahead with an emphatic 6-1 7-6 6-0 win over Janko Tipsarevic before Novak Djokovic brushed aside Gilles Simon 6-3 6-1 7-5 to level for the hosts. To be able to have this support is really relevant," Djokovic told the official Davis Cup website.. Earlier, the in-form Monfils silenced a partisan home crowd by thrashing Janko Tipsarevic in the opening singles rubber on Friday. Tipsarevic has often been the hero for Serbia in Davis Cup over recent years, but he was subjected to booing from some of his own fans as he capitulated in a one-sided third set.
