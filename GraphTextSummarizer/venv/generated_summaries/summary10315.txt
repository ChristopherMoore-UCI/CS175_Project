New keeper Simon Mignolet was indeed rarely tested despite United having most of the possession, with United striker Robin van Persie squandering his team's top chance in the dying minutes. The Reds might be changing the minds of a few after beating Manchester United, traditionally its fiercest rival, 1-0 at Anfield thanks to another goal from birthday boy Daniel Sturridge. While Liverpool has started the campaign strong, Manchester United fell to one win, one loss and one draw under new manager David Moyes. Agger beat United defender Rio Ferdinand to the ball on the corner and then Sturridge poked it into the net with his head. Unable to create much going forward, United's frustration grew and van Persie exchanged angry words with Steven Gerrard.
