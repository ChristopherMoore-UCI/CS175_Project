" Promoting art When he's not crafting compelling artwork in his studio, or scouring the streets for materials, Kabiru is visiting rural communities in Kenya as part of his "Outreach" initiative, aimed at encouraging creativity and raising awareness about ecological issues in his country. -- Ever since he was a young boy, Kenyan artist Cyrus Kabiru has envisaged breathing new life into his surroundings. Back in the 1960s, Kabiru's father was beaten by his mother after accidentally destroying a pair of expensive glasses she'd bought him. In Kabiru's hands, cast-aside bolts, wires, spoons and bottle tops gain a new lease of life as vital components of whimsical pieces of art. And even though Kabiru's art is winning more and more admirers of all ages both home and abroad, there's still one older person who needs convincing.
