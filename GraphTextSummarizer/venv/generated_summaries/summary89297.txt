In the case of Chernobyl, thyroid cancer cases in children reached a peak about 10 years after exposure, according to a report analyzing radiation exposure and the risk of pediatric thyroid cancers. The Fukushima Prefectural Government found more cases of thyroid cancer, with 57 people confirmed cases and 46 others listed as possible cases, according to data released this week. A scientific review published in 2011, found that pediatric thyroid cancers only account for 0.5 to 3% of all types of cancers. Hisakatsu Kotani, from the Fukushima prefectural government's health research section, said there were no patterns detected between the cases of thyroid cancers and high radiation areas. Children are more sensitive to radiation and at risk for a longer period of time than adults, according to medical literature on thyroid cancer.
