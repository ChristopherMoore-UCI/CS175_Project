And the same is true for Los Angeles Clippers owner Don Sterling, if you believe that he made the remarks attributed to him by TMZ and Deadspin. The problem is that while men such as Bundy and Sterling may be racist, they are not the face of racism. The longer the media allow ignorant relics like Bundy to continue to hog the spotlight -- and the public points at him as the face of conservative racism -- the longer the current incarnation can go unchecked. They don't have a racist bone in their body because they would never make such outlandish statements. But don't make such people out to be anything more than what they are -- the few remaining voices of oppression from years past.
