In a note, he said the box contained "powerful new technology plastic explosives" that would go off if Pulver did not follow his instructions, according to a complaint for provisional arrest filed in U.S. District Court in Louisville, Kentucky. Peters, who is in his 50s, was traced to the United States and arrested in Kentucky, more than 9,000 miles from suburban Sydney where the dramatic events took place in early August. The document says he sauntered into Pulver's room on August 3, wearing a business shirt, slacks and a blue, yellow and white mask that covered everything but his mouth and a pair of "saggy and wrinkly" eyes. The guilty plea by Paul Douglas Peters at Sydney Central Local Court is the latest development in a case that grabbed the attention of the international news media last summer. Investigators in Australia and the United States say they linked Peters to the e-mail address using video surveillance and access logs, and found credit card records showing that he had purchased a thumb drive, lanyard and baseball bat identical to those used in the extortion attempt, according to the complaint.
