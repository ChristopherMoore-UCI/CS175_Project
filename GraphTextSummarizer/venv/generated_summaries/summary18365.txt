"This unrealistic plan, that the President would dump on his successor, would ensure higher utility rates and far fewer jobs." President Barack Obama announced Wednesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping that the U.S. will cut its 2005 level of carbon emissions by 26-28% by 2025 while China committed to creating more energy from zero-emission sources and begin reducing its emissions footprint by 2030. Top congressional Republican leaders quickly criticized the U.S.-China climate change pact to cut carbon emissions that President Barack Obama announced while traveling in Asia. And while McConnell and Obama have both vowed to try and work together, climate change regulation is likely to remain a contentious point with little common ground between Obama and GOP leaders. The agreement does not require congressional ratification, but a senior Obama administration official said "leading climate deniers" in the GOP could try and stop the initiative through legislation. Boehner called the deal another example of Obama's "job-crushing policies." "And it is the latest example of the president's crusade against affordable, reliable energy that is already hurting jobs and squeezing middle-class families," Boehner said in a statement Wednesday.
