A crucial vote passed Tuesday night, which directs $300 million in taxpayer dollars to the development, and paves the way for the Braves move from downtown Atlanta to the northern suburbs, the Cobb County Commission said. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed had said he tried to negotiate with the Braves to keep them in Atlanta, but ultimately the price became too high. This vote comes just two weeks and a day after the Braves made the stunning announcement that the team was moving from downtown Atlanta. "So we wish the Braves well knowing the city of Atlanta has much to be proud of." The Atlanta Braves are one step closer to moving away from Atlanta.
