(EW.com) -- After various Websites noted a curious surge in votes Tuesday for a contestant in Oprah Winfrey's "Your OWN Show" contest, OWN, the television network Winfrey will launch in January, confirms to EW it is investigating. But in the afternoon, contestant Dr. Phyllis -- who proposes a reality show on teachers because the drama is in the classroom, rather convincingly -- took the top spot by amassing votes at a rate that spurred some techno-savvy readers into sleuth mode. While some conspiracy theorists have gone as far as to suggest that Winfrey could be rigging the competition against Anner, he has not jumped to that conclusion: "I sincerely doubt that Oprah would do anything like that," he says in a statement to EW. Contacted by EW, a spokesperson for OWN issued the following statement: "The online voting rules for the 'Your OWN Show' video submission competition were carefully crafted to be fair to everyone. The online contest is really a search for contestants for an OWN reality series in which competitors will then vie for their own show on the network.
