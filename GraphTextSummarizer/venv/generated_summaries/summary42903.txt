The formula used by the Social Page Evaluator is related to the formula that Vitrue released last month to estimate the relative value of Facebook Fans to big brands. Still, it's a fun, easy way to get an idea of the factors that impact a Facebook Page valuation. You can also compare a Facebook Page with up to three other brands at a time and view a Page's value history. Likewise, there is a "Fan-tasize" section that lets you manipulate other features like number of posts per day, engagement level and Fan count to see how that affects the valuation. Social media management company Vitrue released a free tool Thursday, the Social Page Evaluator, designed to help marketers get a better understanding of a Facebook page's value.
