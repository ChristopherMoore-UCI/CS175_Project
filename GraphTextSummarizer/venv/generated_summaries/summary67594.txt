The Transportation Security Administration, which oversees the security for U.S. travel, says it has issued a directive for additional security measures to be implemented for flights as they leave their last stop before the United States. During flight, passengers will be asked to follow flight crew instructions, such as stowing personal items, turning off electronic equipment and remaining seated during certain portions of the flight." " Cathay Pacific states that additional security measures will include: "Pat down check by security personnel and physical inspection of their cabin baggage and personal property prior to boarding; and, restricting the use of cabin phones at any time during the flight. International air passengers face tightened security on U.S.-bound flights following the alleged attempt by Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab to bomb a Christmas Day flight heading for Detroit. " It adds that holiday presents in hand luggage will need to be unwrapped -- but only for U.S.-bound flights.
