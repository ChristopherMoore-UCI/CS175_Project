-- A visit to North Korea and China planned by Iran's parliament speaker was postponed Saturday, the semi-official Mehr news agency reported. In May, a report compiled by a U.N. panel of experts looking into Security Council violations by North Korea found the country continues to trade banned weapons technology with several nations, including Iran. "The time for Larijani's visit has changed and we will announce the new time when it is determined," said Hijatoleslam Hossein Sobhaninya, a member of the presiding board of parliament, according to Mehr. Ali Larijani's trips were intended to promote parliamentary cooperation.
