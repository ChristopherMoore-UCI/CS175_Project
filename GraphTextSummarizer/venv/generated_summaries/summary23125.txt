"One of the enormous achievements is to have built up such a collection of such enormous historic and aesthetic importance in such a short space of time," Museum Director Oliver Watson told CNN. -- Through time the art and architecture of the Islamic world has defined a civilization that once extended from Cordoba in Spain to the Mogul empire in China and India. These were works that were commissioned by merchants in Basra to be made in central China," Watson explained. "The interesting thing is not only that the Islamic world had trade connections out to China, but that this kind of ware, that wasn't used in China [at the time] was commissioned. From intricate metal work and calligraphy to ceramics, textiles and precious stones, the collection represents the feverish efforts of the Qatari royal family to assemble an unrivalled collection of Islamic antiquities over the past few years.
