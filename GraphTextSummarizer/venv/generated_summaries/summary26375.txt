Several House Republicans said a lawsuit should be filed immediately to attempt to halt -- at least temporarily -- the president's plans, but they admit that legal challenge will drag out and should be pursued on a separate track than the debate over government funding. Block the president's nominees Still another idea floated by some GOP members is to block some of the president's nominations in the Senate in response to executive order. It's unlikely Republicans would refuse to vote on Loretta Lynch, the president's pick to replace Eric Holder as Attorney General, but they could deny votes on other key positions the president want to fill. That's why other Republican lawmakers admit they would have to put policy riders negating the president's actions on appropriations bills, which would lead back to the short term problem of a government shutdown, since the president is unlikely to sign a bill that rolls back his own executive order. Now, Republicans are so shutdown averse, even Brooks tells CNN they should do everything in their power to fight President Barack Obama's immigration executive action.
