There is built-in tension in the relationship between the president and the press, Earnest said: "If there's ever a day when the White House press corps sits back and says, 'You know, we're getting all the information that we need from the White House Press Office,' then everybody in the White House press corps would not be doing their jobs, right?" Earnest said he had seen the letter to Obama signed by more than 40 news media organizations, including the Society of Professional Journalists and National Press Foundation, urging the President and his federal agencies to be more transparent -- to "stop the spin and let the sunshine in." " In spite of aggressive prosecutions of whistleblowers and other actions, he said that he thought the administration had lived up to it so far -- "absolutely" -- and pointed to the quarterly release of White House visitor records and reporters' access to presidential fundraisers at private homes. But the commitment endures, newly appointed White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in an interview on CNN's "Reliable Sources" on Sunday. -- Press groups, prominent journalists and administration critics have all accused President Barack Obama of failing to live up to his commitment to have the "most transparent administration in history." Earnest described himself as a voracious consumer of media, thanks partly to the White House press clippings service and partly to his iPad.
