"We're fighting for every foot of containment we can get on this fire," said U.S. Forest Service Fire Chief Mike Dietrich. A massive fire that has charred more than 147,000 acres in Southern California and destroyed dozens of homes north of Los Angeles was caused by arson, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman said Thursday. Nearly all the fire was in forest land and the nearby foothill communities, including La Canada Flintridge, La Crescenta and Acton. The governor said he insisted that the state budget he signed in July have a $500 million reserve for emergencies such as fires. Fire officials said progress has been made, particularly on the west side of the fire, but the blaze was still producing hot spots, including one that forced the evacuation of 25 residents early Thursday.
