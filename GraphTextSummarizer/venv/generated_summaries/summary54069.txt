"We're working with the government of Iraq to increasingly and very quickly get urgently needed arms to the Kurds," State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf told CNN's New Day on Monday. The Obama administration has shipped weapons directly to Kurdish forces battling ISIS militants in northern Iraq and is considering ways to expand the transfer of arms, U.S. officials told CNN. The CIA shipments are useful because the Kurdish fighters -- known as the Peshmerga -- use different arms and ammunition than the U.S. military stocks, so the intelligence agency is better equipped to get that type of material to the Kurds quickly. Since last Thursday, the Iraqi government has transferred three shipments of arms and ammunition to the Kurds, one of the officials said. One official noted more arms could come from other countries in consultation with the United States.
