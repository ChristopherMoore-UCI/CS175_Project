-- California Gov. Jerry Brown announced Tuesday almost $1 billion in midyear budget cuts as a result of insufficient state growth. The latest round of cuts is on top of $16 billion in reduced spending that the state enacted earlier this year, Brown said. The $1 billion figure is better than an earlier estimate that as much as $2.4 billion in trigger cuts would be needed by the end of this year, Brown said. Next November, California voters will go to the polls to consider taxes that would provide $7 billion in additional revenue, Brown said. The so-called "trigger cuts" will result in reduced spending for universities, schools, prosecutions, and in-home care for the elderly and disabled, Brown said.
