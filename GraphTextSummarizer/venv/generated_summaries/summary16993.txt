Two women joined the female security line, one of whom "blew herself up, causing minimal casualty," said witness Abdulkarim Musa. Those measures -- in which people are checked for explosives and guns -- were set up because of the spate of Boko Haram attacks in the city and region. The terrorist group has not only bombed crowded markets but attacked churches and mosques, raided villages, and kidnapped people young and old -- most famously the more than 200 girls taken last April from a school in Chibok. The next attack took place about an hour later outside Monday Market, the main one in the city, where people were lined up to go through security. Then, as people gathered to help, the second woman detonated her explosives, said Musa, who was waiting outside the market in the male security line.
