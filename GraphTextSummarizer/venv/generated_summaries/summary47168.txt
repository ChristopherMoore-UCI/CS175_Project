Sunday's targeting of tourists marks a new threshold in Egyptian terror, at least in recent years. The Sinai region has seen Islamist militants become more active in recent years. Egypt's Minister of Tourism Hesham Zaazou said the Egyptian government had taken the "utmost measures" to protect tourists in the country. In July, when the military ousted Morsy in a coup, Islamist extremists in the Sinai saw it as an attack against Islam and stepped up their assaults, particularly against soldiers and military installations. Taba is in the northeastern Sinai Peninsula, just a few miles from Israel.
