Still, this year saw the release of a number of worthwhile CD and DVD boxed sets. "The Wizard of Oz" (Warner Home Video, 5 DVDs, $69.92) and "Gone With the Wind" (Warner Home Video, 6 DVDs, $69.92) Two classic movies from that classic year for movies, 1939, get lavish 70th-anniversary editions. "GWTW" includes art cards, a journal and a book of production art. You can see the influence of the prototypical series of the '80s in countless dramas that have followed, from the delicate soundtrack (by W.G. Snuffy Walden) to densely written characters (Aaron Sorkin should pay royalties). As we head into the final shopping weekend before Christmas, here are a few worth checking out from beginning to end.
