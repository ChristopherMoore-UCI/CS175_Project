"The assault victims did not come forward until police began combing the Kensington (neighborhood) for suspects and potential victims following the November homicides," Evers said. Many residents of the city have joined a Facebook page titled "Catch the Kensington Strangler, before he catches someone you love," and police say a male Philadelphia resident was falsely accused of being responsible for three strangulation murders and three other assaults that have occurred in the central Philadelphia area in recent weeks. The partially clothed body of the third victim, Casey Mahoney, 27, was discovered December 15, according to police spokeswoman Jillian Russell. The post contained a photograph of the man and listed his address and contact information, police spokesman Lt. Ray Evers told CNN. "The investigation appears to be limited to Philadelphia," FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said this week.
