Harry Lewis, a professor and former dean of Harvard College, said on his blog that he will likely move most of his personal e-mails to another account, keeping his Harvard address just for business. Harvard students forced to withdraw amid cheating scandal "To be clear: No one's e-mails were opened and the contents of no one's e-mails were searched by human or machine," they said. "While the specific document made public may be deemed by some as not particularly consequential, the disclosure of the document and nearly word-for-word disclosure of a confidential board conversation led to concerns that other information -- especially student information we have a duty to protect as private -- was at risk," said a statement from Deans Michael D. Smith and Evelynn M. Hammonds. Smith and Hammonds stressed that the search was limited to administrative accounts, and that it did not involve a review of e-mail content. On Monday, the school apologized for the way it handled a secret search of the e-mail accounts of resident deans.
