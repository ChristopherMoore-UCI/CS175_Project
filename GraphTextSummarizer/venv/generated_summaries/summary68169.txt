"My motivation is completely intact after the news last week," the 43-year-old told the sport's official website ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix. "Especially because Suzuka is one of the season's highlights for me. " Schumacher is currently 12th in the drivers' standings, 151 points behind championship leader Fernando Alonso of Ferrari, with six races of the season remaining. On Sunday, the most-decorated driver in F1 history will have his work cut out to finish in the points as Schumacher must serve a 10-place grid penalty at Suzuka for his part in a collision which forced both he and Toro Rosso's Jean-Eric Vergne out of the Singapore Grand Prix. -- Seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher insists he is still motivated to race in Formula One despite last week's announcement that he will be replaced at Mercedes by Lewis Hamilton. "Logically, it would also be nice to achieve a sporting highlight this weekend," continued Schumacher.
