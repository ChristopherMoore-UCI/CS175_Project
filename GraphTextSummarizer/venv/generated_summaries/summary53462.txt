Simply put, naloxone can unseat oxycodone on those same brain receptors, blocking its ability to provide pain relief. The drug's maker, Purdue Pharma, said the combination is intended to "alleviate pain while also introducing a new method by which to help deter misuse and abuse." Oxycodone is one in a group of powerful painkillers -- called opioid analgesics -- that include hydrocodone, morphine and hydromorphone. It provides pain relief by binding to receptors in the brain that dull the sensation of pain. In the painkiller world, oxycodone and naloxone seem like strange bedfellows. Oxycodone is a powerful painkiller, while naloxone is used to reverse painkiller overdose.
