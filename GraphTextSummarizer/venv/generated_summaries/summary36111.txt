On Monday, hundreds of EDL supporters marched near the central London office of Prime Minister David Cameron. After the blaze, police said they were aware of online postings "by a small minority of individuals" that were intended to "incite trouble," Humberside County police said. The group, led by Cameron, will "have a general focus on extremist groups, but accept that in practice the greatest threat is from Islamist extremists," a statement from Downing Street said. EDL demonstrators threw objects at counter demonstrators, and police stepped in to keep the raucous men from going after their opponents. Armed police arrested a 50-year-old man on a street in the town of Welling in southeastern England.
