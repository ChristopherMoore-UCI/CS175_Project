With Alonso failing to finish in the top 10, therefore missing out on world championship points, Massa's seventh-placed finish proved enough for him to steal the overall lead from his Ferrari teammate The Brazilian, who has returned to F1 this season after suffering head injuries in an horrific crash last season, lies on 39 points, two ahead of Alonso and Vettel who are tied for second place. Red Bull have claimed all three pole positions so far this season, with German Vettel heading the grid in the first two races and Webber starting first at Sepang, but had been hit by reliability issues priot to Sunday's race. But this season promises to be one of the closest ever with only nine points separating the top seven after three different winners -- Alonso, Button and Vettel -- in the first three races. McLaren's former world champion Lewis Hamilton drove superbly to battle his way to sixth position, after starting 20th, while Ferrari's Felipe Massa finished seventh and current world champion Jenson Button was eighth. Meanwhile, Bahrain GP winner Fernando Alonso, who led the championship going into the race, saw his race ended on the penultimate lap due to an engine problem with his Ferrari -- after he had tried to overtake Button.
