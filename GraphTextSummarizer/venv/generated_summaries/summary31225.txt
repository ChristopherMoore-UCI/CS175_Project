" Biden also threw his support behind the resumption of direct peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which stalled in September when Israel failed to renew its freeze on Jewish settlement construction. -- Vice President Joe Biden forcefully reaffirmed U.S. support for Israel during a speech Sunday before the general assembly of a major Jewish organization, telling the audience that "the ties between our two countries are literally unbreakable." He also downplayed reports of a rift in relations due in part to Israel's announcement in March while Biden was visiting the country that it was building 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim as their capital. Biden spoke at the Jewish Federations of North America annual gathering in New Orleans, Louisiana, after meeting for about an hour with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is scheduled to address the group Monday. "While the United States will continue to do whatever we can to defend Israel's legitimacy, whenever and wherever it is questioned, we all know that the only true way for it to gain the long-term security it seeks and deserves is through genuine, secure peace with its neighbors," he said.
