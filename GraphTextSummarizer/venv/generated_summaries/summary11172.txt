The invitation from Facebook for Thursday's 1 p.m. ET event is vague, simply beckoning, "Come see a new look for News Feed." We'll report live on the updates from Facebook headquarters Thursday. Josh Constine at TechCrunch reports that the main news feed will be broken into categories, with content such as music information and photos (including Instagram shots) separated off into dedicated feeds. When Facebook rolled out its Timeline feature in 2011, some members balked at the radically different look and even started petitions asking that the new profile pages be made optional. Facebook is rolling out a fresh design for its central page, the News Feed, at an event Thursday.
