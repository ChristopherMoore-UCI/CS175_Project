-- Argentina's Congress debated a broadcast reform bill Wednesday, a proposal analysts say is the latest blow in a fight between President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and media conglomerate Grupo Clarin. Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has blamed Grupo Clarin for her low approval ratings. The newspaper Clarin has been highly critical of the leadership of Fernandez de Kirchner and her husband and predecessor, Nestor Kirchner. In response, Fernandez de Kirchner has come out swinging at the Clarin newspaper and its parent company, observers said. "We urge Argentinean legislators not to pass this bill in its current form." If anyone is applying unfair pressure, it is monopolistic media companies, Fernandez de Kirchner said.
