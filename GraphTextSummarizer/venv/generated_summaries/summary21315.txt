Bayern Munich resumed their quest for a 23rd league title on Saturday with a 2-0 win over Greuther Furth at the Allianz Arena as the Bundesliga returned to action after it's annual winter break. Two goals in two minutes from Polish defender Sebastian Boenisch and Bayer Leverkusen remain in second place after a 3-1 win at home to fourth-placed Frankfurt. Defending champions Borussia Dortmund thumped Werder Bremen 5-0 to stay in third place while seventh-placed Mainz and sixth-placed Freiburg played out a goalless draw. Andre Schuerrle made it 3-0 in the 58th minute, before Frankfurt's Alexander Meier scored a consolation goal with 12 minutes remaining.
