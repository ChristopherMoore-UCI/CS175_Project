-- A judge in Ecuador ruled Wednesday that the directors and former opinion editor of El Universo newspaper must each serve three years in prison for an opinion article about President Rafael Correa, state media reported. In a statement Tuesday, the Inter American Press Association criticized "the ongoing harassment of the Ecuador's independent press through excessive and disproportionate legal suits by President Rafael Correa." "El Universo newspapers rejects this 80-page sentence, delivered in record time (less than 24 hours), by a judge said that he had worked until 5 a.m. to absorb details of the case, which has moved quickly through the hands of five distinct judges in four months," the statement said. Correa filed a libel lawsuit after El Universo published a column in February by the newspaper's then-opinion editor, titled, "No to lies. Emilio Palacio, El Universo's former opinion editor, said he was not accusing the president of ordering an attack on innocent civilians, but instead saying that a future president who is an enemy of Correa could make such an accusation.
