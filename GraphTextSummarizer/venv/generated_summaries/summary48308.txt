Teen rape trial shines unwelcome spotlight on Ohio town 'Stumbling and slurring' One of the witnesses, a college freshman who described himself as a friend of Mays and Richmond's cousin, testified he saw the alleged victim "stumbling and slurring her words" at the first of a series of parties that night. Steubenville teens treated girl 'like a toy,' prosecutor says Texting teens Some of the messages were between Mays and the alleged victim. Mays responded that "nothing happened last night," telling her in the message she performed a sex act on him, Gibb testified. According to prosecutors, Richmond and Mays each penetrated the victim's vagina with their fingers, an act that constitutes rape under Ohio law. The testimony from Joann Gibb of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation came on the second day of a case that focuses heavily on texts, cell phone images and social media posts surrounding the alleged sexual abuse of the 16-year-old girl in August 2012.
