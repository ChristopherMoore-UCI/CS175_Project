Eurostar, the company that operates the service, canceled several trains Monday and experienced "severe delays totaling many hours on others," said a company spokeswoman. -- A power supply problem left passengers stuck on Eurostar trains between Britain and France for several hours on Monday and early Tuesday, the high-speed rail company said. CNN's Juliet Mann was trying to get from Paris to London by Eurostar on Monday afternoon. The glitch in the overhead electricity lines on the French side of the tunnel under the English Channel caused big delays on trains running in both directions. The Eurostar runs a route between London and Paris, stopping in some cases at smaller towns in between.
