Pienaar, after the release of the movie "Invictus" that tells the story, said of his first meeting with Mandela -- when the president described his plan to use the team to help bring white and black south Africa together -- "I left that first meeting with the feeling that we were in good hands in South Africa. But I have discovered the secret that, after crossing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to cross." Twenty years ago, there was no freedom for Mandela, no freedom for black South Africans. And Mandela was instrumental in bringing soccer's World Cup to South Africa -- finally arriving this year, six years after soccer's world body awarded the event. " And no one is more keenly aware of those "big problems" than Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela, now known fondly in South Africa by his clan name, Madiba. He urged black South Africans to support the South African national rugby team -- hated by many blacks because they viewed it as the sport of their oppressors -- in 1995.
