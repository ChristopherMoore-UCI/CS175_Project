And as Google products such as its self-driving cars and data goggles pioneer this brave new world of intelligent devices, it is essential that the FTC and the commission guarantee that the ubiquitous Google search engine doesn't degenerate into a platform for this increasingly powerful company to hawk its own intelligent products and services. But rather than being run by intelligent devices, it's unfortunately being run more and more by a single company -- Google, which controls over 90% of the search market in several European countries. Google has been accused in both Europe and the United States of using its dominant position in search to unfairly promote its own products and services -- from travel and shopping comparison engines to advertising and mapping. Specifically, they were meeting to discuss potential FTC and EU anti-trust lawsuits against the tech giant, in an attempt to resolve the Google problem. But for future entrepreneurs really to be able to innovate, we need fair search which doesn't prioritize the products and services of Google itself.
