With other countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and the Republic of Ireland all wobbling under massive debts this means a sizable chunk of the eurozone is under great strain. -- Financial markets were in turmoil on Wednesday amid fears that more countries could be sucked into Greece's mounting debt crisis. Greece is already in major breach of eurozone rules on deficit management and with S&P downgrading the country's debt rating to junk status, this reflects badly on the credibility of the euro. National debt, put at â‚¬300 billion ($394 billion), is bigger than the country's economy, with some estimates predicting it will reach 120 percent of gross domestic product in 2010. Some people want to see a knockout loan from the Eurozone and IMF closer to $100 billion to give Greece enough firing power to cool the speculation on a default.
