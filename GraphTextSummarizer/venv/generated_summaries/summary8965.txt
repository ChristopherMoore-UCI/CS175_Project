The school, Al-Arabiya Aloom Jamia Masjid Zikirya, which also was a drug rehab clinic, is in Sohrab Goth, a suburb of Gadap in Karachi. Many of the captives told police their families sent them there because they were recovering drug addicts. All 14 boys were returned to their families, senior police official Ahsanullah Marwat told CNN. "The operation was successful, and we plan on continuing our work to ensure that places like this are shut down," Marwat said. Three people who worked at the facility were arrested, but the four men who ran the place were still at large, Marwat said.
