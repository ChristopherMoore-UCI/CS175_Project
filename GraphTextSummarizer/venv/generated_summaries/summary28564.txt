Barca won an historic treble of Spanish league, Spanish Cup and and Champions League titles last season, their first under former captain Pep Guardiola. Guardiola's team face possibly nine matches in a busy month and are also missing players on Africa Cup of Nations duty. The Catalan giants added to the tally by scooping the Spanish and European Supercups and rounded off 2009 with victory in the World Club Cup last month, beating Estudiantes of Argentina in the final. Jeffren and Seydou Keita miss out through injury against Villarreal who drew 3-3 at the Camp Nou last season after being 3-1 down. In celebration of their success, Barca have invited players who left the club in the summer, including Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o, to take part in the pre-match parade.
