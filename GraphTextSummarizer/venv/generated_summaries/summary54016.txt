Meanwhile, Hailey Dunn's mother, Billie Dunn, told HLN's Nancy Grace that she and her live-in boyfriend, Shawn Adkins, both failed polygraph exams. Adkins was the last person to see the eighth-grade cheerleader on December 27 at Dunn's home in Colorado City, according to local reports. Colorado City -- a rural central Texas town -- is about 70 miles west of Abilene. Hailey's father, Clint Dunn, says she often came to his home but did not on that day. Dunn said she took the polygraph test after she was informed that Adkins had failed.
