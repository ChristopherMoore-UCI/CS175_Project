Watch how the students learned about the scholarship loss Â» U.S. officials had said the scholarships were rescinded because Israel had denied them exit visas. If the seven are allowed to leave, it would be the first time Israel has let students do so from Gaza since January, according to Palestinian advocacy group Gisha. The U.S. has restored Fulbright scholarships to seven Gaza-based students, saying it erred last week when it rescinded the awards because of travel restrictions that Israel imposes on the Palestinian territory. Israel, which has been criticized for banning hundreds of students from leaving Gaza to study abroad, said it considers each application individually. McCormack said the seven Gaza Fulbright students must be interviewed by Israeli authorities before they can get visas to the United States.
