Cell phones and radiation: The 10 highest- and lowest-emitting models What cell phone users can do If you are concerned that cell phones might increase your cancer risk, probably the best way to put the WHO announcement to good use is to minimize how much you hold your cell phone next to your head. -- Following the World Health Organization's announcement that radio frequency emissions from cell phones may increase the risk of some kinds of brain cancer, what do you need to know about the radiation coming from your phone? First things first: The WHO study did not say "cell phones cause brain cancer." Rather, there is some evidence indicating a possible connection -- and while not conclusive, it warrants further study. But Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health at University of California, Berkeley, told the Chronicle that "specific absorption rate isn't a very useful measure because it's the peak reading on a variety of tests conducted on cell phones to measure their radiation, but doesn't indicate the average amount of radiation a user would generally be exposed to." And should RF emission information be listed on cell phone packaging, and in stores?
