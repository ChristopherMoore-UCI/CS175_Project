And Prince Charles' one-time sister-in-law, Sarah Ferguson, landed Britain's former Foreign Minister David Miliband, in hot water, according to a cable described in the Guardian newspaper but not yet published by WikiLeaks. It goes on to report Banerji saying the issue of whether Prince Charles would succeed his mother as head of the Commonwealth would be dealt with after the queen passes. By way of an example, he cites comments by Syria's Foreign Minister Farouq Sharaa, to Jordanian officials, that Prince Charles was on the point of being implicated in a Scottish judicial investigation into Princess Diana's death; as a result, said the Syrian minister, the prince was about to embark on a trip to Iraq and Iran "to seek the support of the Muslim world." "They just don't get it," Muasher told the U.S. ambassador, referring to the Syrians. Amitav Banerji tells an officer at the U.S. Embassy in London that the prince does not "command the same respect" among Commonwealth members as does Queen Elizabeth, according to a cable sent on June 11, 2009. Banerji says Commonwealth officials were trying to get the prince "more involved" in the organization, according to the cable.
