The host nation defeated Angola 2-0 in Durban to leave it within touching distance of the quarterfinals following the disappointment of the opening day draw with minnow Cape Verde. My players worked very well and proved they have qualities," Cape Verde coach Luis Antunes told reporters. It was not easy out there on the pitch with the weather so hot." Cape Verde's 'Special One' Morocco will need to defeat South Africa to guarantee its place in the last-eight after it came from behind to secure a 1-1 draw against Cape Verde. That goal looked to have secured a famous victory for Cape Verde but Morocco refused to lie down and with just 12 minutes left, El Arabi popped up to fire home a leveler. But having defeated Cameroon in qualifying and held South Africa to a 0-0 draw in its opening game, Cape Verde's players showed little fear.
