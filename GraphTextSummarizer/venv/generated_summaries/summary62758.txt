The first reports of heavy snow came from Romania on January 26, Ramos said. A total of 122 people have frozen to death in Ukraine since the cold spell started more than a week ago, the state-run news agency Ukrinform reported, citing government ministries.

While further west, in London, Heathrow Airport said it would cancel approximately 30% of its flights on Sunday in response to the winter weather.
