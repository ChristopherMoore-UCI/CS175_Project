Unlike most mosquitoes that breed and prosper outside from dusk to dawn, the chikungunya virus is most often spread to people by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The good news, said Dr. William Shaffner, an infectious disease expert with Vanderbilt University in Nashville, is that the United States is more sophisticated when it comes to controlling mosquitoes than many other nations. A debilitating, mosquito-borne virus called chikungunya has made its way to North Carolina, health officials say. Other states have also reported cases of chikungunya. The other concern is the type of mosquito that carries the illness.
