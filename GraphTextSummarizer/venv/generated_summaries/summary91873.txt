The Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia quickly put Ieng Sary on trial and convicted him in absentia in 1979. But charges of torture and murder will continue against the remaining defendants -- former nominal head of state Khieu Samphan and former prime minister Nuon Chea. One of its infamous leaders died Thursday, escaping judgment for war crimes at the hands of a U.N. tribunal. His wife, Ieng Thirith, was excluded from the case after she was deemed unfit to stand trial in September 2012. He was the foreign minister under, and the brother-in-law-of, Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot.
