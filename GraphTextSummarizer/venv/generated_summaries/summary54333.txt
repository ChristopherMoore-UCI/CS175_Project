The tanker overturned along a highway spilling gallons of gas which hundreds of residents rushed to scoop up, said Titus Mung'ou of the Kenyan Red Cross. "People were lining up trying to get the fuel," he said. Emergency numbers failed to work and water ran out during attempts to put out the fire, said Mung'ou of the Kenyan Red Cross. Meanwhile, the death toll from last week's Nairobi supermarket fire rose to 27 on Sunday, the Red Cross said. "There is the need to strengthen the capacity in handling fires," Mung'ou said. The Red Cross sent more than 80 people to help with rescue efforts.
