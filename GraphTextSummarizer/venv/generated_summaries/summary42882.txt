Earlier this week, House GOP leaders discussed a $1.5 billion package -- more than $1 billion less than a plan introduced on Tuesday by Senate Democrats and significantly smaller than the $3.7 billion proposal the White House sent to Congress earlier this month. -- House Republicans are fashioning a scaled-down bill to address the southern border crisis that would provide less than $1 billion and include an immigration policy change that most Democrats strongly oppose. The Obama administration has indicated that it is open to making some tweaks to the law, but many congressional Democrats oppose changes and reject the GOP's move to attach that provision to the border money. But even if the House does pass a measure, a significant number of Senate Democrats are pushing for a larger spending bill without any policy change. There is increasing concern from members that they cannot leave town next week for their August recess without showing they have a solution to the surge of migrant youth from Central America overwhelming immigration services.
