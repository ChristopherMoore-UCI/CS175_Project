In a hospital room, she would use "yoga techniques," massage, a "birth ball," and music as pain management techniques. It's given me a new appreciation for doctors who successfully deliver thousands of babies, and most of all for the heroics of women -- especially my wife -- in that moment, suffering through all they suffer through for the sake of bringing life into the world. I opened up one filled with everything I had ever heard about real life births, including a child I know who was born not breathing for a couple of minutes. We all sometimes fall into traps that make us forget to seek balance -- to try to carve out enough time for family and for just enjoying life. As far as I knew, no sign of life.
