Multimedia journalist and iPhone street photographer Richard Koci Hernandez recently joined the CNN iReport community on Facebook for a chat about how to become a better smartphone photographer. "People do not understand the unbelievable opportunity that mobile photography is giving photographers," Hernandez said. You can also use other apps like ProCamera to separately set and lock the exposure and focus. Take 20 images of one thing from different angles. You'll begin to see the world differently, even if it's just walking around the bowl of fruit on your kitchen table and observing how the light falls on it from different angles.
