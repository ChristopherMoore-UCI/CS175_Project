-- Low visibility was to blame for a helicopter crash that killed 10 Americans on Monday in western Afghanistan, the U.S. Army said Wednesday. In the other crash, four U.S. service members died when two helicopters apparently collided in the air in southern Afghanistan. In all, 14 Americans died in the two crashes, the largest number of Americans killed in Afghanistan in a single day in more than four years, according to CNN records. Militants did not fire at the helicopter at any point during the departure or crash. The helicopter crashed about 3:30 a.m. Monday when it lifted off after a successful operation to disrupt arms smuggling and narcotics trafficking in the Qadis district, the Army said.
