"Storms are part of the deal when you set out to sail around the world," Abby Sunderland wrote in a blog on her website dated Saturday. As for her boat, Wild Eyes, it had to be left in the middle of the ocean, and Abby said she's "still trying to get over the fact that I will never see my Wild Eyes again." Thank you for caring for our daughter as if she were your own, for answering all of our many questions cheerfully and completely and for going above and beyond our wildest expectations to keep Abby safe," Laurence and Marianne Sunderland said in a post on the girl's website. "As for age, since when does age create gigantic waves and storms?" Criticism has emerged that she was too young to embark on such a journey, which apparently has ended. The parents, who also briefed reporters in Thousand Oaks, California on Saturday said they were overjoyed their daughter was found.
