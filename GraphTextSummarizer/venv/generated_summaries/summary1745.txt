The town itself fell to the pro-Russian separatists Friday, part of an advance south that has encircled the remnants of the Donbass Battalion, a volunteer militia fighting alongside government forces. -- A few miles south of the town of Starobeshevo in eastern Ukraine, a group of men in uniform is slumped under a tree. It's the only action by the air force that we've witnessed against a rebel force that's suddenly gone on the offensive across a wide area of eastern Ukraine. Locals said Ukrainian fire was to blame, but there is no way to prove it. By contrast, a small detachment of Ukrainian troops we encountered on the way north seemed demoralized.
