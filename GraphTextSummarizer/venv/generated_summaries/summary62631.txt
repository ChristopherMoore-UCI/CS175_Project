Dogged by allegations of sexual harassment, San Diego Mayor Bob Filner admitted Thursday "that I need help" but stopped short of resigning. Politics is full of second chances Earlier this week, numerous reports -- including one from CNN affiliate KSWB -- said that Filner's fiancee, Bronwyn Ingram, had called off their engagement for unspecified reasons. Among them is former city councilwoman Donna Frye -- a Democrat, like Filner, who recently worked in the mayor's office. Filner acknowledged Frye's request in a statement Thursday and implicitly admitted there was merit to her concerns. Amid the uproar, the mayor announced Thursday that he's "begun to work with professionals to make changes in my behavior and approach" and that he and his staff will have sexual harassment training.
