Beyonce lost again, this time to Nicki Minaj for her "Starships" video, but Kanye was not in the house to object this year, choosing to be in New York with girlfriend Kim Kardashian instead. The UK boy band won for best new artist, best pop video and the "most shareworthy" video. The 2012 version of MTV's big show passed without a major faux pas, such as happened three years ago when Kanye West interrupted Taylor Swift's acceptance of the best female video award to say it should have gone to Beyonce. " Drake got his own "Moon Man" statue when his "HYFR" won for best hip hop video. Rihanna, who also lost to Minaj, took the night's biggest honor later in the show, winning video of the year for "We Found Love."
