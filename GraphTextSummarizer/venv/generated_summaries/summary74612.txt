The country's new Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has said he wants to take steps to ensure that women are safe, particularly in rural India. The horrific gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi in late 2012 shook India, sparking campaigns against violent crimes against women in the country, the world's second most populous, after China. "Laws can only do so much when you have to end something which is as endemic and as entrenched as violence against women," said Divya Iyer, a senior researcher for Amnesty International in Bangalore, India. This Uttar Pradesh rape is the latest of several that have drawn the world's attention to India in recent years. The lack of indoor plumbing leaves women in rural areas vulnerable to frequent rapes and beatings.
