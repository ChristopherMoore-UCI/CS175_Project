It wasn't so much that they brought punk attitude to hip-hop (Public Enemy figured out that trick at the end of the '80s), but it was about the fact that traditional rock music — and later, jazz — could coexist next to traditional rap. "Hello Nasty" sounds like a reaction to the Diddy-fication of rap in the late '90s, with its focus on breaking down hip-hop into core sonic elements and executing them with breathtaking precision. That title is a little unfair, as those sales were powered by the wildfire success of "(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party)" — a track that many at the time considered more rock than rap. Though hip-hop had always incorporated rock samples and toyed with live instrumentation (Afrika Bambaataa liked to toss Rolling Stones records into his break beats), "Licensed to Ill" also essentially invented rap-rock. To the 5 Boroughs and Hot Sauce Committee Part Two both work to preserve hip-hop's past rather than trying to innovate, but the trio's curatorial minds are so sharp that they both act as a living tribute to the New York streets that birthed rap.
