Although this is the first total face transplant, there have been partial face transplants in France, the United States, China and Spain. Connie Culp, injured by a bullet in 2004, received the nose, upper lip and cheekbones of a donor in a 22-hour operation at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. -- Doctors in Spain say they have carried out the world's first full face transplant on a man who severely damaged his face in an accident. Doctors at Barcelona's Vall d'Hebron University Hospital say they were able to give the man a new nose, lips, teeth and cheekbones during 24 hours of surgery. The first was when doctors operated on Isabelle Dinoire in Amiens, France, in 2005.
