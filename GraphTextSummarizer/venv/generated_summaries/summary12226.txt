The Senate unanimously passed legislation Thursday that will allow taxpayers to deduct cash donations to Haiti earthquake relief on their 2009 tax returns instead of having to wait to file the claims next year. Haitians need donations of cash -- not clothes, food, medicine, or other relief supplies, as well intended as they might be, aid groups said Thursday. Haitian police shot and killed a man they suspected of stealing rice in Port-au-Prince on Thursday, leaving his body on the sidewalk for hours as his family mourned. The U.S. military will now station aid officials in the Port-au-Prince airport control tower to assess the contents of each flight, to prioritize landings and ease the flow of aid. Haiti's orphanages have become targets for people desperate for food, water and medical supplies, aid workers said.
