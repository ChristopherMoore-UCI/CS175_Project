TED.com: Bono: 8 talks that give me hope There has been astonishing progress in other areas of human development. In eight sub-Saharan African countries, malaria deaths have been cut by 75%; the rate of child mortality for those under 5 is down by 2.65 million deaths a year since 2000. First, not enough people have any idea of the successes in the fight against global diseases and poverty. Bono said that if the current trajectory can be continued, extreme poverty could be virtually eliminated by 2030. Bono argued that if we used transparency -- which tackles corruption like nothing else -- and technology, we can get closer to the "Zero Zone," where extreme poverty is virtually eliminated by 2028.
