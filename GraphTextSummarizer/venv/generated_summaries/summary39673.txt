Meanwhile, third seed Shahar Peer reached the quarterfinals of the HP Japan Women's Open with a hard-fought 3-6 6-1 6-3 win over local player Ryoko Fuda in Osaka on Thursday. American Jill Craybas thrashed Ukraine's Olga Savchuk 6-1 6-1, and the 36-year-old will next play French second seed Marion Bartoli. Second seed Daniela Hantuchova came back from 3-1 down in the first set to beat Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro and set up a quarterfinal with Patty Schnyder. Greek qualifier Eleni Daniilidou also made it through after defeating Austrian wildcard Sybille Bammer 6-1 7-6 (7-2), and she will next play German sixth seed Andrea Petkovic. The former world No. 1, who was given a wildcard entry into the Austrian event after the late withdrawal of the injured Serena Williams, had been leading 1-0 in the second set on Thursday when she needed to leave the court.
