Nit infestations, beer instead of water, a band for entertainment -- life on the Mary Rose, the flagship of King Henry VIII's fleet, which sank during battle in July 1545, wasn't all about crashing cannon fire and men being swept overboard, as novels and Hollywood like to depict. Today the secrets of life onboard can be seen in a new Â£27 million ($40 million) museum in Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. Some 60 million people watched the Mary Rose emerge from the water on live television in 1982. The 16th-century warship sank on July 19, 1545, in the English Channel during a battle with the French. The museum tells the story of life onboard a 16th-century warship and is dedicated to the approximately 400 men who lost their lives on the ship.
