Another fire, north of Pecos, New Mexico, has scorched about 8,000 acres and forced the evacuation of about 100 summer homes, said Denise Ottaviano of New Mexico Fire Information. It has destroyed some six homes, threatened as many as 1,000, and grew to more than 32,000 acres as of late Monday, according to Lisa Lugo with the Angeles National Forest. "We want to take advantage of the high humidity, get in there and do a direct attack and do all we can to get some of these hot spots put out so it doesn't spread anymore," Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Elsewhere in the West, a small fire burned in Jefferson County, Colorado, prompting evacuations, according to the Sheriff's Office there. -- Helped by higher humidity, firefighters battled back a wind-whipped wildfire in Southern California, clearing the way for many evacuated residents to return home.
