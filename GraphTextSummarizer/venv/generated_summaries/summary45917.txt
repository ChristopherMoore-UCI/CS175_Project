"For his part, Montesinos used Guevara as an intermediary to run personal errands and to arrange for the deposit of funds into Montesinos' accounts in U.S. banks," the document says. One of his missions was to Miami to meet with banker Luis Alfredo Percovich, who handled a Montesinos account at Pacific Industrial Bank. They met at a Miami hotel, where Guevara handed over a letter demanding that Percovich hand over $700,000 in cash from Montesinos' account and transfer $3 million to another bank. Then, spurred in part by the allure of a $5 million reward, Guevara helped authorities capture the fugitive, former Peruvian spy master Vladimiro Montesinos. But before there was a reward, Guevara had a different relationship with Montesinos, as his protector in Venezuela.
