The Colombian military says it has seized a submarine capable of transporting more than seven tons of cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. In a short news release, the Colombian military said that the submarine was ready to be loaded with drugs when found in Timbiqui, Cauca, a small town in the Pacific Coast. This is the most sophisticated tool ever found to traffic drugs from Colombia, local media reported. Then, experts said the technology used to build it was of Russian origin. Mexican authorities seized a similar submarine in 2008.
