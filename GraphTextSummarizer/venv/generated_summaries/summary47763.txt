-- A 13-year-old boy is in intensive care in Beijing after two adults assaulted him by releasing compressed air into his body using a mechanical pump at an automobile repair shop. Du's father, uncle and grandfather went along to Beijing. Chinese media reported that the boy, Du Chuanwang, who lives in Shandong Province on China's east coast, suffered from dozens of puncture wounds in his intestines and multiple organ failure. Ai Qingze, the head of the Shandong hospital where Du received initial treatment, told the China Daily newspaper that upon seeing his inflated belly, the surgeons there cut his abdomen open to expel the gas and saw that his small intestines were bleeding.
