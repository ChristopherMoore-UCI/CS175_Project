In a last-ditch effort to relieve his symptoms, Larsen decided to undergo deep brain stimulation. "This is not something that you consider first line for patients because this is invasive," said Maguire, chair of psychiatry and neuroscience at the University of California Riverside medical school, and part of the team evaluating whether Larsen was a good candidate for deep brain stimulation. 'I feel like laughing' As doctors navigated Larsen's brain tissue in the operating room -- stimulating different areas to determine where to focus the electrical current -- Larsen began to feel his fear fade. "I know that Brett has a lot of normal in him, even though this disease eats him up at times," said Michele Larsen. Doctors continued probing his brain for hours, figuring out what areas -- and what level of stimulation -- might work weeks later, when Larsen would have his device turned on for good.
