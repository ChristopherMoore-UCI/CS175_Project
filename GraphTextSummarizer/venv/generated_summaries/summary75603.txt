T+L says readers were asked to consider various factors, such as the city's reputation for aloof and smarty-pants residents as well as the presence of high-end shopping, good-looking locals, trendy food trucks and highbrow cultural offerings like classical music and theater. Five spectacular global art cities Other "21st-century definitions of elitism" among the criteria included the city's tech-savviness, number of artisanal coffeehouses and "a conspicuous eco-consciousness" (say, the kind of city where you get a dirty look for throwing your coffee cup in the wrong bin).
