Port Authority to cruise ship captain: 'Get on board, damn it' Rescue and recovery efforts continued Tuesday, with divers searching the ship for survivors and remains. "Nautilus is concerned about the rapid recent increases in the size of passenger ships, with the average tonnage doubling over the past decade," said Nautilus general secretary Mark Dickinson in a statement. It said Monday that while the investigation of the wreck is in its early stages, "We should seriously consider the lessons to be learned and, if necessary, re-examine the regulations on the safety of large passenger ships in the light of the findings of the casualty investigation." But as the official questions his decision, Schettino appears to reverse course and say he had not abandoned ship but was "catapulted into the water" at some point after the ship ran into a rock, began taking on water and started listing. "Many ships are now effectively small towns at sea, and the sheer number of people onboard raises serious questions about evacuation." Crye said regulations have kept pace with the increasing size of the vessels.
