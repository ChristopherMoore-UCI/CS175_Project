The country's then prime minister laid the medal on top of Foe's coffin as some 3,000 mourners - including further government dignitaries, FIFA president Sepp Blatter and Cameroon's football squad -- gathered at the four-hectare site. While the medical measures undertaken by FIFA form part of Foe's legacy, a final chapter continues to play out wherever Cameroon's Indomitable Lions roam. Irreplaceable midfielder The first team from Africa to reach the World Cup quarterfinals (in 1990), Cameroon were feared at the time of Foe's death -- with the team having added the 2002 Nations Cup to their 2000 title as they became the first to win back-to-back crowns in nearly four decades. The last month has been indicative of the country's recent woes, with World Cup qualification having hung by a thread until opponents Togo -- who beat Cameroon earlier this month -- were found to have fielded an ineligible player during the qualifier, meaning the Lions may be awarded some fortuitous points instead. "Foe's death really shook FIFA and what changed was the attitude of the Executive Committee and other decision-makers towards medicine and the health of the players," Professor Jiri Dvorak, FIFA's chief medical officer, told CNN from Brazil.
