" Woods has finished tied for 40th, 21st and third in the three majors ahead of this season's final one -- next week's PGA Championship at Kiawah Island. "It would be nice to get back there because obviously it meant that as far as I had dropped, to build my way back up to this point, I've had some wins, I've had some very high finishes, I've been consistent," said Woods, who dropped as low as 58th following his well-publicized divorce and injury problems. He is the only three-time winner on the U.S. circuit, but will be teeing off at Firestone on Thursday with South Africa's Branden Grace -- the only player on the European Tour with a hat-trick of victories in 2012. "When you make changes like I've made in my game, it takes a little bit of time, and things are starting to click in now. "This will be a nice way to get our games ready for obviously next week but also really test us at the same time.
