Independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta reported Sunday in an exclusive article that Magomedov had identified his daughter in a photograph that was published on the Internet last week. Sharipova triggered a homemade explosive device at Lubyanka subway station, the investigative committee said. Magomedov's account and forensic analyses left no doubt that the body was that of Sharipova, the official said. A person who knows the Magomedov family very well told the newspaper that Sharipova was a "calm and confident person. On Tuesday, Russian state television, citing law enforcement sources, said Sharipova had been the wife of 35-year-old Magomedali Vagabov, a local rebel leader who has been fighting government forces since the 1990s, and who reports directly to Dokku Umarov, the top Chechen rebel, who took responsibility for the bombings.
