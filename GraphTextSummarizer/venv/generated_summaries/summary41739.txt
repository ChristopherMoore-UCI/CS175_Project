-- Walter Hawkins, a Grammy Award-winning gospel singer, composer and pastor, has died of pancreatic cancer, his church said Monday on its website. With the choir he recorded a series of albums, titled "Love Alive," that topped the Billboard Gospel Album charts and sold more than 1 million copies from the 1970s to the 1990s, according to the church's website. Hawkins was nominated for a total of nine Grammy Awards throughout his career, and won one. He later helped found The Edwin Hawkins Singers, a collaboration that resulted in the Grammy-winning song "Oh Happy Day," one of the first gospel songs to become popular on mainstream music charts. Born in Oakland, California., Hawkins' musical career began at a young age as a member of the Northern California State Youth Choir.
