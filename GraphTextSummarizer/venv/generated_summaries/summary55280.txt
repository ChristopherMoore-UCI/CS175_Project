"This investment will not only provide a golden opportunity for young Chinese players sent overseas by Wanda to be selected by leading European football clubs, it will also strengthen the quality of Chinese football and narrow the gap between the rest of the world," Wang said Wednesday. The Chinese are coming -- to European football -- and billionaire Wang Jianlin hopes his decision to invest $52 million for a 20% stake in Spanish champion Atletico Madrid (ATM) will open doors for China's best players. Wang is following in the footsteps of other Asian businessman who have invested in European football, with Indonesian Erik Thohir at Inter Milan and Singaporean businessman Peter Lim owning a controlling stake in Atletico's fellow La Liga side Valencia. China's now second richest man previously used his wealth to establish the first Chinese professional football club --  Dalian Wanda F.C. -- just over 10 years ago. Last season Diego Simeone's side not only won the Spanish title but also reached the Champions League final before losing to city rival Real Madrid.
