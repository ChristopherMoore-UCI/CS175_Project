Police in Ji's home county said Dongguan authorities gave him 100,000 yuan (US$16,290) in compensation in 2010. It said that an investigation had found that Ji, who claimed he had been paralyzed after being beaten by security guards, was dissatisfied with how he had been treated by authorities. The court said the explosive device was contained inside a green canvas bag with the Chinese characters for revenge written on it and Ji hid the device inside his pants to evade airport security checks. On his personal blog in 2006, Ji had said he had been attacked and beaten by security guards outside a police station in 2005 after carrying a passenger on his motorcycle. However, the newspaper also reported that Dongguan police said Ji was not attacked and was instead injured when he fell off his motorcycle.
