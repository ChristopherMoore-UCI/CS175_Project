I was told that there is no financial connection between Waffle House and the old Toddle House. And, because there are more than 1,600 Waffle Houses in the United States, there are a whole lot of Waffle House menus. I must have eaten hundreds of Toddle House meals as a boy and young man. I delved into Toddle House history. To find out the reason for all of this, I got in touch with Waffle House headquarters, in Norcross, Georgia.
