Michigan's penal code says a person is guilty of ethnic intimidation "if that person maliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person's race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, causes physical contact with another person (or) damages, destroys, or defaces any real or personal property of another person." Fifth suspect charged in beating of Detroit driver 'Race is being looked at' as a possible motive in attack CNN's Stephanie Gallman and Haimy Assefa contributed to this report. Daughter Felicia Utash told CNN affiliate WXYZ that she doesn't want to believe the assault on her father was a hate crime, but she is pleased that suspects have been apprehended. After Utash stopped his vehicle to help the boy, he was "severely beaten" with "fists and feet," Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said in a statement. The four adult suspects are charged with attempted murder while the fifth, a juvenile, is charged with assault and ethnic intimidation.
