In mid-November, ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi issued an audiotape saying his Islamic State had expanded to Yemen and other Middle Eastern countries. Houthi militants dressed in government uniforms raided the main office of Yemen's daily Akhbar Al Youm newspaper Thursday, according to two officials in the Yemen Journalists Syndicate, an organization for reporters in the country. A senior cleric for al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen was killed along with three other people in a drone strike on their vehicle January 31 in Yemen, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said Thursday. The cleric, Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari, was killed in Yemen's south-central Shabwa province, AQAP said. Akhabar Al Youm is one of the oldest independent publications in Yemen, with print houses in Sanaa and Aden.
