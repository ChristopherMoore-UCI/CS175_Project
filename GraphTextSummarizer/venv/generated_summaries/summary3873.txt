"Thanks, Phil...and 'Bye Bye.'" Phil and Don were born in the business, the offspring of country and western singers Margaret and Ike Everly. "Bye Bye Love" was "the first thing that really killed me," Paul Simon once recalled. After averaging a Top 10 hit every four months over the next few years, the Everly Brothers inked a 10-year pact with Warner Brothers Records (formerly part of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, though now owned by Access Industries) in 1960. Their style -- a product of their blend of rock 'n' roll with Appalachian folk, bluegrass and other genres more closely aligned to their Kentucky roots -- helped them earn inductions in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame. Rolling Stone labeled the Everly Brothers "the most important vocal duo in rock," having influenced the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel and many other acts.
