Perez, who has been labor secretary since 2013, told CNN that playing mediator in the West Coast ports dispute was "among the most difficult" challenges he has faced so far in office. The standoff has been a nightmare for U.S. businesses that use the West Coast ports to import and export their goods. Labor Secretary Tom Perez said Saturday he believes the U.S. economy can "recover quickly" from the months-long labor dispute that has crippled ports along the West Coast but acknowledged business owners across the country have already suffered losses. Analysts say the process of clearing the ports of the existing congestion could take weeks, if not months. Perez helped broker a tentative contract agreement on Friday between dockworkers and their employers after President Barack Obama dispatched him to San Francisco this week.
