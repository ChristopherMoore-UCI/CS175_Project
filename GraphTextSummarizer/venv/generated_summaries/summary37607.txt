Peak blooms are expected at the tail end of the three-week-long National Cherry Blossom Festival, which kicks off Friday and runs through April 12. The fluttering pink and white blossoms are expected to hit their peak between April 11 and April 14. There should be plenty of pent-up anticipation among cherry blossom fans in Washington this spring. The festival consists of a hot tricks showdown, learning how to make and fly kites, and there's even a kite doctor on site to repair broken kites. Kwanzan trees are usually found in the East Potomac Park area and produce pink blossoms.
