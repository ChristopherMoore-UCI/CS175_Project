Andy Murray picked up his first title of 2015 without having to so much as lift his racket after Novak Djokovic pulled out of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship final in Abu Dhabi due to illness. Djokovic comfortably defeated Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-2 in Friday's semi-final but was overcome with a fever overnight. Murray later picked up the trophy on court before the third place playoff between Rafael Nadal and Wawrinka. "Unfortunately I am not to be able to play in the final in Abu Dhabi tonight. Djokovic is set to appear in the Qatar Open in Doha next week while Murray will travel to Australia to compete for Great Britain in the Hoffman Cup.
