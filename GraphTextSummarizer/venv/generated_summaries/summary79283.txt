With high-visibility jackets mandatory by law, the Muchene brothers are hoping to work with motorcycle manufacturers to infiltrate the marketplace with their product. Up to 13,000 people die in traffic accidents on Kenyan roads annually, according to a report from the World Health Organisation. "We are sourcing partnerships with motorcycle assembly plants in the country so once you buy the motorcycle you are given the jacket for free," says Muchene. "Once we see that there's a good number of guys having the jackets, and it's having the impact that we intended to have that is the reduction of motorcycle accidents due to poor visibility, we'll venture into other markets," he continues, revealing the startup's future plans to expand its operations beyond Kenya. Launched last April, the sibling startup aims to make motorcycle riders more visible.
