-- Massachusetts wildlife officials shot and killed an adolescent black bear that climbed a tree in a Boston suburb Sunday after attempts to tranquilize the animal failed, state officials said. As the bear population expands and moves eastward, more black bears will be seen in eastern Massachusetts," it said. State police briefly closed the nearby Massachusetts Turnpike while authorities tried to remove the bear, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Later, via Twitter, Newton police said the bear was killed after several unsuccessful attempts to tranquilize it. The state Environmental Police agency said it killed the 100-plus-pound animal "in the interest of public safety" and gave the remains to a local sports club "to salvage the meat for use by its members."
