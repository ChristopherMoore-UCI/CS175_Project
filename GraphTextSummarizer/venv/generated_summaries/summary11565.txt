The five Americans -- Ahmed Abdullah Minni, Umar Farooq, Aman Hassan Yemer, Waqar Hussain Khan and Ramy Zamzam -- used to worship together at a mosque in Alexandria, Virginia, until they went missing in November and turned up in Pakistan. -- Five Americans on trial in Pakistan on terrorism charges appeared at a brief hearing Saturday, but did not face the detailed questioning they had expected. The trial of the men opened on the last day of March, with the defense accusing Pakistani authorities of fabricating evidence that the Americans plotted attacks on Pakistan. They have been charged with several terrorism-related counts, including criminal conspiracy to commit terrorism and waging war against Pakistan and its allies, including the United States. The men's defense attorney, Hassan Dastagir Katchela, had told CNN he expected the five to be questioned in detail about the charges Saturday.
