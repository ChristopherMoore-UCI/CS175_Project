The man said he planned to "detonate the device on a tree stump in Jamaica, but later told us he was going to show friends how to build explosive devices like the kind he saw in Iraq," FBI agent Kelly Boaz said in a court affidavit. The first court appearance for the man, Kevin Brown, was postponed Wednesday to allow government officials time to look into whether he suffers from mental illness. He appeared in court Wednesday but government officials asked for the delay, saying there were indications Brown might have a history of mental illness. Airport spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell said Air Jamaica, Air Canada, West Jet and Frontier flights were among those delayed. " Initial record checks indicate Brown was in the United States legally, the FBI said.
