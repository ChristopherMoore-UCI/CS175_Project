Barcelona have already completed the big-money purchase of Spain World Cup hero David Villa from Valencia this summer and on Friday sealed the signing of Brazilian utility player Adriano from Sevilla. Adriano, who has been at Sevilla since 2004, will complete a medical at the Camp Nou on Saturday. The 25-year-old, who can play at full-back or as a wide midfielder, will cost an initial fee of â‚¬9.5 million ($12.29m) with an additional fee payable depending on appearances and performances. Fabregas had been expected to leave Arsenal during the close season transfer window, but the Premier League club have placed a big price tag on their star asset and are refusing to budge. Rosell told Catalan TV3 that Arsenal "don't want to listen to offers to sell and they are not putting the player on the market."
