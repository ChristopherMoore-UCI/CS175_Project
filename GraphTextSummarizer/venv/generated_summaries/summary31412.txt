The agency's Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous-Shoemaker (NEAR-Shoemaker), the first mission to orbit an asteroid, wasn't designed to land, but when the mission ended, NASA decided to give it a try. Many in the United States bemoaned the fact that it was a European agency, not an American one, that led the mission (although NASA was part of a consortium of partners for the mission). There are dozens of other exciting unmanned missions underway -- and several really cool ones that have wrapped up. That's what space lovers and other curious types got on Wednesday, when the European Space Agency's probe Philae touched down on Comet 67P. The probe continued to send back data for several days and made its last call back to Earth on Feb. 28, 2001.
