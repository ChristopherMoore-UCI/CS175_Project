Now, he observes, there are gay actors -- "How I Met My Mother's" Neil Patrick Harris may be the most notable -- playing straight roles, something that would have been almost unthinkable even a few years ago, since studios have often been nervous casting known gay performers in straight roles. "Heroes" star Kristen Bell, who is straight, told CNN that "[Aiken] shouldn't really have to acknowledge it." "What surprises and saddens me is that it still is big news," she said. Aiken and other gay celebrities have generally received support from their colleagues and the public. I think we are producing generations now of youth that do not judge people; they don't judge people on their race or their religion or their sexuality." April Woodard, a correspondent for "Inside Edition," told CNN Headline News' "Showbiz Tonight" that rejection may have been on Aiken's mind. Clay Aiken recently announced he was gay on the cover of People magazine.
