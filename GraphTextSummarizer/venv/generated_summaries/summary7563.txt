" Now, it's all too easy to vent your frustrations via Twitter, Facebook and various and sundry meme machines, cluttering the newsfeeds of friends and "Facebook friends" with your petty, petty gripes. If you must let off some steam, try firing up Enemy Graph, a Facebook app that allows you to declare friends or public figures "enemies." Because you never know who has access to your social accounts -- a lot of workplaces are even asking for Facebook logins nowadays (a practice that we wholly do not endorse). If you're that upset about your current work situation, by all means get smashed and complain about it with friends (after looking over your shoulder, of course). Naturally, you should probably confront your friend, but if you can't manage to summon up the balls to do so, might we suggest downloading Face-Invaders, an iPad game that allows you to blast your Facebook friends in effigy as if they were malignant aliens from outer space.
