Odin Lloyd, who a jury found was murdered by former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez, carved a reputation as a trophy-accumulating athlete with a mischievous streak, according to relatives. Lloyd, who was working for a landscaping firm, also played football for the Boston Bandits, the oldest semi-pro team in Boston and the winners of four championships in the New England Football League, the team's website says. Prosecutors told the jury that Hernandez orchestrated and covered up the killing of Lloyd, a former friend. Lloyd was dating the sister of Hernandez's fianc√©e, Thibou told CNN. Her brother and Hernandez went to a Boston nightclub together a few days before his death, she said.
