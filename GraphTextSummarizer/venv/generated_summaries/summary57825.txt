Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry will not renew his oath of office because his firing by former President Pervez Musharraf was deemed illegal. Both Zardari and his late wife, one-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, had been granted amnesty by Musharraf so they could return from exile in 2007 and participate in elections. Watch people cheer after Chaudhry is reinstated Â» Two unresolved matters will immediately test Chaudhry on his return to office: Some experts have surmised that one reason Zardari delayed acting on Chaudhry's return is because the Supreme Court wanted to look into the amnesty. Buckling under pressure, the government of current President Asif Ali Zardari agreed. A growing protest movement had demanded that Chaudhry and other judges that Musharraf fired be re-seated.
