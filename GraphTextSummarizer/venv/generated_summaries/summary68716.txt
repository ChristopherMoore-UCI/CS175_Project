South of Denver, the town of Castle Rock, Colorado, received about a foot of snow, said CNN iReporter Matthew Colver. Flights headed to and leaving Newark, New Jersey, one of several airports serving New York City, were at risk of delays because of high winds in the area, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. CNN meteorologist Reynolds Wolf said wind could also trigger delays in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, while snow could pose a problem in Minneapolis. High winds and snow prompted airport and highway delays in some metropolitan areas Friday, potentially snarling holiday travel plans on one of the nation's busiest travel days. By Friday afternoon, however, Newark was reporting the only weather-related delay on the FAA's web site.
