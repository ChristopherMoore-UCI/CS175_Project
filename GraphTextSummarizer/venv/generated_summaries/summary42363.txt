"This is a tragedy of the worst kind, because there was no indication in time to save people," he said. As Detective Martin Speechly, a New York police spokesman, put it: "1644 Park Avenue appears not to be there anymore. Seven blocks away, Eric Boise could feel his apartment shake and saw others "pouring out of the apartment buildings at 116th and Madison Avenue." After Wednesday morning's deadly building explosion in East Harlem, squads of firefighters dug through piles of shattered bricks and beams. Three blocks away, the blast knocked Klay Williams off his feet as he brushed his teeth before work.
