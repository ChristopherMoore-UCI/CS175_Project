-- Cristiano Ronaldo scored a superb hat-trick as Real Madrid thrashed Osasuna 7-1 to increase their lead at the top of the Spanish La Liga to three points following Barcelona's surprise 2-2 draw at Athletic Bilbao. But, in injury time, Messi took advantage of some hesitancy in the home defense to claim a vital equalizer. However, both clubs are still nine points behind runaway leaders Manchester City. Champions Barca remain unbeaten, but they have now drawn four of their 11 league matches and they had Argentine maestro Lionel Messi to thank for earning a late point in rain-sodden Bilbao. Osasuna came into the match at the Bernabeu in good spirits after ending Levante's unbeaten record last weekend, but they were always up against it after Ronaldo headed home Angel di Maria's 22nd-minute cross.
