Wayne County, North Carolina, which includes Goldsboro, had a population of about 84,000 in 1961. The Goldsboro incident The B-52 was flying over North Carolina on January 24, 1961, when it suffered a "failure of the right wing," the report said. Two months after the close call in Goldsboro, another B-52 was flying in the western United States when the cabin depressurized and the crew ejected, leaving the pilot to steer the bomber away from populated areas, according to a DOD document. It's also worth noting that North Carolina's 1961 total population was 47% of what it is today, so if you apply that percentage to the numbers, the death toll is 28,000 with 26,000 people injured -- a far cry from those killed by smaller bombs on the more densely populated cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan.
