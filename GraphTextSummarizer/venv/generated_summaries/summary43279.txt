Americans upside-down on their mortgages and unable to pay their home equity loans begin defaulting on other debt, like credit cards, car loans and student loans. That results in a "vicious circle" of additional write-downs, stock market losses, and bank collapses, which leads to even less credit being available. Roubini says that credit conditions are becoming worse everyday across a variety of markets and won't be getting better anytime soon. But with predictions of a recession now more common than Fed rate cuts -- and that's saying something -- maybe now it's time to look at a worst-case scenario. It would be, he told me, "like Northern Rock (the large bank in England that was recently taken over by the British government) times three."
