A domestic dispute set off the events, said Brian Wilson, chief of police in Federal Way, Washington. When officers arrived at the scene in the city just south of Seattle, they could still hear gunfire, said police spokeswoman Cathy Schrock. Five people died late Sunday in shootings at an apartment complex near Seattle, including the gunman who was shot by police, authorities said. Neighbors who had heard the gunfire came into the hallway, and the gunman shot and killed one of those neighbors through an apartment door, Wilson said. Police again ordered him to drop his weapon, he again refused, and police shot and killed him.
