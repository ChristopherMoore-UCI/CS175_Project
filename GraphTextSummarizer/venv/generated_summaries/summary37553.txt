And McCain, who is also a member of the Armed Services Committee, gave weight to attacks against Hagan for missing more than half of all the committee's public hearings in the last two years, as well as one classified briefing on ISIS and other national security threats with the Director of National Intelligence, which she missed for a fundraiser in New York. Tillis beat back those accusations on a call with reporters last week saying, "Quite honestly, if I had anything approaching the seriousness of the threat of ISIS, I would have canceled anything I was doing." McCain's presence next to Tillis, this time at an event with a veterans' group, also served to deflect criticism that the North Carolina Republican has offered few specifics for how he would confront the ISIS threat. Sen. John McCain joined state House Speaker Thom Tillis on the campaign trail Thursday in an effort to boost the Republican nominee's national security credo in a race where the fight against ISIS has become a top campaign issue. The Republican candidate for Senate in North Carolina brought in a foreign policy and national security heavyweight, a week after his opponent Sen. Kay Hagan's Armed Services Committee attendance record became a lightning rod in the contentious race. McCain has been one of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration's strategy for confronting ISIS, particularly the White House's public claim that the U.S. will not put American boots on the ground -- and that it can still defeat ISIS.
