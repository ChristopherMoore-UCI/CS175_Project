Other MTV awards this year included: best rock video to 30 Seconds To Mars; best art direction to Florence + the Machine; best cinematography to Jay-Z and Alicia Keyes; best special effects to Muse; and breakthrough video to The Black Keys. Eminem, who opened the show in a duet with Rihanna, won for best male video and best hip-hop video. She struggled to reach the stage for her second award -- for best pop video -- because of her second dress, which she explained was "too heavy to walk in." -- An unscripted, shocking moment during last year's MTV Video Music awards dominated Sunday night's show, with Kanye West and Taylor Swift putting their feelings to music. West also was the target of jokes from show host Chelsea Handler.
