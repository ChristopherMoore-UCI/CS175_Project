Figures for the full fiscal year to the end of March, also published on Thursday, showed that Japan's exports to China fell 9 per cent to Y11.3tn, while exports to the US rose 10 per cent to Y11.4tn. The US surrendered its position as Japan's top destination for exports early in 2009, following China's aggressive fiscal stimulus amid the global financial crisis. Provisional figures released on Thursday by Japan's finance ministry showed that overall exports rose 1.1 per cent in March from a year earlier to Y6.3tn ($64bn), while imports -- boosted by fuel to replace idled nuclear capacity -- were up 5.5 per cent to Y6.6tn. Tokyo (Financial Times) -- Japan has posted its narrowest trade deficit for nine months, helped by a big rise in the value of shipments to the US, which has toppled China as Japan's number one export destination. The data suggest Japan's revival under a new prime minister will rely more on the outlook in the US than in China, which helped Japan's export-dependent economy through the difficult post-Lehman period.
