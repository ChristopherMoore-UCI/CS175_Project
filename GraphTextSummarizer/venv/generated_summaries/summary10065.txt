The popular freshman opened fire in the crowded lunchroom last month at the school in Marysville, about 30 miles north of Seattle. A teen shot by his cousin during last month's rampage at a Washington state high school has died, bringing the total fatalities to five, including the gunman. The boys were close friends, nearly inseparable and lived close to one another, their grandfather, Don Hatch, said last month. In addition to  Fryberg,  Zoe Galasso died at the scene while Gia Soriano and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit died days later. The four victims died on different days.
