It is not clear why the younger Kim decided to invite Fujimoto back to North Korea, but it is clear that Fujimoto is unwilling to say anything negative about him or the country. Kenji Fujimoto was the personal sushi chef of Kim's father, the late Kim Jong Il, before fleeing to his native Japan in 2001, fearing his life was in danger. He said, 'OK, don't worry anymore.'" Fujimoto has written a number of books about the Kim family since he left North Korea. Fujimoto says Kim gave him a free pass to visit North Korea whenever he wanted, an invitation few have. More than a decade later, he returned to North Korea and described a warm reunion with the young Kim.
