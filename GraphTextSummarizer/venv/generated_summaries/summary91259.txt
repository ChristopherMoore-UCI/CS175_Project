"In my opinion it's worth it," says real estate agent Bahar Khalili. But remarkably, it's happening in Tehran because until the economy improves and housing prices start to stabilize, they believe, real estate is the safest place to invest. "Right now we have a lot of apartments that are not sold and sitting empty because of high prices," says Khalili. The sanctions were a huge blow to Iran's economy and when the value of Iranian currency took a nose dive and no one could figure out where the economy was going, many here poured their money into real estate. According to political analyst, Mohammad Ali Shabani, "real estate became the best way to protect your money."
