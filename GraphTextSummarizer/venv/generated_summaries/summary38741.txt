Zenani Mandela, 13, was buried in a private ceremony earlier in the day, Mandela's office said, after she was killed in a car crash June 11. -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela led mourning for his great-granddaughter at a chapel in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Thursday, his office announced. I should have let you wear all the make-up in the world," Zenani's mother Zoleka Mandela said in a message read by a family friend at the service, according to the Mandela Foundation. Mandela, who is 91, has limited his public appearances recently, although he did meet the South Africa soccer squad before the World Cup began. Her uncle, Prince Zinhle Dlamini, told mourners that she had met Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo on her birthday.
