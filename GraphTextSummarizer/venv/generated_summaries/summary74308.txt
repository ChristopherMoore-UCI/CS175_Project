-- Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords announced she will resign from Congress this week -- but not before finishing her "Congress On Your Corner" event that was interrupted by the shooting rampage that left six people dead and Giffords with a gunshot wound to her head. A flood of people posted comments on Giffords' Facebook page Sunday under her video -- praising the congresswoman for her courage, voicing their continued support and expressing hope that she'll one day return to public office. " "I know she's coming back; she wants to come back to public service," the Florida congresswoman said, adding that Giffords is stepping down thinking "it's better to focus on coming 100% back." Loughner, the man accused of targeting her last year outside a Tucson supermarket, potentially faces the death penalty if convicted on charges of murdering six people -- including the chief federal judge of Arizona, John Roll. I don't believe we've seen the last of Gabby Giffords." At the private gathering Monday, Giffords will meet with some of the people who were at the event last year, including some who aided injured people and some who subdued the gunman, according to a statement from her office.
