AEG drops Michael Jackson insurance claim "We cannot be forced into stopping this, which MJ will try to do because he is lazy and constantly changes his mind to fit his immediate wants," AEG Live executive Paul Gongaware wrote in an e-mail to Phillips. AEG Live was allowed to sell Jackson tour merchandise and share in the profits from the documentary "This Is It," which was produced from rehearsal video. The e-mails, published by the Los Angeles Times, indicated AEG executives had major doubts about Jackson's ability to perform. Internal AEG e-mails leaked to a reporter in September include one written by Randy Phillips -- the president of AEG Live -- in March 2009 saying Jackson was "locked in his room drunk and despondent" the day the pop star was to appear at the O2 Arena to publicly announce the shows. The company failed to look at "Conrad Murray's qualifications, experience, and medical specialty," but instead weighed the benefits Murray could bring, including "managing Michael Jackson so that he could meet all deadlines and timetables AEG set in place," it said.
