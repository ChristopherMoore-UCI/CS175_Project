The U.S. State Department Human Rights Report on China for 2010, published last week, says, "A negative trend in key areas of the country's human rights record continued, as the government took additional steps to rein in civil society, particularly organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public interest issues, and increased attempts to limit freedom of speech and to control the press, the Internet and Internet access. He added, "China also respects the universality of human rights, but at the same time we also believe we need to take into account the differences in culture when talking about human rights." We hope that the Western media will take an objective and fair attitude toward China's human rights situation, which has been constantly improving." Last week, China denied reports that a dissident artist was being held due to his calls for reform. Amnesty International said Ding Mao, Ran Yunfei and Chen Wei were formally arrested between March 25 and March 28 "and could face lengthy prison terms." "Since an anonymous online call on 17 February to stage a 'Jasmine Revolution' in China more than a hundred activists, many of them active on Twitter and blogs, have been detained, put under surveillance or illegal house arrest, or have simply gone missing," Amnesty said in a report this week. -- China has arrested a pro-democracy activist, the latest detention in the government's effort to prevent the Arab world's "Jasmine Revolution" from spreading into China, a human rights group said Wednesday.
