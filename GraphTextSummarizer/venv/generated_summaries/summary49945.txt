Stressful questioning by lawyers about "Partridge Family" profits apparently drove David Cassidy to drink, leading to his third drunken driving arrest in three years, his manager said Monday. "After attending his and his manager's depositions, it appears as if the pressure led to a brief relapse." Cassidy, 63, was on his way to the Los Angeles airportÂ  "to return to his home in Florida and to transitional rehabilitation" when he was stopped by a California Highway Patrol officer, she said. The former star of the TV series "The Partridge Family" was booked in a Los Angeles jail on a driving under the influence of alcohol charge early Saturday, the statement said. "He was in Los Angeles to attend depositions by Sony Pictures Television, respondents in a lawsuit filed by Cassidy in 2011 over what he claims are monies long due him from 'Partridge Family' merchandise, home video, etc.," she said. The singer-actor blew .19 -- twice the legal level -- on an alcohol test administered by the officer who stopped his rented Chevrolet Impala, according to a California Highway Patrol statement on Saturday.
