The state-funded California Medical Assistance Program, known as Medi-Cal, covers Ryan's home care. The cost can be staggering: Ryan's monthly care is about $40,000. "When it comes to neurology, there's so much unknown," said Dr. Ricardo Komotar, a brain surgeon and professor at Miami University who is not involved in Ryan's care. "Why can't he be like the way he was before?" The Buchanans have set up a website, the Ryan Buchanan Trust, where you can learn more about Ryan and how to help. Ryan's parents, Bret and Janine Buchanan, turned their own bedroom into a hospital ward for their eldest son.
