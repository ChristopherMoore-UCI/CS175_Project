Security officials are debriefing him to learn more about the identity and motive of his kidnappers, said Hashem Bashar, the head of the interim Supreme Security Committee Branch in the capital Tripoli. Al-Alam was kidnapped in central Tripoli on July 15, the Libyan Olympic Committee said at the time. Al-Alam is supposed to head the Libyan delegation in London for the Olympic games, which begin on Friday. It described al-Alam as a "man who greatly contributed to the" revolution that led to strongman Moammar Gadhafi's ouster last year. On Monday, the committee issued a statement saying the "Libyan sports family" condemns "this heinous crime."
