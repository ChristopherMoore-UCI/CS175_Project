"We first had to figure out that we needed a consular record of foreign birth or something like that," said Tampa police Officer Dan McDonald, who pitched in to help Helinski. With those papers squared away, he and Inman got Helinski a driver's license and a Social Security card. But getting him into the system was hard, because Helinski's ID and Social Security cards had been stolen. Charles Inman could not bear to see his 62-year-old ward land back on the street, he told CNN affiliate WFTS. Helinski hit it big thanks to the Social Security Administration, and a big-hearted cop and a case worker determined to untangle major bureaucracy.
