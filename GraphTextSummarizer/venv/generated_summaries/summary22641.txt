Car manufacturers from across the world, along with India's homegrown car companies, have descended on New Delhi for the 12th edition of the biannual Auto Expo show. Gupta says that, while "major car companies are bullish on India and think the economy could change post-general elections," he does not think that the Auto Expo itself will provide an upturn in market sentiment. "These cars have been engineered for global markets, through global teams across India, the UK and Korea to set new standards in their respective segments," Ranjt Yadav, president of passenger vehicles, Tata Motors, told reporters in Delhi. Hyundai, currently the country's second-largest car manufacturer, will cut export figures to focus more on the domestic market and maintain market share. With these new models, Tata, the Mumbai-based manufacturer, has undergone some radical overhauls of its design and technology processes -- including the inclusion of the company's Revotron engine -- in a bid to recapture lost market share.
