Adding more cargo ships and oil tankers to the mix, says captain Lembrik, is a big concern. It's also nuclear powered which means low carbon emissions, but, of course, it's a risky polluter if anything goes wrong -- just one of the many paradoxes of Arctic ecology. Escorted by icebreakers, cargo ships and oil tankers crossing the Arctic can shave thousands of miles off a journey between Asia and Europe, saving fuel, and vastly reduce their carbon emissions. And not just for clearing routes -- navigating Arctic waters can be treacherous. Captain of the Yamal, Alexander Lembrik says the Arctic's untapped potential is the reason behind the dramatic increase in maritime traffic.
