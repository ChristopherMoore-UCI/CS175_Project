Unless it manages to successfully appeal the FIFA ban, Barca will be prevented from signing players -- both youth and senior players -- in the next two transfer windows. "FCB will also demand the relevant interim measures needed to preserve the Club's rights, amongst which are those allowing it to sign players in transfer windows," it said in a statement. Under FIFA laws, clubs are not allowed to sign international players under the age of 18 unless the player is moving within the European Union, is aged between 16 and 18 and moving with their parents or the club and the player both live within 50 kilometers of a shared national border. It is unclear whether the ban will affect transfers Barca have in the pipeline. Last summer, for example, Barca invested nearly $120 million on just one player -- Brazilian international Neymar.
