-- A man arrested in police probes following the apparent drug overdose death of actor Philip Seymour Hoffman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to drug charges, and two co-defendants in the case had not-guilty pleas entered for them at their arraignment. The judge entered a not-guilty plea for Juliana Luchkiw and Max Rosenblum, both 22, who appeared in court Monday charged with one count of criminal possession of cocaine, according to Rosenblum's attorney, Daniel Hochheiser. Robert Vineberg, 57, who remains in jail after his bail was set Friday at nearly a quarter of a million dollars total, was arraigned on three counts of criminal possession of heroin. Police immediately set out to track down Hoffman's source for heroin. Vineberg, Luchkiw, and Rosenblum were arrested on February 4 after police raided a Manhattan apartment, recovering 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin with labels that match those found at Hoffman's residence, according to officials.
