" The federal complaint against Romero said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by Klinko. " Romero said the relationship initially was "professional and creative," but she eventually engaged in a "short affair" with Klinko as he helped with her modeling career. When Klinko testified for the prosecution last week he said it was "completely incorrect" that his motivation was to get Romero deported. " The villain in Romero's script would be Markus Klinko, a celebrity photographer she met at a Hollywood casting call about the same time her marriage was "on the rocks," she said. Instead, the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against Michael Ball, the founder and owner of the Rock & Republic fashion company, Klinko said.
