The deputy chief medical examiner with Pima County, Dr. Eric Peters, said the cause of death was suicide by hanging. In 2009, Green was found guilty in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of raping a 14-year-old Iraqi girl and murdering her, her parents and her 6-year-old sister in the town of Yusufiya, about 20 miles south of Baghdad. A former U.S. soldier convicted five years ago of murdering an Iraqi family died Saturday, two days after an apparent suicide attempt in his Arizona prison cell, authorities said. Green, who was sentenced to multiple life sentences without possibility of parole, told the family he was "truly sorry for what I did in Iraq. He was the last of five soldiers who served in the 101st Airborne Division, based at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to be convicted for the crimes and their subsequent cover-up.
