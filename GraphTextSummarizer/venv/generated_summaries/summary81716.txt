"In the United States, we don't have vehicle checkpoints and we don't have people watching who comes into the terminals and the presence of armed personnel is very, very thin," said Ron, a former head of security of Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel. If security officials choose to focus on terrorism in a post-9/11 world, "other threats to security may not be attended to as much as they should be," he said. Vehicles driving into Ben-Gurion Airport must clear a vehicle checkpoint, and there are security personnel at all terminal entrances, he said. If he started shooting, he would probably be dead in a matter of seconds because of the heavy presence of security personnel." A deadly shooting at a checkpoint at Los Angeles International Airport emphasizes airport security vulnerabilities, according to analysts and a union chief.
