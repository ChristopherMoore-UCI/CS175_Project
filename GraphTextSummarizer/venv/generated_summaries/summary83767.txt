In "Hit & Run," which he wrote and codirected (with David Palmer), he plays a retired crook named Charlie Bronson (a fake name chosen when the character ditched L.A. to enter Witness Protection). "Hit & Run" is filled with pop-up-book hooligans who can't stop talking: Bradley Cooper (underacting nicely) as a dreadlocked sociopath, Tom Arnold (overacting loudly) as a gay U.S. marshal so closeted he's about to explode. When Annie lands a job interview, Charlie agrees to drive her to L.A. in his souped-up, death-black 1967 Lincoln Continental, a road odyssey that lures out all the colorful underworld vermin who've been waiting for him to emerge from the woodwork.
