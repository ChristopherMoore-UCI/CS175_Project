President Barack Obama's campaign successfully seized on the former Massachusetts governor's time at private equity firm Bain Capital to paint a picture of an industry that destroys middle-class jobs while wealthy executives reap generous profits -- often taxed at lower rates. Financial executives remember the attacks in 2012 all too well and, faced with the possibility of another Romney campaign, are wary of another round of negative attention. "It really felt like it was not in the interest by the press to get out -- to really explain what the idiosyncrasies are and benefits are to private equity," Meadow said, adding that there's a prevailing sense among PE executives that it's "a waste to go forward trying to defend the industry." In several key statewide races across the country, politicians with PE backgrounds, including gubernatorial candidates Bruce Rauner in Illinois and Tom Foley in Connecticut, were targeted by their opponents for their work in private equity as well as their massive wealth. PEGCC is "prepared to engage and counter any mischaracterizations and attacks from the right or the left that could undermine the reputation of the private equity industry," Ken Spain, the group's vice president of public affairs, said in an email before Romney's Friday announcement.
