The hostages were seized from the Kummabza village in northern Borno state on June 18 after a four-day invasion of the village by Boko Haram insurgents. "But we still have five women, including a nursing mother, missing." News of the escape was slow to emerge due to trouble with telecommunication towers in the area damaged by previous Boko Haram attacks. Sixty-three women and girls kidnapped by Boko Haram last month in Nigeria escaped from their captors and have returned to their burnt village, a security source and a local vigilante fighting the militant group said. When a group of women and girls abducted in November was later rescued from Boko Haram, some were pregnant. Mohammed Yusuf, a charismatic young cleric, founded Boko Haram 12 years ago as part of his push for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria.
