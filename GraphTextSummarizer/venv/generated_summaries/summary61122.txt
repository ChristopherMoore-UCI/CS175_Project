"God helped us," mother Alondra Gervacio told CNN on Wednesday as she held her daughter. The stopped vehicle that the Town Car first struck had two passengers inside, but neither requested medical attention, according to police. The Lincoln Town Car struck one vehicle stopped at a red light and another vacant parked car, and then sped down the sidewalk directly at Gervacio and her infant. Police said he had suffered a heart attack, CNN affiliate WABC reported. Both the mother and child were taken to Lincoln Medical Center, according to the police report.
