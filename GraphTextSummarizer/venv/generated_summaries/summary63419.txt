-- Former England defender Sol Campbell has told CNN World Sport he is baffled by England coach Roy Hodgson's decision to omit Rio Ferdinand from the forthcoming Euro 2012 tournament. Former England captain John Terry has been included in the squad, despite awaiting trial on charges he racially abused Rio's brother Anton during an English Premier League match in October. "I don't know the conversation Roy Hodgson has had with John Terry or Rio Ferdinand. " Hodgson said his conversations with both players would remain private though he did reveal Ferdinand was gracious and wished England well for the competition. But Campbell, who won 73 caps and played in three World Cup campaigns for his England, thinks Hodgson's call has more to do with off-field concerns.
