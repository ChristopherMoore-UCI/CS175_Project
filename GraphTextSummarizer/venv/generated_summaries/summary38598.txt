-- A wanted Florida man shot and killed two St. Petersburg police officers Monday morning, and later the apparent assailant was found dead after police used a backhoe to tear through his house, authorities said. St. Petersburg Police Chief Chuck Harmon said the two slain members of his department were "ambushed" by the shooter, who they believe was a man wanted on an outstanding warrant for aggravated battery. He was later positively identified, using fingerprints, as the 39-year-old Lacy, according to a statement from St. Petersburg police. " The incident began around 7 a.m. Monday, when law enforcement from the city's Police Department, U.S. Marshals Service and Pinellas County Sheriff's Office went to a home in the west Florida city to ask a relative of Hydra Lacy Jr., who was wanted by police, about him. K-9 Officer Jeffrey Yaslowitz and a deputy U.S. marshal were shot at as they got near the attic -- where they intended to try to coax Lacy to surrender -- according to police.
