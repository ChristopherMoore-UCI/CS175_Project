So said Oregon State Senior Trooper David Petersen after he was able to catch up with six exotic sports cars on a stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde on Thursday, according to a news release. After receiving reports Thursday morning that several sports cars were speeding and passing in no-pass zones west of Grand Ronde, Petersen set up east of the casino town, near McMinnville, and waited. Police say the cars were pulled over on a dangerous stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde, Oregon. The stretch where the cars were cited is considered particularly dangerous and the Oregon Department of Transportation provides additional funding to enforce traffic laws there, Hastings said. Highway 18 runs from Dayton, Oregon, in the Willamette Valley to the Pacific coast.
