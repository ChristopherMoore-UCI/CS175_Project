"One armed Bedouin was killed by the Israelis close to Karam Abu Salem crossing ... in North Sinai after Israeli soldiers fired at the men," according to Gen. Saleh Al Masry, head of North Sinai Security, who also said two others escaped. Border incursions are not unusual along Israel's border with Egypt. In August, militants crossed into Israel from Egyptian territory to attack civilian targets. Egyptian security said the shootout involved three Bedouins smuggling tobacco into Israel. Following the revolution in Egypt and the subsequent increase of instability in the nation's Sinai peninsula, the Israeli government has accelerated the pace of construction of a steel border fence that will run the 260 kilometers (162 miles) of shared border.
