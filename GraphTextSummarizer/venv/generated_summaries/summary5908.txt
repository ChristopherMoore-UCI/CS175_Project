A Long Island couple found a 3-foot python underneath a couch cushion Monday, according to the Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The apartment, located in Holbrook, had recently been vacated and the couple was moving in, SPCA spokesman Roy Gross said. A ball python is a nonvenomous python species found in Africa that can grow up to 3-5 feet long. " SPCA officials took the snake, which they determined to be a ball python. "You can imagine how shocking it was," he said of the unexpected housewarming gift.
