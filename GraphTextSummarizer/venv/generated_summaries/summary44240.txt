Celtic had been pipped for the Scottish title by arch-rivals Rangers but were too good for Motherwell at Hampden to give manager Neil Lennon his first piece of silverware since taking over. Schalke's league form was poor as fellow Ruhr Valley side Borussia Dortmund took the title, but the Royal Blues have made partial amends in cup competitions. There had been doubts about his future at Celtic, but he told Sky Sports he would be discussing his future with their board next week. Dutch international striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored either side of halftime after midfielder Julian Draxler put Schalke in front with a spectacular volley after being set up by Peru star Jefferson Farfan. In France, Lille also got their hands on silverware as a 2-2 draw with Paris Saint Germain on Saturday night saw them clinch their first league championship title since 1954.
