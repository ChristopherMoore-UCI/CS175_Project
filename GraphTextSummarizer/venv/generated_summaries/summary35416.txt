Engadin Golf Club in St. Moritz, Switzerland will welcome entrants to the 35th Snow Golf Cup later this month, and in March patrons of the annual Boerl and Kroff Snow Golf tournament will reconvene on Wispile mountain in Gstaad. The Aurora Borealis can be seen frequently in Swedish Lapland during the winter, but sadly the opportunities to get stuck into snow golf are more limited -- the course is only open for three weeks in March. Happily for Bj√∂rkliden, there have been no such issues with the weather so far and plans are in place for a weekend of competitions in late March, with the Scandinavian Snow Golf Masters forming the centerpiece. Tee times after dark are also available thanks to glowing golf balls -- and night golf also lets players witness one of nature's most magnificent spectacles up close. But for most the experience is a happy one, Bergwall says, with players enjoying clean, crisp air under frequently blue skies while mastering the art of driving, chipping and putting on snow and ice.
