Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, has said they built the bombs there, U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation said. Tsarnaev died April 19 after he and his brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, shot a university police officer to death, carjacked an SUV and hurled bombs at officers pursuing them, according to authorities. Authorities have said they believe the Tsarnaev brothers acted alone but are investigating whether they could have learned from or been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. 'Everyone deserves to be buried' Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body remained unclaimed until Thursday, when Tsarni, who had previously publicly condemned his alleged attacks, had a funeral parlor pick up the body. -- Federal authorities were at the apartment of deceased bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev on Sunday, executing a search warrant, an FBI spokeswoman said.
