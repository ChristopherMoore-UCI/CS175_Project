Gardner's friend Christina Jones told HLN's Nancy Grace that the woman had known Giordano for more than a year and flew to Aruba with him. Investigators also examined Giordano's rental car but were unable to find any clues to Gardner's disappearance, Stein said. Although officials have stopped actively searching for Gardner, they are continuing to seek evidence in the case, Stein said. Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. The Aruban prosecutors office has declined to say what evidence led authorities to suspect Giordano's involvement in Gardner's disappearance.
