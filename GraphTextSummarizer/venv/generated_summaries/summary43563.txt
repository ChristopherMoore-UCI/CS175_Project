When the Supreme Court of Arkansas was considering television coverage, one of its justices, Robert L. Brown, undertook his own survey and found that "state supreme courts have blazed a significant technological trail." C-SPAN has asked the justices for permission to televise the extraordinary five-and-a-half hours of oral argument (most cases get just one hour) scheduled for March 26 through 28. The Supreme Court will soon hear oral argument -- the fascinating, highly informative back-and-forth between the justices and the lawyers before them -- in a monumental case that will determine the constitutionality of the government's new health care plan. It now provides its own videos of oral arguments and posts them daily. In Canada the proceedings of the nation's Supreme Court have been televised since the mid-1990s.
