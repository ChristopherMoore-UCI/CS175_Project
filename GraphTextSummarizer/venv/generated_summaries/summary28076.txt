In addition to becoming a topic of conversation on talk shows in Japan, the photo of Deschanel and her randoseru made the rounds on the internet. The randoseru is a mandatory item for first-year elementary school kids in Japan. Randoseru, Japan's traditional schoolchild's backpack, has become the latest must-buy souvenir in Japan. But if you've got a friend traveling to Japan, you might soon find yourself slinging an old-timey book bag over your shoulders. In April, Yorozu and Nagomi souvenir shops at Kansai International Airport in Osaka began stocking the bags in response to a sudden and unexpected demand from tourists.
