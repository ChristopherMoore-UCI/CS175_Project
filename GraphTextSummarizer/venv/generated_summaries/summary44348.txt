The GAO, meanwhile, said that "without more public disclosure of governance arrangements, such as board of director bylaws and director eligibility and ethics policies, there may be continued concerns about Reserve Bank governance and the integrity of the Federal Reserve System." The report focuses on scenarios in which executives pose apparent conflicts of interest by serving on boards that regulate financial houses where they also have business relationships. Despite government regulatory efforts, Wednesday's audit says directors with affiliations and business relationships with banks "continue to pose reputational risks to the Federal Reserve System." An example, it notes, occurred when then-chairman of the New York Fed's board of directors Stephen Friedman owned shares in the investment firm Goldman Sachs, but in September 2008 provided it and other banks billions of dollars in federal funding in response to the unfolding financial crisis. -- The Federal Reserve banks need to better prevent conflicts of interest, according to a new government report that highlights transparency issues with financial executives serving on the banks' boards.
