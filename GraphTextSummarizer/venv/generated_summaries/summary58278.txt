The administration compares the long-reaching impact of free community college with that of the compulsory laws, which made school attendance mandatory, and the progressive era, which made high school more accessible. Had the rise in college costs stayed in line with the inflation, the $10,000 to send your kid to school in 1985 would have been $21,947.12 today. For example, his administration doubled the money for Pell Grants, capped new loan payments at 10% of income and expanded education tax credits, providing up to $10,000 for four years of college tuition. Before you dismiss President Obama's proposal of two years of free community college as frivolous government spending, let me toss a number out at you: 500%. If you still think a proposal to make community college free is just a liberal handout, then you're living in the past.
