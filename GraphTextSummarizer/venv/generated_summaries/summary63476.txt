Josh Hakken is insane and will likely be sent to a hospital for treatment before he can stand trial for the alleged kidnapping, Hillsborough Circuit Judge Chet Tharpe said Wednesday, CNN affiliate Bay News 9 reported. Last April, Florida authorities said Josh and Sharyn Hakken kidnapped their two boys, ages 2 and 4, after losing custody of them. Josh Hakken glared through his sunglasses at the CNN reporter who found him and said nothing beyond confirming his identity. Later that month, CNN found the family of four on a small sailboat in Havana. Cuban authorities then detained Josh and Sharyn Hakken.
