Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina narrowly escaped the attacks, but Ivy Rahman, the wife of Bangladesh President Zillur Rahman was among 24 killed. Zia's eldest son, Tarique Rahman, 47, now resides in England and will be tried in absentia, said Syed Rezaur Rahman, the state prosecutor. Since the end of Zia's tenure in 2006, Tarique Rahman is facing 14 cases on charges of corruption and extortion. The accused include at least two ministers in the cabinet of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, former chiefs of two state intelligence services and three former inspectors general of police. Police investigators say Tarique Rahman aided and abetted the Zia administration in planning the attacks and helping the assailants flee the scene.
