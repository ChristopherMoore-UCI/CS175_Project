" Violence has raged since Thursday, when Georgia launched a crackdown on separatist fighters in autonomous South Ossetia, where most people have long supported independence. Thousands cheered as the presidents of Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia stood with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili at a rally in Tbilisi, Georgia, late Tuesday. Asked on CNN's "Situation Room" whether Moscow wants Saakashvili removed from Georgia, Churkin replied, "It is our recommendation." "He has performed some horrific acts toward the people of South Ossetia, some major crimes against humanity have been committed which have been qualified as genocide and ethnic cleansing. Later, French President Nikolas Sarkozy said Saakashvili had agreed to the plan, in which Russia would agree to conclude military operations, return its armed forces to the line preceding last week's start of the conflict and not use force again in Georgia. The leaders of a former Eastern Bloc nation and four former Soviet republics showed support for Georgia in its conflict with Russia at a massive rally in Georgia's capital Tuesday night.
