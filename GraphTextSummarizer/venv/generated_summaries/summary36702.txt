Why the fuss, when private sector trade unions enroll but one out of every 14 workers and public sector unions have hardly grown in more than 30 years? The Republicans denounce the pensions long ago negotiated by public sector unions as too expensive and they keep up attacks on the contributions of "Washington union bosses" to the Democrats. Walker blundered last year by pushing through the state legislature a hugely unpopular law that cripples public-sector collective bargaining and thereby suffocates most government unions. And in the nation's capital, Republican legislators are on the warpath against the very existence of the National Labor Relations Board, the 75-year-old agency whose Depression-era mandate fosters the capacity of workers to form "unions of their own choosing." When they are strong, unions can limit the prerogatives of individual businessmen, government officials and the untamed workings of the labor market.
