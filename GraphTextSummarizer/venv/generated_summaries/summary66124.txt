Yet as national governments yield power to international bureaucracies -- as even the work of domestic government becomes more complex and opaque -- practical democracy seems on the retreat. In the end, the choice of World Bank president comes down to an electorate of one, the president of the United States. Sachs' quixotic campaign for World Bank president won't change that reality, even in the unlikely event that he should somehow win. The president of the European Commission exercises more power than most of Europe's 27 elected heads of government. Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, has nominated himself to be president of the World Bank.
