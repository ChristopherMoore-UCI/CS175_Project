this is not a major issue in immunization against measles, because people have seen devastation from the outbreaks. Measles has been reported in a university in Shanxi province and a downtown Beijing office, resulting in quarantines and vaccinations for thousands of people, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency. But the WHO warned that progress was fragile, because outbreaks still occur and measles remains one of the leading killers of children in the world. "Measles outbreak occurs every four to five years, and now it's on an uprising stage based on its pattern," said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the local Beijing disease control agency. Vaccine campaigns were not strong in the 1970s and 1980s, so some missed their shots.
