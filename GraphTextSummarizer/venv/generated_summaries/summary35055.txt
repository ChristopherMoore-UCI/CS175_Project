In direct and emotional terms, President Barack Obama informed the nation and the world Sunday night that a U.S. operation in Pakistan earlier in the day killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden almost 10 years after terrorist attacks that killed thousands. "For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies," Obama said. "I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women and children," the president said, looking directly into the television camera in the East Room of the White House for the statement broadcast nationwide on short notice. Last week, Obama said, "I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice." "Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan," the president continued. "Last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden," Obama said.
