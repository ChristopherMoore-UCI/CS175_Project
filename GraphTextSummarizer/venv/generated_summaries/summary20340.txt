We found cases all over the country of underage girls being sold for sex on Backpage: Selena in Vegas, a 12-year-old in suburban Maryland, and a 14-year-old in St. Louis. Selena is a 13-year-old who was sold for sex. The pimps ply their trade on the web, the new marketplace for underage sex trafficking. Most are runaways, suffering from psychological problems or drug dependence, picked up and sold by pimps for staggering profits. But although she exchanged sex for money, in the eyes of the law, she's a victim, by virtue of her age and the circumstances under which she was sold: by a pimp on the website backpage.com, a pimp who used drugs to entice her, and took everything she earned.
