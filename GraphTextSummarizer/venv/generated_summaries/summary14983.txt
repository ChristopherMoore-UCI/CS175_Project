"I didn't feel fully comfortable in the race today, but I'm happy because I was able to gain a large number of points," said Pedrosa, who had won the two previous races in his native Spain and France, and was second at Mugello last year. Pedrosa claimed second place ahead of Britain's Cal Crutchlow, with German rider Stefan Bradl fourth to match his best career result. Rossi's previous team Ducati gave the home fans something to cheer as Andrea Dovizioso, Nicky Hayden and Michele Pirro were fifth, sixth and seventh respectively. The Spanish motorcyclist overtook pole sitter Dani Pedrosa at the first corner at Mugello and never surrendered the lead as he trimmed his rival's championship advantage to 12 points after five races. In spite of everything we were still fighting for second place, which is a reason to be happy." Lorenzo's Yamaha teammate Valentino Rossi was another casualty, with Italy's seven-time world champion retiring only three corners into the race after being hit by Alvaro Bautista.
