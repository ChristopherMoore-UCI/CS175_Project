"Nobody seems to know why he acted the way he acted," Hialeah Police Department Spokesman Carl Zogby told reporters about Pedro Vargas. "Vargas then ran out of the apartment, ran throughout the building firing shots at random in a very irrational fashion," Zogby said. Vargas then ran down to the third floor, kicked the door open of an apartment and fatally shot Patricio Simono, 69, and Merly S. Niebles, 51, and their 17-year-old daughter, whose name was being withheld, Zogby said. Police were looking into the possibility that Vargas -- described by some as a "quiet" man -- may have had a dispute with the building managers, who were among his victims, Zogby said. The incident began around 6:30 p.m. Friday, when callers to 911 reported that smoke was emanating from Apartment 408, which Vargas had recently rented and where he was living with his mother, Zogby said.
