The Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast and have been under British rule since 1833. -- A British oil rig has started drilling off the Falkland Islands in a move likely to stoke further tensions between Argentina and the UK over the disputed South Atlantic territory. The island's government, representing a population of around 2,500, remains committed to British sovereignty and the UK maintains a military presence on the islands. Argentina has always claimed sovereignty over the islands and invaded them in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinean and 255 British military personnel died. Last Tuesday Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner signed a decree requiring all ships navigating from Argentina to the islands to carry a government permit.
