We know that brain changes of Alzheimer's begin years before symptoms surface. Drugs that demonstrate a biological effect will be followed for a longer period in a subsequent study to determine their ability to postpone or delay symptoms of Alzheimer's. Both focus on families with younger-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, a very rare version where symptoms begin before age 65 -- but the results will also inform research questions for the more common later-onset Alzheimer's disease. Standing beside all those living with Alzheimer's are more than 15 million family members and friends who provide them with care and everyday support. Alzheimer's is a progressive, degenerative and fatal brain disease that not only affects the person with the disease, but the entire family.
