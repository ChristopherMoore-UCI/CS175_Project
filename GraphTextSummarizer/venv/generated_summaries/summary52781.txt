-- Two New Jersey state troopers who led an unauthorized high-speed escort of a caravan of sports cars last year agreed Monday to resign, according to the New Jersey attorney general's office. Both men have ended their law enforcement careers, and one will have a felony record for the rest of his life," said New Jersey Attorney General Jeffrey S. Chiesa. Under a plea agreement, the state will recommend that Nassry, a 26-year veteran of the New Jersey State Police, be sentenced to a term of probation, forfeit his job with the state police and be permanently barred from any law enforcement position or public employment in New Jersey. Nassry will be sentenced April 29 according to the New Jersey attorney general's office. The agreement means he did not plead guilty to the charge, but he has forfeited his job with the state police and will be permanently barred from any law enforcement position in New Jersey, said the attorney general's office.
