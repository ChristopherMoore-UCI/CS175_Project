EW: Casting Net: Jim Carrey turns to crime in comedy 'Loomis Fargo' New Line Cinema produced the 1994 original and also made a 2003 prequel called "Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd" without Carrey, Daniels, or the Farrelly brothers. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are expected to return as short-on-smarts pair Lloyd and Harry. The movie depicted Lloyd and Harry's high school years in the 1980s. The in-development follow-up to the hit 1994 comedy was in the works at New Line Cinema, but New Line's parent company, Warner Bros., has dropped the project, EW confirmed Tuesday. The Farrelly Brothers finishing script for 'Dumb and Dumber To' â€” and that isn't a typo Bobby and Peter Farrelly â€” the writer-director brothers who created the original â€” are now searching for a new financier and distributor for "Dumb and Dumber To" (yes, that's the title).
