I'm all about discounts and Twitter parties and Beano and maybe even a touch of mascara when I'm feeling pretty, but I'm not exactly sure this is qualifies as a "club." Clubs have to have standards, and I simply can't appreciate any exclusive organization that doesn't charge excessive dues and/or base one's membership on blatant superficiality. CVS really managed to get people talking about and participating in their virtual Twitter party, which is pretty amazing. Naturally, of course, I was present, showing up casually late because it's what awesome people do at epic parties. Woooooo." Personally speaking, the most appealing aspect of a digital Twitter party is that I only have 140 characters to completely embarrass myself.
