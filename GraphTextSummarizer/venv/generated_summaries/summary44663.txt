Ladsous spokesman Dwyer called the firing on peacekeepers' vehicles "deliberate and direct," and said U.N. officials were evaluating whether the 300 unarmed peacekeepers in Syria are safe enough to continue their activities. The report on children and armed conflict details accounts of juveniles allegedly abused by pro-government forces and came as a top U.N. official said the conflict in Syria has spiraled into a civil war. "Whether we call it all-out civil war ,whether we call it partial civil war, civil war in some places, the point is that it's hugely escalated, that it's across nearly all parts of the country and that the civilians, ordinary Syrian people, are the ones that are suffering," Dwyer said. "Yes, I think we can say that," U.N. peacekeeping chief Herve Ladsous said when asked if Syria is in a civil war. A report from the state-run news agency SANA cited an "official source" at the Syrian Foreign Ministry saying "that the U.S. administration is continuing its blatant interference in the internal affairs of Syria, its open support for terrorists, covering up terrorists' crimes, distorting facts about Syria at the U.N., and extorting countries and the international community to beleaguer Syria."
