In early 1968, it became apparent that American soldiers in South Vietnam were fighting a stubborn communist enemy without the support they expected from South Vietnamese citizens. There has, however, never been a time when American soldiers acted with such obvious and offensive disrespect for Afghan citizens. Afghan intransigence furthers the frustration and resentment among American soldiers, fueling violent behavior directed at innocent civilians. For all the talk of "supporting the troops," the Afghanistan war receives little serious attention in American public debate. Frustrated and desperate, particularly after the Tet Offensive in January 1968, American soldiers took the war to the population with devastating consequences.
