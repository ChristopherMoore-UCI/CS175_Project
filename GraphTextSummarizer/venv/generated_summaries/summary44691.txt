Alongside a supporting cast with WASPy nicknames like Dicky, Bitsy and Peaches, Katey navigates her way through Manhattan jazz clubs and Long Island cocktail parties and into the upper echelons of New York society. One interesting aspect of New York in particular is that it is a leading capital for advertising, art, broadcasting, fashion, finance, food, journalism, music, publishing, theater, etc. Do you think your story could have taken place in today's New York? I think the book's themes of self-invention, aspiration, love and loss are as pertinent in today's New York as they were a century ago. Towles: I understand why the book's subject matter has prompted these comparisons, but I really didn't think too much about the great authors of the New York scene while I was writing the book.
