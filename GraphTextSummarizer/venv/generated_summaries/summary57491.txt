Industrialists had been begging the central bank to cut rates over the last two years, as they blamed the RBI's aggressive monetary tightening policy for stalling investment and damaging overall growth. -- India's central bank cut key lending rates for the first time in three years on Tuesday in an aggressive effort to stimulate growth and boost investment at a time when the gloss is rapidly coming off Asia's third largest economy. "The rate cut shows that the attention has now shifted towards stimulating growth, there is no doubt about that," said A Prasanna, an economist at ICICI securities. The Reserve Bank of India cut the repo rate -- the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks -- by 50 basis points to 8 per cent. However, he cautioned that a 50 basis point rate cut would not be enough to put the Indian economy back on strong growth track.
