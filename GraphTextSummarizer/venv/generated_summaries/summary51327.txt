The eruption of Mount Tavurvur on the island of New Britain began early Friday, said Craig Earl-Spurr, a meteorologist at the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center in Australia. In 1994, Tavurvur erupted at the same time as nearby Mount Vulcan, destroying Rabaul. A volcano erupted in Papua New Guinea on Friday, spurting ash tens of thousands of feet into the sky. The volcano spewed a thick tower of ash that reached as high as 60,000 feet above sea level. Dramatic photos posted on social media showed Tavurvur belching fire and ash from across a bay.
