That prompted Lawhorn to raise his voice for the first time, according to Stacy. "I thought he was calling for his parents to come pick him up," homeowner Glen Stacy told CNN. A motive, if there is one, is unknown at this point, as the boys were not acquainted, according to Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker. Charles Boekeloo, Lawhorn's court-appointed attorney, said he met his client for the first time at his arraignment Tuesday but had no further comment. Stacy said that when the first officers arrived on the scene, they ran toward the playground, which was in the opposite direction.
