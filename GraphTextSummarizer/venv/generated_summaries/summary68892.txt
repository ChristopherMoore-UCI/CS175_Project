Vouchers allow parents who can't afford private school to remove their children from public schools in order to get a better education. Roland S. Martin says it's hypocritical to oppose school vouchers while sending your children to private school. "I don't think vouchers are going to solve all the ills of public education, but parents who are zoned to schools that are failing kids should have options to do better by their kids," she told The New York Times. Yet looking at the sorry state public schools are in now, maybe seeing kids leave in droves via vouchers will force school administrators and teachers to stop thinking they have all the answers and allow for innovation and full accountability, from the classroom to the boardroom. Democrats say they believe in school choice, but they don't fully accept the gamut of choices.
