Sami Hayek, 40, suffered several broken ribs and a cut to his head, while the 20-year-old driver of a pickup that collided with Hayek's sports car was left with a broken foot, a Los Angeles police statement said Monday. Hayek was being treated Monday in a Los Angeles hospital. Hayek, who is a furniture designer based in Los Angeles, was driving east on Sunset Boulevard in the Bel Air community of Los Angeles when he lost control and crossed into the westbound lanes, police said. The coroner had not released the man's name Monday because his family had not been notified. A 43-year-old man from Mexico who was riding in the passenger seat of Hayek's 2006 Ford GT "sustained major blunt-force trauma to his body" and was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, the police report said.
