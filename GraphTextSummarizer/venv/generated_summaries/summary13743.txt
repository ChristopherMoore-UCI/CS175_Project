"Being able to make that kind of a sensitive measurement over a very large number of stars was extremely challenging," Kepler project manager James Fanson said. This is a crowning achievement for NASA and a monumental step in our search for other worlds around other stars." Watch a NASA scientist explain where life could exist Â» Quest for a 'pale blue dot' Once Kepler spots a planet, scientists will be able to calculate its size, mass, orbital period, distance from star and surface temperature, Boss said. He said scientists should know by 2013 -- the end of Kepler's mission -- whether life in the universe could be widespread. The Kepler telescope, however, is seeking something much more familiar: Earth-like planets with rocky surfaces, orbiting in their stars' habitable, or "Goldilocks," zones -- not too hot or too cold, but just right for liquid water to exist.
