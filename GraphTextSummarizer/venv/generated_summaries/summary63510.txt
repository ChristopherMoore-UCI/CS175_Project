U.S. officials have long said there have been no confirmed sightings of bin Laden or Zawahiri for several years. Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the exact locations for bin Laden and Zawahiri are unknown, other than that they are "somewhere in the tribal areas of Pakistan near the Afghanistan border." The official said the general region where bin Laden is likely to have moved around in recent years ranges from the mountainous Chitral area in the far northwest near the Chinese border, to the Kurram Valley, which adjoins Afghanistan's Tora Bora, one of the Taliban strongholds during the U.S. invasion in 2001. -- Osama bin Laden and his deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri are believed to be hiding close to each other in houses in northwest Pakistan, but are not together, a senior NATO official said. " Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Monday that similar reports of bin Laden and Mullah Omar's whereabouts have proven false in the past.
