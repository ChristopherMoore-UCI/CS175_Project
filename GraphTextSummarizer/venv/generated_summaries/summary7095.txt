On Feb. 11, 2009, when Joaquin Phoenix made his infamous monosyllabic, grunged-out appearance on "Late Show With David Letterman," it inspired an orgy of media gossip fueled by a basic question: Was Phoenix having some sort of mental breakdown -- or was his whole shambling, beatnik-derelict routine an elaborate hoax? Standing there in his shades and overly tight suit jacket, holding his cigarette as if he couldn't be bothered to put it out for his act, Phoenix, without doing much of anything, radiates such smarmy contempt that you may think: Who is this -- the second coming of Andy Kaufman's Tony Clifton? Phoenix may say that he's left acting behind, but whether he's trolling the Internet for hookers, trying (hilariously) to convince Diddy to produce his rap album, getting huffy with an entertainment journalist at a junket for Two Lovers, or lashing out at fame while still enjoying all of its perks, the movie understands that his Last Honest Man in Showbiz routine is really a performance -- even if it's one the actor himself is only dimly aware of. By trashing what he's done before, Phoenix thinks he's not just another lowly entertainer on puppet strings but a pure artist who doesn't give a damn about celebrity. After all, why couldn't he try to launch a music career without giving up his day job -- the way that, say, Jamie Foxx (who appears briefly on the same stage as Phoenix in a club in Las Vegas) has done?
