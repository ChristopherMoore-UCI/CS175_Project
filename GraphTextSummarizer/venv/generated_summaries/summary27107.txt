Manufacturing output, however, dived another 0.8 per cent quarter on quarter (the sixth decline in the last eight quarters)", noted Mr Walters. Final demand -- a measure of spending in the local economy by the private and public sectors -- in the mining centres of Western Australia and Queensland rose 13.6 per cent and 7.8 per cent year-on-year respectively, compared with 2.1 per cent in New South Wales and 1.9 per cent in Victoria. Output from the miners, for example, bounced 2.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter and other industries turned in decent performances. In annual terms, GDP growth in the year to March was 4.3 per cent. But economists said the data, which preceded the latest bout of global economic worries, might prove to be the growth peak for Australia, and highlighted the unevenness in growth between the mining and non-mining sectors of the economy.
