In his ruling Tuesday, Beistline said "the injunction is lifted and the Division of Elections may certify the election results immediately." In Alaska, Beistline's ruling "fully and finally resolved all claims raised by Mr. Miller and stated that they have absolutely no merit and no chance of success," said Scott Kendall, an attorney representing the Murkowski campaign. " The Associated Press called the race for Murkowski last month when she had a lead of  more than 10,300 votes over Miller, a figure that included 8,159 ballots contested by Miller observers. In the original Superior Court decisions, a judge ruled that Miller did not provide proof of election official fraud, or that "there would be a sufficient change to the election results if these claims were true. He has argued that Alaska law does not allow the counting of misspelled names on write-in ballots. Miller had claimed the way some votes were counted violated state law.
