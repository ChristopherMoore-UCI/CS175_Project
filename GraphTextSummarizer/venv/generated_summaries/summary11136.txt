Read more: Deadly clashes erupt in Tajikistan Residents of Khorog, the capital of the province of Gorno-Badakhshan, awakened Tuesday to helicopters carrying government forces and flying low over the city near the compound of the former warlord, Tolib Ayombekov, witnesses said. Apparently, Ayombekov's forces were prepared for Tuesday's arrival of government forces looking for him. Thousands of residents in the capital of the Gorno-Badakshan region in eastern Tajikistan were trapped Thursday for a third consecutive day without any connection to the outside world, government officials, aid workers and witnesses told CNN. The Central Asian News Agency said Ayombekov refused to surrender to police and instigated the attack against government forces. The cutoff of communications began Tuesday, when fighting erupted in the autonomous region -- also known as Pamir -- after central government forces attempted to arrest a former opposition warlord believed to have been behind the killing of a top security general.
