The pope was meeting American Jewish leaders at the Vatican on the heels of a controversy over Holocaust denial. "Yad Vashem places importance on the Pope's unequivocal statement condemning Holocaust denial and any attempts to minimize the scope of the Shoah," said its chairman, Avner Shalev. "To condemn the anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial and to reinstate into the Church a bishop who is an anti-Semite and an Holocaust denier does not end the issue," he said. "The Church's clear public denouncement of all types of anti-Semitism, during his meeting earlier today with American Jewish leaders, is to be welcomed." The Vatican has since ordered the bishop, Richard Williamson, to recant, and has said the pontiff was not aware of Williamson's views on the Holocaust when the excommunication was lifted.
