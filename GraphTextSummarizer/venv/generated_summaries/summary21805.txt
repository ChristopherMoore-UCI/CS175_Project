The new government says Iran has a right to nuclear power, but decides it's a bad idea to pursue a nuclear program for the time being. -- It's been almost a decade since the United States accused Iran of actively working on a secret program to develop nuclear weapons. But Iran's pursuit and acquisition of nuclear weapons could ultimately prove more catastrophic for the Middle East, the West and the entire world. Watching the negotiations drag on and the advances made in Iran's nuclear program, Israel decides that it cannot trust President Obama to "always have Israel's back." Since then, Iran has steadfastly proclaimed to a skeptical world that it only seeks to produce nuclear energy, while American presidents have repeatedly warned that the United States will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran.
