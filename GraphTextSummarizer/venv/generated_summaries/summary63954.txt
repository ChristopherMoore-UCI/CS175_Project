Knox was 20 and Kercher was 21 when the two shared a home as they studied at the university for foreign students in Perugia, Italy. The deal comes after prosecutors in Italy lodged an appeal Tuesday of the acquittal of Knox, now 24, and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher. "For the very first time since her trial for murder, her four-year incarceration in Perugia, Italy, and her appeal and acquittal of all charges, Amanda Knox will share the truth about her terrifying ordeal," the publisher said in a statement. Italian prosecutors appeal Knox decision "No one has yet heard Amanda Knox's own account of what happened, and this book will give Knox an opportunity to tell the story in full detail, for the first time." -- Amanda Knox has signed a deal with HarperCollins to write a memoir about her trial, conviction and acquittal for murder in Italy, the publisher said Friday.
