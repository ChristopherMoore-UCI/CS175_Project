The move marks the latest in a series of protests around the capital, where at least 16 people were killed in recent days amid clashes with Egyptian authorities. Days of clashes were further stoked last weekend by the beating of a woman at the hands of military officers, prompting Tuesday's so-called "Million Women" march, billed as an attempt to highlight regime violence against female demonstrators. On Wednesday, Egypt's military announced on Facebook that they had acquired information of a "plan to vandalize government buildings and topple Egypt on January 25, 2012. " The date would mark the one-year anniversary of the start of Egypt's uprising that largely began in Tahrir square on January 25, 2011. Protesters on Friday could be heard singing the country's national anthem and chanting slogans, such as "The honor of Egyptian women is a red line."
