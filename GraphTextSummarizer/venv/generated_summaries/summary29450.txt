-- St. Louis Cardinals struck first in baseball's World Series on Wednesday, beating Texas Rangers 3-2 in game one courtesy of a pinch-hit from substitute batter Allen Craig. Third baseman David Freese scored the decisive run on a cold night at Busch Stadium after outfielder Craig hit a single in the bottom of the sixth innings off Rangers relief pitcher Alexi Ogando. "When you get in the postseason, you have to win games in so many ways," Freese said after Tony La Russa's St. Louis secured a 31st win in 44 games. History is against the Rangers, who are searching for their first World Series success, with the last 10 winning teams in game one going on to clinch baseball's biggest prize. "I don't know what everyone else has been thinking about our team," Craig, who came in for starting pitcher Chris Carpenter, told the MLB website.
