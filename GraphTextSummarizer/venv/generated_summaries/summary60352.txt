Jonathan will continue to oversee the nation as the president recuperates, but his health has "greatly improved," said presidential spokesman Olusegun Adeniyi. Nigeria's acting head of state has urged citizens to maintain peace and stability while the nation's ailing president recuperates after more than three months at a Saudi Arabia hospital. Nigerian lawmakers voted earlier this month to install Jonathan as acting head of state. "Nigeria is an extraordinarily important country to its friends and partners, and all those in positions of responsibility should put the health of the president and the best interests of the country and people of Nigeria above personal ambition or gain," Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson said in a statement. A cease-fire Yar'Adua had spear-headed with militants also started unraveling, and religious conflict in the city of Jos killed hundreds.
