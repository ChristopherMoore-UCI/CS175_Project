The World Health Organization says AIDS accounted for an estimated 2 million deaths in 2008, and more than 33 million people are living with HIV worldwide. While the spread of the disease has slowed since the 1980s, an estimated 56,000 Americans still contract HIV each year, according to White House Domestic Policy Council Director Melody Barnes. Michael Weinstein, president of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, told CNN in an interview that "when you see what this administration has done on AIDS, you have to give them very low grades." Obama has "consistently underfunded AIDS" programs, Weinstein said. -- The Obama administration aims to cut the annual number of new HIV infections in the United States by 25 percent over the next five years, according to a nationwide HIV/AIDS strategy unveiled Tuesday. "This is significant because we've now found antibodies that are good templates for HIV vaccine development," said Peter Kwong, co-author of the study published last Thursday in the journal Science.
