" "Rapper's Delight" also borrowed its bass line and other flourishes from "Good Times," prompting threats of legal action by Chic co-founders Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards. It was born from the emerging New York hip-hop scene of the late '70s, in which young rappers gathered in clubs and exchanged rhymes over instrumental breaks from popular songs, most notably Chic's hit "Good Times. The three friends were unknown MCs when producer Sylvia Robinson recruited them to record the song for her rap label, Sugar Hill Records. After a settlement, Rodgers and Edwards were listed as co-writers of the song. Released in fall 1979, "Rapper's Delight" became a novelty hit and a staple at dance clubs well into 1980.
