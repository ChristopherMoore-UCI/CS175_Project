Jose Salvador Alvarenga flew from El Salvador to Mexico this week to keep his word -- more than a month after the stunning story of his survival at sea captured international attention. While Alvarenga, 37, returned to his native El Salvador last month, Cordoba's family was left demanding answers. Alvarenga said Cordoba had died four weeks into their ordeal because he couldn't manage to drink turtle blood and eat raw fish. His traveling companion, fellow fisherman Ezequiel Cordoba, 23, hadn't made it. Roselia Diaz, Cordoba's mother, said she was grateful that Alvarenga had traveled to the coastal Mexican town where she lives.
