Accordingly, it behooves great sea powers such as Australia and the United States -- the biggest beneficiaries of freedom of the sea -- to make every effort to keep the commons a commons. Hugo Grotius' doctrine of free seas ultimately seemed to win out. No one claimed the Russian task force passed through Australian territorial waters, the 12-nautical-mile belt of sea off any coastal state's shores. Royal Australian Navy men-of-war and surveillance aircraft took to sea and sky to monitor the Russian warships' whereabouts and, presumably, document their activities. We don't expect to break down at sea.
