While not well-known in the West, Masha Drokova will always be a symbol of Putin's power and of the first generation to come of age in post-Soviet Russia, after her tumultuous tenure as the spokeswoman for Nashi, a nationalist youth movement that Putin officials created in 2005. Audiences watch Masha's disillusionment with Nashi turn to anguish when one of those reporters is savagely beaten by attackers he suspects are Nashi members. Masha was someone who certainly believed in Nashi, which describes itself as this kind of democratic anti-Fascist movement that Putin and the presidential administration was very much for. I wanted to portray that side as well, and that's also one of the reasons I chose to portray a person who was a spokesperson for Putin's youth movement, Nashi. So Masha gets into this crowd and she's warned by the leadership of Nashi that she should not mix with these people, that she could not in daytime believe in Putin and then in nighttime be friends with people who would criticize him.
