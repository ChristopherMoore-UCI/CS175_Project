"We just achieved an agreed order," Stephen Casey, a lawyer and founder of The Texas Center for Defense of Life, told CNN in a telephone interview Monday afternoon. Jane's Due Process, which supports the right to legal abortion, is not involved in this case. The mother told the teen that she was "making the biggest mistake of her life" by choosing to have the child and that the mother herself had undergone numerous abortions, so her daughter should, too, the lawsuit said. Casey responded that the courts had notified child protective services about the abuse allegations. "Roe was about the right to choose," Casey told CNN prior to the order being signed.
