"Stop apologizing for what you've done." Bill Ballenger, editor of Inside Michigan Politics, an online newsletter, was research director for the state Republican Party while Romney was governor, and later became a state lawmaker, a director of state agencies and U.S. deputy assistant secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. "It was just all so natural for him," said Keith Molin, who worked on Romney's campaigns for governor, became an influential state GOP operative and served as state labor director and then commerce director under Romney's successor as governor, William Milliken. An early backer of the U.S. efforts "to reverse a shift in the balance of power" between Communist North Vietnam and democratic South Vietnam, Romney said the additional research he did on his return convinced him -- well before many of his countrymen -- that it was the wrong war at the wrong time. Asked for reaction to the comments of Molin and Ballenger, a spokeswoman for the Mitt Romney campaign directed me to Bob Danhof, who served as George Romney's legal counsel when he was governor, but he could not be reached. Ten years after his presidential foray, I interviewed George Romney over a lunch of grilled cheese and chocolate milk at his suburban Detroit home.
