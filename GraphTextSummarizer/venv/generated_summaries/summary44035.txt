Rising food prices have driven nearly 44 million people into poverty since June, according to World Bank estimates released this week, pushing the number of chronically hungry toward 1 billion. "Our research shows higher global wheat prices have directly fed into sharp increases in domestic wheat prices in many countries," Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said earlier this week. Russia -- still reeling from a drought that slashed wheat harvest by nearly 40% and spurred Moscow to ban exports last summer -- hopes new, resilient strains of the crop will lead to a resumption of wheat exports. Global food prices rose 29% in the past year due to weather shocks such as the Russian drought and subsequent export ban, as well as the growing appetite for biofuels and rising demand from emerging economies such as Brazil, India and China. But the tinderbox was built on high unemployment, corruption and rising food prices.
