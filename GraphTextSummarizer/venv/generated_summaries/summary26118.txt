"With tobacco, we have a pretty established set of policies we know are effective, but with obesity, it's still new," New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas A. Farley told an audience at Fordham University in New York during a conference last fall on Bloomberg's public health legacy. "Parents from around the country used to dissuade their kids from moving to New York because it was dangerous," Bloomberg said last week. Bloomberg's eat-your-vegetables approach to public health has triggered cries that the 71-year-old media mogul, politician and philanthropist has turned the city that never sleeps into a nanny state, one where finger-wagging admonitions about what to eat and drink and how to live have become annoyingly intrusive. Gibbs predicted that Bloomberg will remain focused on public health, even after he leaves office at the end of the year. Since taking office in 2002, Bloomberg has unleashed a tsunami of public health initiatives intended to do just that -- cutting sodium in prepared meals, ordering that menus in chain restaurants carry calorie counts, posting restaurants' health department grades, as well as limiting the use of tobacco products.
