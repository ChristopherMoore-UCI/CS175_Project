Seventy-six percent of men who took part in a recent online survey by SheKnows Media admitted using phrases like "man up" and "be a man" toward boys. "These are problems that are often thought of as problems for girls, but boys are just as impacted and they're exposed to unrealistic body images," said Ellen Pack, vice president of marketing for Common Sense Media, which is partnering with SheKnows Media to help parents understand the impact that media and technology are having on children. What do you think is the best way to empower boys and young men to tune out negative gender stereotypes? At the same time, there does appear to be more open-mindedness on what being masculine means to men and boys today, based on the poll's findings. Of the men surveyed by SheKnows, 78% said it was OK for boys to cry, 65% thought it was fine for boys to wear pink, and 55% of men said boys should be able to play dress-up.
