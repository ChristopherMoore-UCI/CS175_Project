" Set in Mexico against the backdrop of the country's ballooning people trafficking problem, Fukunaga's  social-political thriller shows one boy's struggle to escape Mexican gang culture after meeting a Honduran immigrant girl. " After Fukunaga first conceived "Sin Nombre" (which translates as "Without a Name") in 2005 he embarked on a mammoth research tour in order to fully understand what it is like to be both a desperate immigrant and a street gang member. "I spent about two years in two different prisons, and reduced a group of gang members down to a couple guys I could trust," he explained. The film's action includes a dramatic shootout scene featuring real gang members as extras alongside actors. The half-Japanese half-Swedish director decided that it would be impossible to portray street gang culture or the treacherous immigrant experience without fully immersing himself in both.
