The blast happened as a convoy of African Union Mission in Somalia, or AMISOM, personnel passed a United Nations Development Program compound in Mogadishu, Hilowle said. Friday's attack appeared to be aimed at the convoy, AMISOM spokesman Col. Ali Aden Houmed said, adding that the incident is under investigation. All of those killed or injured were Somali civilians, according to Abdikafi Hilowle, administration secretary for the Benadir region. Government and African Union forces have been battling Islamic militants for years in an effort to bring stability to the land. This is the latest in a series of attacks in the city, the heart of an unstable nation beset with civil strife.
