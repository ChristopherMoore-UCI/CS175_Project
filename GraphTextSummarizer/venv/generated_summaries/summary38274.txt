The new benchmarks -- called Common Core Standards -- are a move initiated at the state level to come up with a set of standards that will be used by all states to create cross-border consistency in what students will be expected to know. -- Setting national standards for U.S. students has been tried in the past without success -- but a new state-led effort is gaining momentum, according to an official of an educational think tank that compiled a nationwide study comparing standards. So far 26 states have signed on to the national Common Core Standards while several have opted not to use the standards. On the more local level, California, the District of Columbia and Indiana received the highest marks in English language arts with more stringent standards than the national recommendations, according to the institute's study, while 37 states fell below the recommended Common Core standards. Since the Common Core Standards are part of a state-led effort, Petrilli says they have avoided the debate about the federal government pushing standards on the rest of the country.
