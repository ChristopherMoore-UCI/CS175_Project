Then Japan's top sumo -- Asashoryu -- apologized on national TV after being caught in an apparent lie. Police arrested 335-pound Soslan Aleksandrovich Gagloev -- better known as Wakanoho -- on Monday. Police say they found marijuana in Wakanoho's wallet on June 24 and arrested him Monday after an investigation. First, police charged three sumo wrestlers and their stable master with beating a teenage sumo to death last year. Fewer Japanese boys are entering the tough life of sumo, so the Sumo Association is recruiting foreigners like Wakanoho and Asashoryu.
