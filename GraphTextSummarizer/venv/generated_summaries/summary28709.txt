-- The mother of a Florida girl who jumped to her death announced Monday that she will sue those she believes responsible for her daughter's suicide -- less than a week after authorities dropped criminal charges against two girls accused of cyberbullying Rebecca Sedwick. Authorities said Rebecca killed herself after months of cyberbullying from fellow students. Authorities initially charged two girls, ages 12 and 14, with aggravated stalking, but the charges were dropped last week. Norman's attorney, Matt Morgan, on Monday called on Florida lawmakers to come up with a "Rebecca's Law" -- legislation that Morgan says would allow the state to file bullying charges against minors and their parents. Rebecca, 12, died after jumping from the top of an abandoned concrete plant in September.
