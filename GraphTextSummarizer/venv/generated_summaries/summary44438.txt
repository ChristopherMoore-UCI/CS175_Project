Cromwell, said Publishers Weekly Fiction Reviews Editor Mike Harvkey, is a "little older" in book two but "more powerful" as he plots the removal of Anne Boleyn from the throne. Reviewers have praised Fountain's combination of comedy with the harsh realities of war, and Parnassus Books put its recommendation bluntly: "We got an (advanced copy) of the book back in January, and we all read it and were blown away," said Tristan Hickey, bookseller and floor manager of the shop.
