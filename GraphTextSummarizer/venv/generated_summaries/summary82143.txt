-- Boisterous and uninhibited on screen, comedic actor Kevin Hart has quietly risen to the top in Hollywood. Authenticity A huge part of Hart's appeal is his willingness to mine his own fears and foibles for comedy gold, a practice that made "Laugh at My Pain" and the 2013 top performer that followed, "Let Me Explain," major moneymakers. From the 2012 rom-com release "The Five-Year Engagement" to the 2013 sports flick "Grudge Match" with Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone, there aren't many worlds that Hart can't inhabit. "His comedy comes from such a real place," Hart's frequent co-star, Seth Rogen, told Rolling Stone. Instead of dropping out for good, Hart worked with a mentor and re-evaluated his position: He started performing under his own name and began to hit with his brand of loud, physical comedy that drew from personal stories.
