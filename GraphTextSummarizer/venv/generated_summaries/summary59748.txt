"These models are now used by scientists in order to develop new antibiotics, directly assisting the saving of lives and decreasing humanity's suffering," said the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize. -- Two Americans and an Israeli were awarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry on Wednesday for painstakingly mapping out the thousands of atoms that make up the ribosome -- work that paves the way for new antibiotics. Yonath is a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, and director of the Helen & Milton A. Kimmelman Center for Biomolecular Structure & Assembly at the Weizmann Institute, the Nobel site said. U.S. researcher Thomas Steitz is one of three scientists sharing the 2009 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The medicine award was handed out on Monday and the one for physics on Tuesday.
