In March, the UAE announced that Federal National Council elections will be held in September. Lt. General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, the commander-in-chief of Dubai police, said he was not aware whether Mansoor had been arrested, but promised to look into it. Earlier Friday, three men identifying themselves as police officers were at his apartment building, Mansoor wrote in an email. In addition to elections, the group asked that the Federal National Council be granted legislative powers. Mansoor was part of a group of 133 nationals who petitioned the president on March 9 for direct elections.
