-- A US Airways flight attendant was found dead in his hotel room in Mexico City, company spokeswoman Tina Swail said Saturday. Deborah Volpe, president of AFA Council 66, described Aaronson as "very popular" and a "much-loved flight attendant." A spokesman for the attorney general in Mexico City said authorities were called in the early morning to the Hilton Hotel, where they found the body of a man, estimated to have been between 30 and 35 years old. Preliminary reports do not indicate a safety breach at the hotel, according to a statement from the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) Council 66. Authorities are investigating the circumstances of Nick Aaronson's death, she said.
