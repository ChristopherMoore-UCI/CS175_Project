"The more content I end up doing, then the less time everyone gets to spend watching performances, and really, in addition to doling out awards, that's the reason you watch," says Harris, who last year sang a duet with Hugh Jackman, a group performance with the New York Philharmonic cast of "Company" and a full opening and closing number. With last year's "Book of Mormon"-dominated telecast dabbling in irreverence, this year's ceremony should be noticeably more family-oriented, thanks in no small part to the heavy presence of a solid handful of mainstream plays representing one of the medium's best seasons in recent memory. "I think the celebratory tone of it makes it my favorite show to host," says Harris, who previously celebrated Broadway's biggest night with successful hosting gigs in 2009 and 2011. But what we can expect on June 10 is a high-energy telecast that commemorates the best of the year on Broadway and cements Harris as a master master of ceremonies. "I'm really trying this year to figure out a way to get performances by plays somehow in the show," Harris tells EW.
