Some wineries suffered damage to their barrel storage areas, wine inventory and production equipment over the weekend, but "there were no reports of winery employees being injured by the earthquake," according a statement by Napa Valley Vintners, an association of 500 area vintners. While the Visit Napa Valley tourism office says that most businesses are open as usual, the group noted that some historic downtown Napa businesses had been damaged. " Most of the valley is operating normally, Napa City Manager Mike Parness said at a Sunday news conference. "It appears the majority of the damage was centered on specific areas in the city of Napa," the bureau said, in a press statement. Signorello Estate, which took to social media to announce the Napa winery would be closed Sunday, reopened Monday for business, an employee told CNN.
