Saada government officials and a spokesman for Salafis in Dammaj accuse Houthi rebels of firing mortars and rockets last week at Dammaj's Al-Mazraa mosque -- part of a Salafi religious institute -- in a bid to force Salafis to leave the area. In recent days, violence has escalated between Houthi rebels and Salafi militants  in the city of Dammaj, with hundreds injured as a result. According to officials, regional Salafi figureheads have been calling for jihad against the Houthi rebels, which has raised tensions in the past several weeks. The official said that for decades, Houthi supporters have complained of foreign interference coming from Dammaj, where there is a Salafi Center. "But shelling them today is nothing more than a sign of hubris and exposes how the political map is evolving," the official added. Dozens of people have been killed by sectarian clashes in Yemen's northern province of Saada in the past several days, according to local officials.
