Jeff Loftin, a spokesman for the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, said forces were in the "clearing phase." Afghan and NATO troops discovered 5,500 pounds of explosives and seized a Taliban commander responsible for small arms ambushes and roadside attacks on troops, Loftin said. Villagers told the troops that the Taliban were using private homes to fire at U.S. forces. "Even if there is a Taliban fighter within a compound and [troops] suspect that a civilian is in there, they are not allowed to fire," Abawi reported. McChrystal has given troops clear orders to avoid civilian casualties. U.S. troops are leading the mission.
