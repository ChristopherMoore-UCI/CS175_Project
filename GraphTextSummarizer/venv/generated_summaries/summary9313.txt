The local officers called in federal police, who conducted an immediate search of the vehicle and discovered Lopes in the trunk, police said. Antonio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, alias "Nem," was found hiding Wednesday in the trunk of a car attempting to avoid a police siege in the outskirts of Rocinha, a slum in the heart of Rio that was under his control, police said. Rio will play host to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, and has turned its attention to restoring control of the slums, or favelas, that had been in the hands of criminals and gangs. -- As Brazilian authorities work to "pacify" Brazil's slums ahead of two global sporting events, police in Rio de Janeiro captured one of the city's most notorious drug traffickers. On the way there, police said, the car stopped again and one of its occupants offered the officers 20,000 reais (U.S. $11,400) in exchange for their freedom.
