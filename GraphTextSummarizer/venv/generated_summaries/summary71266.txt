Gun owners also watched, incredulously, when Bloomberg's minions cheered New York and Connecticut's massive gun bans and gun registration requirements -- only to deny, in Washington, that they supported either of these things. In 2013, after the Newtown incident, our members were more than capable of reading Bloomberg's duplicitous background check legislation and understanding what it actually did: open a back door to gun registration. Bloomberg's hatred and hypocrisy has only energized our people, who have enacted 70 pro-gun state laws since Newtown -- twice the number of Bloomberg anti-gun laws that have been enacted around the country. They understand that, in places such as New York City, the government has been sending letters demanding the confiscation of guns in violation of a 2010 city ordinance. He will only energize other gun groups who will be forced to oppose red state Democrats.
