Caroline Frick, curator of motion pictures at the George Eastman House museum of photography and film in Rochester, New York, said such film repatriation projects are exciting, with "a huge array of film history that still remains unknown because so many of the films don't exist." Frick explained that Russia's digital preservation of American silent films is an example of how film preservation itself has changed, especially in the last 10 years. "A study published by the Library of Congress in 1993 concluded that the majority of U.S. movies from the 1920s survive only in foreign film archives," said Librarian of Congress James Billington. The ten films presented Thursday, their studios and production year include: -- "Valley of the Giants" (Famous Players, 1919) -- "You're Fired" (Famous Players, 1919) -- "The Conquest of Canaan" (Famous Players, 1921) -- "Kick In" (Famous Players, 1922) -- "The Call of the Canyon" (Famous Players, 1923) -- "Canyon of the Fools" (R-C Pictures, 1923) -- "Circus Days" (First National, 1923) -- "The Eternal Struggle" (Metro Pictures, Louis B. Mayer, 1923) -- "The Arab" (Metro, 1924) -- "Keep Smiling" (Monty Banks, 1925) He went on to explain that in the days of early American movie-making, many studios and theaters simply threw old movies away. "It used to be that you preserved on film but now we have a multitude of ways, including making digital copies so that the images are preserved.
