In a different cable from the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh there is a discussion regarding the recidivism rate of Guantanamo detainees returned to Saudi Arabia who then passed through the country's rehabilitation program. The cable does acknowledge however, that it was more difficult to rehabilitate former Guantanamo detainees than others. In another creative solution for the detainees, Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah proposed to implant a Bluetooth-like device into former Guantanamo detainees to track their movements. The document also summarized Heusgen as saying, "if Germany were to take any [Uyghurs], it would be best to do so in combination with other European countries to prevent China from focusing its opposition on any one country. It goes on to say that Zhang "did imply that the Guantanamo situation had made China look for ways to hit back at the U.S." The 17 Uyghurs were eventually relocated to Palau, Bermuda, Albania and Switzerland.
