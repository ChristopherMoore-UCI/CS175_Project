On Mancreu, Ferris meets a nameless, streetwise boy raised on comic books, action movies and video games. The book deals with darker themes of justice and vengeance, similar to another hero with father issues, "Batman." When he and the boy bond over their mutual love of comic books and afternoon tea, Ferris starts to imagine life as a father. For now, Harkaway is already at work on his next novel about "semiotics, murder, alchemy, sharks, banking, game design and the surveillance state," he said. Comic book fans will recognize elements of the Caped Crusader, with Ferris playfully referring to the boy as "Robin" in the book.
