The Washington Post, citing anonymous Afghan and Western officials, reported that the embassy pulled its advisers amid concerns it had become politicized in recent months. "We want to ensure that U.S. support and resources are used efficiently and effectively as the transition takes place." The center is responsible for shaping the government's positions and responses to Afghan news issues. The newspaper reported, according to officials, that there were concerns about how the media center "has been managed and the allocation of resources." The statement did not detail why the embassy decided to pull its personnel, who act as advisers to the Government Media and Information Center.
