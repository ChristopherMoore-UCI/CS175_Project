-- Eurostar canceled all service this weekend after severe wintry weather in northern France caused the breakdown of an "unprecedented" six trains, stranding thousands of passengers on both sides of the English Channel on the weekend before Christmas. The trains became stuck in the tunnel because the air inside was much warmer than the air outside the tunnel entrance in France, Eurostar spokeswoman Amelle Mouhaddib told CNN. In a statement on its Web site Saturday, Eurostar said it will conduct a series of test trains Sunday "to better understand the problems that have been occurring. "It's a bit like taking a bottle of beer out of the fridge into a warm room -- within minutes it's covered in condensation," said Eurostar CEO Richard Brown. The train that broke down Saturday was being towed back to the tunnel entry so passengers could be removed and transferred, Eurostar said.
