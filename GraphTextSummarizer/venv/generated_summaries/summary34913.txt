-- "Any time you're around greatness, like I was for six years, and you see it at close quarters, you're asked about it." Tiger Woods' former swing coach Hank Haney says it happens wherever he goes. Haney was "shocked" when the scandal about Woods' personal life broke in November 2009. Haney joined Woods' team in 2004 and knew he'd "catch some flack" for penning the book, but he wanted to share his memories of a person he describes as very complex. Haney spent over 100 days in the company of Woods every year, even staying at his Florida home on occasions. The book reflects "exactly what happened" during their time together right down to publication of some text messages Haney sent to Woods.
