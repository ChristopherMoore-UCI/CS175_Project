Palin has sought about $450 million in earmarks from the state's congressional delegation since becoming governor, and about $27 million for Wasilla during her second term as mayor from 1998 to 2002, according to state records and documents from the Washington-based watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense. Democrats also are trying to exploit a gap between McCain's famous opposition to congressional earmarks and Palin's efforts to obtain those appropriations for Alaska during her time as governor and as mayor of the Alaskan town of Wasilla. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin canceled work on the Gravina Island bridge in 2007 after initially supporting the project. "I'm not going to stand in the way of progress that our congressional delegation -- in the position of strength that they have right now -- they're making those efforts for the state of Alaska to build up our infrastructure," Palin said during a debate shortly before her 2006 election as governor.
