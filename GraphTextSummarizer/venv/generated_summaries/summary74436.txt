Before 2005's Hurricane Katrina, the New Orleans metropolitan area saw significant flooding in May 1995, when 24 inches of rain fell in some neighborhoods, said forecaster Phil Grigsby of the National Weather Service. Downstream, in Morgan City, teacher Julie Cortez McCarty, 42, is glad the oil town has a sea wall, but she is concerned about water backing in from Lake Palourde and other waterways. As has been the case upriver from Missouri south to Tennessee, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is predicting its system of levees and flood walls will hold, keeping the river from inundating most Louisiana towns and farms that line its banks. "We've been hearing about the possibility of flooding," Dan Gober, who lives in the town of Gibson, about 15 miles east of Morgan City, told CNN affiliate WWL. "I'm going to wait a little longer" before deciding on evacuating, said Leanne Boudreaux, 33, of Krotz Springs, an Atchafalaya River community that doesn't feature a traffic signal.
