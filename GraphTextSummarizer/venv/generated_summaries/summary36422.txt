Tendulkar recorded his 99th international hundred over a year ago as part of India's successful World Cup campaign on home soil. Tendulkar became the first man to reach 50 centuries in 2000 and surpassed West Indian batsman Brian Lara's record for the highest number of Test runs in 2008. His century provoked an outpouring of joy on home soil after a long wait. Tendulkar made his debut for India in a Test match against Pakistan back in 1989 when he was just 16 and, despite being hit in the mouth by a ball from fast bowler Waqar Younis, he batted on in a blood-soaked shirt. It was also his first one-day century against minnows Bangladesh.
