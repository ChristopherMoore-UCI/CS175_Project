AMISOM and government forces drove Al-Shabaab fighters from the center of Mogadishu last year, while Kenyan troops crossed into southern Somalia in October to hit back for a rash of kidnappings it blamed on the group. Last week, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) said it, along with Somali troops, had launched an offensive against militants in the Afgoye corridor, a densely-populated enclave near the volatile Somali capital of Mogadishu. -- Kenyan soldiers, as part of African Union forces in Somalia, captured the key Al-Shabaab-controlled town of Afmadow on Wednesday, according to a Kenyan Defence Force spokesman. The town would serve as a staging point for any move on Kismayo, Al-Shabaab's stronghold in southern Somalia. Al-Shabaab has waged an insurgency against Somalia's feeble Transitional Federal Government since 2007, but has suffered recent setbacks in its heartland in southern Somalia.
