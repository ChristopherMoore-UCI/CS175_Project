In his strongest words to date, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, tried to quash talk that he would allow another government shutdown if he becomes Senate majority leader next year. I am the guy that gets us out of shutdowns," McConnell told CNN in an exclusive interview Wednesday. We're going to have those kind of votes next year if I'm majority leader," said McConnell. Last year's government shutdown was hardly a popular event, and McConnell's Democratic opponent, Alison Lundergan Grimes, pounced on the story. McConnell opposed the last shutdown, fueled by a strategy from his fellow Republican Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to only fund the government by defunding Obamacare, which passed the GOP-led House but had no chance in the Senate.
