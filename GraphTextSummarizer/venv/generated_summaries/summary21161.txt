Located on Fifth Avenue, the elegant Big Apple landmark has long been a sought-after site for weddings, so much so that it was a driving plot line in the movie "Bride Wars. The property is known for its lush gardens -- 25 acres where you can gaze upon everything from a 500-year-old tree to azaleas, camellias and roses. Known for its soft white sand beach and first-class spa, Parrot Cay has a no-fly zone so that famous guests -- such as Bruce Willis and Donna Karan -- don't have to worry about photographers snapping pictures of them from the air. Dozens of famous guests -- including Brooke Shields and Jennifer Lopez -- flocked inside the castle's massive stone walls to watch the couple exchange vows during a sunset ceremony. Today, the royals mingle with guests, including model Elizabeth Hurley and businessman Arun Nayar who married here in 2007 -- one of several wedding celebrations the couple held in England and India.
