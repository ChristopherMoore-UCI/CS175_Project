-- Two Tennessee National Guard members were shot during a fight at a suburban Memphis armory on Thursday, and a third was in custody, authorities reported. The suspected gunman was subdued by others at the armory, said Rita Stanback, the police chief in the northern Memphis suburb of Millington. The Navy compound was on lockdown after the shooting, the lockdown has since been lifted, the service reported via Twitter. A U.S. military official told CNN's Barbara Starr that a Guard member shot two others during a fight. Each of the victims was shot once, one in the leg and one in the foot, Stanback said.
