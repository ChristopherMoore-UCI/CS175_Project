That was the third-longest such streak to begin a career all time, the Yankees said, behind Hall of Famers Grover Cleveland Alexander, at 17, and Cy Young, at 15. It's still possible for Pettitte to see another post-season, since the 80-73 Yankees are still eligible to go to the playoffs in the post-season as a wild card. -- The New York Yankees' Andy Pettitte, the winningest pitcher in post-season history, will retire after this season, the Yankees said Friday. Pettitte's announcement comes as the Yankees honor their great reliever, baseball's all-time saves leader Mariano Rivera. In the post-season, he went 19-11 with a 3.81 ERA in 44 career starts.
