The 42-year-old Italian tested positive for the drug at a meeting at Longchamp in Paris last September and he was subsequently suspended by France Galop. -- Iconic jockey Frankie Dettori was cleared to return to racing by the governing body of the sport in France Thursday after serving a six-month ban for cocaine use. Dettori was due to make his comeback last week but was thwarted in his efforts after a test carried out by France Galop produced, according to the BHA, an "irregularity". The world of racing was stunned last year when news of Dettori's misdemeanor became public and he vowed to "rebuild his reputation" in accepting his punishment. The decision to return his license means that Dettori is eligible to compete in Britain's most famous horse race, the Epsom Derby Saturday.
