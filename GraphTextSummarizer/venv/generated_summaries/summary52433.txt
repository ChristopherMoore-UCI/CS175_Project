Twitter highlights the impact of single tweets in its Twitter Stories series, tracking Tweets that go viral and result in positive impacts and happy endings. A tweet doesn't just trigger financial panic, it can also strain diplomatic relations, as the U.S. Embassy in Cairo found out in April when the official Twitter account posted a link to a Daily Show segment critical of Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi. The journalist was an experienced Twitter hoaxer, having previously posted fake tweets about the death of the pope and Fidel Castro and established a number fake accounts for world leaders. -- Misinformation can spread quickly on Twitter, each retweet exposing it to wider audiences and even resulting in real world impacts. Deleting the tweet is a good approach, but even if you delete it it's obviously already out there," said social media expert Krista Neher.
