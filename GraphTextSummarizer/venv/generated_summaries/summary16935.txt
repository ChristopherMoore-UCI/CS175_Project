New Facebook policies and the proposed strengthening of the electronic privacy act are important steps, but until we follow privacy-by-design technology, strengthen fair information practices, and encourage policies that recognize the social nature of privacy, our online world will continue to lack the mechanisms we need to promote and protect personal privacy. If we treated personal information like private property akin to a home or car, the argument goes, then I would have the power to decide when and to whom to "sell" or license my information, and of course would have a case against the dating website for "stealing" it. Businesses lack information accountability and fair information practice policies are weak. Many privacy advocates and information security experts react to examples like mine with calls for more consumer control of information. Privacy enhances social relationships, both private and contractual.
