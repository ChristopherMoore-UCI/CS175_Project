According to InSight Crime, a Colombia- and U.S.-based research and investigation outfit that monitors criminal groups, the Oficina de Envigado, named after a small city in the Medellin metropolitan area, are the inheritors of Escobar's drug trafficking empire. " In July, a man who served as security chief for former President Alvaro Uribe turned himself in to U.S. agents in Colombia to face drug trafficking charges in the United States. He was captured Wednesday morning by an elite group of police in the department of Antioquia, in northwest Colombia, police said. -- Colombian authorities have captured the leader of a criminal group that once worked for Pablo Escobar, a police spokesman said Wednesday. Today, the group is "a hodgepodge of smaller organizations that seeks alliances with street gangs to keep control of their territory and businesses," according to an InSight Crime profile of the group.
