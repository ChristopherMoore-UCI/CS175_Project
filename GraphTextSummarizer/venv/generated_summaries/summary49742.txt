Amazon Prime subscribers get access to books that can be borrowed for no additional cost. And it's easy to get trapped reading multiple books at once, thanks to Amazon's ecosystem. I'm a big guy with large hands, so reaching over that 20 percent portion of screen with my thumb is easy. You can get the ad-free Kindle for $140, but since you never see an ad in-book (only on the sleep screen, or when browsing your library) it doesn't really matter. It's useful if you're buying books while sitting on the beach in Italy.
