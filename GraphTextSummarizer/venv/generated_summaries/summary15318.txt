Instead, even when printed structures are made with living cells, they must "incubate" in the body to become fully functional. It's no surprise, then, that scientists around the world are investigating whether living cells can be used to print replacement organs and tissues. One possibility is to print small channels into the structures that can be populated with blood vessel cells. Vital to the process is a thorough understanding of cell biology. Developments that occur at the laboratory bench are an integral part of the equation and what can be accomplished with printing depends, in large part, on advancements in cell biology and materials science.
