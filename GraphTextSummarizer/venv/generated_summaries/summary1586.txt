Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Beckham had hoped to crown his England career with a fourth World Cup finals appearance in South Africa, but was ruled out after suffering a serious Achilles tendon injury in March while on loan with Italian club AC Milan. He won more international caps than any other outfield England player, but is 10 short of the country's record held by goalkeeper Peter Shilton. -- David Beckham's glittering international career has been brought to an end after England coach Fabio Capello announced his fate in a pre-match television interview. He went to South Africa anyway as an ambassador for England's 2018 World Cup bid and as a mentor for the team, watching the matches from the bench alongside Capello. Beckham may be fit before the end of the American MLS season as he has now returned to light training, but he would not be ready for England's opening Euro 2012 qualifiers next month.
