The Islamist militant group -- whose name means "Western education is sin" in the local Hausa language -- has bombed schools, churches and mosques; kidnapped women and children; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders. In that blast, about 130 people were hurt when a parked vehicle exploded in the Nyanya Motor Park bus station crowded with early morning commuters. The explosion injured 66 people Thursday night, said Manzo Ezekiel, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency. -- An explosion in a bus station filled with laborers killed 18 people in the Nigerian capital of Abuja Boko Haram's leader claimed responsibility for the April 14 bombing.
