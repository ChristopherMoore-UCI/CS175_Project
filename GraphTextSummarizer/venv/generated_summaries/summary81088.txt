Since then, Akon has sold millions of albums around the world and collaborated with countless pop and hip-hop icons such as Michael Jackson, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dog and Eminem. Akon finished the vocals in 2009, after Jackson's death, and the song became the first single released on the King of Pop's posthumous album titled "Michael." Born in the United States to Senegalese parents, Akon, or Aliaune Damala Badara Thiam, spent his early years in the West African country. During those days, Akon says, he let down Africa. "We snuck off to go to the movies, he had a disguise on," says Akon, recalling his collaboration with Jackson.
