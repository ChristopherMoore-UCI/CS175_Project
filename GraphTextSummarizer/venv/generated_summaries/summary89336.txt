Pope Francis called Friday for religious tolerance and dialogue to counter extremism in the Middle East as he met with Turkey's leaders on the first day of a rare papal visit to the predominantly Muslim country. " At the same time, Francis said, Turkey has a "great responsibility," because of its history and location bridging East and West, to help bring different communities together and promote the path to peace. Turkey also faces an atmosphere of increased insecurity, with ISIS at its border and the extremist group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, announcing its intention to conquer Rome and the world. On his first trip to Turkey as pontiff, Francis will also spend time with the head of the Orthodox Church. Francis is the fourth Pope to travel to Turkey, following in the footsteps of Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI.
