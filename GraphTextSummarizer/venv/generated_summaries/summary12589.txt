Minaj, 28, and Safaree Samuels, 30, had "a verbal altercation" at the Hotel Palomar pool, Dallas police said. -- Nicki Minaj suffered a swollen lip when a man shoved a suitcase across her chin Monday night at a Dallas hotel, but the hip-hop artist refused to file a complaint against him, according to a police report. The rapper-singer-songwriter told police she and Samuels "were only friends and had never been involved in an intimate relationship and were not related at all," it said. Samuels "grabbed the suitcase and as he was picking it up, he shoved the suitcase across (her) chin and lower lip," the document said. Her "teeth struck the inside of her lower lip, causing the inside of the lower lip to cut and start to bleed," the police report said.
