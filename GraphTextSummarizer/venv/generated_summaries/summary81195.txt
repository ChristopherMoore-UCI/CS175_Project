"Schedule 1 substances are reserved for those substances with a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision," according to a DEA press release. Poison control centers reported about 13,000 calls about problems with synthetic drugs in 2011, Deborah Carr of the American Association of Poison Control Centers said earlier this month. -- The Drug Enforcement Administration is extending for another six months its emergency ban on five chemicals used to make synthetic drugs such as Spice, the DEA announced on Wednesday. DEA officials also would like to see Congress pass legislation to outlaw synthetic drugs. The DEA says the products are made of plant material coated with chemicals that claim to mimic THC, the key ingredient in marijuana.
