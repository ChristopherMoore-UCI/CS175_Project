From simple SMS reminders for vaccinations or anti-retroviral treatments, to grassroots information gathering on demographics and diseases, to mobile information repositories for personal health records, cellphones are becoming a key cornerstone of health programs in a growing number of African countries. If we classify the MDGs into three broad areas -- education, health, and the environment -- we see that mobile broadband has a key role to play in each. If countries embrace the unique power of mobile broadband technology, I believe many have a good chance. While there is no substitute for the physical presence of a healthcare professional, broadband is helping train community field workers, while providing expectant mothers and their extended families with simple advice that protects health -- and lives. Ubiquitous mobile broadband is a big idea whose time has come.
