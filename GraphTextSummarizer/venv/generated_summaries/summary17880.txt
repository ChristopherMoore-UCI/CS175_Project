We prefer to avoid awkward scientific findings on the biology of violence that question our concepts of free will and punishment and harken back to the bad old days of eugenics and brain lobectomies. We can prevent violence by enhancing early brain development and reducing exposure to toxins. Better brains can make for better behavior for some, and a better future for all. All of these early influences impair brain structure and function, and they contribute to the brain impairments we find in criminals and psychopaths in later life. Omega-3 is a long-chain fatty acid critical for brain structure and function.
