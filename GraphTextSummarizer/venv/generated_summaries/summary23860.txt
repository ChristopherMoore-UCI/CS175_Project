In a proposal based on federal guidelines, Gallo asked teachers to work a longer school day of seven hours and tutor students weekly for one hour outside school time. The firings, which will be effective at the end of this school year, came after the district said it failed to reach an agreement with the teachers' union on a plan for the teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores. She proposed teachers have lunch with students often, meet for 90 minutes every week to discuss education and set aside two weeks during summer break for paid professional development. She added that "teachers have agreed to numerous solutions and reforms." George McLaughlin, a guidance counselor who was fired along with his wife, a chemistry teacher, said the school  has been inaccurately cast as a place with low graduation rates. One is called the transformation model, which includes a series of changes that teachers agree to adopt.
