A congressional source familiar with the investigation of the GSA told CNN on Thursday that the agency had an internal website with video clips and pictures from the Las Vegas conference. "I'll never be under OIG investigation." OIG refers to the Office of the Inspector General, who originally looked into the GSA's spending on a 2010 training conference held in Las Vegas. The revelations prompted GSA Administrator Martha Johnson to resign this week. It was a GSA deputy administrator who initially asked for the investigation, saying there was questionable spending for the 2010 event. The GSA employs nearly 13,000 people across the country and is the federal agency that buys and manages goods and services for the government, ranging from envelopes to real estate and office buildings.
