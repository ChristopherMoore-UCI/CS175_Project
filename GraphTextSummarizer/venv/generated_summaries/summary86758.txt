There are gaffes where candidates make statements that just sound wrong, raising questions about their intelligence and political acumen. Clinton clarified the comment, saying she and Bill Clinton were "obviously blessed" and that "I fully appreciate how hard life is so for many Americans today." The statement, meant to explain the propaganda that many Americans had been hearing, came across as someone who lived in the world of movies rather than the world of politics. There are also physical gaffes, which are less about what candidates say than about how they look. Her critics instantly jumped on the statement, pointing to these words as evidence that she was out of touch with average Americans.
