Hepatitis C is a viral disease that causes inflammation of the liver, which can lead to diminished liver function or liver failure. Dr. John Ward, director of the Division of Viral Hepatitis at the CDC, in a statement called this a "landmark advance in the treatment of hepatitis C, opening up new opportunities to stop the spread of this virus and the ravages of this disease. The CDC urges all U.S. baby boomers, and others at risk, to get tested for hepatitis C. "Widespread screening, together with new cures, promises to slash the burden of hepatitis C in this country and save thousands of lives," Ward said. It may take several years for symptoms to become apparent to individuals infected with hepatitis C. Most people with the disease have no symptoms until liver damage becomes apparent. " Chronic hepatitis C infection can lead to long-term health problems and even death, according to the CDC.
