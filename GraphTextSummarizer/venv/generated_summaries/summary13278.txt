Danville Police Chief Wade Parsons allegedly left his firearm, a .40-caliber Glock 22 pistol, on top of a safe in his bedroom closet on March 11, said Rockingham County Attorney Jim Reams. "But I hope it's a reminder to people in New Hampshire to make sure that children don't have unsupervised access to firearms. Reams said he hopes the tragedy will remind people of the importance of storing weapons properly. The maximum fine under the statute is $1,000, according to Reams' news release. This is the first time Reams has cited anyone with the violation in his 15 years as county attorney, he said.
