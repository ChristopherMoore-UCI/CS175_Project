CookingLight.com: Fat and Ground Beef At the Market • Inspection and grading: USDA inspectors examine all live animals and beef shipped out of state, which encompasses most of today's supermarket beef. When buying beef, we tend to stick to what we know, which may be why almost 60 percent of our beef dollars go for ground beef. • Natural and Organic: Beef labeled "natural" must not contain any artificial ingredients and cannot be more than minimally processed, such as ground beef. Advice to buy a side or quarter of beef may seem sensible, but you'll likely have more meat than you can store. The USDA defines "lean beef" as having less than 10 grams (g) of total fat, 4.5g or less of saturated fat, and less than 95 milligrams of cholesterol per 3½-ounce serving (100g) of cooked beef.
