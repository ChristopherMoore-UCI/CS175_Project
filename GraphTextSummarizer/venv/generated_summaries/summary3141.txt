The Africa Channel showcases English-language programs from across the continent, but Makawa appeared on the channel himself, most notably in 2007 interviewing Robert Mugabe. "[Until The Africa Channel] nobody had the audacity to basically say, 'I am going to grab a hold of this continent, put a nice bow around it and change the perception of this beloved continent in a classy, classy way,'" Makawa told CNN. " Makawa went on to work as a journalist in the U.S. for NBC and later was involved in distributing American TV shows to Africa. James Makawa wants Africa to be seen by the rest of the world in the best possible light. It was during this time that he discovered the diversity of stories in Africa that were not being told.
