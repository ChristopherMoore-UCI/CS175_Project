Third-bottom Blackburn have tested leaders Manchester United and Liverpool in recent weeks and kept alive hopes of staying up with a 2-0 win over Norwich on Saturday. It starts on Tuesday with the second leg of the Champions League semifinal away to Barcelona, then a home derby against QPR, the Newcastle game, two matches against Liverpool (the first of which being the FA Cup final) and finally a visit by Blackburn to Stamford Bridge. Meanwhile, Manchester United will seek to move closer to a 20th league title on Sunday at home to Everton, while City -- five points adrift -- travel to bottom club Wolverhampton. The result left Villa five points above the bottom three, but Bolton have a game in hand -- and have played two fewer matches than Wigan, Blackburn and QPR. We are fighting for our lives and fighting for Champions League football," Redknapp said.
