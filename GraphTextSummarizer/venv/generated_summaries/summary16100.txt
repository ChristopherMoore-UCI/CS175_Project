Vitamin D How it helps: According to a 2009 study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, people with low levels of this vitamin, which helps to regulate the immune system, are more susceptible to catching colds. Sleep How it helps: Sleep regulates the release of the hormone cortisol, which stimulates cells that boost the immune system, says Dr. William Ellert, chief medical officer of the Phoenix Baptist Hospital. Oral lozenges that contain the mineral, like those made by Cold-Eeze and Zicam, have been shown to decrease the duration of colds. How it helps: Research has shown that moderate exercise -- 30 to 90 minutes most days of the week -- increases immune function and reduces your chances of catching a cold. Good to know: If you drink a lot of milk; frequently eat fatty fish, like salmon; or live in a sunny climate, you are probably getting an adequate amount, says Ellert, since these all increase your body's stores of vitamin D.
