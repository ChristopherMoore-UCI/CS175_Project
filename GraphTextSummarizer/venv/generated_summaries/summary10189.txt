" Victims of sexual assault are three times more likely to suffer from depression and six times more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to RAINN. Every survivor responds differently to rape, says Jennifer Marsh, vice president of victim services for RAINN, the nation's largest anti-sexual-violence organization. This kind of personal persecution is a big fear for victims, says Becka Meier, a licensed professional counselor with the Women's Center, a large nonprofit crisis center in Fort Worth, Texas. A lot of that has to do with our culture: Marsh says she sees rape cases like the one in Steubenville every day that aren't taken seriously. it makes it all the more difficult for victims to come forward," Meier said.
