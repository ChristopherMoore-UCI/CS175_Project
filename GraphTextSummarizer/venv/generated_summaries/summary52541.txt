Just one day after Gen. James D. Thurman was installed as the head of the United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/United States Forces Korea, he visited the border between North and South Korea. Tensions have remained high on the peninsula since North Korea carried out two attacks on the South last year, killing 50 South Koreans. The new commander of U.S. forces in Korea stood just feet away from North Korean soldiers on Friday. Standing at an observation post overlooking North Korea, the general said, "I thought it very important that I come to the DMZ to observe first-hand the readiness levels and the training and the leadership of the ROK (Republic of Korea) military and U.S. participation As Thurman arrived at the truce village of Panmunjom and entered the building where the armistice that ended the Korean War was signed in 1953, North Korean soldiers, some with binoculars, watched through the windows from their side of the border, behind a simple concrete threshold.
