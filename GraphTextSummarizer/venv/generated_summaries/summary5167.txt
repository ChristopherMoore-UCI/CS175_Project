Democrats have a bit more hope in this Republican district, now that the upstart Democrat is up against an upstart Republican -- both of whom are professors at the same college. But his statement after the Republican primary results indicates he's a fast learner, as it echoed the message of national Democrats. That's because no one else wanted to run against Rep. Eric Cantor, the second most powerful Republican in the House. The 7th District is very conservative, with the Cook Political Report maintaining its political rating as solid Republican. But after Cantor's shocking defeat in his primary Tuesday against political novice Dave Brat, Trammell's candidacy has a whole new meaning.
