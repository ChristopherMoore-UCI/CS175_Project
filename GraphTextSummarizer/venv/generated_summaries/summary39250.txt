In Santa Rita do Sapucai, Mallmann says he has bigger dreams than having inmates powering street lamps. He is among a small group of inmates who have been given the chance to lower their sentences by exercising on customized stationary bikes attached to car batteries that charge as they pedal. Another recent program -- this one at the federal level -- allows inmates to reduce their sentence for reading books. Da Silva, the inmate at the Santa Rita do Sapucai prison, said at first the prison population didn't know what to make of the stationary bicycles, but estimates that now, some 80% of prisoners want to participate. Nearly half of Brazilian inmates -- 46% -- have not completed more than nine years of basic education, according to the ministry of justice.
