If anything is up for grabs in the Libya of the future, it could be service contracts to help the state oil company improve production from its existing fields and further exploration rights for gas. Libya's past oil production of about 1.6 million barrels per day was sold on contracts arranged by the National Oil Corporation (NOC)'s opaque oil marketing committee. Contrary to what some believe, it was not all about oil; but oil and gas will be central to Libya's recovery. In the two months since the Gadhafi regime fell, the NTC has brought oil production back up to 300-400,000 barrels per day. New exploration contracts could be issued: French and British companies could benefit.
