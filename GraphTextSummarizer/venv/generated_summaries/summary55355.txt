In 2011, he pleaded guilty to rape and robbery in another Philadelphia case and was sentenced to 15 years in state prison. In 2010, DNA testing linked him to the 1999 abduction and rape of an 18-year-old woman in Philadelphia, and he was sentenced to 7 to 15 years in prison for it. She was choked unconscious and raped for 27 minutes by inmate Omar Best, who had been convicted three times previously of sex-related crimes, and then been transferred from a different state prison for assaulting a female assistant there. The Pennsylvania state victim advocate said it's hypocritical to use victim-blaming as a defense for the prison. The Pennsylvania attorney general's office is blaming a former state prison clerk for her own rape, in response to a federal lawsuit the woman filed.
