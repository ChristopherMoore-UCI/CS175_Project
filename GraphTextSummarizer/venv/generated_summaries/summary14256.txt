Our network kicks ass, and now people can experience for themselves what a data-strong network can do with T-Mobile Test Drive." Since March 2013, T-Mobile has eliminated binding contracts and launched deals like Jump, which lets customers upgrade phones twice a year for a modest fee instead of once every two years. In fairness, similar rumors have swirled for several years. On Wednesday, the carrier also announced that it would let customers stream unlimited music via Pandora, Spotify and other services without it counting against their data plans. Through "T-Mobile Test Drive," curious consumers will get an iPhone 5S loaner and seven days of unlimited data to check out the service. But T-Mobile is handing out free iPhones, along with a trial run of its cellular service, in the latest in a string of unorthodox promotions for the No. 4 wireless carrier in the United States.
