Under the policy, women may end up being placed in infantry and Special Forces battalions and other front line combat units. -- On Thursday, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced that the Obama administration would allow women to be placed in positions that will expose them more directly to fighting with enemy ground forces. One study by the Congressional Research Service recommended that "women should be excluded from direct land combat units and positions." It is said that this will allow women to fill hundreds of thousands of combat roles from which they are currently excluded. The purpose of such units is to directly and physically engage enemy forces.
