Bynes, 27, was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold in late July after she was "involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood" in Thousand Oaks, California. -- Amanda Bynes is going to remain under medical care as legal control over her person and estate is temporarily handed to her mother, Lynn. In addition, she also has a DUI case pending in Southern California, while a pair of separate hit-and-run charges against her were dismissed last year.
