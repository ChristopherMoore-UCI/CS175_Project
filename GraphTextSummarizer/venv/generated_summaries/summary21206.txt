ISIS said it "cleansed" the northern border town of Azaz of more moderate fighters from the rebel Free Syrian Army in the past week because the rebels "received American Senator McCain and agreed with him to fight Islamists." Earlier this year, McCain made a surprise visit to this border region to lend support to Syrian rebels. Al Qaeda-linked militants justified their takeover of a strategic opposition-held town near the Syrian border with Turkey by accusing the Syrian rebels who held it of being pro-democracy traitors who cooperated with Western officials like U.S. Sen. John McCain. The U.S. State Department has used the gate for previous shipments of what it describes as "non-lethal aid" to Syrian rebels. FSA rebels have controlled Azaz and the Syrian side of the Oncupinar-Bab el Salama border crossing with Turkey since seizing the town from the government of President Bashar al-Assad last year. The ISIS statement included a sharp warning to members of the Syrian opposition who work with Western governments and organizations.
