Meanwhile, the Arab League will offer Syrian President Bashar al-Assad "a safe exit" if he resigns quickly and leaves the country, a senior Arab League official said, marking the latest attempt to get Syria's longtime ruler to step down. The three border crossings between Iraq and Syria were opened Monday to Syrian refugees, an Iraqi government spokesman said. If al-Assad were to leave, he would follow a series of longtime rulers in the region who have succumbed to popular revolts since last year, including former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, deposed Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who stepped down in a transfer-of-power deal. " Makdissi's remarks come after months of international chatter about whether foreign countries should intervene militarily to try to end more than a year of bloodshed in Syria. The United States will give Jordan $100 million in special economic aid to help ease the burden of hosting Syrian refugees, the U.S. Embassy in Jordan said Monday.
