" Instead, she's taken inspiration from '80s pop acts like Madonna, Phil Collins and Annie Lennox, and turned to producers and musicians like Max Martin and Fun.'s Jack Antonoff to help her shape what she calls her "blatant pop" sound. The 24-year-old singer/songwriter has long had one foot in country and the other in pop, sometimes to the chagrin of country fans. Along with her change in tune has come other shifts in Swift's life: She's moved to New York, has focused more on her friendships and has backed off dating (at least for now). "I feel like watching my dating life has become a bit of a national pastime, and I'm just not comfortable providing that kind of entertainment anymore," Swift told Rolling Stone. It's not as "boy-centric" as past releases, Swift explained -- basically because there haven't been any boys.
