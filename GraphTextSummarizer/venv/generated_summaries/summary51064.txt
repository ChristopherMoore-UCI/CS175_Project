Sheets, 23, of Ephraim, Wisconsin; Austin G. Anderson, 27; Stephen J. Luth, 22, of Muscatine, Iowa.

A spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board on Saturday said the pilot had been in contact with air traffic controllers, but there was no distress call. -- A recent Oral Roberts University graduate was the only one of five people en route to a Christian youth conference to survive a plane crash in southeastern Kansas, officials said Saturday.
