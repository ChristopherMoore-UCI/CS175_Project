The incident bore a striking resemblance to a previous bus crash in southeastern Pakistan last year, which killed a similar number of passengers. Traffic accidents are a major cause of death in Pakistan, with WHO data from 2013 suggesting that the death rate from road accidents was 17.4 per 100,000 of population. Shoaib Siddiqui, Commissioner of Karachi, told CNN that initial investigations suggest that the road condition was bad, and the oil tanker was traveling the wrong way on the national highway. At least 59 people were killed late Saturday in a fiery collision between a bus and an oil tanker near the southern port city of Karachi in Pakistan. Karachi's Jinnah Hospital has received 57 bodies, Semi Jamali, a doctor at the hospital, told CNN.
