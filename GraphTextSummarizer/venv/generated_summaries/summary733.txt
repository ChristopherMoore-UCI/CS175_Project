"In our cluster, these patients had to be hospitalized," she said, adding that such injections should be done by licensed health providers. Windslowe was arrested in March before she was about to host a "pumping party," at which people pay for illegal silicone injections, police said. Tan has heard reports of caulk and other products being used in the injections, as well as injection substances being purchased outside of medical supply stores, she said. Police said Aderotimi paid $1,800 for buttocks enhancements that were performed in a hotel room, then experienced chest pains shortly after the silicone injection and died a short time later. Underground cosmetic procedures have become a growing concern for health regulators.
