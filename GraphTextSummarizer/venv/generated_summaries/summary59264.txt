They have developed a system, called the Toll Index, to tap road toll data for indications of industrial production in Europe's biggest economy. -- Economists pore over central bank interest rate decisions, key retail numbers and consumer confidence figures for signs of economic health -- but could road toll collections also carry clues for the future? Nikolaus Askitas, the institute's chief technology officer, said they considered exploring river and rail transport for economic indicators but the trucking industry provided the best data. "[It's] the first forecast of the economy which is actually better than existing economic indicators," he said. The data -- which calculates the number of trips made across borders -- is then used by Zimmerman's team for economic forecasting.
