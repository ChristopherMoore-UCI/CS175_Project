"Hate crimes are down this year, almost 30%, but anti-gay hate crimes are up over 70%," Commissioner Ray Kelly said Tuesday, hours after the latest incident in which a gay couple walking in the city's SoHo district were assaulted by two men shouting homophobic slurs. The rash of violence has caught the attention of city leaders, including Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who addressed the issue at a news conference Tuesday. In the most violent incident, 32-year-old Marc Carson was shot and killed in Greenwich Village early Saturday by a gunman who allegedly made multiple anti-gay comments before the shooting. "Investigators say there's no pattern in these types of crimes," Kelly said Tuesday. After the march, New York City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn announced a five-point plan for keeping the city's LGBT residents safe.
