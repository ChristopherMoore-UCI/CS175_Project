Broward County Aviation Department spokesman Greg Meyer told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV that pieces of what appeared to be parts of the jet's damaged engine were recovered near the airport. All were rescheduled to take another flight to Minnesota later Sunday afternoon, said Delta spokesman Anthony Black. Black said Delta mechanics confirmed that parts of the twin-engine Boeing 737-800 had been damaged, though the spokesman did not know which ones. -- A commercial flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Minneapolis was aborted shortly after takeoff Sunday morning because of an indicator warning that one of the aircraft's engines had been damaged, according to airline officials. "Incidents like this are extremely rare, but the crew knows the protocol and it's clear the pilot took appropriate action," Black said.
