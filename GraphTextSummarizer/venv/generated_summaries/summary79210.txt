Acevedo was arrested earlier this year in the same Cleveland neighborhood where authorities found Amanda Berry, Georgina "Gina" DeJesus and Michelle Knight in May at Castro's two-story home. Elias Acevedo Sr., 49, was charged with 293 counts, including aggravated murder, rape and kidnapping, said Timothy McGinty, the Cuyahoga County prosecutor. -- A Cleveland man was indicted Thursday in the killings of two women, cases that were resurrected after the discovery of three women held captive for years by Ariel Castro. Last week, the FBI's Violent Crime Task Force linked Acevedo to the murder of Christina Adkins, who disappeared in 1995 at age 18, McGinty said. Castro, who pleaded guilty to 937 counts, was found hanged with a bedsheet in his jail cell on September 3.
