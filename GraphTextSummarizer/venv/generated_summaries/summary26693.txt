On Sunday, the Pentagon announced it transferred six Guantanamo Bay detainees to Uruguay for resettlement as refugees, a move which House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says should be reconsidered. But House Intelligence Committee member Adam Schiff, D-California, defended Hagel's decision to delay the authorization of the mission, citing his continued concerns over the timing of the prisoner release. The President has sought to close Guantanamo Bay since he took office in 2008 -- and issued an executive order to do so in 2009 -- but has faced fierce opposition from members of Congress, like Rogers, who allege that doing so is a threat to national security. Last week, the Obama administration suffered a huge setback in its attempt to close down the detention camp permanently when the House passed a $585 billion defense authorization bill excluding language that would have banned the transfer of any more prisoners to Guantanamo Bay, a stipulation the White House had sought. "I've been opposed to this notion that we're going to farm out Gitmo to places," Rogers told Candy Crowley on CNN's "State of the Union," noting most of the detainees sent to Uruguay are not originally from there.
