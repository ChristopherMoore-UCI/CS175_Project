The historian and reviewer was a movie fan even as a child growing up in New Jersey, and through the years -- whether coordinating programs for the Museum of Modern Art, teaching at Manhattan's New School or reviewing films for "Entertainment Tonight" -- he's always come back to the "Movie Guide," compiled with the assistance of reviewers such as Mike Clark, Pete Hammond and managing editor Darwyn Carson. In the digital age, the paper "Movie Guide," like former competitors such as Steven Scheuer's "Movies on TV" and Leslie Halliwell's "Film Guide," isn't as necessary when IMDb and Wikipedia (not to mention countless blogs) are at your fingertips. Oh, he's not retiring -- there will still be a "Classic Movie Guide," and he continues to review movies for his Indiewire blog and Reelzchannel. "Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide" -- originally "TV Movies" -- has been Maltin's claim to fame since he was a senior in high school. I said, "It's a magazine I publish for old movie buffs."
