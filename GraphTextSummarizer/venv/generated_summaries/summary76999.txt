Open to passengers holding Finnair's platinum and gold cards, the 407-square meter space is decorated with a variety of Finnish designed homeware from the likes of Marimekko, Iittala Ultima Thule and Eero Saarinen, while video projections reflect the time of day and season. Airline lounges are prime ways for airlines to promote their brand and showcase all the luxury and service frills they can muster, but with a traditional unisex sauna, Finnair has upped the ante. "Our aim was to create a high-quality, even emotional experience for Finnair's demanding clients," says designer Vertti Kivi. Finnair think you might like to and has backed the idea by adding a sauna to its new premium lounge in Helsinki Airport. Traditionally saunas in Finland are taken naked, but guests are "recommended" to use towels, states the airline.
