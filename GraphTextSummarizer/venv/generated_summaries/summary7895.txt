The Thai capital is on edge Wednesday as police brace for demonstrations over a bill to be presented in parliament that would grant amnesty to people jailed for acts committed during outbursts of political unrest in recent years. Thaksin left Thailand in 2008 after he was convicted of conflict of interest charges. Proposed by a lawmaker from the governing Pheu Thai party, the controversial bill would absolve protesters charged, prosecuted, and convicted for acts against the state since the military coup in September 2006 that brought down former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. The groups organizing demonstrations in opposition to the bill say they fear it could set the stage for Thaksin's return from exile. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is the current prime minister of Thailand.
