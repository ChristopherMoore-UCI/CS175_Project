Judge blocks restrictive North Dakota abortion law Like that North Dakota legislation, the Alabama law does not mention abortions being allowed in cases of rape or incest. "Republicans in the Alabama House believe that life begins at conception and that a heartbeat is evidence of a viable life that deserves to be defended." But Nikema Williams, an official with Planned Parenthood Southeast, sharply criticized the measure, including the so-called Fetal Heartbeat Act, which she noted would bar abortions "before some women even realize they are pregnant." "It's part of an extreme agenda to restrict all abortions under any circumstances in the state of Alabama," she said from Montgomery, one of five Alabama cities that have abortion clinics. Last year, North Dakota passed its own law to ban abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected -- much like one passed Tuesday, by an overwhelming 73-29 margin, by Alabama representatives. -- Alabama legislators passed several restrictive abortion bills this week, including one that could mean felony charge against any doctor performing such a procedure on a woman who'd been pregnant as little as six weeks.
