It was the second time in as many days that state media reported Kim's activities. -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il has been making the the rounds of major industrial facilities in the country's north, state-run media reported Thursday. South Korean media noted it was the first time since Kim reappeared in public October 4 -- after a hiatus of nearly 60 days -- that his activities have been reported two days in a row. State media reported Wednesday that Kim had visited a steel company and expressed "great satisfaction" with workers' efforts. The North has denied its leader was ever ill and state media has issued a series of reports portraying Kim as healthy and active.
