"The money was spent on what they call higher priority work," said TURN senior attorney Mike Florio. -- Pacific Gas & Electric planned in 2009 to replace a section of its gas pipeline just a couple of miles from the section that exploded last week in San Bruno, California, but never spent the $5 million of rate increases to do the work, a consumer watchdog group said Wednesday. In the filing documents -- provided by TURN -- the section of pipe to be replaced is identified as in the top 100 for highest risks of failure. "Coupled with the consequences of failure of this section of pipeline, the likelihood of a failure makes the risk of a failure at this location unacceptably high," the company said in that filing. But the company did not explain why it needed an additional $5 million and three years to complete repairs on a section it said in its most recent rate filing was in the top 100 risks for failure.
