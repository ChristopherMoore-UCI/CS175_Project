Without the waiver, Dompierre wouldn't be able to play sports next school year, he said. Dompierre has played sports with other children in Ishpeming since he was in elementary school. When he got to high school, Eric Dompierre was invited to keep playing. " "He's doing it because he loves me, because he just wants to watch me play sports in my last year," Eric Dompierre said. Eric's father, Dean Dompierre, told CNN that he hopes other states will follow Michigan's lead in offering an exception to sports age limits for students with disabilities.
