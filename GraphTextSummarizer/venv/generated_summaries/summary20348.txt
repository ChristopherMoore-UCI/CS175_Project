Now I have to shop there knowing I dare not go near certain clothes because, well,  this is how a very attractive, older J.Crew lady put it: "In my 20's, I wore rollneck sweaters with short shorts. Oprah.com, way back in 2010, helpfully pointed out "women of a certain age" should NEVER wear mini-skirts with Uggs, never expose their stomach, never, never wear tube tops, absolutely no shredded denim and, for goodness sakes, no neon nail polish because "as you age, skin gets more sallow." J.Crew is the latest to inform me, that at my advanced age, short shorts are not for me. But, then again, J.Crew isn't alone when it comes to schooling older ladies on what they should or shouldn't bare. So, please, fashion mags, clothing stores and Hollywood, stop with the "how to dress in your 20s, 30s, 40s and beyond" nonsense.
