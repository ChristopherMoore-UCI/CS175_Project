Authorities arrested businessman and stockbroker Mark Hotton at his Long Island home Monday morning on charges of defrauding Broadway producers and a Connecticut-based real estate company in two separate ruses, the U.S. district attorney in Manhattan and the FBI said in a news release. From September 2011 to October 2012, Hotton created fake investors and businesses to fool producers of "Rebecca: The Musical," the release said. But when producers started pressing Hotton for the money, Hotton told them Paul Abrams had suddenly died of malaria, Sprecher said. Hotton claimed to have secured the $4.5 million from four investors, identified in the news release as Paul Abrams of Hawthorne, East Victoria; Roger Thomas of St. Peter Port, Guernsey; Julian Spencer of Crocker Hill, Chichester, Sussex; and Walter Timmons of London. The "Rebecca" producers were introduced to Hotton through the investment community in February 2012, when they had fallen about $4 million short of their budget, producer Ben Sprecher told CNN Tuesday.
