As a result, Millennials I know have become disillusioned about national political change, turned to local politics and community engagement instead and focused on getting through tough times. We can't build a moral economy or health care system without considering the major social challenges of our time: civil liberties, immigration, women's rights, domestic extremism and climate change. The debate was supposed to be about domestic issues, but focused exclusively on economic policies and health care plans. I believe that Millennials can be critical of the political process and still have faith that incremental change is possible if we organize before and after Election Day. As a Millennial, or a member of the generation born in the 1980s and 1990s, I care deeply about the economy and health care.
