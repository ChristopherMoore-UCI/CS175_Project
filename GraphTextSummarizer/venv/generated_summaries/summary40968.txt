The local organizing committee for the tournament, the Supreme Committee for Qatar 22, and the company it appointed to help oversee World Cup construction, CH2M HILL, have said they will establish labor standards that builders and other contractors hired to build World Cup venues must meet. The report seeks to address apparent concerns over worker safety in Qatar's construction industry and claims that discrepancies exist between the number of construction worker deaths reported by local embassies and the number reported by the government. Human Rights Watch (HRW) has compiled a 146-page report -- "Building a better World Cup: Protecting migrant workers" -- examining Qatar's recruitment and employment system, where 94% of its workforce are migrant workers. A leading humanitarian organization has urged soccer's ruling body FIFA and the Qatari government to honor their commitment to reform employment laws for migrant workers ahead of the 2022 World Cup, amid fears that stadiums will be built using an exploited labor force. Those commitments are a beginning, HRW says, but it wants additional steps, including minimum employee standards in line with Qatari law and international labor standards for private contractors involved in World Cup-related construction.
