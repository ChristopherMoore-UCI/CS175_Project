In February, President Barack Obama launched an initiative to provide educational and community support for African-American boys and young men, an issue he said "goes to the very heart of why I ran for president." In light of the death of Michael Brown -- the unarmed African-American teen who was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in August -- Obama said that the country is now "awakened" to a reality that a "gulf of mistrust" exists between African-Americans and law enforcement officials in communities throughout the country. Obama also thanked Attorney General Eric Holder, who announced his retirement last week, for his continued effort to improve race relations and advance civil rights. "We still have to close the opportunity gaps, and we have to close the justice gap -- how justice is applied, but also what is perceived, how it is experienced," Obama said at a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation event in Washington on Saturday. Obama's remarks came at the end of a four-day annual legislative conference sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, a nonprofit institute that supports the policy positions of the Congressional Black Caucus.
