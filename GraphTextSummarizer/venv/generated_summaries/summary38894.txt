Europe take narrow lead after first day Morgan Pressel and Cristie Kerr defeated Suzann Pettersen and Caroline Hedwall by one hole, Stacy Lewis and Ryann O'Toole triumphed 2&1 against Sandra Gal and Christel Boeljon, while Paula Creamer and Brittany Lincicome were 3&1 victors over Maria Hjorth and Azahara Munoz. Former U.S. Open champion Creamer will take on Catriona Matthew as she seeks to remain unbeaten, having played in all this year's matches. Having sat out the foursomes, Davies and Melissa Bell beat Michelle Wie and Brittany Lang 4&3 "We are all so pumped up and it is great to be back tied," Creamer said. Britain's Laura Davies will take on fellow veteran Juli Inkster in one of the key clashes, with the Englishwoman confident after overtaking Annika Sorenstam as the Solheim Cup's record points scorer.
