By the time Dykstra filed for bankruptcy in July 2009, he had accumulated loans totaling $21 million, bankruptcy records show. With these federal convictions, Mr. Dykstra's fraud and deceit have been exposed for all to see," U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. in Los Angeles said in a statement. -- Three-time Major League all-star outfielder Lenny Dykstra, who amassed a fortune in professional baseball and financial advising, pleaded guilty Friday to bankruptcy fraud and other federal charges, authorities announced. Dykstra was also accused of confiscating a $50,000 custom sink and allegedly receiving cash at a Los Angeles consignment store for other personal items and fixtures taken from the mansion, according to the complaint. "At one time, Mr. Dykstra inspired Americans but later, sadly, he chose to defraud his fellow Americans and the United States government," Timothy Delaney, the FBI's acting assistant director in charge in Los Angeles, said in a statement.
