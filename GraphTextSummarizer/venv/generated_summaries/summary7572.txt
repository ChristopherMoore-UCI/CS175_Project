Dow cited a 2008 survey in which 28% of air travelers said they avoided at least one trip because of the hassles of air travel, which included aviation congestion and passenger screening. Passengers typically say they forgot the weapon was in their bag, TSA officials said. "TSA is spending more money each year to screen the same amount of passengers." Federal airport screeners still find four to five guns at checkpoints on a typical day, the Transportation Security Administration's chief told a Senate hearing Wednesday. More than 900 guns have been recovered at checkpoints this year, the TSA says.
