While fighting bulls, matador Joselito Ortega will use capes embroidered with the words "Gay Up," the name of the energy drink. " "The cape is a sacred thing," said Vazquez, adding that it's fine for premier bullfighters -- who are treated like rock stars -- to have lucrative endorsement deals for products, but only outside of the ring. Bull breeder Juan Pedro Domecq Morenes welcomed the change, saying it might help revive Spain's billion-dollar bullfighting industry, which he said in recent years has seen a 45 percent decline in the number of fights, especially in smaller village bullrings. But that lasted just one or two fights," recalls Curro Vazquez, a former bullfighter who now manages one of Spain's top-tier matadors, Cayetano Rivero Ordonez. "Ortega is a new bullfighter and he might see this as a way to get known," Vazquez said.
