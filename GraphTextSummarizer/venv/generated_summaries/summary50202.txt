For rooted Android phones, there are unauthorized apps called Wireless Tether and Barnacle, which offer free hotspot utilities. The most recent U.S. iPhones (the 3GS and the iPhone 4, when upgraded to the latest version of iOS) and the vast majority of Android smartphones now officially support wireless-hotspot capability, which turns the handset into a Wi-Fi connection that can be shared with multiple devices, including the iPad 2. It turns out that if you hotspot with an iPhone, the connection transfers the GPS to the iPad. Just connect the iPad to the iPhone's hotspot, then launch the Maps app, and you'll see the blue dot tracking your location. For Android phones, you just have to root (aka jailbreak) the device with a tool called Unrevoked.
