Several European cities saw similar protests. To make their point, hundreds of drivers took their black cabs into central London for a horn-tooting drive around Trafalgar Square and past the UK's Houses of Parliament, bringing traffic to a standstill. "The long and the short of it is, allowing [a company like Uber] to come in and say they're a tech company, that they don't want to be licensed ... is not fair," said Steve Garelick, a union official representing licensed London taxi drivers. Its founder, Travis Kalanick, told CNN he often sees a backlash in cities where it gains market clout. In France there were reports of taxis blockading roads in Paris and other cities.
