Hundreds died in clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsy supporters in the weeks which followed his ouster. The second session in the trial is due February 1, after a hearing last week was postponed when bad weather prevented Morsy from being brought by helicopter to court. Muslim Brotherhood members have continued their protests, even though the government declared the group a terrorist organization last month. Detractors said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values, but Morsy's supporters say that the military has returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler Hosni Mubarak, who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011. Morsy has said he doesn't recognize the court's authority, claiming he still is Egypt's legitimate President.
