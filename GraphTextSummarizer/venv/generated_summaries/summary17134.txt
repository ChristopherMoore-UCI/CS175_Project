Castro held on $8 million bond Berry then crossed the street with her child, 6-year-old Jocelyn, and went to the house of Altagracia Tejeda, the neighbor Cordero had been visiting, where she called 911. The woman, later identified as Amanda Berry, apparently was making reference to the owner of the house, whom police have identified as Ariel Castro, and who has been charged in the case. But Ramsey showed up after Berry had already escaped, according to Cordero. Once police arrived and began talking with Berry, the girl, dressed only in diapers and a T-shirt, began screaming, he said. "One of the women I was with told me that something was happening in front of the house," Angel Cordero, 32, said on CNN's "Piers Morgan Live" on Wednesday.
