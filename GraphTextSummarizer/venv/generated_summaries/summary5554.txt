In the Armenian village of Lichk, you will find many hard-working women, but you will not find many men. Pebrel stayed with Anoush and Ruzanna, two sisters-in-law who lived together with their families while their husbands worked in Russia. Look under the shade of a cool brick wall, and you can find the older generation wearing caps and denim as they tell stories and play cards on splintery wooden tables. Because of the poor economic situation of this village, 90% of its working-age men have left for better-paying construction jobs in Russia. But by the end, they acknowledged that while most of the women in the town do trust their husbands, there is still an underlying fear that the men may lead a secret life in Russia.
