Watch YouTube video of revelers in Tehran shouting "death to the dictator" Iran has been wracked by anti-government demonstrations since the disputed June 12 presidential vote that resulted in the re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Six protesters who were arrested in December on the Muslim holiday of Ashura were sentenced to death on Monday, the day before Chaharshanbe Soori, the semi-official Fars News Agency reported Monday. Eyewitnesses in Iran said thousands of riot police and security officers lined the streets of the capital, Tehran, and patrolled major intersections on motorcycles and on foot Monday night. Thousands of people turned out, some in groups as large as 400 people, to dance, listen to music and light bonfires in side streets around Tehran on the festival of Chaharshanbe Soori. A video posted on YouTube showed what the poster said was an anti-government protest in another Tehran neighborhood, where protesters could be heard chanting "Death to the dictator." Earlier in the week, the chief prosecutor in the eastern city of Mashad warned that those who engaged in "disruptive behavior" during Chaharshanbe Soori would face "strong consequences."
