Efforts to register Spanish speakers are further complicated by technical problems on Obamacare-related websites, worries that information might be used for deportation purposes, problems verifying income, and a digital divide among those who might not have ready access to a computer said Alejandra Gepp, associate director of La Raza's Institute for Hispanic Health. " But when Spanish speakers want to sign up for Obamacare in their own language, they face problems. Unlike their English speaking counterparts, Spanish speakers still cannot shop for insurance plans on the website. The administration says it does not yet have figures on the number Spanish speakers who have enrolled in Obamacare thus far or a breakdown of those enrollments by state. This means Spanish speakers have a much shorter window to browse online to make health care choices before the March 31 deadline for enrollment.
