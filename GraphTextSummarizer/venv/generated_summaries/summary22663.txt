"The North Korean leadership must know that any further provocations will be dealt with swiftly and decisively." North Korea's Korean Central News Agency, meanwhile, cited an article in the North's ruling party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, that said the South Korean government is trying to escalate a confrontation with North Korea. North Korea invaded the South in 1950 to achieve its goal of Korean unification under communist rule. South Korea blames North Korea for the sinking, which left 46 people dead, but Pyongyang hotly denies the claim. -- North and South Korea marked the 60th anniversary of the Korean War with sober commemorations and sharp rhetoric as tensions continued to ripple between the two countries over the sinking in March of a South Korean warship. At a national ceremony on Friday commemorating the start of the war, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak urged North Korea to stop what he says are military provocations.
