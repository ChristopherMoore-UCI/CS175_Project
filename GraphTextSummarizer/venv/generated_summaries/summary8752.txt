" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, has weighed in: "We have a weak and indecisive President that invites aggression," as did Rep. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas: "Emboldened by President Obama's trembling inaction, Vladimir Putin has invaded the Crimea region of Ukraine." The ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, called for immediate sanctions against Russia--but the Treasury Department under Obama's direction was already drafting a package of stiff sanctions. Because, they allege, it's because Obama has been so weak for five years that Putin thought he could get away with invading Ukraine. He's given them a new excuse to bash President Obama." I'm not saying Republicans are pro-Putin or that they want him to invade Ukraine.
