"Colgan's actions in assigning flight crew members and flight attendants to duties in scheduled air transportation without required rest ... were careless or reckless so as to endanger the lives and property of others," writes Christian Lewerenz, an attorney for the FAA in the letter to Colgan. The FAA in December announced new pilot flight, duty and rest rules that will go into effect in December 2013. In a letter to the airline released Friday, the FAA lays out 17 instances in which pilots or flight attendants flew without the required amount of off-duty rest time. The FAA says that between June 14, 2008, and February 23, 2009, Colgan scheduled flight duty time for two captains, two first officers and six flight attendants on a seventh day after they had been on duty for the previous six days. The FAA said one of the captains operated four flights without adequate rest.
