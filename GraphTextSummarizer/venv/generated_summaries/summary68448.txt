The memristor technology is a candidate for this crucial step: "It could mean the end of the silicon era, giving us lower power consumption, the ability  to compute more information, increased data storage and completely new logic patterns for our computers," says Rupp. At the moment, manufacturing costs are still high, but the benefits are worth it: "Memristors operate at a lower power consumption, with a faster speed, and with a higher volume density of information than anything we have based on silicon microchip transistors," Rupp told CNN. This can pave the way for computers that will instantly turn on and off like a light bulb and never lose data: the RAM, or memory, will no longer be erased when the machine is turned off, without the need to save anything to hard drives as with current technology. Initially, the technology will be mostly used to create super-fast memory chips that contain more data and consume less energy. It is inevitable that, one day, we will need to move away from silicon based computing.
