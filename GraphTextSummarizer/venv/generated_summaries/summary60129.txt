Despite Mayweather being a heavy favorite, Cotto's close friend and manager, Bryan Perez, told Fight Hype last month that Team Cotto had devised a "blueprint" for beating Mayweather and that he hadn't seen Cotto this motivated in "many, many fights. In a recent appearance on Kellerman's HBO show, Mayweather called Cotto "solid" and "one of the best fighters out there." Cotto will need something special if he's to hand Mayweather his first loss, Kellerman said. Those circumstances are what prompted Mayweather's remark that Cotto was undefeated. Cotto has lost twice in his professional career, once against eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao, in which Pacquiao made Cotto drop weight, and another against Antonio Margarito, who was suspended for a year after a subsequent fight against Mosley when officials found plaster in his hand wraps.
