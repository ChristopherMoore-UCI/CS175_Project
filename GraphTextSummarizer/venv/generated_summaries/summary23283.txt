Today there are tire designs that contain up to 200 raw materials, as well as complex architecture of steel belts, textile piles and computer designed tread patterns, which deliver maximum traction under all conditions.

Tread designs are tested for traction in "virtual reality" before they are molded into the rubber. The major component in tires is rubber.
