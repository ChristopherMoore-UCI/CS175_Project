British media outlets said Cafferkey is a public health nurse in Scotland's South Lanarkshire area who was part of a 30-strong team of medical volunteers deployed to West Africa by the UK government last month in a joint endeavor with Save the Children. London's Royal Free Hospital announced Saturday that "Pauline Cafferkey has been discharged from the Royal Free following her recovery from Ebola. " Cafferkey contracted Ebola while working with Save the Children at an Ebola treatment center, according to Michael von Bertele, humanitarian director at that organization. " On December 29, the 39-year-old Glasgow, Scotland, resident became the first person to be diagnosed with the virus on UK soil shortly after returning from Sierra Leone. As she got treatment there, Save the Children said that it was "doing everything possible" to establish how Cafferkey contracted Ebola and had been conducting a review since she was confirmed as having the virus.
