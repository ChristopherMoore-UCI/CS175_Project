-- India's federal police have arrested two senior officials involved in organizing last year's troubled Commonwealth Games in New Delhi for suspected corruption. India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing allegations of massive corruption in the conduct of the Commonwealth Games of last year in New Delhi, had earlier arrested four other committee officials. Bhanot and Verma are seen as close aides of Suresh Kalmadi, India's chief organizer of the sporting event that attracted international headlines for alleged scams and messy preparations. Politicians, bureaucrats, officials and company executives linked to probes have denied any wrongdoing. They have been held for a suspected over-priced purchase of a timing, scoring and result systems from a Swiss company, federal police spokesman R. K. Gaur said.
