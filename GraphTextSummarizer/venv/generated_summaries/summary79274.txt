That shouldn't be a problem for U.S. PGA Tour rookie Erik Compton. " Compton had been toiling on the second-tier Nationwide Tour, but victory at the Mexico Open helped him finish 13th on the money list and secured his place for 2012 alongside stars such as Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. " In 2009 Compton received the Ben Hogan Award, for courage, presented to him by golfing legend Jack Nicklaus, and after two steady seasons he clinched his PGA Tour place with that momentous win in Mexico. By 1998 Compton was ranked as the top junior in the United States, competing against -- and beating -- the likes of 2008 Masters champion Trevor Immelman and current world number six Adam Scott. " Compton's desire to fulfill his dream of qualifying for a PGA Tour card helped to energize his recovery, as did the birth of his first child -- another miracle given that doctors had been unsure if he'd be able to have kids due to the medication he has taken all his life.
