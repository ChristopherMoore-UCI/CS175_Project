Four mortars struck the Kerem Shalom humanitarian-aid crossing on the tip of southern Gaza, forcing authorities to shut it down and prevent 70 trucks carrying fuel and other aid from entering the strip, she added. Israel routinely targets the Rafah tunnels under the Gaza-Egypt border, which it says Hamas uses to smuggle weapons into Palestinian territory. Palestinians say the tunnels are needed to get basic food supplies that are not available in Gaza. The sources said a secret metal shop used to make Qassam rockets was hit in Gaza City. Qassam rockets are homemade projectiles that have been fired into communities in southern Israel for years.
