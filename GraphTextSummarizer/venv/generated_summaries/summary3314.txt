Governor McCrory should keep the promise he made to North Carolina women during his campaign and veto the bill sent to him today by the legislature," Cecile Richards, president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement. I want to thank those who worked on an improved bill which will better protect women while not further limiting access," McCrory said after the House bill passed. -- North Carolina's Senate passed a restrictive abortion bill Thursday, and it now heads to Gov. Pat McCrory, who is expected to sign it. "This bill would take women back 40 years, and we won't go back," she said. The bill would place requirements on clinics that family planning advocates say would make it hard for them to stay in business.
