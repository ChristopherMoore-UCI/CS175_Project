The violence stems from the transfer of prisoners from local institutions to federal lockups in other states, the government-run Agencia Brasil news outlet reported, citing Rio de Janeiro Public Security Secretary Jose Mariano Beltrame. "I called the justice minister and told him to attend to Rio de Janeiro with whatever he needs," Lula told CNN affiliate TV Record. Officials are concerned about crime in Brazil as the nation prepares to host the 2014 World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 Summer Olympics, which will be held in Rio. The security chief also said he mobilized all police in the city to try to restore order and to step up police presence in 17 of Rio's slums. The attacks also came as a result of police trying to remove some drug gang members from Rio's slums, called favelas.
