A draw would leave Los Blancos in pole position to reclaim the La Liga crown after four years but assistant coach Aitor Karanka said they would approach the heavyweight clash in positive fashion. -- Arch rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid meet for the sixth time this season Saturday in an El Clasico clash which is likely to decide the destination of the Spanish title. Radnedge believes Mourinho will be making La Liga success for his team a priority, even over the Champions League crown. By contrast, Pep Guardiola's Barcelona have mounted a late charge with 11 straight La Liga wins with Lionel Messi in free scoring form with 18 goals in that run. Since taking charge at the Bernabeu in the summer of 2010 his team has only beaten Barcelona once in 10 attempts, the final of the Copa Del Rey last season with Ronaldo scoring the winner in extra time.
