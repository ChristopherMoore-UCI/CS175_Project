"Right now I can definitely tell my grandkids, I kicked the butt of Roger Federer," Stakhovsky told reporters following his sensational victory. -- Roger Federer, the seven-time Wimbledon champion, suffered one of the most staggering defeats in the history of the tournament after being beaten by Ukraine's 116th ranked Sergiy Stakhovsky. Then tomorrow is going to be a long day to think about Andy." Elsewhere, former champion Hewitt was ousted in by Dustin Brown 6-4 6-4 6-7 6-2, while there were also wins for Spain's Nicolas Almagro, Austria's Jurgen Melzer and Argentina's Juan Monaco. "I struggled maybe on the big points this time around again, like I have for some time this season," Federer said of his clash with Stakhovsky. Federer will now drop out of the top four for the first time since he won Wimbledon in 2003 and could fall as low as No.6 should Tomas Berdych win this year's title.
