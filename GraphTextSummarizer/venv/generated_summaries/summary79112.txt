Dr. Michael Kamrava demonstrated "a pattern of behavior that violated the group's standards," American Society for Reproductive Medicine spokesman Sean Tipton said. Nadya Suleman gave birth to eight babies after being implanted with six embryos by Dr. Michael Kamrava. Doctors say giving birth to extreme multiples comes with tremendous risks for the mother and the babies. The expulsion, which was imposed last month and just announced, does not affect Kamrava's ability to practice, because affiliation with the professional association is voluntary. Suleman, in an interview in February on NBC, said Kamrava told her about risks for the children, but she did not want to have only one or two embryos implanted.
