"As a rule, children in gay families are surrounded by care, attention and respect," one of the women tells me. Tanya Lokshina from Human Rights Watch says the existing gay propaganda law already has the potential to criminalize gay parents. In 2013 lawmaker Alexei Zhuravlyov proposed a new law that would strip gay people with children of their parenting rights. The legislation makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. The bill triggered fears the government was about to start taking children from their parents, but stalled in Russia's parliament.
