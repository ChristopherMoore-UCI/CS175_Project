Seattle-based architect Matthew Coates and James Green, a British aircraft structural engineer, joined forces just over a year ago to build on Green's original idea for incorporating shipping containers within a bespoke steel shell. Coates, who specializes in sustainable design, was familiar with recent innovations in container housing, he says, but Green's idea immediately stood out. He points to the successes already achieved in this area by New York architectural firm LOT-EK -- one of the pioneers of container housing -- and Jennifer Siegal, founder of the Los Angeles-based Office of Mobile Design. " Green hopes Eco-Pak will change the "living in a box" perception of shipping containers at a price which won't break the bank. The containers form part of the foundation for the building, Green says, as well as being a building block that aids the quick and easy assembly of the frame around it.
