Farah told Mother Jones magazine in 2007 that according to his multiple passports, Bout was born in 1967 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the son of a bookkeeper and an auto mechanic. Most of those flights -- estimated in the hundreds -- occurred after then-President George W. Bush had signed an executive order making it illegal to do business with Bout because he represented a security threat to the United States, Farah told Mother Jones. In addition, Bout approached the CIA and the FBI through an intermediary just after the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, offering to help oust the Taliban if paid tens of millions, Farah told Mother Jones. Much of what Bout is alleged to have done is morally reprehensible, but not illegal, Farah said, noting there are no penalties for violating UN weapons sanctions. For one thing, they have his family, which is "considerable leverage" -- Bout is widely known to be a family man, Farah wrote in August in Foreign Policy magazine.
