Barcelona have been in indifferent recent form and a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday saw them drop behind arch-rivals Real Madrid at the top of the Spanish La Liga. Barcelona must avoid defeat which could see them make a sensational exit if Russian surprise package Rubin Kazan beat Dynamo Kiev in the other match in Group F. "This game will be a test of character for my players," Mourinho told reporters after his side's 3-1 win over Bologna on Saturday. Barca will certainly want the key pair to be fit for next Sunday's El Clasico against Real, but first comes a European test against Jose Mourinho's Italian league-leaders. They will also welcome back Wesley Sneijder, who has recovered from an ankle injury and will field Samuel Eto'o in attack as he returns to the Camp Nou for the first time since his close season transfer switch between the European powerhouses.
