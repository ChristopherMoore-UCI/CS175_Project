Best known for launching the 1970's all-girl punk rock band the Runaways, producer and manager Kim Fowley has died. " In recent times, Billboard Magazine reported that Fowley was suffering from bladder cancer and "in an interesting turn of events, former Runaways singer Cherie Curie cared for Fowley during his fight with cancer. "With a career in the music business spanning over fifty years, Fowley was a singularly unique figure in the realms of rock history. " Fowley worked with a wide range of artists, including Paul Revere and the Raiders, the Modern Lovers, Blue Cheer, Kiss and Helen Reddy. "It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Kim Fowley," independent music publisher Peer Music announced on its website Thursday.
