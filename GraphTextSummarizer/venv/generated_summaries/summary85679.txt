It takes less than 10 minutes in her company to see that for Abramovic, art and life are one thing. Even so, what makes people from all walks of life, as seen in New York, wait for hours just to be in her presence? Entitled 512 Hours, the exhibition will see Abramovic in residence at the Serpentine Gallery for 64 days, spending eight hours a day with no breaks trying to create art out of nothing. It seems that at a time when the pace of life threatens to engulf us, Marina Abramovic wants us to slow down and live in the present. "When we grow older we lose that connection with other people, and Marina helps us regain it through her." In a career spanning over 40 years, Abramovic has constantly challenged the notions of what art should be, using her body as an instrument, and sometimes risking her life in the process.
