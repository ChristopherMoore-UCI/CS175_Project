If we do not get our priorities right now -- and properly make the case for rebalancing military and humanitarian expenditure in Syria -- then there is every reason to believe the much-needed cash for humanitarian assistance will dry up once the United States declares victory over ISIS and turns its attention elsewhere. Indeed, only last month, Congress approved roughly $500 million to train moderate Syrian rebels, the same amount set aside for additional humanitarian assistance. According to the State Department, this brings the total amount of U.S. humanitarian aid to $2.9 billion since March 2011 â€” or about $700 million per year, $60 million a month or $14 million per week. Take, for example, the State Department's recent announcement that it will provide an additional almost $500 million in humanitarian aid to help those affected by the war in Syria. Expanding the air war to Syria will substantially increase those expenditures, to as much as $100 million per week, according to some analysts.
