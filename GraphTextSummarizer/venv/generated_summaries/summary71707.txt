-- Former President Jimmy Carter predicted that Republicans' obstructionist ways should change and President Obama's re-election prospects could improve after next week's midterm elections. Carter praised Obama for doing "an extraordinary job" despite numerous challenges, including an environment in which most every move he made, even if it had once been championed by Republicans, faced immediate opposition. If and when Republicans engage the White House after voters hit the polls on November 2, Obama may be more able to engage them as well as voters in drawing a clear distinction between himself and his opponents, Carter said. Speaking Wednesday on HLN's "The Joy Behar Show," Carter said the Republican party has been "completely irresponsible" in the past 18 months by opposing most legislative initiatives backed by Obama and his fellow Democrats. " A devout Christian and longtime Sunday school teacher, Carter also addressed recent comments from Republican senatorial candidates Sharron Angle of Nevada and Christine O'Donnell of Delaware talking openly about religion on the campaign trail.
