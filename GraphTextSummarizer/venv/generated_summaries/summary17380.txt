Kennedy, also former wife of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, faces a charge of driving while intoxicated, accused of driving erratically and striking a tractor-trailer on the morning of July 13, 2012, on an interstate in Westchester. Among her supporters were brothers Robert Jr. and Douglas Kennedy, and their mother Ethel Kennedy, 85, who was pushed in a wheelchair inside the Westchester County Courthouse in White Plains. -- Jurors in the DWI trial of Kerry Kennedy, daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, on Monday watched the seemingly disoriented defendant allegedly failing three sobriety tests on video recorded by a police vehicle dashboard camera after her July 2012 accident in New York. The prosecution will continue its case Tuesday morning with the testimony of a New York State Police trooper trained as a drug-recognition expert. Kennedy claims she took the medication accidentally when she mixed up medicine bottles.
