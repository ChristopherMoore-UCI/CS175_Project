Bernie Sanders, my Vermont senator and, indeed, a friend of many years, is now running for president. He has been one of only a few voices in the Senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right-wing factions funded by "millionaires and billionaires" (one of Bernie's favorite mantras) have held sway over American politics for as long as anyone can recall. And it's working people who seem mostly to interest Bernie Sanders. By proclaiming himself a socialist, he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks, many with international bases, have controlled American public policy for a very long time, usually to the detriment of working people.
