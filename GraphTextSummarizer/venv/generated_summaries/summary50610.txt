" Olympic memories Klimke's appearance in London will be her fourth Olympics, having competed in Sydney, Athens and Beijing, but her gold at the Games in China was her first. "The Olympics is the thing I grew up with and that's why I keep going with my next generation of horses, hoping one of them will be able to follow in Braxx's footsteps. And eight years later Ingrid became the second Klimke to clinch a gold medal when she was part of the German three-day eventing team that triumphed at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Klimke has now competed in three Olympics and has also claimed a host of domestic and international titles over a 21-year career in the sport. In 1960 he took part at the Olympics in Rome as an eventer, but then afterward he started doing dressage," she said.
