Attendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the MDC and the Mugabe's ZANU-PF. A third member -- Elton Mangoma -- escaped an arrest attempt when other party members came to his rescue, MDC officials said. MDC party spokesman Nelson Chamisa said all MDC members elected to parliament were expected to attend "except those few MPs who are still in hiding. Themba-Nyathi represented the splinter MDC faction led by Arthur Mutambara, but he had support of President Robert Mugabe's ZANU-PF party. An MDC official said the arrests were part of the "sinister agenda of this regime" to "tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament."
