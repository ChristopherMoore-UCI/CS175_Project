Google has to rely on roundabout ways to get data for ad targeting. If Google's +1 does lead to a larger number of Google Profiles, Google will have even more personal and demographic data than it currently does about web users. In short, Google needs other ways to gather data to target ads, and it needs huge amounts of this data very quickly. If Google could get more profiles, it could increase the accuracy of its targeting beyond keywords and browsing data, potentially matching Facebook's level of personal relevance. As you can see from the chart below, Google has a lot to worry about when it comes to competing with Facebook for ad dollars.
