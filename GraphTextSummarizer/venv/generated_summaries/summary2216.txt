Similarly, French voters typically take little notice of allegations of infidelility, which are much less likely to derail a political career in France than in America -- though in Strauss-Kahn's case, the sheer volume of accusations seems to have stymied his ambitions, especially with the election this month of Hollande as French president. Just last year, Dominique Gaston Andre Strauss-Kahn was head of the powerful IMF and the presumptive front-runner for the presidency of France. In May police French prosecutors have widened the investigation, opening a preliminary inquiry into acts that allegedly took place in Washington, which they believe could constitute gang rape. Strauss-Kahn was a force in French politics for a quarter-century, first winning election to that country's National Assembly -- the lower house of parliament -- in 1986. To the extent that there was a perceived conflict between his socialist political ideals and wealthy lifestyle, it wasn't an issue for most French voters, said Simon Serfaty, a senior European analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
