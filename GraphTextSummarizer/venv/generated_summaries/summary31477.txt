Afshar says the vest could even be used to manipulate emotional states, like calming the wearer down or getting them excited. Afshar recently used it to listen to Bach and experience classical music in a new way. Vibrations in the body make the brain interpret experiences as more immediate, as if they're really happening to them and not just taking place on a screen, according to Afshar. "I thought, 'They're enjoying something in the bass, go about it as a scientist,'" said Afshar, who also has a background in neuroscience. After much research, Afshar launched a Kickstarter campaign, which raised $183,000 (245% of its goal) in July.
