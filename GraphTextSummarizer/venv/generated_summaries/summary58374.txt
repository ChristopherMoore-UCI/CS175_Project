-- The body of a Massachusetts Air National Guard pilot with "numerous deployments to the Middle East" has been identified after his F-15C fighter jet crashed Wednesday in Virginia, an Air National Guard official said Friday. The search for the single-seat aircraft was complicated by the remote, wooded location of the crash, near the Virginia-West Virginia border. An Air Force Academy graduate, Fontenot earned the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal, the Aerial Achievement Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Air Force Achievement Medal and the Combat Readiness Medal, among others, for his service. Before losing contact, Fontenot had reported an in-flight emergency, according to Col. James Keefe, 104th Fighter Wing commander. Anthony Mutti, spokesman for Barnes Air National Guard Base.
