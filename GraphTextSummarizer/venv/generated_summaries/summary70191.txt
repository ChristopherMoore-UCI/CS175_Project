This can be best achieved through a vigorous re-assertion of U.S. soft power, combined with prudent use of hard power. As does the wisdom of much of the way in which he harnessed U.S. leadership and power to try to achieve these ends. Indeed, at a time of U.S. military cutbacks, and given the ongoing information revolution, the importance of achieving better balance between -- often expensive -- hard power assets and soft power resources is perhaps even more important today for Washington. Through his skilful rebalancing of hard and soft power, he powerfully renewed U.S. global leadership, helping to thaw the Cold War. To be sure, there remains a legitimate remaining need for maintaining significant U.S. military power in Asia, not least to re-assure key allies.
