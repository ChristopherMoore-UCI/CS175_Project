Amtrak's Petito said the Acela Express trains on the East Coast already have free Wi-Fi, as do the Downeaster trains (between Boston, Massachusetts, and Portland, Maine), the Coast Starlight (between Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California) and the Pacific Surfliner (between San Luis Obispo, California, and San Diego, California). Jet airliners are a much faster way to get from one part of the United States to another; trains and buses take considerably longer, and passengers can grow weary and bored. If you need proof of that, it's right in front of you on any city street, as people stroll along oblivious to their immediate surroundings, their eyes locked on the information being delivered to them on their phones and handheld devices. "Our passengers enjoy it a lot," said Greyhound spokesman Timothy Stokes. "Our passengers tell us that they love to be able to use their computers for free as they travel," said Amtrak spokeswoman Barbara Petito.
