The termination of funding came after the Charity Commission "took robust action" and cited how "public statements by CAGE officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities," the commission said in a statement. The commission didn't specify those statements by CAGE, but stated that "in our view, those statements increased the threat to public trust and confidence in charity and raised clear questions for a charity considering funding CAGE's activities as to how the trustees of those charities could comply with their legal duties as charity trustees," the commission said. "CAGE is not a charity but has been in part funded by British charities. As it is not a charity and given the nature of its work, and the controversy it has attracted, the Charity Commission has been concerned that such funding risked damaging public trust and confidence in charity," the commission said. But CAGE blamed a "neo-conservative" leadership on the U.K.'s Charity Commission for pressuring the two charities to halt funding.
