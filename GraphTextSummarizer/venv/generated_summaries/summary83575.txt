More on the Library of Congress plan to archive tweets Thoughts and ideas written by people who wouldn't necessarily be in a position to write them into books (some for good reason) will be immortalized just the same. Billions of public tweets are already available, and millions of new tweets go into the system every day. There will be a record, for example, of the torrent of tweets that brought news from street demonstrations during the Iranian elections last year, when Internet and mobile lines were cut off. Only that future generations will have an unprecedented amount of firsthand data (in 140-character bites) about what people from every corner of the world were doing, thinking and feeling at every moment starting four years ago. The Library of Congress announced this week that it will archive the billions of tweets published since Twitter launched in March 2006.
