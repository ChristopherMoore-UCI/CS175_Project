Hashmat Karzai was a member of Kandahar provincial council and was a key campaigner and ally of presidential candidate Dr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai in the south of the country. -- A cousin of Afghan President Hamid Karzai died in a bombing Tuesday, a provincial spokesman said, marking the latest killing of a Karzai relative. Hashmat Khalil Karzai, an influential figure in southern Kandahar, died in the blast, Kandahar provincial spokesman Dawa Khan Minapal said. A governor's spokesman said he was shot by a guard, who was subsequently shot dead by other guards. In 2011, half brother Ahmed Wali Karzai was shot to death in his home by a guard.
