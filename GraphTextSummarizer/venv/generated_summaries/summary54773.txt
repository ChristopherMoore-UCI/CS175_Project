Former Massachusetts chemist faces even more charges After ordering that the lab where she worked be shut down in August 2012, while the investigation was ongoing, Patrick created a special counsel to expedite the identification of individuals whose cases involved evidence potentially mishandled by Dookhan. The chemist, Annie Dookhan, 34, already is facing a total of 27 counts including obstruction of justice, mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master's degree in chemistry from the University of Massachusetts. Dookhan worked as a state chemist testing drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies from 2003 until March 2012, when she resigned, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office. -- The list of defendants whose cases could be affected by the alleged drug tampering of a former Massachusetts chemist has now grown to over 40,000, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick's administration said Tuesday. The attorney general's office began a criminal investigation in July 2012, after Massachusetts State Police were tipped off by Dookhan's co-workers who alleged her work might be unreliable.
