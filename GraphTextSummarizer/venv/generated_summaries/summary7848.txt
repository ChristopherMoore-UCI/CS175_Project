With coordinated leadership from the government of Haiti, backed by perseverance and leadership from the United States and international community, Haiti can help ensure Andrise -- and all the children of Haiti -- have the chance to realize their full potential so that they and their country may prosper. Despite the untenable living conditions and lack of jobs and basic services, many children are back in school. Congress and the Obama administration need to make a 15-year commitment to Haiti that will help create sustainable development to improve the health, education and economic opportunities of children and families. These include: -- the opportunities presented by unprecedented attention, resources and international partnerships focused on Haiti, -- the incredible resiliency of the Haitian people who prefer a hand up to a handout, -- the resourcefulness of Haitians living abroad who are committed to Haiti's future, -- Haiti's proximity to the United States, which has a strong national interest in seeing the country progress. -- The images coming out of Haiti since a devastating earthquake rocked the country almost a year ago show death, disease and political uncertainty.
