At the time when the Allies were establishing new states for old peoples in the region, scholars and clerics from Morocco to India went into extensive discussions about the vague future of the Muslim "nation." Morsy is not the first -- and given the upheavals of the Arabic Spring, is unlikely to be the last -- Muslim leader to seek a constitutional way to create functioning state institutions in a region where the collapse of the Ottoman Empire led more often to tyranny or puppet regimes than strong democratic states. It is not a coincidence that constitutional reforms were considered a priority in all the Arab Spring countries -- and that popular Islamic movements in countries such as Tunisia and Egypt have the upper hand in redrawing laws. The drive to institutionalize the states of the Muslim world was the primary objective for most political parties in the region in the early 20th century. Muslim intellectuals, shocked by the tyranny and the deterioration of their nations - especially when compared to the rapid advance of the West both politically and militarily - tried to reverse the course by political means.
