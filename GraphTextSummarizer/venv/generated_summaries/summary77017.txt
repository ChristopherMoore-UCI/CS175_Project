More snow is predicted Tuesday for the eastern shores of Lake Michigan, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario as dry Arctic air absorbs water vapor off the lakes and dumps up to 3 feet of snow in places, forecasters warned, The cold weather isn't only an annoyance, it can be dangerous. Wind was a major issue in some places, with wind chill warnings and advisories in effect from North Dakota to West Virginia and on into parts of New England. The cold snap triggered blinding snow in some areas Monday, spawning a number of traffic pileups in Ohio alone, including one fatal wreck involving 86 vehicles. Whiteout conditions caused by snow arriving off Lake Erie caused at least three more pileups -- one involving 52 cars, another with 25 vehicles, and a third, in which 23 motorists collided. Residents of Rugby, North Dakota, suffered through wind chills of 51 degrees below zero early Monday morning.
