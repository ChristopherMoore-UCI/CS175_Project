Celebrate role models Company policies and behavioral change can create the right space for people to come out, but role models prove that it is possible and worthwhile. Companies cannot change the law, and LGBT employees in these countries must be mindful of the dangers they could face. But by creating a safe space for people to be open about their sexuality, wherever they are in the world, companies can help those countries to take a step in the right direction. Most people are straight, and only they can create a safe space for people to come out. Companies that are committed to LGBT diversity do not bend their policies, even in the most challenging environments.
