There were no plans Friday to cancel or postpone Sunday's Marine Corps Marathon or any events connected with it, race spokeswoman Tami Faram said. Additional security measures have been taken, however, to bolster an "already robust plan" for security at the marathon, Col. Daniel J. Choike, the commander of Marine Corps Base Quantico, said Friday. It is the second time the Marine Corps museum in Triangle, Virginia, has been fired on in recent days. The Pentagon and a vacant Marine Corps Recruiting Station in Virginia also were shot at recently. -- Several shots have been fired at the National Museum of the Marine Corps building in Virginia, the FBI said Friday.
