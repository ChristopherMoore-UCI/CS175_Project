The fires at the Amuay refinery since Saturday have been described as "the most lethal industry accident in Venezuela to date" by analysts and come as the country faces other infrastructure problems, apparently because of a lack of maintenance, including a bridge collapse in Caracas, analysts said. " The deadly incidents at Venezuela's largest refinery highlight serious problems at the state-run refineries and are "a reminder of the bleak outlook for the company's declining production and investment capacity," said the analysis firm Eurasia Group in a note Wednesday to investors and media. When Chavez overhauled the oil company in recent years, he fired numerous senior managers and experts with technical know-how, said Eurasia Group analyst Risa Grais-Targow. -- The Venezuelan oil refinery whose explosions killed 42 people suffers mismanagement, delays in major maintenance and underinvestment, according to analysts and an engineering firm's recent report.
