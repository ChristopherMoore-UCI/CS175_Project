In a video that's gone viral, Santa Cruz Mayor Percy Fernandez is seen placing his hand on the thigh of journalist Mercedes Guzman April 30. After a public outcry and complaints by Guzman's family, the mayor's office sent a video to Santa Cruz media in which Fernandez apologizes for the incident. "We all obviously want Percy Fernandez to stop doing that because ultimately him, as mayor, is the one who loses the most," Esp√≠ndola said. Pagina Siete, a Bolivian newspaper, published a survey Monday showing that the Santa Cruz leader is at the top of a list of popular mayors in Bolivia. Opposition lawmaker Marcela Revollo filed a complaint accusing Fernandez of sexual harassment, sexual violence and discrimination.
