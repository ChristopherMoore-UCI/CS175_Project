Turpin books her clients only on cruise lines where English is the ship's primary language and on ships subject to U.S. Coast Guard inspection. Safety drills are "the first thing that happens the minute they get on the ship." Cruise prices are actually up 1% since the beginning of the year, according to the UBS Cruise Tracker released Tuesday. -- Less than two weeks after the Costa Concordia cruise disaster, customers are still booking cruises for 2012 -- even as they ask more questions about safety at sea. The fact that the Costa Concordia didn't conduct a same-day safety drill for passengers boarding the ship was surprising to some agents, and Kertes says he expects more cruise lines to tighten their safety procedures and have drills before a ship sails. Mediterranean cruise lines were already facing lower demand because of high U.S. airfares to Europe and economic instability in Greece and Turkey, Kertes said.
