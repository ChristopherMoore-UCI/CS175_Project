Storm has Northeast in crosshairs Sunday Heavy rain and strong winds will pound the coastal regions of North Carolina and Virginia as the storm slogs north. Sandy should make landfall late Monday or Tuesday, striking somewhere between Virginia and New York. Sandy is a swirl of moving parts and any change in forecast could mean major changes in its impact. In spots, its center could linger for as long as 48 hours, unleashing heavy rain from the Great Lakes down to the Mid-Atlantic, through the Northeast. Rough seas and surf will be building along the seaboard as far north as North Carolina.
