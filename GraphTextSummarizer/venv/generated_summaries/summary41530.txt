It is unclear who is behind the blast, a rare occurrence in the Himalayan capital, although a previously unknown group, United Ethnic Liberation Front, has claimed responsibility, police Officer Dhiraj Singh said. As Nepal prepares a new republican constitution and adopts a federal model, various ethnic groups in a population of about 27 million are demanding special rights and calling for provinces based on ethnicity. -- Three people were killed and seven others injured, two of the seriously, when an improvised explosive device went off Monday near government offices here. The explosion happened outside a court house and less than 200 meters from the Central Secretariat, which houses most government ministries. Two people died on the spot while third died while undergoing treatment at hospital.
