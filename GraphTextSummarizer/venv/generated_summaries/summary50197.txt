U.S. close in on Ryder Cup glory despite late Poulter heroics Olazabal's players struggled to keep up with the U.S. in the fourballs and the foursomes, but they raced out of the traps from the very first tee shot of the singles matches. " Scotland's Paul Lawrie, playing in the Ryder Cup for the first time since Brookline 13 years ago, claimed Europe's second point of the day, thrashing FedEx Cup playoff winner Brandt Snedeker 5&3. Led by Luke Donald, who comprehensively saw off Bubba Watson in the opening game, Europe rode on the crest of a wave with Englishman Ian Poulter, who won four of his matches, at the center of the charge. With the momentum firmly behind Europe, world No. 1 Rory McIlroy edged out impressive rookie Keegan Bradley 2&1 before Poulter brought Europe level. That left Europe on 14 points and Italian Francesco Molinari secured the half point needed to win the cup outright after finishing level with 14-time major winner Tiger Woods.
