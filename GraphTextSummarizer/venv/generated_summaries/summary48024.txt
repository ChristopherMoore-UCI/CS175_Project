Ligety made it four victories in a row last week in Beaver Creek, Colorado to become the first man since legendary Italian Alberto Tomba more than 20 years ago to achieve that feat but his race was quickly over in Val d'Isere, France on Saturday. In the women's Super-G in St. Moritz, Switzerland, Tina Weirather of Liechtenstein -- who registered two second-place finishes in Lake Louise, Canada last week -- beat surprise package Kling Kajsa of Sweden by 0.31 seconds. Austrian Marcel Hirscher took advantage of Ligety's mishap to win, rallying from a 0.41-second deficit after the first run to cruise past Thomas Fanara of France and Stefan Luitz of Germany. Former overall champion Bode Miller -- second behind teammate Ligety in Beaver Creek -- and current overall leader Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway also couldn't complete the first run. The win was a birthday gift for Weirather's mom, Hanni Wenzel, a gold medalist in the slalom at the world championships in St. Moritz in 1974.
