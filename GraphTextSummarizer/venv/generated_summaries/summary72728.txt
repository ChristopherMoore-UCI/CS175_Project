Nonetheless, World Cup numbers have been so consistently high that Twitter was struggling to keep its ship afloat. Nearly as much traffic was reported after Brazil's first goal against North Korea in its 2-1 victory that same day, as well as after Mexico's tying goal against South Africa on June 11. -- It's not as audible as the noise from vuvuzelas, but internet buzz over the 2010 FIFA World Cup has observers calling the tournament the biggest event in Web history. The U.S.-England match, which ended in a tie June 12, drew 13 million viewers to ABC, making it the most-watched first round World Cup game in U.S. broadcast history. According to Akamai, a content delivery network, the Web peaked at more than 12 million users per minute just two hours after the kickoff between South Africa and Mexico.
