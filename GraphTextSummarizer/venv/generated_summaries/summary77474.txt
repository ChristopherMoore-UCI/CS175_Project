" Radwanska meets Dominika Cibulkova in the semifinals Thursday after the diminutive Slovak -- who sent Sharapova packing -- cruised past maiden grand slam quarterfinalist Simona Halep 6-3 6-0. Li Na, the only grand slam champion in the women's semifinals and twice the Australian Open runner-up, battles Canadian upstart Eugenie Bouchard in the other semifinal. Following Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova and Novak Djokovic, two-time women's defending champion Victoria Azarenka became the latest big name bundled out when the Belorussian fell to Agnieszka Radwanska on Wednesday. When Azarenka misfired to seal her fate on match point, the crowd at Rod Laver Arena roared its approval. "This is for sure one of the greatest matches at the slam, especially here," Radwanska told reporters.
