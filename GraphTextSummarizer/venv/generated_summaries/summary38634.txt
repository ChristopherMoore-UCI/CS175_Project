The forecast track for Tomas, a storm which formed in late October, is typical for November hurricanes, CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider wrote on a blog for HLN's "Morning Express." "Two fairly recent November hurricanes include Hurricane Lenny in 1999 and Hurricane Michelle in 2001. Two people were injured, including one critically, when they tried to repair roof damage during the storm, said Michelle Forbes, acting director of National Emergency Management. Although hurricanes are less likely to form in November, "the month isn't always hurricane-free," Schneider said. No coastal watches or warnings were in effect associated with Tomas, according to the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center.
