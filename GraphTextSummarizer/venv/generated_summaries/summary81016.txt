" The original theft and subsequent publication of around 1,000 CRU e-mails in November 2009 led to claims that climate scientists were manipulating or falsifying data to exaggerate the threat of global warming. "If genuine...these e-mails have the appearance of having been held back after the theft of data and e-mails in 2009 to be released at a time designed to cause maximum disruption to the imminent international climate talks," the CRU statement said. The leak comes just days before the latest round of United Nations climate talks which get underway in Durban, South Africa on November 28. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency report published last year also cleared climate scientists saying that their critics "routinely misunderstand or mis-characterize the scientific issues...and draw faulty conclusions on the state of the science. A file containing approximately 5,000 private e-mails from the University of East Anglia's Climate Research Unit (CRU) was published online Tuesday, according to the university.
