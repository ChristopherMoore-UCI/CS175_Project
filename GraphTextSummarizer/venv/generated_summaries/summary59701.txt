Minimum mandatory sentencing takes discretion away from judges and gives it to prosecutors. If the facts and the law support a harsh sentence, a judge has the discretion to impose it, but we should not force their hands when minimum mandatories produce obviously unjust sentences. Prosecutors can use the threat of extreme minimum mandatory sentences to strong-arm defendants into plea deals. In Florida, a person who uses a gun in the commission of certain felonies (including aggravated assault) must face minimum mandatory sentencing. While it is appropriate for prosecutors to have discretion over who they prosecute and what charges they pursue, minimum mandatory sentencing gives them a power that can be too easily abused.
