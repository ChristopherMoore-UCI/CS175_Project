Federal prosecutor Roderick Sonley indicated Tuesday that the government would disclose more details of evidence against Mohamed before his next court date, set for February 12. Police allege Mohamed's terrorist activity was directly linked to the arrests of Ashton and Carlos Larmond, two Ottawa twin brothers accused of conspiring to commit terrorism offenses. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced Mohamed's arrest Monday, charging him with participating in the activity of a terrorist group and conspiracy to participate in terrorist activity. Carlos Larmond was charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group but also with attempting to leave Canada to participate in terrorist activity abroad, a relatively new Canadian terrorism law. A third Canadian man arrested this week on terrorism-related charges will remain in custody after making a brief court appearance Tuesday.
