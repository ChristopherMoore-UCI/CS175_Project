"While my government is working hard to meet the basic needs of citizens who have been forced by the violence of armed groups to flee their homes, some have sought to fabricate a refugee crisis in neighboring countries through inciting armed groups to intimidate Syrian civilians at border areas and forcing them to flee to neighboring countries," said Moallem. Strong U.N. Security Council action has been blocked by longtime Syria supporters, Russia and China. Kim Jong Il's son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, has taken over as "supreme leader," though the level of his influence on policy decisions remains unclear. He recalled the December death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il. He accused "some well-known countries" of pursuing "new colonial policies" under the guise of humanitarian efforts, and blamed Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya and others for "arming, funding, training and harboring armed terrorist groups."
