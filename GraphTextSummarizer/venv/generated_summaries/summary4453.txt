My husband adores his mother—he calls her Big Red for her auburn hair—so after our wedding I took up post as dutiful daughter-in-law. What first ensued was one bad TV moment after another: Minutes after my MIL met our first child, Jane, she exclaimed, "That is the most beautiful baby I've ever seen. She showed up for short spurts: quick shopping trips, weddings, and babies' birthdays. When we first met, I was relieved when my future mother-in-law told me that I was pretty and smart. My mother-in-law, it turned out, was thoughtful, forgiving, and quick to praise.
