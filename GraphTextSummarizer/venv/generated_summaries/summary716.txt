Douglas Prade walked out of the Madison Correctional Institution around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday, CNN affiliate WOIO reported, a few hours after Summit County Common Pleas Judge Judy Hunter ruled he was innocent of the crime and ordered him released. (Dr. Prade and her mother) are probably turning over in their graves, but God will have the final say," Tony Fowler, Margo Prade's nephew, told CNN affiliate WEWS. "The Court is not unsympathetic to the family members, friends and community who want to see justice for Dr. Prade," Hunter wrote. She ordered that Prade be released from prison "forthwith. "This is a gross misapplication of the law, and we will be appealing Prade's exoneration," county Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said in a news release.
