An advance copy of the report, which is circulating among Security Council members, was obtained by CNN ahead of a Wednesday briefing on Syria to the council by Joint Special Envoy Kofi Annan. The U.N. mission's role in Syria was based on the premise that there would be a cessation to the violence, and failing that, "a calibration of effort in response to the situation on the ground would be appropriate," Ban writes. "From a central hub in Damascus, the civilian component would continue liaison and dialogue with opposition and Government representatives in the provinces as security conditions allow," Ban writes. CNN cannot independently verify government and opposition claims of casualties because access to Syria by international journalists has been severely curtailed. These options must be considered, Ban writes, because "in spite of the best efforts of (the mission) to support the parties in the effort to de-escalate the crisis, there is not a cessation of violence, and the basic human rights whose protection is at the core of the (six-point) plan continue to be violated," the report says.
