In September 2008, when Silver State Bank collapsed, a group of elderly Las Vegas deaf residents was especially hurt. According to Securities and Exchange Commission documents, he sold $1.8 million in Silver State stock from November 2007 through February 2008. As a result, the FDIC was left to cover more than a half-billion dollars in Silver State liabilities. Silver State and others loaned money on the promise of Las Vegas' commercial real estate boom with the belief that undeveloped land would be turned into shopping centers, hotels and offices. Bill Martin, a Las Vegas banker who once worked as a regulator for the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington, said what was happening to Silver State was clear.
