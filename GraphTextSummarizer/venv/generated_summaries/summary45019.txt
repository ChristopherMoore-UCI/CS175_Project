-- At least five people were killed Saturday in the Yemeni city of Taiz amid heavy shelling and ongoing clashes between government forces and opposition fighters, according to witnesses. The southwestern city of Taiz has been a scene of recent turmoil where opposition groups have squared off against those loyal to the country's embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saleh recently agreed to step down from power after months of protests against his 33-year rule, becoming the fourth leader to leave office as a result of unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year. He had been granted immunity sparking protests among demonstrators who would like to see Saleh tried for alleged acts of violence. The heaviest clashes took place in the mountain region of Manakha, considered a stronghold for anti-government fighters.
