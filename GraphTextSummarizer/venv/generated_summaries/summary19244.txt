Police are searching for a woman seen running from an elevated station for the No. 7 train in Queens on Thursday evening, Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said in a statement. Sen's roommate, Ar Suman, 33, told CNN on Friday that after living together for over a year they had become like "family." The New York Police Department on Friday identified the victim as Sunando Sen, 46, of Queens. Sen owned a shop called New Amsterdam Copies and was a graphic designer for posters, according to Suman. "I came home and I heard this happened," said Suman, "I am feeling very bad."
