Armstrong first admitted the use of performance enhancing drugs and blood doping during a January television interview with Oprah Winfrey, ending years of denial that he cheated during the prime years of his cycling career. Armstrong's cycling career is long over, but he competed in and won several triathlons in 2012. "Mr. Armstrong and his legal team have not complied with that demand." Obviously, we've been well aware of the statements that have been made by Mr. Armstrong in other media reports. Tillotson said the suit, which has not been filed yet, will ask for the return of $12 million in bonus money paid for wins from 2002 to 2005 and for millions in legal costs and interest.
