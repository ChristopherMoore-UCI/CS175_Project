The 27-year-old woman met New York resident John Hopkins on the website Craigslist before spending nine days trapped in his apartment, where she claims she was repeatedly raped, according to a district attorney's statement. The pair agreed that the woman could stay rent free if she cooked and cleaned for Hopkins, who then paid for her airfare to New York on February 4, 2011. The woman claims that she was looking for work in New York and found an advertisement that Hopkins posted on Craigslist, listing a room for rent, according to the complaint. The woman -- whose name has not been released -- was treated for injuries at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn, New York. Police found the woman bruised and bound in Hopkins' apartment, according to the district attorney statement.
