Suddenly, from a carnival of color and celebration, a dark cloud hung over Brazil's World Cup dream. Fernandinho, the Manchester City midfielder, added a fourth with six minutes remaining to ensure Brazil finished top on goal difference from Mexico. His two goals and further strikes from the much maligned Fred and substitute Fernandinho ensured Brazil claimed a 4-1 win over Cameroon and secured top spot in Group A. Mexico, which defeated Croatia 3-1, took second place and will now face the Netherlands in Fortaleza on Sunday. Leading through Neymar's 17th minute strike, Brazil allowed Cameroon back into the contest as its cumbersome defending was once again exposed. After a goalless first half, Rafael Marquez, the first man to captain his country at four World Cups, headed Mexico in front with 18 minutes remaining.
