Atkins has won MTV Video Music Awards, Source Awards, a BET Award, a GQ Man Of The Year Award, an NAACP Image Award, a World Music Award and a Teen Choice Award, according to the publicist's statement. He will be sent to New York's Rikers Island before being assigned to another facility in upstate New York, said his publicist, Courtney Barnes. In an interview on the TV show "Good Day New York" this month, Atkins said growing up in Queens, he felt almost groomed for prison and knew "a lot" of friends who were locked up. Hip-hop artist Ja Rule turned himself to begin a two-year prison sentence Wednesday afternoon in New York. In the months leading up to his surrender date, Atkins has been putting the finishing touches on a new album -- his first in six years -- that is scheduled to be released later this summer, Barnes said.
