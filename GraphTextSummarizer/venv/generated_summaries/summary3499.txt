Watch: Angola's economic potential The fact the Angolan economy is the most concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa also makes growth vulnerable. Do these tremendous growth rates mean that Angola has escaped the so-called resource curse, where oil resources are detrimental to growth? After 2009, growth has dropped to around 3% per year and projections for the coming years are in the range 5-8%. Experience shows that growth reduces poverty less in countries with high initial inequality. The country is the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa, and the third biggest economy, after South Africa and Nigeria.
