"[With] so many children and so few adults to help them grow up, I knew we had to find a way to bring new information, resources and the caring, nurturing effect of other adults into the lives of [these] children." Since 2006, Infinite Family has built and operated five computer labs at partner organization sites across South Africa. While in South Africa, Stokes witnessed how HIV/AIDS has resulted in millions of children being left without parents. There, they were introduced to their first computer through Infinite Family, a nonprofit started by Amy Stokes. "About six months after being connected with Betty and Dave (Voigt of Sycamore, Pennsylvania,) he came up to me when I came to visit and said, 'Amy, Amy, I'm in the head of the class now, and I am so happy with where my life is going.'" Buthelezi is also pursuing a degree in IT, and he credits Infinite Family for getting his life on the right track. " As orphans in Johannesburg, the Buthelezi brothers were moved to a home for families and children affected by HIV/AIDS.
