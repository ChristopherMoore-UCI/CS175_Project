Ryan O'Neal: Andy Warhol portrait of Farrah Fawcett 'is mine' O'Neal said Fawcett forgave him and they reconciled in 2001 after he was diagnosed with leukemia. It is not an easy question to answer since the artist gave the portrait as a gift, both Fawcett and O'Neal have insured it, and it has never been sold -- a point underscored by the correspondence between lawyers for the university and Fawcett's trustee: "In light of the unusual relationship and living arrangement between Ms. Fawcett and Mr. O'Neal and in light of the fact the Warhol works were not purchased, it may be impossible to 'prove' the ownership of the works in question by the kind of documentary evidence we lawyers like," said one letter to the university from the trustee's attorney. -- Twelve ordinary people, some too young to remember when Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal were Hollywood's golden couple, will now decide who owns an Andy Warhol portrait of the iconic blond beauty. The question before the jury of six men and six women: Did Warhol give one portrait to O'Neal -- the Oscar-nominated star of "Love Story" -- or did he give them both to Fawcett? O'Neal, who starred with Mia Farrow in the steamy 1960s prime-time soap "Peyton Place" and with Ali MacGraw in the 1970 tearjerker "Love Story," testified that he persuaded Fawcett to pose for Warhol in 1980 soon after the actors began seeing each other.
