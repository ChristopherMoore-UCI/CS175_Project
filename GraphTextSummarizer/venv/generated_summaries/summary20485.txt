Analysis: Saber-rattling in Strait of Hormuz Rear Adm. Ali Fadavi, of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said last month the world could not last 24 hours without Persian Gulf oil, and that Iran is capable of closing the strait. "At best, Iran can posture and potentially disrupt traffic for a short duration," said Rodrigue, who specializes in global trade and maritime transportation issues. Still, in the past two weeks both U.S. and British defense officials have denounced any move by Iran to close the strait, the only outlet from the Persian Gulf and a key trade route for oil. "Today, out of the 1,300 billion barrels of oil in the world, 800 billion barrels are in the Persian Gulf," Fadavi told Iran's Press TV. State media said Friday that Iran plans to conduct military drills in the strait in February under the name "The Great Prophet."
