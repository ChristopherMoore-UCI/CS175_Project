"It's about a lot of things, about beating the West at its own game, which is fashion: 'You colonized us but we dress better than you.'" Gondola says the history of the Sapeurs can be traced back to the 19th century, when the Republic of the Congo was a French colony. Gondola, who was born in the Congo and teaches history at Indiana University in the United States, explains that Sapeurs aren't rich; they typically work menial jobs, and have been known to resort to shoplifting to feed their addiction to apparel. "It's the fetishization of fashion -- they are the worshippers of fashion, it's their god, it's powerful," says Didier Gondola, author of "History of the Congo," who has extensively researched the Sapeurs. The Sapeurs rebelled by wearing aggressively non-conformist clothes, including leather suits, says Gondola. In the 1970s, popular musician Papa Wemba, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), began promoting the idea of the Sapeur, forming the "Société des Ambianceurs et Persons Élégants," or SAPE, of which many modern-day Sapeurs claim membership.
