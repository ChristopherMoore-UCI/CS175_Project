" Jason Day -- who lost eight of his relatives in the deadly typhoon in the Philippines this month -- led on home soil, one shot better than Denmark's Thomas Bjorn. Welsh golfer Stuart Manley thought he won a new Mercedes when he struck a hole in one at the World Cup of Golf in Melbourne. " Despite the disastrous fourth, Manley managed to finish the round at one-over 72 and stands at two under, total, entering play Sunday. But then Manley was told the car only went to those who hit a hole in one in the fourth and final round and he slumped to an 11 on his ensuing hole, the fourth. "It's the highest high and then the lowest low I've ever experienced on a golf course," Manley told the tournament website.
