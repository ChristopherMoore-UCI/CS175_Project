"I want to share a vision, I think we have a unique opportunity going forward, not only for the good of this party, but more importantly for the good of the country, to find a new fresh leader out there who can take big bold ideas, take ideas that come from of outside of Washington, from the states all the way down to the grassroots," Walker said. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker portrayed himself as a battle tested warrior who has successfully beat back successive attempts by powerful Democratic-aligned organizations to try and defeat him, during a campaign style speech Thursday night to members of the Republican National Committee. Walker, who is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination, used his remarks to sharply criticize Washington and Hillary Clinton as he argued that Republicans should look to the states for a presidential nominee in 2016. Walker then followed by saying that since taking office, "because of our reforms in our great state of Wisconsin, they are growing up in a state that is better, even better than the state I grew up in." Walker also emphasized that he enjoyed campaigning and meeting voters -- an important trait for a presidential candidate who endures grueling hours on the road away from family and friends.
