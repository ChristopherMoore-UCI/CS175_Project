"It's two-way traffic," explains Cape Farewell founder, artist David Buckland. On Friday, the American singer-songwriter and self-professed "expert infuser" will join an unlikely ensemble of 40 artists, scientists and musicians aboard the 10-day "Cape Farewell" expedition to Disko Bay. " Martin Rose, director of the British Council Canada, which organized the Youth Expedition with Cape Farewell, says, "It was clear that the snow was late and the glaciers are retreating year by year. This time, he's hoping to complete the program they started filming last year on climate change and the Cape Farewell trip. " Around midday Friday, the sturdy and ice-strengthened science research vessel, the "Grigory Mikheev," will depart Kangerlussuaq in Greenland bound for Disko Bay, a location on the west coast that provides some of the starkest examples of the island's melting ice caps.
