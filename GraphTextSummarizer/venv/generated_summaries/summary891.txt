" She put out Henin in the 2007 semifinals before going on to lose in straight sets to Venus Williams and will be looking to go one better against Lisicki, who is appearing in her first grand slam final. Lisicki, who caused the upset of all upsets when she dispatched defending champion Serena Williams on Monday, was again taken the full distance by Radwanska before winning 4-6 2-6 9-7 in two hours 18 minutes of compelling action on Centre Court. -- Sabine Lisicki survived another emotional roller coaster to claim her place in the women's singles final at Wimbledon with a thrilling three-set victory over fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska Thursday. Like in her match against No.1 seed Williams, Lisicki trailed by a break in the decider and looked to be heading for the exit door until summoning up a stirring comeback. Bartoli, who revealed after her victory that she had taken a half hour nap shortly before coming out for one of the most important matches of her career, emerged from her slumbers to dismiss 20th seed Flipkens.
