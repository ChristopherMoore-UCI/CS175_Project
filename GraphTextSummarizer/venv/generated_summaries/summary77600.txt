The police captain added authorities do not know how the suspect learned details of the victims, speculating it may have been over the internet, by accessing an old directory or noticing would-be victims with Delta Sigma Theta jewelry, placards or other paraphernalia out in public. "He made it obvious to our victims that he knew information ... about them personally," said Plano police spokesman Andre Smith, adding that none of the women believe they knew their attacker in advance. And all were alumnae of the same sorority: Delta Sigma Theta. "We want them to understand that their group is being targeted," Wilkerson said of the sorority's alumnae, urging them "not to advertise" their affiliation with Delta Sigma Theta and advising those who live alone to stay with a relative or friend until the case is resolved. He noted that the Corinth police department is currently processing DNA evidence, as are other police departments.
