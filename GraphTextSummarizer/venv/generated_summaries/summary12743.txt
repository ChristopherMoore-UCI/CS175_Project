Video, recorded by Chadd and later posted on CNN's iReport, shows an apparently unconscious Newman head-down on the floor in a pool of blood. The suspect's grandson, Nicholas Nava, told CNN affiliate KNXV that Newman had grabbed one video game and put it under his shirt so that others jostling for the game didn't take it from him. As to the criminal charges, Todd Nolan -- the attorney representing Newman -- said his office will conduct discovery procedures Monday with police "to gather evidence proving my client is innocent." As he's turned over, Buckeye police officers appear to try to revive him -- at which point his face, covered mostly in blood, is revealed. Chadd estimated Newman was knocked out for about 10 minutes, all the while gushing blood and handcuffed.
