Herpetologist Paul Rosolie generated lots of hype ahead of his attempt during a Discovery Channel special to be eaten whole by a giant green anaconda, the largest and most powerful snake in the world. Rosolie presented himself as prey to the snake after putting on a special reinforced suit with helmet and devices to measure his vital signs, he said before the show aired in a news release on the Discovery Channel website. "The last 30 minutes of the program shows him wrestling with the snake then trying to get but never getting eaten -- all of this is punctuated by overproduction (i.e., loud music, short scenes and shots cut together like an action movie, etc.) to add drama where there really is none. The safety of Paul, as well as the anaconda, was always our number one priority," Discovery said in a statement. Viewers ultimately recoiled at the special after it aired Sunday and took to social media to blast the network for overselling the program's title.
