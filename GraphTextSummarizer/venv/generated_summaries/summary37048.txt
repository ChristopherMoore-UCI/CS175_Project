The first rigorous, worldwide study of high-altitude wind power estimates that there is enough wind energy at altitudes of about 1,600 to 40,000 feet to meet global electricity demand a hundred times over. So, a small increase in wind speed can lead to a big increase in the amount of mechanical energy you can harvest. During the energy shocks of the 1970s, when new energy ideas of all kinds were bursting forth, engineers and schemers patented several designs for harnessing wind thousands of feet in the air. The second is more like a kite, transmitting mechanical energy to the ground, where generators turn it into electricity. Wind's power -- energy which can be used to do work like spinning magnets to generate electricity -- varies with the cube of its speed.
