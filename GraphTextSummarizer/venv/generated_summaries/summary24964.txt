Farm Aid 25 Photos: Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp, Dave Matthews, Neil Young, Steven Tyler and more The Farm Aid foursome -- Nelson, Young, Mellencamp and Matthews -- were joined by twelve other acts on Saturday at Miller Park, including Nelson's guitar-slinging son Lukas, who ran around the stage barefoot leading his band, the Promise of the Real, through blues incantations and rockers. Appropriately, Young ended his set with the Seventies gem, "Homegrown," joined by his fellow Farm Aid board members Dave Matthews and John Mellencamp, as well as Farm Aid's president, Willie Nelson. "As the family farmer goes, so goes America," said Mellencamp, before tearing thorugh "Pink Houses," "Take Some Time To Dream," and "Scarecrow," which he also performed at the inaugural Farm Aid, held in Illinois in 1985. Earlier in the day, at a press conference held at Miller Park's adjacent little league field, Mellencamp said, not for the first time, that Nelson should be honored with a Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless devotion to American farmers. "This echo is 'good,' " Neil Young said toward the end of his set at Farm Aid's 25th annual concert, which drew 35,000 to Milwaukee's Miller Park.
