Mitt Romney on GSA and Secret Service controversies Tangherlini and Miller also testified later Wednesday at a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing where Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, wondered how the hundreds of GSA employees exposed to the excesses failed to question the obvious misconduct taking place. Speaking to GSA Inspector General Brian Miller and Acting Administrator Dan Tangherlini, Boxer said the panel "will support you and encourage you to clean house" at the vast federal procurement agency. One exchange Tuesday between Rep. Jeff Denham, a freshman Republican from California, and Miller highlighted the ways that Neely, and presumably others, avoided strictures against supplying food at government work conferences such as the Las Vegas event by creating joke awards in order to hold ceremonies at which food would be allowed. Asked Wednesday about how to fix the problems at GSA, Miller called for more centralized control of the agency with more oversight to hold regional officials accountable for spending. " "One of our witnesses characterized them, I guess, as fake awards, jackass awards and things of that nature," Miller said.
