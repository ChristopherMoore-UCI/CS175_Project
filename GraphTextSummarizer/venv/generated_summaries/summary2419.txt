Colorado authorities said the trio spent Tuesday night in the San Isabel National Forest about 10 to 12 miles west of Colorado City. The Dougherty siblings led Colorado authorities on another chase Wednesday before crashing into a highway guardrail. On August 2, Zephyrhills, Florida, Police Officer Kevin Widner was shot at from a car occupied by the siblings. Their run ended Wednesday morning on Interstate 25 between Colorado City and the town of Walsenburg, authorities said. Ryan Edward Dougherty, 21; his sister Lee Grace Dougherty, 29; and half-brother Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26, were arrested Wednesday on a rural stretch of Colorado highway.
