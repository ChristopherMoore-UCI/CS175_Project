-- Mercedes and tire supplier Pirelli have been punished by world motorsport's governing body after conducting an unsanctioned tire test. The Formula One team and Pirelli were called to an FIA tribunal following a three-day, 1,000 kilometer trial in Spain last month. It also ruled Pirelli had failed to offer other teams the chance to participate in the test. The FIA ruled Friday that the German manufacturer would not be able to take part in the upcoming young driver test event, with the team also having to split costs for the tribunal equally with Pirelli and the motorsort regulator. Mercedes will be on the grid when the 2013 Formula One season continued with British Grand Prix on June 30.
