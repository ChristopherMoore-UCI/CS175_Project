How is it that I as well as you, reader of these words, can be conscious of our respective existences and of what is going on in our minds â€” in my case, ideas about how the brain generates consciousness, about the fact that I was asked to prepare this particular text for a specific deadline, along with the fact that I happen to be in Paris, at the moment, not Los Angeles, and that I am writing this on a cold January day. On the side of understanding, we can point to the process of sensory representation as an important part of consciousness. But while mapped representations are a necessity for consciousness, as far as I can imagine, they are not sufficient for consciousness to occur. I believe to be conscious of our perceptions is to have ongoing representations of streams of events that affect our bodies, cause feelings, and become felt representations. The biological mechanisms behind the phenomena of consciousness remain unclear although it is fair to say that recently our understanding has made remarkable progress.
