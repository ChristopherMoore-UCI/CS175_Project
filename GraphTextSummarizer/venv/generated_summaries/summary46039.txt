"It's a very sad day," spokesman Dave Koontz told CNN on Tuesday. -- Shows at SeaWorld in San Diego, California, are expected to resume on schedule Wednesday, a day after a 12-year-old male killer whale died. The last killer whale to die at the San Diego venue was Splash, who was sickly when SeaWorld adopted him. Park veterinarians began a regimen of antibiotics to help try to stabilize his condition while they attempted to determine the cause of his illness," a SeaWorld statement said. The cause of death for Sumar won't be known until a necropsy is complete, SeaWorld said.
