Most MRSA infections acquired in community settings present themselves as sores or boils and often appear red, swollen, painful or with drainage such as pus, the CDC says. Athletes often get cuts and abrasions; MRSA can enter uncovered skin breaks and cause infection. Hospitals have long been known to be hot spots for transmitting staph, but recently cases have cropped up in other community settings. Experts say Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, a form of staph resistant to common antibiotics, has become a more prevalent problem in settings such as contact sports that involve skin-to-skin touching. The problem came to the forefront last week with Cleveland Browns player Kellen Winslow, who recently had his second staph infection.
