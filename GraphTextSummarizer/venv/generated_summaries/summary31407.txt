Steven Green of Midland, Texas, was found guilty Thursday in U.S. District Court in Paducah, Kentucky, said court spokeswoman Vanessa Armstrong. The slayings became public in 2006, angering the Iraqi public and prompting demands from some Iraqi officials that American soldiers accused of crimes against civilians face prosecution in Iraqi courts. Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl. Jurors deliberated for more than 10 hours before finding Green guilty of murder, rape, conspiracy and obstruction of justice, according to the court's Web site. All the defendants were with the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky.
