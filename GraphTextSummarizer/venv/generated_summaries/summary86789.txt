Second, although being a good citizen means supporting certain core principles, civic education should not be fully standardized. First, the goal should be to encourage people who are seeking naturalization to be genuinely constructive contributors to civic life. Memorizing a few phrases won't suffice to show they are capable citizens, but having the opportunity to learn advanced civic skills will help them and their communities. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services provides online flashcards to help, and the same is true of multiple choice civics tests in high school. Instead, it would create a new U.S. citizenship foundation that would promote civic education for immigrants, especially low-income residents.
