Determined not to let his disability curtail his sporting activities, Hickling initially took up wheelchair basketball and road hockey, but it was a meeting with Duncan Campbell, one of the Canadian founders of wheelchair rugby, which changed his life. But the most recent championships on home courts in Vancouver saw Hickling and his teammates back in fifth spot. Canada won a bronze medal when wheelchair rugby was introduced to the Paralympics in 1996 as an exhibition sport, and then placed fourth when it gained full status at the 2000 Sydney Games. "He got me to come out, hit my first guy -- knocked him out of his chair -- and haven't looked back since," Hickling told CNN's Human to Hero series. Despite his uncompromising attitude, Hickling has made many friends off the court, even among his American rivals.
