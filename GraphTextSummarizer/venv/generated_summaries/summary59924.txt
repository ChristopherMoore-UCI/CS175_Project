A surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, his hands cuffed, exiting a patrol car. -- The father of George Zimmerman, the man accused of shooting and killing an unarmed black teen, says the teen threatened to kill Zimmerman and then beat him so badly that it forced Zimmerman to shoot him. Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually. The shooting has hit a nerve in the nation, sparked a debate about racial profiling, and ignited protests and calls for Zimmerman's arrest. The video does not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head, but some say it shows Zimmerman did not have significant injuries to his face.
