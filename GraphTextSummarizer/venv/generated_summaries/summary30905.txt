Wells proved women could sell records and fill arenas by singing country songs from a woman's point of view, according to her Recording Academy biography. " Country mourns loss of 'Queen' Kitty Wells "If I had never heard of Kitty Wells, I don't think I would have been a singer myself," Lynn said after learning of Wells' death Monday at age 92. "Her songs resonated with women in an evolving post-war America, and she unassumingly paved the way for other strong female country singers, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Tammy Wynette, among others," said Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy. "She performed for seven decades, and she continues to be a model for generations of female country singers." Wells was the first female country singer to get a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which the Recording Academy presented in 1991.
