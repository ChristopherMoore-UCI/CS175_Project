Martin sent Incognito text messages three days after he left the team, Glazer said. -- Suspended NFL player Richie Incognito said his alleged bullying of Miami Dolphin teammate Jonathan Martin is misunderstood because "people don't know how Jon and I communicate to one another. After the interview, which was recorded in Los Angeles on Saturday, Incognito let Glazer review his phone text messages with Martin. " Incognito acknowledged in an interview aired on "Fox NFL Sunday" that he used racist and vulgar language in voice mails and text messages to Martin but said it was "coming from a place of love. He said the only issue that Incognito "sidestepped and wouldn't answer" concerned the allegation that Miami coaches had ordered a "code red" instructing the veteran to "toughen up" the younger Martin.
