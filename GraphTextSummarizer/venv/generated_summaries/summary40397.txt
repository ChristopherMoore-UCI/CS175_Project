-- A Rutgers University student hiking in the woods of northern New Jersey was mauled to death Sunday by a 300-pound black bear in what authorities said was a highly unusual attack. Caitlyn Kovacs, 19, died at a New Jersey hospital after appearing to go into distress during a gathering at the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity house, according to CNN affiliate WPIX. Authorities were awaiting the result of toxicology tests, WPIX reported. But encounters with human as well as attacks are unusual, said Lawrence Hajna, a spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection. "During the confusion, the group became separated as they ran in different directions." Four of the young men later found one another and contacted police.
