A worldwide network of fraudsters conned thousands of people into buying fake golf clubs on eBay, a London court has heard. In allegedly the largest fraud uncovered by the online auction site, the counterfeit clubs, as well as clothing and other golf accessories, were sold "on a scale, it is believed, has never been seen before," prosecutors told Snaresbrook Crown Court. Ebay was hit by a massive worldwide fraud in counterfeit golf clubs. Adam Davis, for the prosecution, said: "Nearly every major golf brand has been affected by the sale of counterfeit goods through the eBay accounts. The fraud only came to light when a disgruntled customer complained to a local trading standards office in London about sub-standard Acushnet clubs and an investigation was launched.
