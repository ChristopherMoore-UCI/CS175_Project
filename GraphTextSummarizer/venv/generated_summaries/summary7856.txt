Almost every day over four decades and more, he's stood out in Jemaa el Fna, the great sprawling square that forms the heart of medieval Marrakech in Morocco. In his left, a shoebox half-filled with human teeth. As the night approaches, the medicine men and the healers pack up their bones, their potions, and their boxes of human teeth. Marrakech may be easy to get to now, but it's smack in the middle of Morocco's red desert. Working as a volunteer in an orphanage by day, he supports himself by touting in the square at night.
