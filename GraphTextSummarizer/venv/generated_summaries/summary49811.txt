-- Libyan government and rebel officials offered wildly disparate views of the situation on the ground Sunday, as gunfire and explosions continued to rock Tripoli not far from the home of embattled leader Moammar Gadhafi. About two hours later, Moammar Gadhafi echoed his spokesman in claiming rebel officials were lying about the situation in Tripoli and beyond while predicting the six-month-long conflict would climax soon. He blamed small groups of "armed gangs" -- a term that Gadhafi loyalists have frequently applied to rebels -- for the blasts and gunfire heard overnight Saturday inside Tripoli. A U.S. official said Friday that Gadhafi might be preparing for a "last stand" in Tripoli as a months-long NATO air campaign continues amid reports of rebel advances. Faithi Baja, political affairs chief for the rebel's Transitional National Council, said early Sunday in a video statement that rebel fighters freshly launched operation inside Tripoli is "going easily" and they are inching toward Gadhafi's Bab al-Azizia compound.
