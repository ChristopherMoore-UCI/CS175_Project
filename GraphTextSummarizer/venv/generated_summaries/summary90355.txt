Thousands of tons of tainted milk powder were recalled, including pullbacks by Mengniu Dairy Group, China's largest milk producer, and Sanlu. -- Sanlu Group, the company at the center of China's tainted infant formula scandal, has filed for bankruptcy. Markets withdrew Sanlu milk powder in September after melamine was found as an additive. The poisonings killed six babies and sickened 290,000 others, according to China's Xinhua news agency. Baby formula produced by Sanlu -- previously one of China's leading dairy producers -- was first flagged in the scandal when it recalled about 700 tons of the powdered milk in September after discovering the product was contaminated with melamine.
