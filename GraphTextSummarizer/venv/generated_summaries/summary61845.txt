-- Four New Orleans police officers accused of killing two men after Hurricane Katrina are scheduled to appear in federal courtrooms Friday. The hearings Friday will determine whether the officers will be held in jail until the trial, according to court documents. The officers are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy, weapons and civil rights violations in connection with the well-publicized 2005 shootings in the infamous Danziger Bridge incident. The indictment also says police supervisors Arthur Kaufman and Gerard Dugue helped the other officers to obstruct justice during the subsequent investigations. Federal prosecutors then moved in and launched a new investigation.
