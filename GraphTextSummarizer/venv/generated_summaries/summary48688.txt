But in some of the fishing communities near Zamboanga City in the Philippines, swimming half a mile of open water in school uniform while carrying school books tied up in plastic bags on their heads is still a daily reality. His foundation now provides boats -- painted yellow to mimic the color of Filipino school buses -- for some six communities where the children used to swim to school. In an age where many school children are ferried to school in their parents' SUV, the idea of having to swim to school over open ocean or wade through muddy mangrove swamps to get to class might seem part of a cruel and long-forgotten past. He said the project has been an education for many of his friends and colleagues who were raised in cities and communities where getting to school each day was taken for granted. Often a family's only boat would be out in open water fishing by 4am and still at sea at around 7am when the children began to go to school.
