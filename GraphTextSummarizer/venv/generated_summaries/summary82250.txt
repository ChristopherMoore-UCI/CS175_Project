-- Actor John Forsythe has died at the age of 92, his publicist said Friday. He acted in many notable live television shows, including "Studio One," "Philco Playhouse," "Kraft Theatre" and "Robert Montgomery Presents," including the award-winning episode "What Makes Sammy Run?" "His first Broadway appearances in 'Vickie' and 'Yankee Point' led to a motion picture contract with Warner Brothers and his Hollywood debut with Cary Grant in 'Destination Tokyo,' " the official biography from his family said. Forsythe was perhaps best known as the voice of the never-seen Charlie in the TV show and movies "Charlie's Angels," and for his role as oil magnate Blake Carrington in the 1980s TV show "Dynasty," for which he received two Golden Globe Awards for best actor. Forsythe, the son of a Wall Street businessman, was born John Lincoln Freund in 1918 in Penn's Grove, New Jersey. He enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II, and then performed in numerous Broadway productions after the war, before moving to Los Angeles, California.
