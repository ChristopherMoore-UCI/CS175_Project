Stakhovsky caused one of the biggest shocks in the history of the tournament on Centre Court on a crazy Wednesday at SW19, but was banished to Court Three for his match against experienced Austrian Jurgen Melzer. And the Wimbledon crowd were given the perfect end to the day's play as second seed Andy Murray cruised past Spain's Tommy Robredo, winning 6-2 6-4 7-5 in two hours under the roof of the famous Centre Court. Stakhovsky was preceded on Court Three by Bulgarian 29th seed Grigor Dimitrov, the boyfriend of Maria Sharapova. There were no such problems for Spanish fourth seed David Ferrer as he completed his second round match against compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut, but was taken to four sets. Darcis, who stunned Rafael Nadal on the opening Monday, scratched before his second round match as he joined the long list of injury casualties which has marked this year's grass court grand slam.
