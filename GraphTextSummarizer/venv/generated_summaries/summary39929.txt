His brother, Amir -- also a journalist -- said Hamid Mir believed ISI and its leader, Lt. Gen. Zaheerul Islam had plans to assassinate him, but the Pakistani military's public relations agency has dismissed the allegations, saying that "raising allegations against ISI or the head of ISI without any basis is highly regrettable and misleading." Since the attack, Pakistan's military has pushed for media regulators to suspend or even revoke the license of Mir's network Geo News over its coverage of the incident, filing a complaint with the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority. On its website, Geo News reported similar blackouts in Okara, Murree and Dera Ghazi Khan as well. Officials from Pakistan's powerful intelligence agency, ISI, approached Mir several days before the shooting and told him he was on a hit list along with other journalists, his brother said. -- Pakistani news anchor Hamid Mir had been threatened by "both state and non-state actors" before he was attacked by gunmen, the journalist said in a statement read by his brother outside the Karachi hospital where he was recovering Thursday. A former newspaper reporter and editor, Mir writes columns and hosts a political talk show on Geo News.
