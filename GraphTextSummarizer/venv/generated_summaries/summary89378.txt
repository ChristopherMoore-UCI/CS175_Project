On November 4, 1995, Amir shot Rabin as Rabin was leaving a rally in Tel Aviv in support of the Oslo Accords, which set out a plan for a permanent peace between Israel and the Palestinians. -- Two Israeli television channels have dropped plans to air full-length versions of telephone interviews they conducted with the man who assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In the wake of a torrent of public criticism, Israeli broadcast channels 2 and 10 said they decided not to air the entire interviews each did this week with convicted killer Yigal Amir. Late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin holds a press conference in 1994. As a result, Amir has been moved to a higher-security prison where his phone calls, family visits, and conjugal visits have been revoked, according to a Prisons Authority spokesman.
