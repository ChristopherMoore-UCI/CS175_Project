Predicting the future The exhibition, titled Premonition: Ukrainian Art Now, is the biggest of its kind in the world, and will run until 3 November. But for a group of Ukrainian artists, the violence of 2014 was no surprise. "It really is uncanny," says Nigel Hurst, the CEO of the Saatchi Gallery in London, which is hosting a new exhibition of Ukrainian artworks. A spine-chilling 2012 painting by Vasily Tsagolov depicts a crowd of protesters with pitchforks, running side-by-side with skeletons. "A good number of the works are uplifting, using bright colors and witty references to Western pop culture and Soviet iconography," he says.
