But this year, New York voters sent the clear, hopeful message that identity politics would not drive their decisions. But the brilliant, ambitious Spitzer was always aiming for a return to political power, and he saw the comptroller's race as a means to that end, threatening to bigfoot the otherwise pedestrian campaign of mild-mannered policy wonk and career politician Scott Stringer. This year, city politics seemed determined to hit a new low rather than aspire to new heights. Weiner plummeted from first to fourth in the Democratic primary polls, with much of his support shifting to the aggressively progressive Public Advocate Bill De Blasio, who rose to pole position aided by powerful ads featuring his biracial son, Dante de Blasio, and a campaign theme focusing on inequality. In the past it has always been a cynical article of faith that winning campaigns were cobbled together by ethnic algebra.
