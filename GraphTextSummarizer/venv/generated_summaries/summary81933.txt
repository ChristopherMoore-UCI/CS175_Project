Brianti need just one hour and 17 minutes to defeat seventh seed Halep, who also lost in last year's final. The 22-year-old German stunned the Dane with an impeccable display on the clay, sending down 38 winners to become the first home winner since Anke Huber 17 years ago. Meanwhile at the Fes Grand Prix in Morocco, Italy's Alberta Brianti clinched her first WTA Tour title by beating Romania's Simona Halep 6-4 6-3 in the final on Sunday. The 31-year-old Brianti broke Halep's serve twice in the first set and three more times in the second as the 19-year-old struggled for consistency on her serve all match. It was Wozniacki's second final defeat of 2011 after she lost to Russia's Vera Zvonareva at the Qatar Ladies Open in Doha at the end of February.
