Under the care of "optimistic" doctors, Jahi McMath -- whom a judge and other doctors have declared brain-dead, over her family's objections -- is "improving" days after her release from an Oakland, California, hospital, her family's lawyer said. However, barring a misdiagnosis, medical experts say the teen's condition can't improve if she is truly "brain dead," because there's no way to come back to life once brain activity ceases. Jahi underwent a December 9 operation at the Northern California hospital to remove her tonsils, adenoids and extra sinus tissue. That conflict played into a weeks-long battle between the hospital, which wanted to remove Jahi from a ventilator, and her family, who believed she was showing signs of life. Due to privacy laws, hospital officials have not been able to discuss Jahi's case in detail.
