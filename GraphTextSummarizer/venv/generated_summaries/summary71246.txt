The 2012 European Captain Jose Maria Olazabal, and past European Ryder Cup captains Nick Faldo, Bernard Gallacher, Colin Montgomerie, Sam Torrance and Ian Woosnam, attended to pay their last respects to Ballesteros, a European Tour spokesman said. -- Ryder Cup captains past and present joined family and friends of golfing legend Severiano Ballesteros Wednesday for the funeral in his hometown parish church in the northern Spanish village of Pedrena. A three-time British Open champion and two-time Masters champion, Ballesteros was often credited for transforming European golf. His triumph at the 1979 British Open made him the youngest winner of the event that century and the first non-British European to do so since 1907. Ballesteros' website said someone also carried a three iron, the club he used when he started playing golf as a child.
