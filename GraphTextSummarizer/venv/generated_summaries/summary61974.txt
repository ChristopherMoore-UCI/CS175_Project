Dejesus is charged with aggravated child abuse with great harm, a first-degree felony, and aggravated child neglect with great harm, a second-degree felony. Lee Willie Dejesus, 23, of Homestead, appeared in court Wednesday night wearing a green protective vest reserved for those on suicide watch, reported CNN affiliate WFOR. Griffith said once prosecutors are notified the child has been taken off life support and pronounced dead, they are poised to file first-degree murder charges against Dejesus. Miami-Dade police said Dejesus was watching the child while his mother was at work Monday night. A criminal complaint alleges that Dejesus waited to call for medical help for as long as an hour after the boy became unresponsive.
