While the process will take days, at least sheets and towels that Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan used have been removed. Duncan's partner, identified only as Louise, told CNN's Anderson Cooper that hospital medical staff were twice told that Duncan, who was suffering with fever and abdominal pain, had recently arrived from West Africa -- key information that could have been a tipoff for Ebola, yet was never properly relayed. Official: U.S. focusing on 'source countries' As intense as the media attention is in the United States, the issues here are nothing compared to West Africa, where Ebola continues to spread through the living and the dead and where health facilities have often been unable to keep up with the outbreak. Official: 50 being monitored Until this week, Ebola's impact on the United States has been confined to preemptive measures at airports and elsewhere to stop its spread, the deployment of U.S. military and other resources to West Africa to help corral the outbreak there, and the treatment of a select few Americans who contacted the virus in Africa and were flown back home to get well. That sentiment was echoed Friday night by Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, who pointed out "there is only one person" -- Duncan, who is in isolated in a hospital -- "that is actively showing" signs of Ebola.
