Scully said efforts are under way to enlist conservationists to help Haiti, and a flurry of e-mails shared by collectors, curators, gallery owners and other interested parties show the urgency people are feeling to support the arts community. The significance of art in Haiti may be hard for outsiders to understand. For this reason, salvaging art, including the oldest piece in Haiti -- an 1822 painting buried in the national palace -- matters. The man who began a career using beets, carrots, tomatoes and black beans for paint creates vibrant abstractions of life and nature. But with few functioning institutions, few outlets of expression, Haiti's brightly colored depictions -- some laced with spiritual traditions of voodoo culture -- of sun and sea, people and animals serve as memory for a country that has suffered under dictatorships and failed governments and is today the poorest in the Americas.
