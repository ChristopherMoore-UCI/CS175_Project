Because it lives in the deep, the pancake batfish is not threatened by tar balls or the surface sheen of oil -- but by undersea oil plumes identified by researchers from the University of South Florida. But Chakrabarty says this subspecies of batfish could be wiped out even if it doesn't directly encounter oil. Chakrabarty says that one ray of hope for the newly discovered species are the oil-consuming bacteria that thrive on crude oil. On June 8, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration confirmed that tests done by the University's researchers proved the existence of subsurface oil clusters. And if oil stays deep under water, the gulf could lose it before it's even officially recognized as a species.
