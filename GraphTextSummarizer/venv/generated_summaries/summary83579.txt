On Saturday night, shortly after we learned of the horrific slayings of two New York police officers at the hands of a man who reportedly said he wanted to avenge the deaths of Garner and Michael Brown, Lynch released one of the most irresponsible statements I've ever heard from a person in his position. And here's what New York City police union leader Patrick Lynch and others like him in the New York Police Department don't get: I'm not the exception. In fact, former New York Gov. George Pataki, a Republican who is said to be considering a presidential run in 2016, made comments similar to Lynch's via Twitter, where he blamed de Blasio for the tragedy. First, he blamed New York Mayor Bill de Blasio -- who has in the past been slightly critical of certain of the department's actions -- saying that the "blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall in the office of the mayor." To me, these falling poll numbers are tied, at least in part, to a case like Eric Garner, the unarmed man placed in a chokehold by a New York officer and who died a short time later.
