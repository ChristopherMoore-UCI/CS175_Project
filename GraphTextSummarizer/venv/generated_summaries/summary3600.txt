The 25-year-old former University of Delaware rugby player joined the nonprofit Invisible Children last year and spent much of his time as an unpaid volunteer, traveling with the group around the United States, said spokesman Jedidiah Jenkins. " Henn -- a native of Raleigh, North Carolina -- had worked with the nonprofit for a year and a half and raised money to help educate Ugandan students affected by war. The nonprofit organization works with Ugandan children affected by decades of war between rebels and government forces. Henn, who lived in San Diego, California, joined Invisible Children through his sister's work with the organization. When they chatted last week, Henn told Kibler he wanted to continue working with charitable organizations.
