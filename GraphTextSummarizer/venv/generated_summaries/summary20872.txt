The panel is growing from three to four judges next season, with singer Mariah Carey, hired in July, and "Idol" original Randy Jackson sitting with Minaj and Urban, the network said. -- Rapper Nicki Minaj and Australian country singer Keith Urban will join the "American Idol" judges panel when the TV competition's 12th season starts in January, the Fox network said Sunday. The judges immediately jumped into action Sunday, auditioning singers at New York's Lincoln Center. Earlier speculation also included the names of Latin singer Enrique Iglesias and former "Idol" contestant Adam Lambert as possible judges. Rocker Steven Tyler and singer Jennifer Lopez left the show at the end of last season, after judging for two seasons.
