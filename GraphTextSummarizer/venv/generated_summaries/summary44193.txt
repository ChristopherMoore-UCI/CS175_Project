That year was a time of transition for me and to "keep moving forward," I knew I had to be part of the 2013 CNN Fit Nation team. In January 2012, I joined my local Y, where I started taking water classes such as HÂ²O cardio and hydrorider. I left all the words and actions that hurt and haunted me since childhood along with the unhealthy, unhappy woman I used to be at the finish line in Malibu on September 8, 2013. One morning I heard Jeff Dauler on "The Bert Show" recount the biggest lesson he had learned from being part of the CNN Fit Nation 2012 team. Bobbette got a new kidney in June and was finally getting back on her feet in September.
