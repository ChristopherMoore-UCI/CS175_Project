Kim Kyung Hee is the sister of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader who died a little more than three years ago and left his son in power. Presumed dead by some, the actual fate of the aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un remains unconfirmed because of the secretive nature of that country. Lawmakers in neighboring South Korea told the news agency Yonhap Tuesday that the country's National Intelligence Service reported there is no evidence that Kim Kyung Hee died. Last year, a North Korean defector said that Kim Kyung Hee had died from a stroke while arguing on the phone with the North Korean leader about her husband's execution. CNN could not verify claims of Kim Kyung Hee's fate.
