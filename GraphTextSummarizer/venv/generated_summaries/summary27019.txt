Sam responded that he'd "been in locker rooms with all kinds of slurs (being) said," but didn't take it personally believing that those players using such language were probably "a little naive." So the questions came, like how he felt about gay slurs flying around among teammates. The revelation stirred a flurry of talk and debate about whether pro football players would accept a homosexual teammate, and whether Sam's announcement could hurt his chances of being drafted and ultimately making a team. And so Sam patiently fielded question after question that, directly or indirectly, related to his sexuality and topics such as gay slurs, bullying and more. He gave special thanks to members of the Missouri community -- stating "I am M-I-Z-Z-O-U, I'm a Tiger forever" -- while also expressing appreciation for many more people who he's never met.
