According to a memorandum released Thursday by the Broward County State Attorney's Office, Cusanelli told authorities this July 28 that he put Klee's body inside his black Chevy van after he was dead and that his brother, Carl Cusanelli, helped shove the van into the canal. " Klee's mother, Florence Klee, clutched a framed photo of her son but did not speak during Thursday's news conference. Police had long thought Klee's best friend, David Cusanelli, was the last person to see him alive June 21, 1977. Cusanelli, according to the memo, said he panicked and put Klee's body inside his van. But Cusanelli denied involvement in Klee's death, prosecutors said.
