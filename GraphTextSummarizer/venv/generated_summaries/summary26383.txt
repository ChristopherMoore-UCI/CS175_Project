White House officials are is lowering expectations, cautioning the numbers "will be lower than we hoped and we anticipated," Carney said. White House spokesperson Jay Carney said Obama agreed with Clinton and is working to address the matter of people losing their coverage. That's when House Republicans will take up a bill to address one of the more politically potent Obamacare problems for the President and Democrats -- those losing their health coverage due to the law despite Obama's assurances in selling it to the public that Americans could keep their plans if they wanted. He said very clearly he was sorry if he misled people." Durbin added that Republicans and Democrats "need to be open to constructive changes to make this law work better." Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, introduced a narrower bill than what House Republicans are planning with Upton's plan and said that she has growing support in the Senate, including Dianne Feinstein, Joe Manchin, Mark Pryor and Kay Hagan -- all Democrats. Things could get even more heated on Wednesday when White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park will testify before a congressional committee investigating the rocky rollout of the HealthCare.gov website, the Obama administration said.
