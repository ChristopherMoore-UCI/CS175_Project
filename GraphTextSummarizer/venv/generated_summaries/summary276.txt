The Diversity Visa program offers up to 55,000 visas worldwide each year to applicants "drawn from random selection among all entries to persons who meet strict eligibility requirements from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States," according to the State Department website. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad is warning Iraqis who want to enter the annual visa lottery to be wary of a scam that instructs applicants to send money via Western Union to someone apparently at the U.S. Embassy in London. The winners get green cards, meaning they are permanent residents of the U.S. The embassy said any Iraqi who worked with a private entity to apply should be cautious, because  some people apparently have been sent letters instructing them to pay money up front. It's free to enter the random drawing through the State Department website dvlottery.state.gov.
