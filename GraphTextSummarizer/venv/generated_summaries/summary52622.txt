In addition to accusing Diallo of inciting violence, Dore singled out journalist Mouctar Bah (no relation to Oury Bah) of French radio RFI for calling the government repression of post-election protesters "bloody." "What he said was a violation of the law because he cannot show a pool of blood in any Conakry neighborhood," Dore said. The Guinean government has declared a national state of emergency and a curfew restricting movement of people from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., but residents of ethnic Peul neighborhoods in the Conakry suburbs of Enco5, Bambeto, Hamdallaye and Cosa said that security forces entered the homes of civilians and shot at innocent people before and after the curfew was called. Amnesty International, the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights and the International Crisis Group have all detailed what they say are examples of arbitrary arrests, excessive force, incitement of ethnic hatred and killings by Guinean security officials. The African nation's Supreme Court must now look at fraud allegations put forth by both Diallo and Conde, and will finalize the results by December 2. This comes after three days of clashes between Diallo partisans and supporters of Conde and security officials in multiple cities around the country.
