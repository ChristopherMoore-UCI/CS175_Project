Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti has backed his Â£50 million ($80.5 million) striker Fernando Torres to live up to his price tag after the Spain striker's disappointing debut against his former club Liverpool. Meanwhile, Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted by his team's performance in a fourth straight win but dismissed talk of Torres' departure being an extra incentive. The defeat leaves defending champions Chelsea still 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester United, with games running out but Ancelotti is hoping Torres and the other new signing, central defender David Luiz, will be up to the task. It was a difficult game, obviously we are disappointed, but both Fernando Torres and David Luiz will be the future for this club,' Ancelotti added. Torres admitted that Liverpool's tactics of deploying three central defenders had proved effective.
