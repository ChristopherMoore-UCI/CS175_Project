For decades, the government has spent more money than it has taken in, which is why we have debt and why it's so high. So in order to raise that ceiling so the U.S. can borrow more money to keep things going, the debt ceiling has to be increased by Congress. So, the debt ceiling is the absolute top amount of money that the U.S. can owe to anyone at any given time. He's been able to move piles of money around and basically keep us solvent until August 2nd. That's just on the five costliest government programs, and it's already more money than the goverment would have!
