The Gospel Music Channel's talent search is going into its fourth season, and Locke joins fellow host Mike Kasem (son of Casey Kasem) and the judges -- gospel artist J. Moss, Destiny's Child member Michelle Williams and industry executive Mitchell Solarek -- on the show. "American Idol" finalist Kimberley Locke is the new co-host of "Gospel Dream." CNN: How did you get involved with "Gospel Dream?" Kimberley Locke: Having placed third during season two of "American Idol" -- just behind winner Ruben Studdard and runner-up Clay Aiken -- the singer is back in reality show action as the new co-host of "Gospel Dream." How is "Gospel Dream" different? Locke: It's different in that the contestants are very focused on where they want to be and the type of music they want to sing.
