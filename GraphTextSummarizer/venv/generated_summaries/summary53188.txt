" While Beckham will curtail his time in Paris at the end of the season, Clement hopes to remain to continue his work alongside manager Carlo Ancelotti. Paul Clement, the assistant manager of Paris Saint-Germain, became a close confidante of his compatriot Beckham following the midfielder's arrival in the French capital last January.
