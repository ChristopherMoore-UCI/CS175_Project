We hope that as Libya prospers and grows, the government will recognize the importance of these sites, as a possible boon to the tourism industry but also as a source of economic diversification and patriotic reconciliation. The ruins of Leptis Magna, Sabrata, Cyrene (also called Shahhat) and all the other incredible remnants of Libya's rich history can be an example of the glory of Libya's past -- but also its hope for the future. Its people have the opportunity to design a fit-for-purpose political system, which takes into account Libya's diverse peoples, tribes and cultures, creating a unique national identity. I anticipate celebrating contemporary art alongside the ancient monuments and illustrating that Libya can show its maturity, but also its innovation and creativity. I hope that Libya's development will usher in new forms of expression, and I look forward to seeing how that newfound expression will find its place in the visual arts.
