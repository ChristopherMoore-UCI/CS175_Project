Germany is riding high after annihilating host country Brazil 7-1 in their semifinal, a defeat so brutal that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff said she'd never imagined such a horror in her worst nightmares. In a World Cup already marked by stunning victories and catastrophic defeats, trying to guess the next World Cup champion is pretty much moot. Back when West Germany was still a country, it lost to Argentina in 1986. Four years later, Argentina lost to West Germany in 1990. Sadly, unlike the last World Cup in 2010, there is no psychic cephalopod placing its bets on this year's victor.
