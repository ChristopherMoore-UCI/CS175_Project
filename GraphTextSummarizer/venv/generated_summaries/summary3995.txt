Now that the two countries have worked together for five years in Iraq and eight in Afghanistan, there is a generation of officers and enlisted service members "for whom coalition operations are the norm," Petraeus said. The cooperation included the British SAS, or special forces, which were "fully integrated" into U.S. special operations teams, Petraeus said. "It's clear that, as was the case in Iraq, the scale of the British contribution in Afghanistan is such that the coalition cannot succeed without you," Petraeus told the British audience. Gen. David Petraeus was speaking at a conference here at the Royal United Services Institute, where he said Britain has played an "irreplaceable" role in Iraq, and a similar role in Afghanistan. "It is one thing to deploy our people to combat zones and have them adapt to coalition operations and build effective teams, which they've shown they can do amazingly well," he said.
