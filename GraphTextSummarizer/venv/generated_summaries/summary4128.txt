-- Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted by the International Criminal Court on charges of war crimes and genocide, will attend this week's Arab Summit in Baghdad, Iraqi state television reported Sunday. Sudan's Bashir has traveled to other Arab countries despite the ICC warrants against him for alleged war crimes and genocide in the Darfur region, where rebels have fought government forces and allied militiamen such as the Janjaweed since 2003. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby arrived Sunday in Baghdad for the summit with a small delegation, Iraqiya TV reported. The report by Iraqiya TV said the office of President Jalal Talabani announced Bashir's intention to attend the summit on March 29. This year's summit begins with preparatory meetings starting Tuesday involving government ministers.
