"Therefore FIFA is currently monitoring the situation and waiting for action taken by the Nigerian [federation]." As they entered the third and final round of matches to determine which team would gain promotion to the Nationwide League Division 3, Plateau United and Police Machine were level on points, goal difference and goals scored. The scores were the biggest seen in African football since Madagascar's AS Adema won 149-0 in a 2002 match where losing side Stade Olympique l'Emyrne scored numerous own goals in protest at a refereeing decision. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) indefinitely suspended the winning sides and their beaten opponents as it launched an investigation into an incident it termed "a mind-boggling show of shame never previously witnessed in Nigerian football." News of what leading NFF official Mike Umeh has called a "scandal of huge proportions" come in a year when Nigerian football has been on the up. The second half witnessed a tsunami of goals, with United netting on 72 occasions and Police Machine plundering 61 strikes themselves.
