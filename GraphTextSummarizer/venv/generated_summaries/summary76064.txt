"No one could give a good account of what it was, so we did the safe thing and called (the) NYPD bomb squad," Port Authority Police Department spokesman Al Della Fave told CNN. TSA officials said the checkpoint was not closed, nor was the terminal evacuated, during the incident. When that officer later learned they were not test items, the officer alerted others, and the TSA contacted the Port Authority Police Department, responsible for protecting the airport. -- A New York airport screener who removed two pipes from a traveler's bag and set them aside Monday morning prompted a security scare six hours later when the next shift saw the pipes and feared they might be pipe bombs, local and federal officials said. The incident at New York's LaGuardia Airport began at 11:30 a.m. when a screener discovered unidentifiable items inside a passenger's carry-on bag.
