Abidal has collected a Cop del Rey winner's medal on two occasions and helped Barca clinch European Champions League glory in 2009 and 2011. -- Barcelona defender Eric Abidal returned to training Wednesday after seven months on the sidelines following a liver transplant. Abidal, hugely popular with the Barca fans, began his career with Monaco before moving to Lille in 2002. He was a part of the Barca squad which won three consecutive La Liga titles between 2009 and 2011. The world of football was stunned when Abidal was diagnosed with a liver tumor in May 2011, but he made a remarkable recovery to reclaim his place in the first team squad at the Camp Nou.
