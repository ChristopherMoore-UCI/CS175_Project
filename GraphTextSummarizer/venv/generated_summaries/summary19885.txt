Fortunately, there are better voice control options on both the iPhone and Android handsets than either Siri or Iris. Yet it took the India-based software company Dexetra just eight hours to create the initial version of Iris -- a blatant Android knockoff of Siri. Even the name "Iris," which is the reverse of "Siri," stands for "Intelligent Rival Imitator of Siri" according to Dexetra's blog. So Iris is about as entertaining as Siri seems to be. Still, neither Iris nor Siri seems very useful so far.
