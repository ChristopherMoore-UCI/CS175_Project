The reconciliation process is well under way, and despite the complex history between my two homelands, the U.S. and Lao governments can be on the right side of history and clear Laos of these deadly bombs once and for all. One ton of bombs was dropped for every person in Laos at the time, making the nation the most heavily bombed per capita in history. After all, the U.S.-backed war in Laos left the U.S. and the new government of Laos in tense relations for decades. That way, the dreams that my parents had for me when I resettled in the U.S. -- to live freely and with bountiful opportunities -- may also be realized for the children in Laos for generations to come. We have a long way to go, but this is a problem that can be solved -- as long as the U.S., in cooperation with Laos and other international donors, makes a long-term, sustained funding commitment.
