For the past four years, his character, Charlie Harper, has been dead as a doornail, but the finale showed us that Charlie's "widow," Rose, had been keeping him in a pit in her basement all this time. As the hour unfolded, Alan (Jon Cryer) and Walden (Ashton Kutcher) discovered that Charlie was alive and coming for them to get revenge. The pair  tried to get help from a police detective played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who captured Charlie (though it turned out to be Christian Slater he'd caught). With a minute remaining in the show, Alan and Walden spotted a helicopter in the distance, carrying a piano belonging to Charlie. Rose (Melanie Lynskey) explained (in a bizarre animated sequence) that Charlie's life had been saved at the last minute by a goat who jumped in front of the train meant for him, and she took him back to hold him hostage.
