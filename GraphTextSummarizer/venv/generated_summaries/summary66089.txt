-- Oscar-winning actor Javier Bardem calls Israel's treatment of Palestinians "genocide," while "Wonder Woman" actress Gal Gadot sends her "love and prayers" to Israeli soldiers in Gaza. "Ã‚ Gal Gadot, the actress cast as the new incarnation of Wonder Woman, used her Facebook page to show support for Israel. Her posting is not a surprise, considering she served in the Israeli army and represented her country as Miss Israel. Veteran Hollywood publicist Michael Levine cautions clients to be careful about stepping into the public relations controversies that surround any comment on the Israel-Gaza crisis. My only wish and intention in signing that group letter is the hope that there will be peace in both Israel and Gaza.
