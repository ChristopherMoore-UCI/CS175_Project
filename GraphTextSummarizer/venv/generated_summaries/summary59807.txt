UConn guard on unions: I go to bed 'starving' Northwestern coach urges players to vote against unionization Opinion: The hypocrisy of big-time college sports It's the latest reaction to the ruling last month by the National Labor Relations Board in Chicago that football players at Illinois' Northwestern University are considered employees of their school and can vote to form a union. -- As the right of college athletes to form unions is debated across the country, at least one state is moving to head off that idea at the pass. State lawmakers in Connecticut have expressed support, praising University of Connecticut guard Shabazz Napier -- named the most valuable player in the team's win Monday over the University of Kentucky for the NCAA basketball championship -- for talking out about NCAA reform. Other private schools, like Duke and Stanford, have had meetings on the issue, according to remarks by Northwestern's president emeritus Henry Bienen at the Knight Commission on intercollegiate athletics last month.
