That article called out charities that "place high values on GIK (gifts-in-kind) donations" in order to "falsely appear to be spending a higher percentage of their funds on programs than other groups that receive mostly cash contributions." " SPCA International told CNN it follows "industry standards and accounting regulations" in placing values on donated goods. "If a product can be purchased at one level and the charity, for whatever reason, or the intermediary raises the value significantly, then one can say there's a potential for overstatement of value," said Luke Hingson, president of Brother's Brother, a Pittsburgh-based charity that ships donated goods worldwide. -- Standing amid pallets of bottled water, suntan lotion and boxes of candies, Roy Tidwell says he is providing a service that can't be duplicated: shipping needed goods to dozens of charities at a low cost. But CharityWatch president Daniel Borochoff says determining the worth of gifts-in-kind donations is simple: Charities should report what they paid for the items.
