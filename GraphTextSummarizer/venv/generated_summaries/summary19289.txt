Preterm or premature births are defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation. Thirty-five states and Washington reduced the percentage of women of childbearing age who smoked, and 28 states, Washington and Puerto Rico lowered the rate of late preterm births: infants born between 34 and 36 weeks gestation. The organization compared birth rates with its goal of 9.6% by 2020. Compared with 2006, nearly all states had lower preterm birth rates in 2012. "A premature birth costs businesses about 12 times as much as uncomplicated healthy birth," March of Dimes President Dr. Jennifer L. Howse said in a statement.
