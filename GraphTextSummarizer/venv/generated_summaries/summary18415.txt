"I'm sensing some frustration and polarization," said Sheridan lawyer Mark Baute, after the judge sent jurors home for the day with orders to try again Friday morning. -- Jurors in actress Nicollette Sheridan's wrongful termination lawsuit against "Desperate Housewives" creator Marc Cherry told the judge they were "having difficulty reaching a verdict" Wednesday afternoon. Baute called Cherry a "really obvious liar" who was covering up the real reason he killed off Edie Britt, the sassy blonde character Sheridan played for the show's first five seasons. Five months and 11 episodes later, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five-year run on "Desperate Housewives. The defense won one victory Tuesday when the judge issued a directed verdict dismissing Sheridan's battery claim against Cherry.
