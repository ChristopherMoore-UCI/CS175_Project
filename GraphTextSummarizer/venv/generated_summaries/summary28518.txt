Globovision is Venezuela's last remaining television broadcaster that is openly critical of President Hugo Chavez. -- Venezuela's telecommunications regulator, Conatel, fined private television broadcaster Globovision Tuesday 7.5% of its gross income for alleged violations of the country's media responsibility laws, marking the latest salvo in the long-running feud between the broadcaster and the government. His government has also gone after the owner of Globovision, Guillermo Zuloaga, who is wanted in Venezuela for allegedly illegally storing vehicles at his Caracas home with the intent to sell them for a profit. Claudio Paolillo, a member of the freedom of expression committee of the Inter-American Press Association, likened Chavez to a dictator in an interview with Globovision and said the fine was a roundabout way to shutter the station. Globovision defended its coverage of the prison standoff, which started with a riot that killed at least 22 people and turned into a nearly monthlong standoff between prisoners and national guard troops.
