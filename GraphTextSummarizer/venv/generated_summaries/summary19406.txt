Coach Jurgen Klopp's team later saw defending champions Bayern Munich move up to second place on goal difference above Bayer Leverkusen, who host lowly Stuttgart on Sunday. The defeat left visiting Kaiserslautern third from bottom on goal difference behind 2009 champions Wolfsburg, who lost 2-1 at sixth-placed Freiburg. Barrios netted for the first time this year after doing well to control Nuri Sahin's cross, and his ball across goal forced Gunesch to turn the ball into his own net with Robert Lewandowski waiting behind him to score. Wolfsburg led when Turkey striker Tuncay Sanli helped set up fellow new signing Patrick Helmes, but substitute Stefan Reisinger leveled just before halftime and Papiss Demba Cisse's 69th-minute winner was his 16th goal this season. Hamburg claimed seventh place above Nuremberg -- 3-0 winners over Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday -- following a crushing 4-0 victory at home to Werder Bremen.
