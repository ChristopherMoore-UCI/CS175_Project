Noronha says AVA Solar needs two things: Government loans to expand its factory, and more government assistance to help power companies commit to building large solar power plants in the United States. The plant, set to begin production in the spring, will construct solar panels for solar power plants. " Noronha says his company's biggest customer base is in Germany, a country that is far ahead of the United States in embracing solar energy. -- A Colorado solar-energy company has high hopes for the economic stimulus bill that President Barack Obama will sign Tuesday in Denver. Once production is up to speed, CEO Pascal Noronha says, the plant should create enough solar panels a year to power 40,000 U.S. homes.
