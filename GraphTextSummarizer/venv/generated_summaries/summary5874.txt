The group of Central American migrants was traveling on "The Beast," a noisy, often-dangerous cargo train that rumbles through Mexico. The Honduran migrant says she's lucky to be alive: She was traveling on a cargo train in southern Mexico with other migrants when a group of armed men assaulted them. The governments of Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador are asking Mexico to thoroughly investigate disappearances, abuses and deaths of their citizens in Mexican territory. The case was brought to the attention of authorities by Alejandro Solalinde, a Catholic priest who operates a shelter for traveling migrants in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca. Last summer, 72 migrants who were trying to reach the United States by traveling on the ground in Mexico were shot and killed in the border state of Tamaulipas.
