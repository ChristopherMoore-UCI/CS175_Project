Anna Kendrick (from "Up in the Air") works hard to make her novice psychologist believable -- a tall order in the circumstances but she carries it off well enough -- while Bryce Dallas Howard bravely follows "The Help" with another chilly narcissist, Adam's girlfriend Rachel. But the mordant camaraderie Adam strikes up with his much older fellow patients (Philip Baker Hall and Matt Frewer) rings true, actually. Based on an autobiographical screenplay by Will Reiser (a friend of Seth Rogen who apparently went through the same diagnosis), "50/50" generally avoids the terminal whimsy that swamps Gus Van Sant's current arty atrocity, "Restless" in favor of practical real-life concerns like getting to and from the hospital, eating and allowing your loved ones their share of the suffering (Anjelica Huston more or less steals the movie with a knockout turn as a difficult and overbearing but still caring mom). It's no cure for cancer, but when we're dealing with such a painful topic it sure doesn't hurt to laugh -- or cry -- and know you're in good company. Adam shaves his head and admits to some weariness, but that's about as far down that depressing road director Jonathan Levine wants to take us.
