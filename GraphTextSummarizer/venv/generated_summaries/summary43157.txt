Over the past 60 years, residents of Port Said have felt betrayed by Egyptian security forces during a series of wars with Israel. Thousands of residents were displaced several times because of the Suez War, the Six-Day War of 1967, the War of Attrition with Israel, and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War. In addition, some say Cairo has not invested enough in Port Said's infrastructure, and that their city doesn't reap enough tax benefits from trade with international ships that pass though Port Said via the critical Suez Canal. Residents of Port Said, in northeastern Egypt, believed security forces did not adequately defend their city. Then on Saturday, a judge issued death sentences for 21 people from Port Said for their roles in a football game riot last year.
