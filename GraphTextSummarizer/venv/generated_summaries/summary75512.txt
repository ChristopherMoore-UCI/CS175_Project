Behind the scenes, these companies have full-time staffs of privacy experts, lawyers and engineers who are juggling an array of privacy demands.

Public changes to privacy policies, like the ones that make news when Facebook or Google change their settings, are just a small part of the story. Privacy experts from Facebook, Google, Mozilla and Microsoft have been tackling these big questions this week at the RSA security conference in San Francisco.
