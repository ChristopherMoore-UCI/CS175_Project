Provoking and unsettling is a major part of ISIS media strategy. Western counter-messages and social media offences will hardly prevent this. So in essence, it is as simple as to keep doing what ISIS media people are already doing. A few more posts, pictures or videos featuring ISIS fighters with French, British or German voices are sufficient to scare Western politicians and their respective electorates. This is not so much because ISIS and its supporters have created media arms like those radical Islamic groups al-Furqan or al-Hayat.
