The report is expected in June, and police have cited fewer officers and limited budgets for hiring more officers since 2008 as causes for longer response times, the newspaper reported. Lance Kirk, brother of Richard Kirk, told CNN affiliate KWGN that he was stunned to hear of the incident. In response to questions about the incident, Denver Police Chief Robert White told reporters Thursday he had opened an internal review of why it took officers more than 12 minutes to respond, CNN affiliate KUSA reported. Investigators will look at the time it took operators, dispatchers and police officers to handle the call, he said. The city of Denver auditor's office this year began studying police response times, which have grown longer in recent years, the Denver Post reported.
