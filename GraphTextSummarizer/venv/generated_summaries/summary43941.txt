It was the second day of BDR Week, when army officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations. Recruits complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and opportunities to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations. Bangladesh and its South Asian neighbors contribute the most troops to U.N. operations and the pay is far greater than the meager salary the jawans -- as the BDR troops are called -- make. The mutiny began Wednesday when BDR members took dozens of their superiors hostage. Another 27 emerged from their captivity in the headquarters of the BDR, a 65,000-strong paramilitary outfit primarily responsible for guarding the country's borders.
