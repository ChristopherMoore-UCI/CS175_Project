-- Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta resigned Friday after less than a year in office, according to a statement released by the Italian presidential palace. Berlusconi, a billionaire tycoon who has dominated Italian politics for two decades, was the last elected leader. He has alienated many people on the left in his party but, as a perhaps more centrist leader, he has been able to pick up some disgruntled supporters of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. The last election to produce a leader was in 2008, when Berlusconi became Prime Minister for a third time. He's likely to be replaced by Democratic Party leader Matteo Renzi, a rising political star who won the party's primary a couple of months ago.
