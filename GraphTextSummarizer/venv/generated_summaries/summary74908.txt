The violence spiked as Syria agreed to an Arab League observer mission Monday aimed at ending the violence between regime forces and protesters that started in mid-March. In another incident, Abdel Azeez Al-Khair, an Alawite opposition figure from the National Coordination Body, was detained briefly at the Damascus airport before he tried to take a flight to Cairo to discuss Syria with Arab League officials, two opposition figures told CNN. "While Syrian security forces have also taken casualties, the overwhelming majority of the violence and loss of life in Syria stems from the actions of the Assad regime, and we call on all parties to put an end to violence. We urge Syria's few remaining supporters in the international community to warn Damascus that if the Arab League initiative is once again not fully implemented, the international community will take additional steps to pressure the Assad regime to stop its crackdown," the White House statement said. CNN could not independently verify the allegations of violence or other incidents because Syria restricts the activity of journalists in the country.
