Brazil under Dunga was less free flowing and more solid defensively but entered the World Cup on a roll, having won the 2009 Confederations Cup and finishing atop the standings in South American qualifying. But both are struggling in front of goal -- Damiao hasn't netted in the league since the end of August while Uruguay star Forlan's drought extends to July. He started every game at the 1994 World Cup and captained Brazil when it beat Italy on penalties in the final in Los Angeles. Dunga played in the 1998 World Cup final in France, too, although Brazil lost to the host 3-0. The slump comes even with big-name strikers Leandro Damiao -- heavily linked with Tottenham of the English Premier League -- and Diego Forlan on its books.
