-- Demonstrations that began with quiet determination on the internet more than three weeks ago erupted into riotous jubilation Friday evening, moments after it was announced that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was stepping aside. In Alexandria, Fatima Puskar, an American living with her Egyptian husband, Emad, said she was watching Egyptian state TV when news of Mubarak's resignation was announced. One of the movement's key activists, Wael Ghonim, credited ordinary Egyptians for persisting through historic and sometimes violent protests that led to the first ouster of an Egyptian leader since 1952. Protesters swarmed army tanks that had been deployed to keep order, banged drums, blew whistles and frantically waved Egyptian flags in celebration. On the front lines of the movement, protester and actor Khalid Abdallah, best known for his role in "The Kite Runner," expressed complete shock at Mubarak's decision to step down, but said Egyptians now feel like "destiny is in their hands," and he praised supporters of their struggle.
