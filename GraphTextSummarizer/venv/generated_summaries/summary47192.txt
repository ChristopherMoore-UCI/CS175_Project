Not surprisingly, Google Music will not integrate with Facebook Music, the aggregation service that launched recently from Google's social-network rival. Google touted that, unlike other music stores, people who find songs through Google+ will be able to listen to each one in full for free one time before they buy. With Google Music or Amazon.com's Cloud Drive, users with a lot of music may have to wait several days for their entire catalogs to upload. Songs purchased from the store are automatically uploaded to Google Music, a locker that can be accessed from an app coming to recent Android phones and tablets in the next few days, or from a website. The music store sells songs and albums for prices comparable to iTunes and Amazon MP3, but Google's catalog is smaller.
