Less than two weeks ago, Odile snapped palm trees, washed out roads, trashed outdoor markets and damaged facilities, including the Los Cabos airport. On Saturday, the 12th storm so far this summer and fall grew to hurricane status -- not threatening anything on land yet, though it would certainly be understandable if folks on the Mexican coast with fresh memories of Hurricane Odile are a little spooked. As of 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET), Hurricane Rachel was centered well offshore about 460 miles west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. It is expected to continue in this direction, and get a little slower, through Sunday, though "little motion" is expected come Monday. The region's most recent big hit came compliments of Hurricane Odile.
