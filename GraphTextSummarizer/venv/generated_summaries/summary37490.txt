The e-mail, which instructed fellow fraternity members on "luring rapebait" and contained several references to using alcohol as a means of sexual persuasion, caught the attention of online communities and prompted Georgia Tech and Phi Kappa Tau to issue statements and conduct investigations into the incident. In response to an incendiary e-mail that drew criticism from online sites and on-campus organizations alike, a Georgia Tech student and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity member has stepped forward and issued an apology in the school's newspaper. Matthew ended his e-mail by saying, "I will conduct myself to more honorably reflect the ideals of Georgia Tech in the future. " The Georgia Tech community has been vocal over the incident. "Misogynistic behavior is everywhere online and unfortunately, my attempt to ridicule it in an immature and outrageous satire backfired terribly and in a manner I mistakenly underestimated," Matthew wrote in Technique, Georgia Tech's student newspaper.
