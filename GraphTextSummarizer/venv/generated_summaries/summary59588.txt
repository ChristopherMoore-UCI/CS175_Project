-- Tilikum, the killer whale that killed SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau last year, has returned to the stage at the Orlando theme park. On this day when Tilikum is the star of the show, Frogameni said, "We want people to remember Dawn's life, not that tragic accident." CNN's Dugald McConnell contributed to this report. The agency's investigation "revealed that SeaWorld trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities, including its location in Orlando," OSHA said. "We figured a great way to honor her is to focus on that." SeaWorld told CNN that a request for information on Tilikum's return must submitted in writing. In August, SeaWorld was fined $75,000 by the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one referring to the death of Brancheau.
