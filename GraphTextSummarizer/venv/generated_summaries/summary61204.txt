-- Communities in northeastern Mexico found themselves flooded and isolated Tuesday as Mexico's National Water Commission tried to manage high levels at area reservoirs due to Hurricane Alex. He said that the communities of San Antonio de Reyna, Mexico, and Arcabuz, Mexico, faced flooded homes, ruined sorghum crops and disabled work equipment as well as lack of electricity and phone lines, Notimex reported. The mayor said his town was not affected directly by Hurricane Alex, but by the lack of coordination between reservoir managers and local officials. Servando Lopez Moreno, mayor of Miguel Aleman, Mexico, said that the water commission released water from the nearby El Cuchillo reservoir without warning communities near the river, which flooded homes and crops, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. In the neighboring state of Nuevo Leon, the effects of Alex were more direct.
