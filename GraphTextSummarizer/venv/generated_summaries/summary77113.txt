Walmart did not disclose financial details for the partnership, which Neil Ashe, president and chief executive of Walmart Global e-commerce, said would help deliver a "superb customer experience" to consumers in China. In October, Walmart China closed its stores in Chongqing for a fortnight after the local government found it had mislabeled ordinary pork as organic. Mr Ashe said that, in addition to helping Walmart's e-commerce goals in China, the increased investment in Yihaodian would "further contribute to China's domestic consumption, help stabilize prices, and advance expansion in the middle and western regions" of China -- a nod to Beijing's oft-repeated desire to make progress on these goals in the current Five Year plan. Walmart has more than 350 stores in China, where it has been making steady progress. In the three months to the end of October it reported a 16.1% increase in China sales from the previous year, but although individual shoppers were spending more money on each trip, visitor numbers were down 7.1%.
