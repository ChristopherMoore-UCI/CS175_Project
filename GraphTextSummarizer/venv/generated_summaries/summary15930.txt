"During a brainstorming session, we were talking about discounts and promotions and wanted to come up with something different than the same promotions and discounts," said Rancho Bernardo general manager John Gates. " Rancho Bernardo's "Survivor Package" starts at $219 per night, but customers are allowed to customize and pick their price point. " Gates said he has received several phone calls, and 50 customers have already booked a reservation at the $19 price. "For $19 a night, a customer gets a shell with a tent inside," says Rancho Bernardo Inn's John Gates. Guests can lower the cost by opting to give up breakfast and other luxury items, including toiletries.
