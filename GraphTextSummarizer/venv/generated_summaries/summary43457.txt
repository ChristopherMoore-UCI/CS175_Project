Attached to the report was an essay authored by two economists who argue that that reform is needed to boost the legal immigration of highly-educated workers to the U.S. "The disproportionate focus on illegal immigration is missing the picture that the legal system of immigration is broken as well," Federal Reserve senior economist Pia Orrenius told CNN. Orrenius and Zavodny also point out that U.S. policy on granting green-card status to immigrants overwhelmingly favors relatives of U.S. citizens, other legal residents or refugees. In highly technical fields, immigrants tend to complement U.S. born workers by moving into expanding fields "where native labor supply cannot keep up," the author's Federal Reserve essay states. Employment-based green cards for skilled workers and their families account for 15% of the total issued by the U.S. government every year, according to the authors. and unless the American government enacts immigration reform, the U.S. "risks falling behing in the global race for talent," according to a report released Wednesday.
