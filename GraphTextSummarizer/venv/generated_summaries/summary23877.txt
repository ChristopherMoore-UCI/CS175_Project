In 2002, a U.S. helicopter mistakenly bombed a house full of wedding guests in Afghanistan, killing more than 30, including children. And as children tend to do, they disobeyed their parents to play on the beach where they had always been safe before. Children will one day go outside to play and they may never come home. It's not just the U.S. and its allies whose military strikes end up hitting children. In 2012, a U.S. Army sergeant walked more than a mile from his base late one night and killed 16 unarmed Afghans, nine of them children, in their homes.
