For days, there had been speculation about whether Knight and the women held with her -- Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry -- would attend the sentencing hearing of Ariel Castro, who pleaded guilty last week to 937 counts in a deal that eliminated a possible death penalty in exchange for life in prison plus 1,000 years. Knight, DeJesus, Berry and Berry's 6-year-old daughter were held in Castro's 1,400-square-foot home with boarded-up windows and peeling paint on Seymour Avenue. It was the first time Knight had been in the same room with Castro since she was freed from 11 years of captivity on May 6 after neighbors heard Berry's cries and broke down a door. Under threat of death by Castro, Knight was forced to deliver Berry's child, Ochberg said. Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, told The Plain Dealer in May, that the family had concluded that Michelle had left of her own accord because she was angry that she had lost custody of her 2-year-old son.
