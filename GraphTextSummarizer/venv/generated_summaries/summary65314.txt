" Fourth seed Murray is searching for a first major title, having been beaten in the last two Melbourne finals by Roger Federer in 2010 and then Djokovic last year. "He's definitely very motivated to win his first grand slam," said Djokovic of Murray after reaching his fifth successive grand slam semifinal. Defending champion Novak Djokovic shrugged off an injury scare to beat fifth seed David Ferrer in the Australian Open quarterfinals on Wednesday, setting up a last-four rematch with 2011 runner-up Andy Murray. That 2011 final defeat sent Murray into a minor form slump, but he bounced back to reach the last four at Roland Garros, Wimbledon and Flushing Meadows. Djokovic holds the edge in the head-to-head record against Murray, having won six and lost four of their 10 matches -- including victory in their only clash at a grand slam.
