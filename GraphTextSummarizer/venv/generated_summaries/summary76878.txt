-- It wasn't a typical day on the set of the hit game show "Family Feud" on Monday. The "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo" bunch played for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders. Alana Thompson, the 7-year-old star of "Here Comes Honey Boo Boo," and her family faced off against "Cake Boss" Buddy Valastro and his family. "You better redneckognize," said Honey Boo Boo in an interview with CNN before the show taping began. Each family clearly had a competitive nature, but it was all for a good cause on Monday.
