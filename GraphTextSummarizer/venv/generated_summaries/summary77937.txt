" Residents near spill urged to evacuate In his prepared testimony, Enbridge President and CEO Patrick Daniel said he was "deeply concerned" by the Michigan incident and that "for Enbridge, no spill is acceptable." -- An oil pipeline that on September 9 began leaking crude oil just southwest of Chicago, Illinois, was back up and running Friday morning, owner Enbridge Energy Partners LP announced.

The line, 6A, runs from Superior, Wisconsin, to Griffith, Indiana, and transports 670,000 barrels per day, according to Enbridge.
