The online taunting caught the attention of ISIS's central command structure in Syria, and a sleeper cell was ordered to find and destroy the clandestine group, according to a letter Abu Rafiq claims was leaked to his organization. From an undisclosed location, a Syrian activist operating under the pseudonym Abu Rafiq spoke to CNN about the war taking place on one of ISIS's main front lines -- social media. Abu Rafiq claims that some foreign fighters are defecting from ISIS, something reported by other activists and local media. "The regime played the media card and ISIS did the same, and they are both very good at this," Abu Rafiq said explaining the importance of press coverage. Abu Rafiq's underground network is modest so far, but similar groups in the area that have more support and resources -- including one calling itself "Raqqah is Being Slaughtered Silently" -- have been threatened with death for publishing reports on the ISIS operation in their hometown.
