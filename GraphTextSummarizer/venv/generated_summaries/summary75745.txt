The suspect, who is being named only as "Alexandre," will turn 22 on Thursday, Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said in a news conference broadcast by CNN affiliate BFMTV. He had a prior record of petty crimes committed when he was under 18 and is known to have been rebellious in his youth, but was not known to French security services, Molins said. Molins praised the work of French investigators in identifying him in only four days. The attacker wanted "to kill a soldier who is in charge of French security," he said. The soldier was on patrol as part of a heightened security plan initiated in certain areas following France's intervention in Mali this year, French President Francois Hollande said.
