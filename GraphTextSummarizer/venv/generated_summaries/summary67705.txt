The 35-year-old actor became a fruitarian while filming Steve Jobs biopic, "jOBS," in an attempt to "understand some of his discipline," Kutcher explained to CNN. -- Matthew McConaughey lost 40 pounds for December's "Dallas Buyers Club," and Matt Damon worked out for four hours a day to get ripped for "Elysium." Ashton Kutcher, meanwhile, wanted so badly to get the role of innovation icon Steve Jobs right, he put himself in the hospital. " Arriving Friday, "jOBS" traces Steve Jobs' ascendance from college dropout to globally influential creator and will recount his founding of Apple along with Steve Wozniak (played by Josh Gad). What the Jobs movie got right, and wrong "(Jobs) was a really disciplined guy in a lot of ways, around his work and his life and his relationships and his products," Kutcher said. Kutcher says that when he received the script, which was already a work in progress when Jobs died, that he did have that "immediate concern."
