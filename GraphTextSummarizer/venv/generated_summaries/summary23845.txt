Klinsmann made a couple of changes at the break with Nick Rimando, the only MLS-based player in the squad, replacing Guzan in goal and Bolton's Tim Ream coming into defense. And Argentina continued its assault after the interval, adding two more inside the opening five minutes with Federico Fernandez heading home a di Maria free kick before the United star added a fourth. Sergio Aguero and Erik Lamela both converted chances provided by di Maria before halftime to give the visitors a two-goal lead. A dreadful error by Darida allowed Mix Diskerud to run through on goal and when his effort was saved, Bedoya netted the rebound. Germany, without a number of players who helped the team win the World Cup following a number of retirements, hit back with Andre Schurrle and Gotze scoring consolation goals.
