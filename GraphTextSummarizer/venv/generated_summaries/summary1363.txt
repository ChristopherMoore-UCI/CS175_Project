Google Glass are using bone conduction rather than ear buds for their speaker system, although there have been teething problems. "It's the natural spectrum of sound compared with traditional hearing", says Brian Walshe, spokesperson of hearing treatment company Cochlear. While a new generation of cochlear implants has had spectacular success in recent years, they rely on air conduction and the patient possessing a functional pathway from outer to inner ear. Neither do they need to be compensation for disability - such systems have been used by military in environments that require awareness as well as audio instructions. The Audiology Foundation of America have also supported the concept, stating that it causes less damage to the ears than ear buds.
