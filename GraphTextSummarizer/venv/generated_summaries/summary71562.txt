To get Google+ Android app working you must first install the app, then log into Google+ via the Web to set up a link to your phone. So: What would happen if Google suddenly made Google+ available to all Google account holders and Android device users? At least 200 million people already have Google accounts, based on estimates of active Gmail users -- but the total number of Google account holders is probably much higher I just accessed Google+ on my laptops Web browser and saw five new notifications of interaction from other users, similar to Facebook notifications. I'll like it even better when Google releases an application programming interface for Google+, so other services I like and use frequently,such as PicPlz, for posting photos selectively to several services at once, can connect to my Google+ presence.
