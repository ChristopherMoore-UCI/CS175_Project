-- Federal agents are conducting a criminal investigation that could affect the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four others accused of plotting the 2001 terrorist attacks, Justice Department lawyers told a U.S. military court Monday in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In the Monday public filing, a special team of Justice Department lawyers set up specifically to handle the dispute said only that the ongoing FBI "preliminary investigation" includes "classified information" but has nothing to do with the publication of the Mohammed manifesto. the FBI preliminary investigation does not pertain to the disclosure of Mr. Mohammed's written communications to third parties," the public court filing said. That request came after preliminary proceedings for the planned military commissions trial were halted recently when defense attorneys for defendant Ramzi bin al Shibh said a member of the defense team was approached by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and asked to become a confidential informant in an ongoing probe. Defense lawyers said they believed it was related to what military prosecutors said was the unauthorized publication in January of a manifesto written by Mohammed.
