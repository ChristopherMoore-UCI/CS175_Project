In the first direct contact between the two sides, Pakistani government representatives met the Taliban for peace talks Wednesday in the tribal region of North Waziristan. At least 19 Taliban noncombatants were released earlier on the directive of Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said Shaukatullah Khan, governor of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province. The release is a goodwill gesture that will help promote peace talks, Khan said, speaking at a seminar in Peshawar. Journalist Zahir Shah Sherazi reported from Peshawar, Pakistan, and CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report from Los Angeles. The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, which has been waging an insurgency against the Pakistani government, said it is still awaiting a reply from the government regarding the demands, including the release of noncombatants.
