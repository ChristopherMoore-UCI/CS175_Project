The British McLaren driver finished sixth in the season-opener in Melbourne two weeks ago, as reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel drove from pole to flag to secure an impressive victory for Red Bull. " Button might well have improved on his sixth place in Melbourne but for a tussle with Ferrari's Felipe Massa, which resulted in a drive through penalty after he overtook the Brazilian illegally. He told British newspaper The Daily Telegraph: "With the heat and humidity, and with it being a very tough circuit on tires, then we are going to see a very different race to the last one in Melbourne. I think with the DRS it is going to make overtaking a lot easier than it was in Melbourne." -- Jenson Button fears the weather could have a huge impact on the Malaysian Grand Prix as his McLaren team try to haul back Red Bull's lightning start to the season.
