According to the museum, contemporary ice age mammals include giant ground sloths (Megalonyx jeffersoni) like one found at SeaTac airport and now on display at the Burke Museum, and extinct bison (Bison antiquus), among others. "Since the tusk is on private property, it could have ended up in a private collection," said Christian Sidor, the museum's curator of vertebrate paleontology. Burke paleontologists earlier removed dirt from around the waterlogged tusk with shovels, trowels and brushes, and placed layers of plaster-soaked burlap bandages on one side of the tusk, the museum said in a statement. Scott Koppelman, senior vice president of AMLI Residential, said in a prepared statement that the excavation will cause a construction delay, "but the scientific and educational benefits of this discovery clearly outweigh the costs and delay. -- Seattle paleontologists Friday safely removed the largest fossilized mammoth tusk discovered in the region from a construction site, according to the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture.
