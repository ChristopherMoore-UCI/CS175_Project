English Premier League side Manchester City will be the majority owner with MLB giants New York Yankees also claiming a stake in the team -- which will be named New York City FC (NYCFC). "The New York area is home to more than 19 million people -- and we look forward to an intense crosstown rivalry between New York City Football Club and the New York Red Bulls that will captivate this great city," he added. "New York is a legendary sports town, as well as a thriving global city with a rapidly expanding soccer fan-base," Ferran Soriano, the Chief Executive Officer of Manchester City said. They have an existing marketing deal with 27-time World Series champion Yankees and the Manchester City squad will be in New York to play a friendly against fellow EPL giants Chelsea at the Yankee Stadium Saturday. City, who saw their own cross city rivals Manchester United wrest the EPL title from them this season, have already expanded their activities in the United States by setting up community programs in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.
