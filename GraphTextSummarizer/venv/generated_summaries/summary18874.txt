"On Monday morning, the whole story's gonna be different," Mitch Landrieu promised a group of reporters during Landrieu's Friday night event. The Louisiana Democrat had been shouting all week, rallying her supporters at campaign events up and down the state, fighting to hold off a challenge from Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy to the bitter end. Early voting among African-Americans, a voting bloc key to her chances for a win, was down, but Republican early voting was up. Mitch Landrieu, the senator's brother and mayor of New Orleans, told a group of reporters Friday night that as soon as they start focusing on 2016, the "environment is going to start changing all across America." Cassidy pauses, then adds: "You see the paradox." Asked about the evaluation made by others of his personal style, Cassidy brushes them off as unfounded bias from reporters who "read what other reporters have said and they write what the other reporters have said."
