Media urge unsealing of documents in Colorado shooting case As part of his graduate studies application, Holmes submitted a photo of himself offering a piece of straw to a llama. According to e-mails released by the University of Illinois, Holmes visited the Urbana-Champaign campus in March 2011 and met with professors, research assistants and Beshers while touring the facilities. The move caught the attention of Samuel Beshers, the university's neuroscience program coordinator, who pointed Holmes application to a colleague in an e-mail. The documents were released Friday by the University of Illinois, where Holmes applied to the neuroscience department before opting to attend the University of Colorado. The University of Colorado has declined a request to release Holmes' records, citing a judge's order that sealed documents in the case.
