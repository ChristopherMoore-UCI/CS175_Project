Top officials at the campaign committee for House Republicans said Tuesday they weren't aware of anonymous Twitter accounts that were used ahead of the midterms to share internal polling data with outside groups, potentially violating campaign finance laws. Campaign finance experts said that pushed the limits of election laws that bar coordination between campaigns and outside groups, such as super PACs and nonprofits. CNN reported Monday that NRCC and at least two outside groups -- American Crossroads and American Action Network --  masked their identities through anonymous Twitter accounts to share information about House races. FEC vice-chair Ann Ravel wrote Monday on Twitter that proving coordination occurred would be difficult because election laws are "sadly murky." According to a source with knowledge of the activity, the groups posted internal polling data in shorthand on Twitter, a public forum, to avoid the appearance of coordination.
