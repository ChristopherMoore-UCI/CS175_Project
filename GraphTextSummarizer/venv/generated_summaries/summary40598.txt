"We are here to give these guys a hand; it's lot of work to keep their bikes running," said event organizer Kristen MacQueen. Cuban Harley aficionados are unique, MacQueen said, because their vintage bikes are not just for show. "You get to a point where the Harley becomes part of your family," Cuban Harley owner Yuri Garcia said. One family of American tourists said they had changed their travel plans to come from Mexico to Cuba for a few days after learning about the event. "A lot of the people use them in their everyday life to get around," MacQueen said.
