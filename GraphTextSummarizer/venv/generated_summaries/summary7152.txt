Schmidheiny's lawyer, Astolfo Di Amato, told CNN Tuesday that his client did not accept the sentence handed down by the court in Turin, an industrial hub in northwestern Italy. Though now banned in Italy and most Western countries, asbestos is still used in developing countries, mainly in China and India. Bruno Pesce, the leader of Italy's asbestos victims association, said more than 1,500 people attended Monday's hearing -- including some who were suffering from asbestos-linked illnesses. -- A Swiss man sentenced in an Italian court to a 16-year prison term in absentia over deaths of about 2,000 workers who prosecutors said were exposed to asbestos will appeal the ruling, his lawyer said Tuesday. " Renato Balduzzi, Italy's health minister, called the sentence "historic."
