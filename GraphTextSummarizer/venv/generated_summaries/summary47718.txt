"This sentence sends a powerful message to those who plan or prepare acts of terrorism overseas or here in the UK." Authorities say Khawaja, of west London, traveled to Syria in January 2014 and joined Rayat al Tawheed, a group aligned with ISIS, the brutal terror group that has captured parts of Syria and Iraq for what it says is its Islamic caliphate. "Khawaja chose to become a terrorist, engaged in weapons training in a terrorist training camp and faked his own death in order to conceal his entry back into the UK," Metropolitan Police counterterrorism Cmdr. Police said they searched addresses linked to both men, and found messages and photographs that showed Khawaja had engaged in terrorist training in Syria, including how to handle weapons. Khawaja pleaded guilty in December to preparation of acts of terrorism, attending a terrorist training camp, weapons training and possession of an article for terrorist purposes. Khawaja, 27, was sentenced Friday in Woolwich Crown Court to 12 years in prison, having pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism and other terror-related charges, London's Metropolitan Police said.
