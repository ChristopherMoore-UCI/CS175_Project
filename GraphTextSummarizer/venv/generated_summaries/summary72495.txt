The incident occurred just after 9 a.m. at Coral Gables Senior High School in Coral Gables, the officials said. "I think we need to understand that whether it's Liberty City, Opa-Locka or Coral Gables, children are responding to everyday stressful situations in very negative ways," Carvalho said. -- A Florida high school student was killed Tuesday by another student during an altercation at the school, officials said. " Coral Gables is about 8 miles southwest of Miami.
