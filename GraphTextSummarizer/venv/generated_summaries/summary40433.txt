Advocates of a repeal say Connecticut's current law keeps inmates on death row for extended periods of time, who are often engaged in multiple appeals, and presents taxpayers with far larger costs than if the convict were placed in the general prison population serving a life sentence. Of those, only one person has actually been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. -- Connecticut's governor says he will sign a bill abolishing the death penalty, making it the 17th state to abandon capital punishment. The state currently has 11 people on death row. Michael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after he voluntarily gave up his appeals.
