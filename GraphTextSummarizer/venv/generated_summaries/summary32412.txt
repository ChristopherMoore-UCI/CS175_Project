" "During the entirety of the video, no one is observed entering or exiting inmate Castro's cell prior to the emergency call by the officers," the report notes. At the time of his death, Castro had been sentenced to life plus more than 1,000 years for kidnapping and repeatedly raping three young women: Michelle Knight, Georgina DeJesus and Amanda Berry. They also found that the convicted kidnapper had apparently done more than kill himself that day, according to a report on Castro's death from the Ohio State Highway Patrol. He got a tray of food at 5:29 p.m., for instance, and a "supervisor, an officer and a nurse (stood) in front of" Castro's cell one hour and 10 minutes later, according to surveillance video. It added that "possible inaccurate and/or questionable entries" on the log book detailing what inmates were visited, and when, were found, but "no discrepancies were directly related to the death of Inmate Castro."
