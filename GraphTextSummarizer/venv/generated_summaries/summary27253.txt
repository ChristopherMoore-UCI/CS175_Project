A United Nations Police spokesman confirmed reports of a clash erupting on Haiti's border with the Dominican Republic between soldiers of that nation and Haitian civilians. " He called the decision of the 12 presidential candidates to call for cancellation of elections hours before polls closed "precipitous" and "regrettable. The incident took place as one of the 18 presidential candidates was denouncing the outgoing president and his endorsed candidate in a news conference broadcast live on Haitian radio. " Vezina said he could not confirm reports broadcast on Haitian radio that a woman and a girl were killed in the border clash. He also said at least one person died as a result of election violence.
