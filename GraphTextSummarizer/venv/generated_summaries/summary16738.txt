-- At least six people were killed and some 18 were wounded by an explosion in what appears to be a "deliberate attack" in Nairobi, Kenya, a senior Red Cross official tells CNN. Nine of the injured were listed in critical condition at Kenyatta National Hospital, the Kenya National Disaster Operation said on its Twitter account. CNN's Joseph Netto contributed to this report. "Our resolve & will to defend ourselves from those who intend to harm us will never be discouraged," the governor of Nairobi City County, Evans Kidero, said in a tweet. The explosion occurred in Eastleigh, a largely Somali neighborhood, east of the Nairobi city center.
