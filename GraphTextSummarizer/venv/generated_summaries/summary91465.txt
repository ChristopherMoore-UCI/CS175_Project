Future efforts to adapt to climate change will be guided by emerging African strategies that seek to focus on leveraging technological innovation for sustainable development. The challenge is to strengthen local capabilities through endogenous technological innovation in fields such as energy, agriculture, health and environmental management. The second important element of innovation is the capacity of the less resource-endowed communities to harness emerging technologies and put them to creative uses. Such preparedness assessments focus on existing conditions and capabilities and fail to account for emerging technological opportunities that might be easily adapted by those with the least access to conventional infrastructure and capabilities. The celebrated story of the widespread usage of mobile phone has rebranded the continent as a place where emerging technologies can find novel and unanticipated uses.
