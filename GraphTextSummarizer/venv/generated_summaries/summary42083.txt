The girl was discovered during a search of a home in a community of Roma, also known as gypsies, near the town of Larissa in central Greece, police said. Among the suspect documents found by police was a 2009 birth and baptism registration from Athens authorities, the news agency said. " In May, Amnesty International said Greece had been found guilty of discrimination against Roma schoolchildren in three separate rulings by the European Court of Human Rights. Anyone with information is asked to call the European Hotline for Missing Children or contact The Smile of the Child. The charity said it would look after her "until a solution in the best interest of the child is found." The two people posing as her parents have been arrested and face charges of abducting a minor, as well as counts of falsifying identity documents, said the state-owned Athens-Macedonian News Agency.
