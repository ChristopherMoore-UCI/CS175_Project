Sheriff Larry Williams told HLN's Nancy Grace. "She said she was going down road and lost control of vehicle and happened to be at juncture where boat ramp was," Williams told Grace. State troopers responded to a report of a car accident early Monday and found a Chrysler sedan in the water near a boat landing in Orangeburg County. While the woman described the incident as an accident, Williams told CNN that "it has a stench of foul play." Williams said he couldn't confirm reports that the key was still in the car's ignition, but he said the car apparently was in neutral.
