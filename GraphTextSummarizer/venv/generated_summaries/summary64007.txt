" Tennis Australia high performance coach Craig Morris added: "Our long term objective in creating a product like FAST4 tennis is to attract more people to the sport, and get more people to play tennis. First he'll line up against former US Open finalist Mark Philippoussis before taking on current US Open junior champion Omar Jasika, finally playing a best-of-five match against compatriot Fernando Verdasco. It might sound like a Vin Diesel movie, but tennis authorities in Australia are hoping that the FAST4 format, which debuted Monday with an exhibition match between world No. 2 Roger Federer and former Wimbledon and US Open champ Lleyton Hewitt, could "revolutionize" the sport.

"It's a fantastic innovation for tennis, and one that I hope will take off.
