But in the emergency declaration, which paves the way for emergency funds for the seven counties, Gov. Brian Schweitzer claimed oil has since been discovered beyond Hysham, about 90 miles from the leak site. The current continued to move swiftly Tuesday down the Yellowstone, carrying with it all sorts of debris, like a tree 30 inches in diameter that Schweitzer spotted. Montana's governor declared a state of emergency Tuesday related to a ruptured pipeline that caused tens of thousands of gallons of oil to gush into the Yellowstone River -- a break the pipeline's owner still doesn't know the cause of, a spokesman said. Gary Pruessing, the president of the ExxonMobil Pipeline Company, told reporters Tuesday that oil had been confirmed 25 miles away, with most such pockets within 19 miles of the leak site. Pruessing said Tuesday that no dangerous levels of oil have been detected yet in the air or ground water, even as he committed to continued checks for the foreseeable future.
