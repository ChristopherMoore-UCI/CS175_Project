-- World No. 1 Serena Williams will play second-ranked Victoria Azarenka in a rematch of last year's U.S. Open final on Sunday as she attempts to become the oldest winner of the New York grand slam. The defending champion, who turns 32 at the end of this month, made a blistering start against Li but the fifth seed battled back in the second set -- Williams required seven match-points to reach her seventh U.S. Open final. The Belorussian was largely untroubled in reaching her fourth grand slam final, beating Italian underdog Flavia Pennetta 6-4 6-2 in a match marred by service struggles for both players. " Williams has lost just four times this year -- two of those to Azarenka -- and dropped only 16 games in 12 sets on the way to the final. Pennetta, ranked 83rd in the world, was playing in her first major semifinal but had a 1-1 record against Azarenka.
