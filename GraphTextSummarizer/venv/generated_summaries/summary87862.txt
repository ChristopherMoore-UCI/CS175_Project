Turkey, an opponent of the Syrian government that has long allowed opposition fighters to travel freely back and forth across its long border with Syria, has recently begun sounding the alarm about extremist groups. Cash-strapped secular Syrian activists have been warning of the rise of Islamist groups in opposition-controlled parts of Syria. " But moderate opposition groups appear to have suffered a series of setbacks this month as hard-line jihadi groups have pushed to grab more territory and resources. Among the signatory rebel groups were Ahrar al Sham, Al-Tawheed and Suqoor al-Sham, three major fighting factions that control considerable amounts of territory in Syria. The activist asked not to be named, for fear of reprisal from Islamist groups.
