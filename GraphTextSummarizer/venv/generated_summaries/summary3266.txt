Red Bull Motorsports posted its car concept, designed by Newey for a computer game in 2014 on Twitter with the cheeky message, "Way ahead of ya, @Scuderia Ferrari ;)" The aesthetics of F1 cars have attracted plenty of criticism in recent seasons. During the winter break, the team has welcomed a new president, Sergio Marchionne, new team boss, Maurizio Arrivabene, and new driver, Sebastian Vettel, as well as restructuring its technical department. The rules on car design are carefully laid out in millimeters by the sport's governing body, the FIA, whose main aim is to curb speed and increase safety. "It would be good if a bit more consideration was given to aesthetics in the drafting of the regulations," suggested Newey in an interview with Formula1.com last season. But Ferrari probably did not expect to elicit a response from racing and car design rivals Red Bull, winners of four straight team and driver titles between 2009 and 2011 thanks to the superior aerodynamic design of Adrian Newey.
