Hackers are also after personal information accessible through government computer systems, not unlike their counterparts who have nabbed millions of credit and debit card numbers from Target and Home Depot. In fact, the Obama administration report showed that federal government agencies spent $10 billion on information security. A CNN review of cyber attacks against federal agencies shows that the number of breaches into government systems is skyrocketing. Last year, the IRS mistakenly posted tens of thousands of social security numbers on government websites, according to the nonprofit Public.Resource.org. Indeed, this year's Obama administration report found that so-called phishing attacks -- where users are duped into clicking links that open systems to hackers -- are the most widely reported cyber incident.
