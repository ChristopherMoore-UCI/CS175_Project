Human remains found in two plastic bags near a beach in southwestern Mexico have been identified as those of Harry Devert, a New Yorker  who left his job as a trader in finance for a transcontinental motorcycle journey from the United States to Latin America, Mexican authorities said. Friends had hoped Harry Devert would surface Ann Devert last heard from her son January 23. Del Sardo said Ann Devert spent time in Mexico after her son's disappearance, meeting local authorities and residents in the western Mexican state of Michoacan in an attempt to find him. Del Sardo said Mexican authorities informed Ann Devert of the findings late Thursday. Ann Devert had been in touch with both the American and French embassies in Mexico.
