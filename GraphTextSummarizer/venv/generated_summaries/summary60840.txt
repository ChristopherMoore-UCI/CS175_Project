-- A magazine designed for and by gay military members may soon be displayed at military installations worldwide, an advocacy group announced Monday. "We also want to communicate to all troops that there are capable gay military members serving honorably, and that accepting that and moving on will make our military stronger," said Smith. The policy stopped the practice of asking service members if they are gay, but still called for the dismissal of openly gay service members. " "Don't ask-don't tell" became law in 1993, after opposition ballooned to then newly elected President Bill Clinton's plan to lift the military's complete ban on gay service members. "Our first objective with the magazine is to let all the gay, lesbian, bi, and trans members currently serving know that they are not alone," an active-duty officer who goes by the pseudonym JD Smith said in a statement.
