A small Port-au-Prince radio station stays on air after the January 12 earthquake, helping people coordinate aid distribution. "We say that the only way communicate with the people and the world to is to stay on," station manager Mario Viau told CNN. And with tens of thousands of people now living in tents or makeshift shelters, aid agencies have been distributing portable radios to keep them in touch. Others have used it to inform search-and-rescue workers about sites where people may still be buried alive, as well as food and water distribution sites. In the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake, a small radio station became an informational lifeline for people in Port-au-Prince and beyond.
