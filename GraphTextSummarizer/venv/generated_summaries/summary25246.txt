-- Britain's Prince Harry has passed the first stage of training to become a military helicopter pilot, following in the footsteps of his brother William, royal officials said Thursday. "If Prince Harry qualifies as an Army Air Corps pilot, he will, like any officer, be available for operational service wherever the AAC flies," it said. Harry's elder brother William was awarded his Royal Air Force wings in April after training since January. William and Harry's father, Prince Charles, and uncle, the Duke of York, have also learned to pilot military helicopters. Harry, third in line to the British throne, will now begin a two-and-a-half year course with the Army Air Corps in January 2009, that could result in him seeing active service as a pilot, according to a press statement.
