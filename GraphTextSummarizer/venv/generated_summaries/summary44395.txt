Lavin, the host of MTV's "Real World/Road Rules Challenge" program, has won the gold at several X Games and has produced a music album, according to MTV. "T.J. is an important member of the Dew Tour family -- the Tour, athletes and action sports industry are all keeping him in our thoughts and prayers," race officials said in a statement. Lavin was wearing a helmet, tour spokeswoman Nicole Mancuso told CNN. The competitor remained in critical condition Saturday, hospital spokeswoman Danita Cohen said. Lavin's mother told CNN affiliate KTNV that Lavin broke his eye socket and wrist, and is in a medically-induced coma to reduce swelling on his brain.
