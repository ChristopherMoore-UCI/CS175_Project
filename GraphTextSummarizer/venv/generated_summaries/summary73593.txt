The court is polarized, with four conservatives (Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) and four liberals (Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan), with Anthony Kennedy holding the balance of power, especially on gay rights issues. This includes the Fourth Circuit, covering Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina; the Seventh Circuit, including Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin; and the 10th Circuit, which covers Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. More time equals more states, which might (the theory goes) make Kennedy's vote easier to get a year from now. Today's non-decision means that more than half the states, with well more than half the population, have marriage equality. That's the message of the Supreme Court's decision today to let stand five federal appellate court rulings that recognized a constitutional right for gay people to marry.
