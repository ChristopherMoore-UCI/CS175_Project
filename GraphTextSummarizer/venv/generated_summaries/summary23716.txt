The Connecticut Policy Institute recently published its Urban Policy Project, a compendium of policy recommendations for preserving jobs, improving schools and housing, and reducing crime in struggling cities based on successful strategies from around the country. As jobs left, crime rates rose to record highs, and the city faced a Detroit-like downward spiral. Their residents, who experience the American Dream when the city is growing, experience the American Nightmare when things turn down -- no job opportunity, underperforming schools, deteriorating housing stock, high crime rates and overextended social services. Let's add fixing struggling cities to the national agenda. Smaller cities are also struggling.
