In a Marketplace Tech Report interview, internet security expert Anup Ghosh warned that one of the most insidious parts of e-mail phishing is that the fake alert e-mail might actually say the company is notifying you in response to a recent publicized security breach -- that is, the one they perpetrated. "This makes sense since mobile users are 'always on' and are most likely to read e-mail messages as soon as they arrive. Also, recent statistics from Nielsen indicate that U.S. mobile users spend more time on their phones doing e-mail than using Facebook. CNN's John Sutter explained that the main problem consumers face from this breach is an increased risk of targeted "phishing" attempts -- "a sneakier and more sinister version of spam ... fake e-mails that try to look real because the scammer knows something about you. Major companies with millions of customers, such as JP Morgan Chase and Target, sent e-mail notices alerting customers of the breach.
