-- Police will investigate the deaths of nearly 100 animals that were found in a Petco store after flooding in upstate New York, Johnson City Mayor Dennis Hannon said Monday. Employees at the Oakdale Plaza store checked on the premises late Wednesday and "all was still well," Petco chief executive Jim Myers wrote Sunday on the chain's official blog, PetcoScoop. A river flood warning was issued Wednesday afternoon for the entire Johnson City area, along with flash flood warnings that continued well into Thursday, according to Joanne Labounty, a spokeswoman for the National Weather Service. The Johnson City store is a relatively new location, Myers wrote in his blog, and it was not in operation during the record high-river floods of 2006, and "we misjudged the risk to this location. " "We apologize to the members of the Johnson City community and look forward to serving you better in the future," Myers wrote.
