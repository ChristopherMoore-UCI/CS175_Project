Brooklyn, New York (VICE.COM) -- Walking through the jungle in the dead of night with a group of Rwandan rebels best known for their expertise at rape and murder wasn't exactly what we had planned for our first trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo. After having our yellow-fever cards checked for the first time in our well-traveled lives, we ran a gauntlet of sweaty police officers and other officials -- each with his own laundry list of infractions that we had apparently already committed. We knew very little about Congo before we came, but the one thing that had been drilled into our heads was "do not fly on Congolese airlines." These are part of a group of natural resources that have been dubbed "conflict minerals" because of the alphabet soup of armed groups (FARDC, CNDP, FDLR, PARECO, etc.) who have found them a very portable and highly profitable way to fund their activities -- which mostly consist of killing people.
