In fact, Elysian and Boston's Harpoon Brewing have set up a friendly wager for Super Bowl Sunday: Three kegs of beer from each brewery will be poured in the opposite breweries' taprooms the week after the big game. The New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks hail from two of the finest craft beer regions in the U.S. Boston is home to Samuel Adams, the largest-selling craft beer company in the country, as well as some smaller, notable breweries like Trillium Brewing and Cambridge Brewing Co. Seattle was one of the key players in starting the microbrew revolution, partly because of its proximity to fresh hops in the nearby Yakima Valley. Their scope is still pretty small, but they are hitting the gym and building a pretty strong following among local craft beer fans. This style of beer is right out of the Pacific Northwest playbook, but Harpoon was one of the first to produce an IPA on the East Coast. One of the leaders of that revolution was Elysian Brewing Co., now famous for its creative pumpkin beers and flagship Immortal IPA.
