Pierre Korkie was killed Friday in Yemen when the U.S. military launched a failed raid to rescue another hostage,  American photojournalist Luke Somers, who also was killed. Yolande and Pierre Korkie were kidnapped in Yemen's Taiz province in May of last year, the nongovernmental organization Gift of the Givers said. The wife of slain South African hostage Pierre Korkie has said she chooses to forgive those who caused his death during a botched rescue attempt in Yemen. Yolande Korkie said "all is God's will" as she discussed the failed U.S. military mission. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula freed Yolande Korkie in January, after negotiations with Gift of the Givers, and was to release her husband Sunday, the group said on its site.
