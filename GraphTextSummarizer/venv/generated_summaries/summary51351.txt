Days after refusing to rule out recommending U.S. combat troops in Iraq, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff made an unexpected trip Saturday to the turbulent Middle Eastern nation to talk with officials there about combating ISIS, an official said. After his Baghdad stop, Dempsey moved north to Irbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdish region and home to U.S. military advisers and consular personnel. Yet in testimony Thursday to the House Armed Services Committee, Dempsey said he would not rule out asking the President to send U.S. ground troops into Iraq. Gen. Martin Dempsey traveled to Iraq "to confer (with) Iraqi political and security officials on next phase of the campaign to defeat (ISIS)," according to a tweet from Brett McGurk, a U.S. diplomat focused on ISIS as well as Iran and Iraq. During the meeting between Dempsey and al-Abadi, the two discussed what to do about ISIS, America's support for Iraq's armed forces, as well as progress made by Iraqi forces, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's office.
