"The only person on this planet who wants a shutdown is President Obama. " Earlier Wednesday, the first-term senator penned a Politico op-ed titled "Obama Is Not A Monarch," where he slammed the President for threatening executive action. " Cruz, who voted in favor of shutting down the government last year over Obamacare, made the expected argument that the President would be violating the powers set by the Constitution by forcing executive action. In the plan, Cruz told Fox News that incoming Senate Majority Leader-elect Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, should threaten to block any nominations by the President, with the exception of those for vital national security positions. While Cruz says legislative action is the best way to move forward to combat the President's initiative, a few of his GOP colleagues -- and potential 2016 rivals -- said they felt a lawsuit would be more appropriate.
