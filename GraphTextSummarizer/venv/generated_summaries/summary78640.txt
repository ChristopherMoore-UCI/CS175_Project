Noriega also faces possible prison time in Panama, where he is accused of kidnapping, extortion and the murder of political opponents. Though the charges are more serious, if the 69-year-old Noriega is convicted of murder, he would likely serve much of his sentence under home detention in Panama. He had said Noriega hoped to return to Panama to be closer to his family. -- A federal judge on Tuesday approved the extradition of former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to France, where he faces a 10-year sentence on a conviction in absentia on money-laundering charges.
