-- Former NFL star Darren Sharper, wanted in New Orleans in connection with the alleged rapes of two women, has turned himself in to Los Angeles authorities. Miami Beach police are investigating the case, Miami Beach Detective Vivian Hernandez said last week. Last week, Sharper pleaded not guilty to the California charges, which included two counts of rape by use of drugs. In addition, a Florida woman last month filed a sexual battery complaint in Miami Beach against Sharper relating to a 2012 incident, a police report said. The New Orleans charges are in addition to charges Sharper already faces in California.
