Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a bill into law on Friday that made New York the sixth state to legalize same-sex marriage, more than doubling the number of Americans living in states that permit such unions. " "I think it's awesome," said Robin Rosser, 49, who traveled to New York from Union, New Jersey, for the parade. "The point of civil rights laws is to protect everybody -- both the people who look like us or who we relate to and the people who don't," said Suzanne Goldberg, a professor at New York's Columbia Law School. The measure will take effect 30 days after it was signed, on July 24, providing same-sex couples with a slew of new rights that include employer health benefits, easier inheritance and a host of state tax breaks. Marching with supporters on Sunday, Cuomo told reporters that the country looks to New York as a guide for many of its progressive politics.
