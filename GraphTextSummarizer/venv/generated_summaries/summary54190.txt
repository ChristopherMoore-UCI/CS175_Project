Leading the race is Ivo Karlovic, the 6 ft 10 in Croatian they call the "King of Aces," who was clocked at 156 mph (251 kph) during a Davis Cup tie in Zagreb last month. "Players like Raonic and Karlovic combine great technique with height and long arms to generate racket speed," said former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash, of CNN's Open Court. Forget "New balls, please" -- the call for the next generation could well be, "Bigger balls, please." Reaction times have a ceiling, and when that's reached a glut of aces will likely prompt the ITF to act. Taking the volley out of the game with larger balls will ruin the game.
