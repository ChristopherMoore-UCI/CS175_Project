But war began, triggered by events in Eastern Europe, by the end of July. We have kept that promise through NATO, the alliance that war in Eastern Europe threatens seriously to undermine. In the end, it shattered Europe, cost tens of millions of lives, bankrupted countries and changed forever those who survived the horrors. So while the United States has sent thousands of meals ready to eat (Army rations) to a country that is an agricultural exporter, the administration has refused to send even nonlethal equipment that would help Ukraine defend itself and possibly avert war. Instead of sending military supplies to Ukraine, we hear talk of more sanctions.
