Turkish armed forces have been striking what the country calls PKK safe havens in Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region. Targets included rebel barracks, caves, ammunition depots and anti-aircraft positions in the region, part of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region. -- Iraq's foreign ministry summoned the Turkish ambassador in Baghdad on Thursday to deliver a diplomatic letter protesting Turkey's aerial and artillery bombardment of northern Iraq. Dozens of Turkish soldiers have been killed over the last month, in a clear escalation of the conflict that has raged intermittently between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish state since 1984. About 90 to 100 Kurdish rebel fighters have been killed since the incursion started, Turkey said Tuesday.
