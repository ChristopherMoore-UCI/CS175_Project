-- There's one thing Kentucky Republican Senate candidate Rand Paul and his Democratic opponent Jack Conway have in common: They're both finished talking about "Aqua Buddha." In the days following that surprise victory, Paul's libertarian views came under scrutiny after he raised questions about the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The ad features a claim from an anonymous woman who told The Washington Post and GQ magazine that Paul's group forced her to pray to a false idol named Aqua Buddha. At his news conference, he said the Aqua Buddha ad would discourage future candidates from running for political office. He had previously threatened to pull out after Conway raised the Aqua Buddha issue.
