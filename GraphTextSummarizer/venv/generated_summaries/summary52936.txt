Arkansas and North Carolina: Like Begich and Landrieu, Democratic Sens Kay Hagan of North Carolina and Mark Pryor of Arkansas face tough re-elections in Republican friendly states. In a traditionally Republican state, which Mitt Romney won by 7 points in 2012, Democrats are making a play in what Cook Political Report sees as "one of the Democrats' few opportunities" to pick up a seat. The incumbent is Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is under pressure from two fronts: Democrats, naturally, and from a tea party challenger within his own Republican Party who says he's not conservative enough. Things got ugly immediately after Liz Cheney, the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, announced in July that she would mount a primary challenge against three-term GOP Sen. MIke Enzi, who faced no Republican opposition in his last re-election bid. Were these outcomes isolated or do they mean anything for 2014, when candidates will heat up the campaign trail big time ahead of next November's congressional midterms and key gubernatorial elections?
