A number of legal and political advocacy groups have rallied to Yates' cause, saying "misuse" of government discretion to use criminal law rather than civil law to handle a range of regulatory enforcement is hurting the justice system. "Overreach by any branch of government steps on the rights of all Americans, whether on our country's street corners or our nation's boardrooms," said William Shepherd, representing the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, which filed an amicus brief in the case. The justices agreed on Monday to take up the case in which prosecutors used a law typically applied to corporate records to convict Yates of getting rid of three illegally caught grouper. -- John Yates believes when it comes to the power of the federal government, he is just a small fish caught up in a prosecution meant for corporations. Yates, 61, owns the Miss Katie, a commercial fishing vessel moored near Bradenton, Florida.
