Pyeongchang narrowly failed in its bids for 2010 and 2014, losing by three votes to Vancouver, Canada, for last year's event and by four votes to Sochi, Russia, for the 2014 event. Pyeongchang will become the first Asian city outside of Japan to play host to the Winter Games and hopes to become a center for Winter sports once the event is over. -- The International Olympic Committee chose Pyeongchang, South Korea, Wednesday to host the 2018 Olympic Winter Games. South Korea has never hosted the Winter Games, though the capital city of Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games. Munich would have been the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
