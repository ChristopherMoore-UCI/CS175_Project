-- Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, appeared at a book convention in New York City on Wednesday, undeterred by a scandal that she allegedly offered to sell access to her former husband, Britain's Prince Andrew. "The Duke of York categorically denies any knowledge of any meeting or conversation between the Duchess of York and the News of the World journalist," Buckingham Palace said, using alternate titles for Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson. On Sunday, the News of the World tabloid posted a video on its website that appears to show Ferguson accepting money from an undercover reporter in exchange for access to Prince Andrew. Ferguson is also filmed on hidden camera telling the reporter -- who was posing as a wealthy businessman -- that a payment of 500,000 pounds ($723,000) "opens doors" to Andrew. In the heavily edited, roughly 4-minute video, Ferguson appears to accept $40,000 as a down payment for a meeting with Andrew, then later discusses a wire transfer of the larger sum.
