"Children continue to bear the brunt of this conflict, with schooling disrupted and access to basic services limited," said Marie-Pierre Poirier, Unicef regional director for Central and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. More than 1.7 million children in conflict-torn areas of eastern Ukraine face an "extremely serious" situation, the U.N. children's agency has warned, with their suffering exacerbated by harsh winter weather. A ceasefire deal was reached September 5 in Minsk, Belarus, after talks between representatives of Ukraine's government, Russia and rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine. Government forces and pro-Russia rebels have been battling for control of eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions since April, after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region the previous month. Putin told reporters gathered in Moscow on Thursday that his country was ready to mediate in the Ukraine crisis.
