"I think in these times when there is pressure on budgets, people rely on alternative formats because they know they're getting well thought-out programs that have proven their worth in a number of territories," said Trish Kinane, president of worldwide entertainment for London-based FremantleMedia, a world leader in format sales. " "A+E Networks comes to MIP TV with a newly expanded sales staff and a dynamic programming catalog that features some of the highest-(rated) series and formats on U.S. pay TV," Marielle Zuccarelli, managing director for A&E Networks international content distribution, said in the release. " Kinane predicted that interactive shows, such as "Recipe to Riches," where viewers can watch a show and then eat the food the next day, will start a trend among TV format producers. These are a few of the television formats for sale next week at MipTV, the world's largest marketplace for TV programming, held in Cannes, France. FremantleMedia has a huge catalog of TV formats for sale, but at MipTV it will shine a spotlight on "Recipe to Riches," a Canadian production.
