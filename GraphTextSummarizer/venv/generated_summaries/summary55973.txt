Blog:Home hopes distant ahead of U.S. Open Elsewhere, Nadal Djokovic battled to a 6-3 3-6 2-6 7-5 6-3 win over compatriot Viktor Troicki in his opening game. -- World number one Rafael Nadal got his bid to win his first ever U.S. Open title off to a good start with a 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-4) 6-3 first-round victory over Russian Teymuraz Gabashvili at Flushing Meadows. Argentine Nalbandian bounced back from a break down to beat South Africa's Rik de Voest over five sets, while Verdasco saw off the challenge of Italy's Fabio Fognini in five sets to insure the Spaniard did not repeat his first-round exit of Wimbledon. Following the recent good form that saw him finish second to Roger Federer in Cincinnati, number 19 seed Mardy Fish showed his character to emerge as victor over Jan Hajek in a 6-0 3-6 4-6 6-0 6-1 win. However, the Wimbledon and French Open champion wore his opponent down in the tie breaks to set up a more comfortable third-set win for the match.
