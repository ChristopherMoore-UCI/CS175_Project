When I served on the board of Stop It Now, which is focused on the prevention of sexual abuse of children, I learned that more than 90% of abused children know their attacker. It's also not hard to understand why parents of troubled young men would want their sons to have the influence of the environment that Penn State and Sandusky provided. I was at Penn State conducting a workshop with coaches on sexual violence. I had great respect for Sandusky as a coach and remember his masterful game plan in the 1986 national championship, when Penn State defeated Miami with its impeccable strategy, devised by the architect of "Linebacker U." I spoke with Sandusky and found he was not a typical defensive coach. As a football coach at Penn State, Sandusky was the epitome of its image and reputation.
