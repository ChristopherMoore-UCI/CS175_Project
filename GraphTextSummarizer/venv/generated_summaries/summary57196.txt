" Two U.S. officials said Thursday the facts on the ground in Tel Aviv are the same as they were before the FAA freeze was put into place, but Israel has shared more information about airport defenses. "There was significant new information about the threat -- new information/intelligence about the threat which they took into account, which led to the rescinding of this notice, and also measures -- new measures the government of Israel put in place to mitigate potential risks to civilian aircraft and aviation," State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said Thursday. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and US Airways said Thursday they are resuming flights to Israel's busiest airport, Ben Gurion International. The FAA said it had worked with other U.S. government agencies and officials to assess security in Israel and "carefully reviewed" new information and measures Israel was taking to "mitigate potential risks to civil aviation. The United States has lifted its ban on U.S. carriers flying to and from Tel Aviv, Israel.
