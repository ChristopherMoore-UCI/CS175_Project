Nine minutes after the Proton-M rocket lifted off in Baikonur, Kazakhstan, on Friday, officials on the ground lost contact with the it, ITAR-Tass reported, citing an official from Russia's Federal Space Agency. A Russian space rocket launch went sour Friday, destroying the booster and its payload, Russian state media said. It was a Russian Proton rocket that placed the first piece of the International Space Station, the Zarya module, into orbit in 1998. But the agency also said that part of the rocket could be in a "non-intended orbit" and small pieces could fall down to Earth. The Russian Federation is known for its active space program; it carried out more than 30 space launches last year, according to a Russian media report.
