One of the key questions for people interested in ocean trash is how much of it is out there, but Monday's U.N. report does not solve that mystery. The world's oceans are full of trash, causing "tremendous" negative impacts on coastal life and ecology, according to a U.N. report released Monday. Plastics and cigarette butts are the most common types of ocean litter, with plastic making up about 80 percent of the ocean trash collected in some areas of the world, a U.N. news release says. Ocean trash also affects marine life and degrades human health. In Australia, for instance, a survey found 80 percent of ocean trash starts on the land.
