Two poultry plants have cut production by one day a week to curtail water use and are also trucking water in for other uses. Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue had said  Wednesday the state would seek an injunction forcing the Corps to stem the flow of water from Lake Lanier, Atlanta's primary water source. The Army Corps of Engineers says there is about a three-month supply of water left in Lake Lanier, which is 15 feet below its capacity. In Siler City, North Carolina, residents and businesses have been ordered to cut water use by 50 percent or face penalties. The corps -- under an agreement reached in the 1980s with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state and downstream users -- releases 5,000 feet of water per second from the dam between the man-made lake and the river.
