" "Texas can't afford to wait for Washington to act on this crisis, and we will not sit idly by while the safety and security of our citizens are threatened," Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement. The announcement was made in a statement by Perry, Crime rates related to drugs, cartels, transnational gangs, and illegal border activity plummeted because of the resources we allocated to stop illegal entry at the border. "Until the federal government recognizes the danger it's putting our citizens in by its inaction to secure the border, Texas law enforcement must do everything they can to keep our citizens and communities safe," Perry said. The so-called surge will continue at least through the end of the calendar year to combat a "flood" of illegal immigrants, the statement said.
