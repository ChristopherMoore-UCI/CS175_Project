Houston Rockets team physician Tom Clanton has said the foot injury currently sidelining Chinese center Yao Ming could threaten the seven-foot-six-inch player's career. Admirers say Yao has done more for improving China's image overseas than any modern-day politician or diplomat. Yao is now a multi-millionaire, earning millions of dollars yearly, not just from his NBA team but from lucrative commercial endorsements. "At this point, the injury has the potential for him missing this next season and could be career-threatening," Clanton told the Houston Chronicle regional newspaper. Yao was awarded the honor of "model worker" in 2005 by China's ruling Communist Party.
