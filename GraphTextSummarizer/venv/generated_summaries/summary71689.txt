An 'Army' of friends Laura Bucklin from Solon, Iowa -- who, at 21, is the same age as Harry Potter would be now -- remembers the moment in 1998 when her friend lent her the first book. Whether "Harry Potter" influenced art, relationships or simply the pure joy of reading, it's clear the books and movies won't soon be forgotten, especially for those who grew up with them. "She laid the paperback down on our kitchen table and told me that a number of her friends had told her that the 'Harry Potter' books were wonderful stories, and she wanted me to try 'Sorcerer's Stone.' -- Like the moment that Harry Potter first learned he was a wizard, Raleigh Browne can vividly recall when he first heard of the adventures of the "Boy Who Lived. " "It was the summer between my kindergarten and first-grade years when my mom returned home from the bookstore with a copy of 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' " he said.
