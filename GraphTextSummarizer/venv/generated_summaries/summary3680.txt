Woods has won the tournament at the same venue six times and also famously claimed the 2008 U.S. Open, despite being handicapped by injury, Woods, who began his campaign by missing the cut at at European Tour event in Abu Dhabi last week, the same fate befalling No.1 Rory McIlroy, showed that was a mere blip with inspired play on the easier North Course. He had opened his campaign with a four-under 68 on the tougher South Course as defending champion Brandt Snedeker shared the first round lead in the $6.1 million event after a 65 with Korea's' KJ Choi. Looking for his first victory on the Tour since turning pro in 2008, the 25-year-old Wood has the trio of compatriot Simon Khan, Swede Alexander and New Zealander Michael Campbell as his closest challengers going into Saturday's final round. On the European Tour Friday, England's Chris Wood shot a brilliant 64 to take a three-shot lead into the final round of the Qatar Masters at the Doha Golf Club. It left him two clear of fellow American Billy Horschel, who battled to a 69 on the more difficult South Course.
