But for now, the Amnesty report said, many countries continued to execute people for offenses that trigger much less severe sentences in other countries. Last year, China reformed the way capital cases are handled, with the Supreme Court deciding all cases. Exact figures for how many people were put to death in China are difficult to come by because the country considers the death penalty a "state secret," Amnesty said. -- China executed at least 470 people last year -- more than any other country in the world, according to an annual report on the death penalty by the human rights group Amnesty International. This led to a drop in the number of executions, with "half of the cases changed to a reprieve in the end," according to an article last week in China's state-run news agency, Xinhua.
