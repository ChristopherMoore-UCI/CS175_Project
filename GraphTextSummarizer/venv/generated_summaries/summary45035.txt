"The patients in this study were not carefully examined and definitely diagnosed with Parkinson's disease," said Dr. Michael S. Okun, national medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, which is why he believes more research is needed before drawing any conclusion that the two are related. "Some experts believe that this metal deposition may place patients at risk for diseases like Parkinson's." People who suffer from migraines with aura during middle age have double the risk of developing Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders later in life than those who do not, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Neurology. Researchers don't yet understand why migraines might be linked to Parkinson's disease or other movement disorders, Scher says. Researchers followed more than 5,000 people between the ages of 33 and 65 for 25 years, who were originally enrolled in a clinical trial designed to study heart disease in Iceland.
