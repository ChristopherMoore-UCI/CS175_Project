Usually one of the top teams stubs its toe in the playoffs on the way to Super Bowl glory. Think of the great Super Bowl halftime shows put on by Prince, Bruce Springsteen and Beyonce. After four months of exciting gridiron action, America (and the world) has its Super Bowl combatants. After this year's title tilt, the NFL will break with tradition (for one year) and ditch using Roman numerals in the Super Bowl name. The 2016 version of the championship game -- the 50th, to be played in the San Francisco 49ers' Levi's Stadium -- will simply be known as Super Bowl 50.
