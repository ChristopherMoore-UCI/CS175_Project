-- Thousands of Ontario, Canada, residents made do without power Monday in the aftermath of storms that toppled trees and brought down power lines. Toronto Hydro CEO Anthony Haines said major power lines are being restored at a rate of one every few minutes, but street-to-street work remains, and he couldn't offer a guarantee everyone will have power by Christmas. " Ford said 100 trucks from other cities were on their way to Toronto to help restore power to more people. More than 300,000 customers remained without electricity Monday across Ontario, including 200,000 in Toronto, officials reported, in the wake of what Mayor Rob Ford called one of the worst ice storms to hit the city. Northeast: Hot and cold New York City set a record high Sunday at 71 degrees, National Weather Service meteorologist Ashley Sears said.
