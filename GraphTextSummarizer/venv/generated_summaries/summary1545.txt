"We're working to see what's going on in each other's city and to share solutions and help adapt them to our own city." They hope to take home lessons learned in each city in order to address gaps between wealthier areas with great schools and poorer neighborhoods where schools struggle. -- Mayors Julian Castro of San Antonio, Michael Hancock of Denver, Kevin Johnson of Sacramento, California, and Angel Taveras of Providence, Rhode Island, each attended public schools in the cities they now lead. "One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that students are prepared when they start school," Castro said. "I got to excel in school and that was the beginning of my feeling good about achieving academically." Providence Mayor Angel Taveras said he became a lawyer because his third-grade teacher, Mrs. Dorothy Donaldson, told him he could. Providence Talks was the winner of the $5 million Bloomberg Philanthropy Mayors Challenge, a contest created by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to draw out ideas from city leaders.
