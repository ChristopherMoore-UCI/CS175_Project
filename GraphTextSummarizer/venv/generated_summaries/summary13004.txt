"The reason we are not going to file criminal charges is because it was a sanctioned event," said Mario Lopez, a California Highway Patrol spokesman. -- The driver of a truck that crashed into a crowd of spectators in a California desert, killing eight, will not face criminal charges, a spokesman for the highway patrol said on Monday. Lopez added that California vehicle codes did not apply to the race because permits were issued to the event's organizers. The 200-mile race was part of an amateur series on a course in the Lucerne Valley area of San Bernardino County, east of Los Angeles, said Tim Franke of the San Bernardino County Fire Department. He said any safety violations would be investigated by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which owns the land where the race happened, or by agencies that handle permitted events.
