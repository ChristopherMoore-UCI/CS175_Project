President Obama has learned the hard way that without a supportive Congress, not much gets done. Still other Democrats have complained that Obama has not put up enough of a fight and has been too willing to compromise his principles. President George H.W. Bush ensured that Ronald Reagan's moves to reach peace with the Soviet Union in 1987 did not go to waste, while Republicans and Democrats in Congress have entrenched most of the national security programs President George W. Bush put into place. Even if the odds of Congress passing bills based on Obama's proposals are slim, the President can help generate ongoing media discussion about key issues -- such as income inequality or middle class insecurity -- that play well for Democratic presidential candidates. President Obama needs to keep his eyes on 2016.
