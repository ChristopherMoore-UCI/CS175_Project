Baker served in the U.S. Navy, was elected to the U.S. Senate, was asked to serve on the Supreme Court by Nixon, and served two terms as Senate minority leader. The other Republicans of the presidential primaries of 1980 consisted of Sen. Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, who was a liberal Republican and a rather influential member of the Senate Watergate committee (for those of you over 45 you can remember such a species.) He later went on to serve as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senate majority leader, and Senate minority leader. To justify my deeming the Republican field an absolute joke I have compiled a list of comparable candidates for your reading pleasure. George H. W. Bush went on to serve as vice president and president of the United States.
