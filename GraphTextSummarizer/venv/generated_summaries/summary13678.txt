Italian Trulli and Finn Kovalainen were the line-up for Lotus Racing last season as a team bearing the name of the famous marque returned to the world championship for the first time since 1994. Renault have named only Robert Kubica after Russian Vitaly Petrov's seat was placed into question after an inconsistent first season. The 36-year-old Trulli is preparing for his 15th season in F1, racing for six different teams, winning his only grand prix in Monaco in 2004 with Renault. He was knocked unconscious and he wrote on his Twitter blog: "I've been put to bed-rest at home as a precaution, heavy concussion, further tests in the next few days as head took a big hit. Force India, Toro Rosso, Hispania and the renamed Marussia Virgin Racing have yet to confirm their driver line-ups.
