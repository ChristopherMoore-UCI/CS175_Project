The other four factions are Erudite (defined by their transcendent knowledge), Candor (who are compulsively honest), Amity (the naturally peaceful), and Dauntless (the fearless tattooed warrior jocks in black â€” in other words, the sect that anyone cool would want to be part of).

Tris chooses to become part of Dauntless not because she has any special athletic skill but because it's her nature to go for broke.
