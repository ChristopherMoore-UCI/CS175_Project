The idea of spreading the tournament across the continent was first mooted after this year's European Championships by Platini, who suggested it as a way of avoiding high costs at a time of financial uncertainty in many countries. "An opportunity like this, to give many cities and many countries the possibility to host even just one part of a EURO, is certainly an excellent thing, especially in times when you have an economic situation where you cannot expect countries to invest in facilities in the way that such an event requires. On Thursday, Infantino added that the bidding process for host cities will start early next year and is expected to take around 12 months, with a decision expected in 2014. "Obviously the fact that the (championships) will feature 24 teams instead of 16 puts an additional burden on countries to host such an event," said Infantino. "It becomes much more difficult for many countries -- the requirements are becoming bigger and bigger.
