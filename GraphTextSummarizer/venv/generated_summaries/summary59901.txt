Siegelman stands convicted of bribery, conspiracy and honest services mail fraud arising from a scheme in which HealthSouth CEO Richard Scrushy paid $500,000 for a seat on the state regulatory board governing HealthSouth. "The outcome of this case reflects the unflagging commitment of the Department of Justice to hold public officials accountable for corruption," Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer said in a statement. At a hearing Friday in a federal courtroom in Montgomery, District Judge Mark Fuller said Siegelman would serve the 78 months behind bars, plus receive three years of supervised release and a $50,000 fine. -- Former Alabama Gov. Don Siegelman was denied a new trial Friday and resentenced to 6Â½ years in prison for his role in bribery, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice, the Justice Department announced. "The District Court reviewed and denied all of Siegelman's various claims for a new trial prior to his resentencing (Friday)," the Justice Department said.
