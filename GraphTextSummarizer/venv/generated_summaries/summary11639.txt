-- Actor Matthew Lewis, who spent the last 10 years portraying Neville Longbottom, the awkward, nerdy pal to the trio of students at the center of the Harry Potter films, is moving on. CNN: What's your favorite memory from your total Harry Potter experience? What I've gathered from fan mail and meeting people is that that's quite inspiring, and it helps some people get over bullying at school or whatever difficult problems they're having in life. What has coming out the other end of Harry Potter been like for you personally and professionally? I'm a huge fan of "Lord of the Rings," "Harry Potter" and "Star Wars," science fiction, that kind of stuff.
