Although President Obama has continued part of the centrist approach of Clinton on many economic issues, he has also pursued economic policies that have focused on working- and middle-class Americans. The result, according to Hacker and Pierson, were policies that left working- and middle-class Americans at the mercy of powerful market forces. According to Reagan, economic policies that benefited the wealthiest Americans would have a trickle-down effect that eventually helped lower-income brackets. Americans, he shows, in all income brackets have enjoyed more economic success when Democrats inhabit the White House. Regressive tax cuts that benefit wealthier Americans but generate deficits were also fine since, in the long run, more revenue would flow into the Treasury from rising wages.
