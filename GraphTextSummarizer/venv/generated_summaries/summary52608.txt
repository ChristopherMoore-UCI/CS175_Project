The death penalty trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- long delayed by painstaking jury selection, crippling snowstorms and last-ditch appeals to move the case someplace else -- is on track to get underway here next week. The officer was ambushed in his patrol car and shot to death as Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan ran from police hours after their photographs were released to the public. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died during a gun battle with police, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hours later, bleeding and hiding in a boat in a Watertown backyard. Tsarnaev also is charged in the April 19, 2013, death of MIT police officer Sean Collier. It is almost certain that the trial, which will include wrenching testimony and video footage of the bombing victims, will be well underway during the running of this year's Boston Marathon on April 20.
