Russian tanks, troops and armored vehicles poured into South Ossetia and another breakaway Georgian territory, Abkhazia, advancing into Georgian cities across the administrative borders within those regions. Russia's upper house of Parliament gives the green light for the incursion of military forces into Ukraine's volatile Crimea region. Russia and Georgia signed a French-brokered, six-point cease-fire agreement that allowed Russian forces to establish a buffer zone inside Georgia within a few kilometers of South Ossetia. In 2008, Russia's incursion into the former Soviet republic of Georgia followed the launch of a Georgian campaign against the Russian-backed separatist territory of South Ossetia. President Vladimir Putin justifies the move as a necessary step to the protection of Russian citizens and military personnel in southern Crimea.
