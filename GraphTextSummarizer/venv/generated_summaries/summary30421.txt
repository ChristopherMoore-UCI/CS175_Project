France: Senior Islamist militant killed in Mali Protesters lash out at peacekeepers in Central African Republic Dozens killed in attack on peacekeepers' base in South Sudan In fresh evidence the threat of violence in Mali -- and, specifically, attacks directed at international forces -- hasn't gone away, two U.N. peacekeepers died and nine others were hurt in a suicide attack Saturday, the U.N. mission there said. A motorist Saturday targeted a U.N. patrol base in Ber, a village in northern Mali not far from Timbuktu. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility, the recent spate of attacks suggests such a threat is still very real -- especially when one considers that Saturday's attack is the third against U.N. personnel in the past week.
