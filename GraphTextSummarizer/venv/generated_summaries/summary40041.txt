To figure out what posts to show, Facebook looks at a person's most recent everyday actions such as liking, sharing or hiding posts, the amount of interaction they have with people or pages, and a post's popularity among their group of friends. It also resulted in a 5% increase in likes, comments and shares on the resurrected posts from friends, and 8% increase in the same activity for posts from pages, it said. Facebook thinks showing all 1,500 stories would be overwhelming, and that people would miss important posts in that flood of updates. With the new tweak, older posts can resurface and the amount of stories read jumps to 70%, Facebook said. On an average day, Facebook says you have about 1,500 posts from friends and pages you follow.
