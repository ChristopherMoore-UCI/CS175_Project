Petraeus, the 58-year-old four-star general who commands the U.S.-led international military force in Afghanistan, represents a new breed of military leader well-versed in counter-insurgency strategies that depend on coordination and cooperation with the CIA, analysts say. His experience and strong contacts in the major foreign-policy hot spots for the Obama administration -- Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan -- provide strategic value for the leader of CIA operations on the ground in those countries, according to security experts. -- Analysts and sources say a combination of experience working with the CIA in the field and political considerations are behind President Barack Obama's expected nomination of Gen. David Petraeus to be the next director of the Central Intelligence Agency. " Rick Nelson, national security expert from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Petraeus has "a lot of respect around Washington and in the broader international community, which is very important as head of the CIA. For the White House, the sources noted, the CIA role for Petraeus gives him an important command position that tends to stay out of the public spotlight, which could be important given Petraeus' strong personality and the pending challenges of the Afghanistan mission as the presidential campaign gets going.
