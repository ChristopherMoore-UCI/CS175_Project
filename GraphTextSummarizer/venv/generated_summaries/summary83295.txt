Raul Castro was chosen Sunday to take over Cuba's presidency from his brother, Fidel Castro. "Raul Castro has called for a nationwide debate on the country's economic future and for Cubans to propose reforms in group discussions. -- Cuban President Raul Castro is taking over leadership of a country whose government believes its citizens are not working hard enough. " Smith credited the younger Castro's leadership over the past 1Â½ years, while serving as acting president, with having already resulted in "a greater openness, and open criticism of certain government programs." "The country's priority will be to meet the basic needs of the population, both material and spiritual, based on the sustained strengthening of the national economy and its productive basis without which, I'll say it again, development would be impossible," Raul Castro said in a speech Sunday.
