-- A Colorado woman indicted on terror charges pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Wednesday in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The U.S. indictment also charges Colleen R. LaRose, a Pennsylvania suspect known as "Jihad Jane," with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists. He said he is trying to make arrangements for a phone call between mother and son. Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, 31, faces federal charges that she conspired to support terrorists overseas. On Tuesday, the government filed a motion for a continuance in the trial of Paulin-Ramirez and LaRose, citing the complexity of evidence in the case including the seizure of several computer hard drives.
