In a tweet on Sunday, Murdoch seemed to defend his use of the phrase: " 'Jewish owned press' have been sternly criticized, suggesting link to Jewish reporters. And isn't there something rich in a complaint about media ownership by the man who controls Fox News, the Fox broadcast network, 20th Century Fox, the New York Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Times of London, the Sunday Times, Sky News, HarperCollins and other properties? Murdoch is obviously strongly pro-Israel, which may mean he bristles at any coverage that doesn't sympathize with Benjamin Netanyahu's government. The message: "Why is Jewish owned press so consistently anti-Israel in every crisis?" That's right, he said Jewish-owned press, reviving the old canard about Jews controlling the media. Murdoch's Fox News portrayed Mitt Romney as a more viable candidate than he turned out to be.
