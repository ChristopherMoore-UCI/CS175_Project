At 34 and without a new contract having been signed, this may just yet be Gerrard's final act in this competition -- the pinnacle of European football. Trailing 1-0 to Swiss side Basel and facing elimination, Gerrard roused Liverpool one final time with a quite magnificent free kick. Anfield on European nights is supposed to be one of the most enchanting football arenas in world football. One victory from six games, that a last minute triumph against Bulgarian minnow Ludogorets, is a rather sad indictment of the club's campaign. But on this occasion, there was and is nothing magical about this Liverpool side, bar perhaps the cloak of invisibility which seemed to be wrapped up around its tactics and game plan.
