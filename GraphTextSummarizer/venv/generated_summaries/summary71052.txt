We don't have any particular religion, and we'll honor all requests and faith traditions -- special songs, flowers or chants. Robin Lim: In Indonesia, there is a great need for us because many mothers want the help of professional birth attendants but can't afford them. Lim recently spoke with CNN's Ebonne Ruffins about how her midwife teams respond in natural disasters, balancing critical medical needs with cultural traditions.

Lim is the founder of Indonesia's Yayasan Bumi Sehat health clinics, which provide free prenatal and birthing care to women in need.
