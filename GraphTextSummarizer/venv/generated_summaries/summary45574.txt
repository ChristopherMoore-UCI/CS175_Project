Actually, it's less of a movie than a horrific catalogue of everything that is miserable and boring in modern Hollywood: The urge to sequelize into infinity, the paycheck-gravitas of great British actors, the redefinition of "plot" as "a series of digitalized set-pieces signifying nothing," the notion of Shia LaBeouf as an action hero, the notion that Russians still make interesting villains, the limits of Cate Blanchett's greatness, but, most of all, the TV-ification of movie stardom, whereby every movie star is only really a star when they're sleepwalking through reheated incarnations of their most iconic roles. But "Crystal Skull" was directed by Steven Spielberg, who has almost certainly earned the right to strike out every now and then. That's a great run that ended with "Crystal Skull," but in a new interview with Empire, Spielberg sounds pretty serene about the "Indiana Jones" fourquel. Spielberg happily admits that the most infamous scene in Crystal Skull belongs to him: "What people really jumped at was Indy climbing into a refrigerator and getting blown into the sky by an atom-bomb blast. "I sympathize with people who didn't like the MacGuffin because I never liked the MacGuffin," says Spielberg.
