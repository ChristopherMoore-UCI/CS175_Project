He said he was particularly concerned about one section of the treaty, called the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which concerns fundamental human rights, including property rights, for EU citizens. Kaczynski signed the treaty at a ceremony attended by EU officials in Warsaw. The treaty would create an EU president and foreign minister and introduce rotating representatives for member countries in the EU Commission, the union's executive branch. Polish President Lech Kaczynski holds the EU's Lisbon Treaty in Warsaw on October 10. "On its basis, the Luxembourg Court of Justice of the EU will assess whether the legal provisions, customs and practices of the EU member countries comply with those of the charter," Klaus said.
