The team, which apart from Armstrong has a number of high-profile riders including current Giro d'Italia and Vuelta Espana champion Alberto Contador and top American Levi Leipheimer, is financially supported by a consortium of Kazakh-based companies. -- World cycling's governing body, the International Cycling Union (UCI), have expressed their concern at the financial situation surrounding Lance Armstrong's Astana team. The 37-year-old American is immune to Astana's financial plight as he does not receive a salary from the team, relying on his long-term sponsors such as Nike, Oakley and Trek. If the sponsors fail to stump up the required revenue, team chief Johann Bruyneel, who mentored Armstrong to all seven of his Tour de France victories, could have a number of options which should see them able to continue, including finding another title sponsor. "He (McQuaid) will take the opportunity to talk about that, because we are concerned," Enrico Carpani, the UCI's chief press officer, told Press Association Sport.
