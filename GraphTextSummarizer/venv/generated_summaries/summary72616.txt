"I understand from President Ouattara that he wants President Gbagbo to go on trial in Ivory Coast," said the U.N. official. United Nations forces were not involved in the raid on Gbagbo's residence, said U.N. spokesman Hamadoun Toure. -- Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara called for calm Monday after forces stormed the president's residence and arrested Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to accept the results of a presidential election last year plunged the West African nation into civil war. But United Nations and French troops have pounded Gbagbo's forces, citing their mission to protect civilians in the country. The arrest is a "step in the right direction to return Ivory Coast to normality," the source said, adding that the city of Abidjan is a wreck, with "death squads, militias roaming (and) burning bodies on the streets, which is posing a major humanitarian challenge." Speaking from inside the Golf Hotel, Gbagbo told his supporters to stop fighting.
