Right across the four Grand Slam events -- the Australian Open, U.S. Open, Wimbledon and French Open -- comparative prize pools have been affected by volatile exchange rates, largely caused by the recession. Chadwick said volatile exchange rates are unlikely to cause players to turn away from tournaments like Wimbledon as it has a huge prize pool and great history, but, for smaller tournaments it is "a real issue." "With prize money you are trying to attract the best players, and if the prize money pots are reduced ... it really does undermine the appeal of those competitions," he said. Although organizers increased the winner's prize at Roland Garros by â‚¬60,000 this year, recession-driven fluctuations in the Euro - U.S. dollar exchange rate means the men's and women's winner's prizes in U.S. currency ($1.48 million) have actually shrunk by almost $100,000 compared to last year. Director of the Center for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) at Coventry University, Professor Simon Chadwick, told CNN the impact of exchange rates on sports prizes and wages had been largely underestimated. The Australian Open offered the smallest winners' prize check of the four majors in 2008, however, at today's exchange rates, the 2009 prize is currently the richest in the game (although the amount of the 2009 U.S. Open winner's check is yet to be announced).
