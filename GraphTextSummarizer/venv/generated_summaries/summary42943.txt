"Ultimately, play is something that happens in the imagination," said Byrne, content director of TimetoPlayMag.com. Author Christopher Byrne crowd-sourced the compilation from readers of the popular website TimetoPlayMag.com and came up with more than 100 beloved toys. When it comes to gift-giving for children, the most important rule of thumb is to know who you're shopping for, Byrne said. The book includes not just the most popular choices, such as Big Wheels and the Etch a Sketch, but also those that prompted the most compelling memories, serving as "a catalyst for the imagination," Byrne said. Other toys create strong memories simply because of their nostalgic appeal.
