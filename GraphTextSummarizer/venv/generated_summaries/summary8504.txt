However, while Esther Jenner and Kris' daughter Kim Kardashian have both publicly offered strong support for Bruce Jenner, neither has used the words "transgender" or "transitioning" with the media. Jenner's ex-wife, Kris, is the matriarch of the Kardashian clan -- no strangers to growing up and showing off in public. Talk about gender transitioning may be swirling around Bruce Jenner, but the 1976 Olympic gold medalist has kept quiet. Wachowski came out as transgender in public in 2012. Though the mainstream is increasingly aware of the various ways some people are modifying their gender presentations -- even in our Instagrammed, reality-show age -- it remains rare for people to do their transitioning in public.
