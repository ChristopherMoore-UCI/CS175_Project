As officers were leaving, neighbors told them that a small child may also have been living in Bennett's residence, Officer Tanya Little said. She is charged with terroristic threats, simple assault, public drunkenness, aggravated assault, unlawful restraint, false imprisonment and related offenses. According to Little, Bennett is being held at Philadelphia Police Headquarters. Little said it appears to be a case of neglect, and police are unsure for how long the alleged abuse had been going on. -- A woman was found bound to a bed late Friday night in Philadelphia when police responded to a neighborhood dispute, police said.
