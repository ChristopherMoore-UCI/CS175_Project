" Awan said the fight against "murders for honor" is slowly paying off; that police are making more arrests, the courts are prosecuting more cases, and the media is paying attention. In 1999 Awan set up Pakistan's first hotline for female victims of abuse and families who lost loved ones to "honor" murders. British court convicts parents of murder in "honor" killing Ismail accused his wife of eight months of repeatedly flirting with other men and spending long hours away from home. Today Awan has help centers in four cities, providing thousands of victims and families shelter, legal advice, and medical care, often free of charge. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported 943 women were "killed in the name of honor" in Pakistan last year, an increase of more than 100 from 2010.
