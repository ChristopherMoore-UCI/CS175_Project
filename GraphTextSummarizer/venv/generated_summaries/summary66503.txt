Former Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell died Thursday, the team reported on its website. Modell made a large mark on the league as chairman of its television committee, which helped shape lucrative rights fees for game broadcasts. The Browns won the National Football League championship in 1964, two years before the NFL and the rival American Football League agreed to merge. "'Poppy' was a special man who was loved by his sons, his daughter-in-law Michel, and his six grandchildren," Modell's son, David Modell, said in a statement released by the team. His wife, Pat Modell, died last year.
