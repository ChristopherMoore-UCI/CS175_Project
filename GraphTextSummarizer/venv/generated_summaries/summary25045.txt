At the South By Southwest music festival last week, Gaga invited "vomit artist" Millie Brown to join her onstage to do what Brown does best: swill brightly colored goos and then regurgitate them in the name of art. Both Brown and Gaga have been accused of everything from crossing a line of general decency to glamorizing eating disorders, which both artists have said was not their intent. Gaga appeared undaunted by any criticism, explaining that she's charging ahead and at work writing new music. For her part, Brown explained to Elle magazine that she came up with the idea of "vomit art" because she "wanted to use my body to create a performance that was about the beauty from inside out. So while Gaga sang the "Artpop" track "Swine," Brown participated in the performance by sticking her fingers down her throat and vomiting green and black paint all over the pop star.
