"We got caught up in a family feud," Eagles member David Frost told CNN on Tuesday night, referring to the group that rented the Eagles' hall for the party. "When (first responding) officers arrived there it was a pretty intense fight going on inside," Elmwood Place Police Chief William Peskin said. Some 150 people were at a party at the Fraternal Order of Eagles Hall in Elmwood Place when the fight started early Tuesday, CNN affiliate WCPO reported. " Members cleaned up the shards of glass and damaged chairs and a table Tuesday, said Frost, adding that his organization may revisit its policies on rentals. The princess birthday cake for a 3-year-old girl was one of the few things left untouched after a brawl that police said involved 75 people at a hall in suburban Cincinnati, Ohio.
