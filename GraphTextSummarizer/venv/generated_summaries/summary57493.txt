" Rights group: Britons tortured after arrest on drug charges Claims of abuse The men say police beat them and subjected them to electric shocks after their July 10 arrest, according to Reprieve, which provides legal support to prisoners. In a letter to London-based legal charity Reprieve, British Prime Minister David Cameron wrote that "our concerns about the allegations of torture ... have been repeatedly raised with the Emirati authorities, including by the Foreign Secretary and (Foreign Office Minister) Alastair Burt." The supply charges against the men were dropped, said Kate Higham, a lawyer for Reprieve. We hope the UAE president would take this opportunity to show that he shares the British public's concern about torture," Higham said. -- Britain says it will continue to press for an independent investigation into the case of three British citizens who say they were tortured before being sentenced Monday to four years in prison on drug charges in the United Arab Emirates.
