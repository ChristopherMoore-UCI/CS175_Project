The following is a transcript of his speech: Last night, it became apparent that what happened at the Labour Youth League summer camp on Utøya yesterday was a national tragedy. Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and Minister of Culture Anniken Huitfeldt were at Sundvollen last night and in the early hours to support the young people arriving from Utøya and their families. Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg spoke at a news conference Saturday about the two-pronged attack on his country the previous day -- a shooting at a youth camp that killed at least 85, and a bomb targeting government buildings in the capital, Oslo, that killed seven. Every single person on Utøya has been marked for life. Last night, I talked to the leader of the Labour Youth League Eskil Pedersen.
