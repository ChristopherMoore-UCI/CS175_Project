A new Medicare benefit that acknowledges the value of end-of-life conversations between health care practitioners and patients is long overdue and should be included in any health care reform bill. This provision simply provides for Medicare to pay for voluntary conversations between patients and their health care practitioners on the difficult but important subject of planning for care at the end of life. The heated national debate on health care reform has taken an unusual turn, with many eyes focused on a minor provision regarding end-of-life care embedded in the House bill. At some point, we all will need to make decisions about care at the end of life. According to a 2008 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, these discussions have been proven to improve patient care and quality of life.
