Hoping to rid themselves of the bad fortune their weapons brought them on their latest adventure, the crew voted to "bury them as sea," according to Stephen Mayne, once they entered U.S. waters, tossing the firearms overboard. Robert Mayne told CNN last month by cell phone from the prison that the weapons were for protection against piracy while at sea. Despite the run-in with authorities, Mayne said his company would continue to work with Honduras on the log retrieval project, though they would likely not return by sea. -- Six Americans imprisoned in Honduras for more than a month on weapons smuggling charges are back home after sailing their ship from the Central American country to their home port in Florida. The crew of the Aqua Quest arrived in Tarpon Springs, Florida, on Wednesday after a voyage on stormy seas that delayed their return home by a day.
