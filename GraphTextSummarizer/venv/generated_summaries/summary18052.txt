The system would let nations and industries that are the biggest greenhouse-gas emitters buy carbon credits in tropical forests in South and Central America, Africa, Southeast Asia and other equatorial regions. Rain forests absorb and store huge amounts of carbon dioxide, the most prevalent of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Final details of the plan remain uncertain, such as how forest carbon credits would be verified and how the money paid for them would be handled and distributed. Polluters in the developing world would be able to offset their emissions by buying credits for stored forest carbon dioxide. Global climate change treaty, scheduled for completion in December, is designed to protect tropical forests.
