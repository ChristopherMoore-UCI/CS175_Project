Anderson's fitness is key to England's hopes, the tourists having already lost fellow fast bowler Stuart Broad for the rest of the series due to injury. Australia level series with crushing Perth win "Jimmy seems absolutely fine," said captain Andrew Strauss. Meanwhile, England's injury worry James Anderson also appears to be winning his fitness battle. The 28-year-old pace bowler suffered a side strain in the defeat in Perth, but came through an hour-long net session Friday. Australia vice-captain Michael Clarke is confident Ponting will be fit to play on Sunday.
