Meanwhile, parts of North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Vermont were under winter weather warnings Tuesday for additional snow. In Coral Springs on Florida's west coast, Michigan resident Rob Brown was reveling in what he considered to be warm weather as he worked in a long-sleeved T-shirt at the family Christmas tree stand. For the past 15 years, Brown's family has cut trees from their farm in Greenville, Michigan, to sell in south Florida.
