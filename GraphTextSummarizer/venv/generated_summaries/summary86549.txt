The primary focus for Martino and the Argentina team will be the 2015 Copa America, which takes place in Chile during June and July next year. Martino enjoys a good relationship with Argentina captain and Barca star Lionel Messi, having managed Argentine club Newell's Old Boys while the four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner was in its youth team. Martino arrived in Catalonia as a replacement for Tito Vilanova, who was forced to step down in July 2013 as he battled throat cancer. -- Three months after leaving Barcelona following a trophyless season, Gerardo Martino has been appointed coach of the Argentina national team. Despite signing a two-year contract, Martino lasted just one season at the Nou Camp, missing out on the La Liga title to Atletico Madrid on the final day of the season having been eliminated at the quarterfinal stage of the European Champions League by the same opposition.
