Michael Bloomberg on Monday called on designers to come up with a proposal for a Manhattan apartment building made up mostly of "micro-units," defined as rentals with 275 to 300 square feet of living space. Observers say Bloomberg's proposal may reflect shifting housing needs and point to a more accurate portrayal of the true costs of city living. The units will likely be priced under $2,000 a month, which is the average market rent for a studio apartment in Manhattan, according to city Housing Preservation and Development Commissioner Matthew Wambua. " Micro-units will equate to about 15% of the size of the average U.S. home, he added, which spans about 2,200 to 2,400 square feet. Bloomberg's soda ban proposal goes to public comment Submissions are due September 14, and winners will be chosen at the end of 2012, with the first micro-units to be developed by late 2013.
