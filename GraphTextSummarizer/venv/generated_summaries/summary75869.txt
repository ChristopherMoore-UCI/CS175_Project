U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said, "If you pirate an American ship, you will be caught and you'll face severe consequences in an American courtroom." Mohamud Hirs Issa Ali, Mohamud Salad Ali and Ali Abdi Mohamed -- all in their 30s -- entered guilty pleas in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia. -- Three Somali men pleaded guilty on Friday to piracy and hostage-taking charges involving the yacht Quest, a February hijacking that ended with the death of four American citizens. Americans Scott and Jean Adams, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle were found shot to death when U.S. forces boarded the yacht. The piracy and hostage-taking charges carry mandatory life sentences.
