And while Nelson Mandela may have been freed from prison in 1990 after 27 years, and the system of racial separation of apartheid was beginning to be dismantled with the opening of beaches and other public places by then-President F. W. De Klerk, the reality was that black people had a long way to go. So I say goodbye to Madiba and celebrate his life with the joyous lyrics of "Black President" by Brenda Fassie, a nationwide hit that I first heard in South Africa at a celebration party after Mandela's election. For me, traveling to South Africa in the early 1990s before apartheid was fully dismantled was an eye-opening experience. In South Africa, I met courageous journalists who had risked their lives and lived in daily fear because they dared to speak out against apartheid. After reading about his life and studying the history of South Africa, "Madiba" became a hero and symbol of freedom for me and many of my generation.
