The benefits are enormous, says Jonathan Meyer, leader of Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM) Research at EADS Innovation Works, based in the UK. We can achieve properties that are equivalent to or, in some cases, better than available materials from plate products," Meyer said. As well as cutting down on waste, the technology also presents the opportunity to make new system parts that are more complex than ones made using conventional machining, Meyer says. When you invest in tooling it drives you to a requirement for higher volumes in order to make the cost case," Meyer said. Now we are focusing on multi-material printing -- integrating electric wires, batteries and motors," Lipson said.
