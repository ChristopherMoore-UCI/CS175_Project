With the effects of rising water levels that scientists have blamed on global warming already being felt in Maldives and Miami, Olthuis says we need to learn to live with the water, not just fight it. "We call it a scar-less development," architect Koen Olthuis tells CNN, explaining why the five-star Krystall will sit in icy waters off Tromso's rugged coastline rather than on dry land. Olthuis says the Krystall has been inspired by the floating architecture widely found in his low-lying Dutch homeland, but will be on a far grander, and more opulent scale that is hoped will attract wealthy visitors from Japan, Russia and other parts of Europe. "Building on water brings us new space for expansion, safety against floods and flexibility to adjust developments without demolition whenever needed." "I see around me the first signs of a new generation of climate change architects who do not only want to provide icons but also solutions," he adds.
