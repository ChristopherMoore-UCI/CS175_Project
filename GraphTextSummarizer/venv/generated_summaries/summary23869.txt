-- A group of student protesters were arrested Sunday after they called on President Bush to end the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan, and refused to leave the front gates of the White House. In the U.S., Scott Warren, national student director of the Student Anti-Genocide Coalition, said the students were bringing specific demands to the president, including bolstering the United Nations peacekeeping force in Sudan and stepping up pressure on China, Sudan's trading partner. Sunday's protest was one of many scheduled around the world for "Global Day for Darfur" to mark five years of ethnic cleansing in Sudan. Also, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for Darfur peace talks. "We're trying to help them, but the truth of the matter is there are obstacles to peace in Darfur," he said at a stop in Tanzania.
