Putin, who himself became president of Russia partly because of heavy contributions from oligarchs in his first presidential campaign, knows that the only thing that can defeat him is huge money. Putin has long insisted that the country's new elite should bring money back to Russia. During his press conference on March 4, when Putin was asked if Russia was considering annexing Crimea, he said no. The United States, Britain and Canada are upset that Russia has breached the Budapest Memorandum, but so what? Putin's approval rating has increased, his political oppositions are split, and many Russians support the return of Crimea. Crimea gave Putin exactly what he desired -- an opportunity to build a financial iron curtain between Russia and the West.
