-- Three of Michael Jackson's brothers settled a lawsuit Monday that they filed last week against a company they alleged "duped" them in a deal to sell replicas of jackets worn by the pop icon. "We spent the last week making sure that everyone is in agreement with this settlement," Eric Farber, the attorney for the Jackson brothers, said in announcing the settlement. The endorsement of the "Thriller" and "Beat It" jackets was the first involving Michael Jackson's oldest son, Prince, who posed for pictures with his uncles as they autographed the limited-edition jackets last month. Michael Jackson debuted the red "Beat It" and red and black "Thriller" jackets, designed by Marc Laurent, in 1983. "We have such an immense respect for the Jackson brothers and Michael's legacy and are pleased to have resolved this situation," he said.
