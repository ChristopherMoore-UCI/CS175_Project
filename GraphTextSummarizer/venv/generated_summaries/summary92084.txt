Expect daring new designs To understand the epic patent dispute between Apple and Samsung, one must appreciate that there were two distinct breeds of intellectual property rights at play in the case: Utility patents and design patents. Roughly speaking, utility patents protect the function of an item, while design patents protect the appearance of an item. Design patents were at the core of this case. During the course of the trial we learned Samsung's business folk were calling most of the shots on product design, rather than its design professionals. Finally, it has a desire to expend significant effort and resources to enforce and defend product design.
