Bin Hammam, a FIFA executive committee member and president of the Asian Football Confederation, told CNN last month that the time had arrived for change in the organization after more than a decade under the stewardship of the Swiss. -- Asian football chief Mohammed Bin Hammam will be Sepp Blatter's only opponent in the forthcoming FIFA presidential elections, the sport's governing body confirmed on Monday. Africa's Issa Hayatou was the last candidate to run against the Swiss when he was defeated in the 2002 ballot, which came after a campaign of accusations of financial mismanagement at FIFA. If successful in his bid to succeed Blatter, Bin Hammam would become the ninth president in FIFA's history. Blatter, who has been involved with FIFA since 1975, announced at a recent UEFA congress in Paris this will be his last term as president if he is elected for another four years at the helm.
