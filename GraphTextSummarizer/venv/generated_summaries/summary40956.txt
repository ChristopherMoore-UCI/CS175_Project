Morrissey said estimates of deficits in the pool's finances were reduced last year when a Social Security advisory board's technical panel revised some unrealistically low assumptions it had made about Latino immigration. Minority births, combined with high immigration levels, kept the nation's population growing dynamically, spurring the economy by adding to consumer demand. Latinos and other minority workers contribute to keeping the Social Security system solvent, according to Monique Morrissey, an economist for the Economic Policy Institute. Asians, the second-fastest growing group, increased 2.7 percent year-over-year to 15.5 million. The undocumented workers among them often pay more into the Social Security pool than they will take out in benefits.
