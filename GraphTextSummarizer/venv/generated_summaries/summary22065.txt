While speaking with Australian outlet News.com.au, Noth dropped this comment about the charming but manipulative Mr. Big and his relationship with Sarah Jessica Parker's romance-loving Carrie Bradshaw: "He was what he was. " News.com.au notes that Noth made his remark about the Carrie Bradshaw character with a laugh, which would indicate that the actor was being facetious. Sarah Jessica Parker teams up with Manolo Blahnik CEO Questionable humor aside, Noth was more serious about how theshow affected his beloved city, New York. "The New York that 'Sex and the City' depicted is not the New York that I love," Noth said.
