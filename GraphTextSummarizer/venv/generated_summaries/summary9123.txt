"Presence of voters today is lower than any other time of voting," said Gazi Aslim Uddin, a presiding officer at a voting station in old Dhaka. Police officials reported violence in many parts of the country as opposition activists hoping to foil elections clashed with officers. The capital of Dhaka was largely peaceful, but voter turnout was low. Senior BNP leader Osman Farruk demanded cancellation of the elections results and called for fresh elections under a neutral caretaker government. Attackers torched about 150 polling centers and election materials nationwide.
