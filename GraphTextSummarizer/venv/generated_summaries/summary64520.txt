Supporting Perry would provide Palin with a plausible context to remain in the limelight, which translates into more photo ops, more speeches, more television interviews and more chances to flex her muscles. From Palin's perspective, her legend soars for saving a campaign on life support and, should Perry lose, she can save face by passionately proclaiming that she fought for the candidate and the values in which she believes. A dose of Palin power would do much to revitalize Perry's chances to win the Republican presidential nomination. But while it is easy to see how Perry could benefit from an infusion of Palin power, what does the Alaskan maverick with a penchant for self-promotion have to gain by pitching her potency toward Perry? Or better yet, imagine a commercial with Palin touting Perry as a great American and a true, true Christian (hint hint).
