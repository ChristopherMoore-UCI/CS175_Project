The United States issued a general travel alert for Americans in Europe last month amid concerns that al Qaeda or related groups might be planning attacks similar to the 2008 massacre in the Indian city of Mumbai. "We investigate some specific persons, but we cannot yet make connections to specific threats on specific locations or type of attacks. "We have no firm lead on a specific location of a potential attack, or names or groups," said Joerg Ziercke, head of the Federal Criminal Police Office. The Reichstag cupola is multi-storied providing views of the Berlin landscape and also the main hall of parliament below. "What Der Spiegel wrote is to be seen and understood in context with the overall assessment of potential targets being possibly highly symbolic places, buildings, venues," said Ziercke.
