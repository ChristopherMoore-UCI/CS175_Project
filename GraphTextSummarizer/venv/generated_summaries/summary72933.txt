-- An anti-abortion activist suspected in the death of Kansas doctor George Tiller told CNN on Tuesday the closing of Tiller's women's clinic is "a victory for all the unborn children." Scott Roeder, charged in the death of Dr. George Tiller, spoke to CNN on Tuesday. At the time Roeder was interviewed Tuesday, word of the permanent closure had not come out -- but when told the clinic had been shuttered since Tiller's death, he said, "Good." Roeder said the closure would mean "no more slicing and dicing of the unborn child in the mother's womb and no more needles of poison into the baby's heart to stop the heart from beating, and no more partial-birth abortions." But he complained about conditions in the jail, saying he doesn't like being in solitary confinement and that the jail is "freezing." Associates have told CNN that Roeder was a regular among the protesters who routinely gathered at Tiller's clinic. He had already survived one attempt on his life before he was slain, and the announcement by Tiller's family dismayed supporters of abortion rights. Troy Newman, the president of one of those organizations, Operation Rescue, said in a statement on the group's Web site Tuesday that his group is "thankful that Tiller's clinic will not reopen and thankful that Wichita is now abortion-free."
