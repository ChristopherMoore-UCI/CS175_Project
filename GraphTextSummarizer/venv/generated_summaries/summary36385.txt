There's nothing wrong with the great percentage of Twitter fights. And while the Humboldt University report doesn't indicate how many of these comments were made during Twitter fights, I can assure you that is where I have seen them rear their ugly face most often. -- For some, Twitter is a social media platform that enables you to keep up with breaking news, raise political issues or offer amusing thoughts. Here's my plea to my fellow Twitter users: We need to make it clear that there's simply no place for that type of hate on Twitter. If enough of us collectively speak out, Twitter can become a social media platform where users share info, joke around and even fight with each other, but all without being subject to hate.
