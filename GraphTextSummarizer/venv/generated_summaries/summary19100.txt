-- A blaze in a historic Sufi shrine in Indian-controlled Kashmir's capital on Monday triggered widespread anger and violence. Efforts by firefighters could not save the ornate structure, named for an 11th-century Iraqi saint, Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jeelani, who never visited Kashmir. The 200-year-old shrine, a classic of Kashmir architecture, caught fire early Monday morning. The gutting of the highly revered shrine set off angry protests and clashes between police and protesters in the old city. Kashmir is having a booming tourist season.
