Grandmother: Adopted boy sent back to Russia was violent Artyem Saveliev, adopted from a Russian orphanage, was put on a plane back to Moscow. The United States and Russia last year signed an agreement to strengthen procedural safeguards for adoptions following the 2010 incident. The American woman who sent her adopted son back to Russia must pay $150,000 in child support, a Tennessee judge reaffirmed Friday. An investigation was launched after the child showed up unannounced at Russia's child protection ministry with a letter from his adoptive mother asking Russian authorities to annul the adoption. In May, the association said Artyem is still a U.S. citizen and under Tennessee law Hansen is legally considered to be his mother.
