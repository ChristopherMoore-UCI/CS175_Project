Although there are many free e-book versions of the Bible floating around online, a 6-inch Kindle e-reader retails in the U.S. for $109 (or about $139 in the UK). Guests not keen on paying for an e-book they might have to abandon halfway through can choose from the 15,000 free titles in Amazon's free e-book collection. Starting this month, however, the InterContinental Hotels Group is modernizing that mission at one of its hotels, replacing the paper tomes with electronic versions of the Bible loaded on Kindle e-readers. Just like with fluffy hotel robes, the full cost of any pilfered Kindle will be charged to a guest's credit card. If guests purchase other books to read, the cost will be charged directly to their rooms.
