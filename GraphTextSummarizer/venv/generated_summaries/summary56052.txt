-- Costa Rica grabbed their first points of the 2011 Copa America on Thursday and left hosts Argentina facing elimination after a 2-0 victory over Bolivia. Second half goals from strike duo Josue Martinez and Joel Campbell secured three points for Costa Rica, while Bolivia endured a torrid evening after having two players dismissed. Costa Rica sealed an important victory with 12 minutes remaining, when the lively Campbell ran clear to slide a shot beyond the helpless Arias. The result means two-time world champions Argentina must beat Ricardo La Volpe's Costa Rica in their final Group A match on Monday to avoid an early exit from the quadrennial tournament. The Central American side went ahead after 59 minutes, when the 21-year-old Martinez swept home after goalkeeper Carlos Arias had saved Heiner Mora's effort.
