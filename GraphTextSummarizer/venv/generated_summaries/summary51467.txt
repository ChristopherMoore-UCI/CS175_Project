Jackson's startling June 25 death nearly brought the Web to a standstill, with several sites buckling under the sheer weight of traffic. Long before the memorial service began about 1:40 p.m. ET, many Web sites braced themselves for an onslaught of traffic. But early numbers suggested that Internet traffic Tuesday may have lagged behind other recent news events. With many North Americans at work during Jackson's memorial service, online traffic had been expected to reach near-record levels. Millions of people around the world watched coverage of Jackson's memorial service on the Web, although the event appeared to fall well short of online viewership records.
