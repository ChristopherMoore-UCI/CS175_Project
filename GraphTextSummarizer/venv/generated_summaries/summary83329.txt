At a Saturday community event at the campus where the attack took place, the Rev. Jim Wheeler, who said he was the family's pastor at First Presbyterian Church in Richmond, read a statement from the teenager's parents. " Police say as many as 10 people were involved in the rape on October 24 in a dimly lit back alley outside Richmond High School, where a homecoming dance was taking place. "If you need to express your outrage, please channel your anger through positive action," they said, according to Wheeler. The parents of a 15-year-old girl who was gang-raped on a California high school campus urged the community Saturday to channel its anger over the event "through positive action," according to a pastor. The victim, who was taken to a hospital in critical condition, was released Wednesday.
