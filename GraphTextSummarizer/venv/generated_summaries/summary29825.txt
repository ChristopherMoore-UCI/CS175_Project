Khodorkovksy has penned a seven point plan for the opposition which include a focus on peaceful protest, the establishment of two or three political parties, getting activists out of Moscow into the regions and establishing working pacts with moderates within Putin's regime. Last December, after the spontaneous popular demonstrations in Moscow against the "results" of the parliamentary elections, suggested that Russia's internet hamsters might be outfoxing Vladimir Putin. The rest rely for their information on radio, television and newspapers which are mostly managed by Putin apologists and allies.

" "Putin beats the spread", noted Matthew Rojanksy, deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia Program.
