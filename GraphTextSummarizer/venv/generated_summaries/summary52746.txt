#Buckwild" The series, which follows a group of young people as they have fun in Sissonville, West Virginia, was controversial before it even aired. "I still cannot get over the fact that Shain Gandee died he was my favorite," tweeted one fan named Buffy Sue. In reviewing the show, The Hollywood Reporter said it "follows a slew of wild, drunken West Virginians in their late teens and early 20s." "Not only is it another tired portrayal of Southern stereotypes, but it's also inexcusably poorly executed," the review said. Many believed the show would fill the void of the wildly successful "Jersey Shore," which featured plenty of drunken shenanigans, hookups and fights. So reports of the death of 21-year-old cast member Shain Gandee on Monday hit fans hard.
