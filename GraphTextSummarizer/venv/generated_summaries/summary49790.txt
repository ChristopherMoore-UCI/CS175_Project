Protesters have used Change Square for a seven-month sit-in demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Thousands protested in Sanaa's Change Square last week, but this week the square has been quiet, except for groups of youths carrying away the dead and helping the injured. Dozens were killed and more than 700 were wounded -- many of them by gunshots -- over the last three days in clashes with the military, according to medical staff in Change Square. -- Civilians are in hiding in the Yemeni capital as protesters and government forces struggle for control on the streets of Sanaa. Abdul Rahman Barman, the executive director of a local human rights organization, said Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh's regime is attacking with no limits and does not differentiate between civilians, protesters or gunmen.
