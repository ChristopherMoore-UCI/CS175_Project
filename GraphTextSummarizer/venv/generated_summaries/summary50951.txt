USCIS Director Alejandro Mayorkas said in a press release: "The law is designed to avoid extreme hardship to U.S. citizens, which is precisely what this rule achieves." The new rule does not guarantee legal status to the undocumented immigrant -- the family still has to prove that the deportation of the spouse or parent would cause "extreme hardship" to the U.S. citizen. " Under current law, immediate relatives of U.S. citizens who are not eligible to adjust status in the U.S. to become lawful permanent residents must leave the country and obtain an immigrant visa in their home country. "This final rule facilitates the legal immigration process and reduces the amount of time that U.S. citizens are separated from their immediate relatives who are in the process of obtaining an immigrant visa," said Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano in a press release. The new rule does not apply to U.S. children with an undocumented parent.
