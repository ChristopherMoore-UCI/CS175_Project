It was City's second home defeat in three days, having been knocked out of the FA Cup by Manchester United on Sunday. The winners will face either Crystal Palace or Cardiff City, who both play in the second-tier Championship, in next month's final at Wembley Stadium. -- Captain Steven Gerrard scored the only goal from the penalty spot as Liverpool beat Manchester City 1-0 in Wednesday's first leg of their English League Cup semifinal. Meanwhile, there was a shock result in the last 16 of the Italian Cup as Serie A title hopefuls Udinese lost 2-1 at home to Chievo. Gerrard made no mistake with his 13th-minute spot-kick, after City defender Stefan Savic had fouled Daniel Agger in the area, to give Liverpool a narrow advantage to take into the second leg at Anfield in a fortnight.
