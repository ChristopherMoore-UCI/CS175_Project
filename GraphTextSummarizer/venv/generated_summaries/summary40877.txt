" The reality singing competition has suffered from quite a few complaints from the poor performance of the male contestants last year to the lack of producing chart-topping artists in recent years. But even while the show, which for years has been a juggernaut in the ratings for Fox, has slid in terms of viewers for the past year, it is still a force to be reckoned with in TV land. The show will be back with heavy competition from NBC's "The Voice," which for the first time last year beat "Idol" in the ratings on a Thursday night. According to a Forbes ranking, Carrie Underwood was the top money-making "Idol" winner last year. The country artist/ "Sound of Music" actress raked in $31 million last year and has pulled in $83 million over the past few years.
