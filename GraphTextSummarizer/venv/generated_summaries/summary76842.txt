U.S. investigators appeared ready to blame North Korea for the crippling hack attack at Sony Pictures, which saw the leak of internal emails and personal information that escalated to a threat that people should avoid going to theaters where "The Interview" is playing. Can u do the opposite of what u just did & get it back IN to theaters?" Meanwhile, Seth Rogen posted a review of the film earlier this week, but neither he nor James Franco addressed the controversy directly on social media. He tweeted: "Dear Sony Hackers: now that u run Hollywood, I'd also like less romantic comedies, fewer Michael Bay movies and no more Transformers." -- Celebrities expressed their outrage at Sony Picture's decision to cancel plans to release "The Interview" on Christmas Day on Twitter. When the film was pulled, celebrities vented their disappointment and raised concerns about the precedent it would set for controversial films in the future.
