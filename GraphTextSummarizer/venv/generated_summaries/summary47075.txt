We shared a podium together a couple of times." Wolff, who replaced Massa's teammate Valtteri Bottas for Friday's first practice session, finished 1.638 seconds off the pace set by current championship leader Nico Rosberg. Things had not looked so promising for Wolff earlier in the day as she crawled round her out lap in first gear before returning to the pits. Wolff has been a development driver for Williams since 2012 and is the first female driver to participate in a F1 race weekend since Italy's Giovanna Amati attempted to qualify for three races during the 1992 season. The Australian's teammate and last year's race winner Sebastian Vettel finished the session in sixth, one place behind McLaren's Jenson Button. The Williams development driver only managed four laps during practice at the British Grand Prix a fortnight ago before engine problems curtailed her involvement.
