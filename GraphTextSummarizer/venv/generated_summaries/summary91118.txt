When Apple made the white MacBook unavailable to the public last year, it was on the same day the company introduced its 11-inch MacBook Air for $999 -- the same price the as the MacBook. Now, however, the machine has officially been EOL'd (End of Lifed), bringing the old iBook legacy to an end once and for all. It's unlikely that Apple has been actively manufacturing white MacBooks up to this point, either -- it's not public how long the company did manufacture it (if at all) past last July, but its cancellation this week was likely due to the end of whatever remaining supply was available. The 13-inch machine was essentially killed off for most of the public last July, but the budget laptop continued to be available to schools for the last six months. The white plastic MacBook is officially dead for good after Apple notified resellers that it will no longer be available to educational institutions.
