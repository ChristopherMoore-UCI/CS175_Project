Khawlan is one of the most lawless areas in the country and al Qaeda uses it as a traveling route to numerous parts of the country, local tribal leaders said. When Yemen's 2011 uprising led to the al Qaeda invasion of Abyan -- the southern province of Yemen -- Washington was quick to call on newly elected President Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi to set his house in order and address militarily the threat posed by al-Qaeda in the country. He said that more strikes will continue and that al Qaeda is living its weakest days in Yemen. The United States views Yemen as being on the front line of the war on al Qaeda. Three of the killed were senior members of al Qaeda, two of whom were Saudi nationals, the officials said.
