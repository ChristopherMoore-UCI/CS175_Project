-- Two paintings by Pablo Picasso and a third by Henri Matisse were among works auctioned off Tuesday at Christie's, including "Jacqueline," a Picasso not seen publicly since 1967. Also offered in the auction, called the "Impressionist and Modern Art Evening Sale," is "Homme Assis sur une Chaise," a Picasso portrait painted in 1956, soon after he had moved from Paris, France, to La Californie, a villa overlooking Cannes in the south of France. And "Mademoiselle Grimprel au Ruban Rouge," an 1880 portrait by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, portrays Helene Grimprel, granddaughter of Armand Grimprel, a wealthy banker who became a great patron of the arts, Christie's said. The 1963 work is a portrait of Picasso's second wife, whom he married in 1961, Christie's said. The woman had a very short neck, Christie's said, "and it is said that Picasso would often humorously exaggerate its size in his portraits.
