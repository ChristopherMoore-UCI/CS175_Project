The United Arab Emirates will try 94 people on charges of seeking to seize power, the UAE's state news agency WAM reported Sunday. "They launched, established and ran an organisation seeking to oppose the basic principles of the UAE system of governance and to seize power," Attorney General Salem Saeed Kubaish said in a statement published by WAM. It came to power in Egypt after a revolution that unseated President Hosni Mubarak and brought sweeping changes to that country. The government accuses the group of meeting in secret "in their houses and farms" to organize their plot to "seize power and the state's system's governance," according to a statement on the official news agency WAM. Abdullah Al-Hadidi, son of 53-year old detained al-Islah member Abdulrahman Al Hadidi, spoke with CNN.
