It is not necessarily homophobic or sexist people using such words and phrases, but largely just ordinary people. -- This fall, two student organizations at Duke University met to discuss a simple idea: Put a spotlight on reasons people might take offense to phrases and slurs used in everyday conversation. Anuj Chhabra on using the phrase 'That's so gay': I thought it was important to bring awareness to the implications that these words have because having used some of [these phrases] in high school, I quickly realized how differently other Duke students perceived me [when I commented], "That's so gay." When I was in high school, I was the leader of the my school's small Christian Fellowship. Even if I am not gay, I know that calling someone a "fag" or qualifying an expression of admiration with "no homo" attaches hurtful connotations to words that are directly connected to a certain identity.
