Yeah, we know that the notion of beating your brother-in-law at Words With Friends has been haunting your very dreams, but your friend/family member/other of varying degrees of significance is probably much more interesting. Digital dallying You stopped physically seeing this dude/chick about three weeks ago, but you still text him/her every once in a while ("Whoooaaa, it's like unseasonably warm today!"), you still comment on all of his/her stuff on Facebook and you're currently engaged in a vigorous game of Chess With Friends. Whoever answers first -- or whoever answers with the best, most exciting plans (jello shots and football and girls!!!) You may have a problem if: your first thought when gazing up at a sun-splashed sky, rippling and luminescent like a melting watercolor, is "I have to Instagram that" instead of, "Oh, pretty sunset." Yup, we're addicted to those little bleating beasts, so much so that we fold them wholly into our workaday lives, blindly committing a cornucopia of social indignities with zero cognizance.
