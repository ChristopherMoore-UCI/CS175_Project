'A fundamental freedom ... critically injured' "We will do everything in our power to catch this individual," Interior Minister Manuel Valls announced Monday. The description of the man at Liberation is similar to that of the man at BFMTV, and the gun used was of similar caliber, police said. -- Paris police on Tuesday continued to search for the man who shot a photographer twice near the heart with a shotgun in the lobby of the French daily newspaper Liberation on Monday. There had been no recent threats against the paper, and security was not high, managing editor Fabrice Rousselot told CNN affiliate BFMTV. Another man told police he was carjacked in the neighborhood of La Defense.
