-- A German organization involved in establishing and maintaining the Indonesian tsunami warning system denies widespread reports that the system failed to detect the tsunami that devastated parts of the Mentawai Islands on Monday. The statement continued:  "The detection of the causative earthquake by the seismic network was almost in real time, the corresponding operational image showed relevant warning levels in particular for the western coastline of the Mentawai Islands. "Contrary to reports stating otherwise, all components of the tsunami early warning system worked properly," the German Indonesian Tsunami Early Warning System said in a statement. In particular the organization refuted news articles claiming the warning system had been vandalized and was not functioning. The tsunami followed a 7.7-magnitude earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra.
