At Monica's house, she and Jenny had a mom-to-mom chat about the issues that mother warriors face. Within four weeks, Monica's infection had restricted the blood flow to her arms and legs. So when Oprah heard about Monica, another mom fighting for her children, she thought Jenny would be just the person to get this mother warrior's story. A year later, Jenny visited Monica and her family at their home outside Boston, Massachusetts. Jenny calls Tony a daddy warrior because he always stood by Monica and their family.
