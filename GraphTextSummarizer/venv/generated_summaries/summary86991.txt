Five cannons from the Queen Anne's Revenge, the sunken flagship of Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard), were recovered Monday by scientists from the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources after nearly 300 years under the water of Beaufort Inlet. The Queen Anne's Revenge's remains are scuttled two miles off the North Carolina coast in 25 feet of water. The team, working with the Coast Guard, brought the big guns --  2,000 and 3,000 pounds -- to the surface of Beaufort Inlet on Monday. Rrrrrchaelogists have recovered five big six pounders from t' wreck o' t' famed scurvy dog Blackbeard's ship off t' coast o' North Carolina. Blackbeard made it six more months before he was killed in a battle with British troops.
