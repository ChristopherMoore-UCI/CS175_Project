-- Shia LaBeouf appeared in Manhattan criminal court Thursday morning over charges stemming from a June incident at a Broadway performance of "Cabaret." The actor was arrested after allegedly disrupting the Broadway show mid-performance and has been accused of berating and spitting at police officers who were removing him from the theater. The actor's attorney, G. Robert Gage Jr., and New York Assistant District Attorney Ali Russell jointly requested an adjournment from the court, asking the judge to allow them to work toward "a possible resolution" to the charges. LaBeouf didn't speak during the brief court appearance before Judge Ann Scherzer, who took less than five minutes to grant the adjournment. He entered the courtroom surrounded by his legal team and went up to shake hands with Russell.
