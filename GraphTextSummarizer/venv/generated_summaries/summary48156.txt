-- A number of Israelis and tourists entering the country at Ben Gurion Airport have had their new Apple iPads seized by customs officials. Those words are not likely to comfort those in Israel who have had their iPads taken away, with reports of angry scenes at the airport. Apple announced on Wednesday that it was delaying the worldwide release of iPads because "demand is far higher than we predicted and will likely continue to exceed our supply. Yechiel Shavi, spokesman for the Ministry of Communication, told CNN that the ban only applies to those iPads built for the American standard but would not apply to devices that match the European specifications. Israeli authorities say the devices' Wi-Fi standard does not match Israel's standard, which is also used in Europe.
