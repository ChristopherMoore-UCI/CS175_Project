-- Twitter posts about anti-government protests have landed a human rights activist in Bahrain behind bars. Said Yousif al-Muhafda is accused of disseminating false information about clashes between security forces and protesters in the country's capital, the state-run Bahrain News Agency said Thursday. The image, posted Monday, "resulted in protests and acts of sabotage that disrupted security on that same day," Bahrain's government news agency said, citing Deputy Attorney General Mohammed Salah. " Al-Muhafda has been using the account for months to document what he says are human rights violations in Bahrain. Human rights activists have criticized the arrest, saying it is part of a growing crackdown on social media posts.
