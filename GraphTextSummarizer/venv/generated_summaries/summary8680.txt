" As for how Fallon matched her pipes during their duet, Streisand jokingly deadpanned, "I wouldn't give up your night job," before saying that she and her husband, actor James Brolin, are big fans of Fallon and his show. At least it did for Barbra Streisand, who was the sole guest and musical act Monday night on "The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon." In honor of her appearance after a 51-year absence, Fallon insisted that Streisand sit in his host chair behind the desk. Fallon filled in for some of those partners Monday night as he sang a medley with Streisand. The project is a series of duets with singers, including Blake Shelton, Michael BublÃ© and Stevie Wonder.
