R. Andrew Murray, the Mecklenburg County district attorney, said that while the high bail was "not typical for a revoked license charge," the court document "heightens our concern for public safety." Tyson spent Sunday night and most of Monday in jail. Tyson is a volunteer with the Rainforest Action Network and has spoken at Occupy Charlotte events, according to the group's website and Twitter feeds. The Charlotte lawyer got before a judge, Lisa Bell, on Monday and convinced her to lower Tyson's bail to $2,500. "I firmly believe that Mr. Tyson has been profiled and has been singled out as an organizer, and I believe that the government in this case had the intention of suppressing speech before it was even exercised," Fletcher said. "I think it's censorship pure and simple, and I have never seen a $10,000 cash bond on any kind of traffic charge." Tyson agrees.
