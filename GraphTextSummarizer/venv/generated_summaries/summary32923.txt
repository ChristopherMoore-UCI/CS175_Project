A neighbor told The Bristol Press that he had seen a strange vehicle outside Yussman's house on Monday. But this whodunit began Monday in a quiet cul-de-sac in Bristol, Connecticut. The plot surrounding Yussman is reminiscent of that of pizza delivery man Brian Wells in 2003. And two days later, police say they are still searching for the two men who forced their way into Yussman's home and ordered him to carry out the heist. It was still dark, when Yussman pulled into his driveway, he told police.
