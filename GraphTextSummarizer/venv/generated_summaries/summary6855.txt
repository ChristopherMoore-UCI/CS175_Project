Despite that problem, NASA Administrator Charles Bolden called Sunday's launch and the mission "a critical event in space flight." SpaceX said it was studying flight data with NASA to figure out what happened, "and we will apply those lessons to future flights." Orbital has a nearly $2 billion contract with NASA for station resupply missions. "For the protection of the space station mission, NASA had required that a restart of the upper stage only occur if there was a very high probability (over 99%) of fully completing the second burn," SpaceX said. "Looks like we've tamed the Dragon," NASA's Sunita Williams, commander of the current ISS mission, said in a statement released by SpaceX.
