"As crude as it is to declare a company the 'winner' of E3, it's hard to see Sony's presentation today as anything but a PR coup ... ," Kyle Orland, senior gaming editor at CNN content partner Ars Technica, wrote Monday. After rolling out a list of new games, Jack Tretton, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, essentially went down a laundry list of complaints about the new Xbox, which had been showcased earlier Monday, and promised the opposite. A big point of contention among gamers is that Microsoft's new Xbox will require an online check-in every 24 hours (less than the "always-on" mode gamers expected) and will only allow games to be resold at selected retailers. Playing to what's already comfortable for gamers was clearly part of Sony's strategy, Newman said. "Sony is just betting that the good will of gamers will be enough to cut Microsoft's ambitions short," he wrote.
