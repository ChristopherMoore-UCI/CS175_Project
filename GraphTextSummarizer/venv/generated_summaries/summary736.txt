The woman was examined at a hospital and released, according to police Superintendent Vinod Kumar Dhawan. The woman was unable to provide significant details about the men or the truck they were driving, making it difficult for police to make an arrest, Dhawan said. -- An American woman who authorities say was gang-raped by three men after visiting a popular Hindu temple in northern India was resting in her hotel Wednesday under the protection of a police officer while investigators searched for her attackers. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi confirmed diplomatic officials had been in touch with local authorities about the case, but declined to talk further about it. Authorities had arrested three men in the case, but the woman said they were not the men who attacked her, according to police.
