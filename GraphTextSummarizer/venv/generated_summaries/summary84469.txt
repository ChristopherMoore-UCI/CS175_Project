While admitting some disappointment, Daisy Chan with the Civil Human Rights Front was still upbeat, saying the march had achieved its main goal: to remind the Hong Kong government that the reform proposal currently on the table for the 2017 election doesn't go far enough. As Hong Kong works through the process of how its top leader will be elected in 2017, the government has asked for feedback during a two-month period of public consultations. "This rally is to let people know the umbrella movement is not over," Wong said, referencing the iconic symbol chosen by the demonstrators when they occupied the streets of Hong Kong for two-and-a-half months late last year. Since its handover from the United Kingdom in 1997, Hong Kong has been governed as a Special Administrative Region of China under the concept of "one country, two systems. But Hong Kong's leaders, including Chief Executive CY Leung, have made it clear that there are limits: reform must be within the framework outlined by Beijing.
