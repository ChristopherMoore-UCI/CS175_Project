The baby boy, who doctors said was aged between one and two days, was discovered soaked in blood at a garbage dump in India's financial capital of Mumbai on Tuesday, they said. A newborn Indian baby found abandoned with 26 stab wounds has survived, doctors said on Wednesday, despite a cracked skull and exposed intestines. Babies are sometimes abandoned by unwed Indian mothers, who fear severe social repercussions for having a child out of wedlock. "When he was brought in he looked pale from blood loss," said Ramesh Hatti, a doctor at a city hospital. His intestines were hanging out from a deep wound on his back and he had dirt and garbage stuck on him.
