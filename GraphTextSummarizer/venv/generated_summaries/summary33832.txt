(Since then, violence has escalated as other war criminals received death sentences, and Jamaat supporters launched counterprotests.) When one of the top officials in the opposition Jamaat-e-Islami party, Abdul Quader Mollah, was sentenced to life in prison for war crimes on February 5, protesters demanded a death sentence. "Within 30 seconds, everyone sat down and started chanting slogans." Of course, scenes of large protests have become more common in recent years, with varying results. "There's an unfinished job of trying the war criminals," said Ahmed, who was in Dhaka on business when the demonstrations started in February. Three Molotov cocktails were tossed from a five-story building, allegedly by supporters of Jamaat.
