A narrator in one of the videos says the bodies are of Syrian soldiers who were killed by Islamic State fighters. At least three videos posted on YouTube by different people show the grisly scene at a roundabout in the city of Reqqa, where Islamic State militants have been carrying out public executions, crucifixions and other acts decided by its Sharia, or Islamic law, court. The videos surfaced online along with news that Islamic State took over the Syrian army's 17th Division headquarters, which was considered the Syrian regime's last remaining military base in Reqqa. While fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza has gotten far more attention in recent days, the death toll in Syria has been higher. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has tabulated casualties in the country's civil war, reported on Islamic State's seizure of the military base in late May.
