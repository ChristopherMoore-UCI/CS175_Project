"I think it's clear that a Justice Kagan would be a much more formidable match for Justice Scalia than Justice Breyer has been," Tribe concluded. Both left Harvard last year to take jobs in the Obama Justice Department -- Kagan as solicitor general and Tribe as a special adviser. Tribe, who was an influential professor at Harvard Law School, made clear the purpose of his letter -- written on Harvard stationary -- was to promote the candidacy of Elena Kagan, who had been Tribe's boss as dean at the law school. Whelan suggested in his blog that Tribe may have promoted Kagan's candidacy out of loyalty over a 2004 incident when she was his boss at Harvard Law School. "Reservations I expressed about Justice Sotomayor prior to her appointment were amply refuted by the closer study I was later able to give her record and that have been fully negated by her performance as a justice," Tribe said.
