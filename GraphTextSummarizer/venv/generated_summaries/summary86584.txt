When a judge denied her motions to transfer the case to state court, Bond pleaded guilty and immediately appealed. The government says federal law broadly prohibits a person from knowingly using a chemical weapon in a way that can "cause death, temporary incapacitation, or permanent harm" to another person -- exactly what Bond did here. Surveillance cameras were set up and sure enough, Bond was videotaped stealing mail and placing chemicals inside the mailbox and car muffler, court records show. "The Constitution does not prohibit federal prosecution in an area of overlapping federal and state authority," the Justice Department said in its brief to the high court, rejecting Bond's assertion the treaty makes an exception for chemicals used for "peaceful" purposes that are not "warlike" in nature. Bond's excitement turned to rage when she learned that her husband, Clifford Bond, was the child's father.
