Interpol Secretary-General Ronald K. Noble said investigators have established "clear" links through passport records, video surveillance, DNA analysis, witness interviews and hotel, credit card, phone and transport records, according to the news release. Dubai's police chief told CNN last month that he is "100 percent sure" Mossad was responsible. "The Mossad needs to be ashamed of its actions," said Lt. Gen. Dahi Khalfan Tamim. Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a founding member of Hamas' military wing, was found dead January 20 in his Dubai hotel room. The organization will now help investigators in Dubai try to track down all 27 people suspected of links to the death of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel.
