We could see some uprooted trees or other damage from the winds, and there's a chance of some surface water flooding from the rainfall -- all of which could lead to some disruption," said Martin Young, chief forecaster at the Met Office, the UK's national weather service. "While this is a major storm for the UK, we don't currently expect winds to be as strong as those seen in the 'Great Storm' of 1987 or the 'Burns Day storm' of 1990," Young said. Strong winds blew and heavy rains fell late Sunday. The Met Office advised people to take precautions and consider staying off the roads until the worst of the winds has passed. The unidentified teenager disappeared from Newhaven, East Sussex, on the southern coast, according to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.
