In response to the Obama administration's initiative, CTA spokesman Mike Myslinski said, "We agree, as long as multiple measures are used beyond just test scores, and the right remains for using test scores to be negotiated locally to meet local student needs." United Teachers Los Angeles, a union that represents 45,000 public school teachers and health and human services professionals, has been engaged in a legal battle with the Los Angeles Unified School district involving the use of standardized test scores in contract negotiations. "The plan incorporates data on student outcomes to identify areas of student need and to improve instruction, but test scores are not used for punitive measures," he said in a statement. Several California unions have objected to the Obama administration's $4.3-billion Race To the Top program, which offers federal grants to help states improve failing schools but requires that teacher evaluations factor in student test scores. "The Conference of Mayors unanimously supports student growth over time as a measurement in teachers," said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who presides over the conference as president. The Los Angeles Unified School District has been reviewing a system of teacher and administrator evaluations that, for the first time, includes student test scores, said spokeswoman Ellen Morgan.
