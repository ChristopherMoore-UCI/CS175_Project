Soccer in the West African country has suffered a series of misfortunes in recent years. A helicopter carrying 22 Togolese soccer officials, including Sports Minister Richard Attipoe, crashed in Sierra Leone in 2007. Gunmen attacked a bus carrying Togo's national soccer team to a tournament in Angola in 2010, killing the team coach and the director of communications. Among the victims were Christophe Dagbovi, the club's secretary-general, Isidore Kouma, the deputy coach, and Charles Balogou, a former national team goalkeeper. The team was headed to Sokode, where it was scheduled to play Sunday, when a tire reportedly burst, causing the bus to flip and catch fire, said Aime Ekpe, the spokesman.
