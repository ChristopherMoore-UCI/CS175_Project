The Dream Foundation contacted Grammy award-winning songwriter Diane Warren and got permission for Helena to record a song in Diane's studio. I was absolutely mesmerized and instantly attached to their unique mission of granting wishes to adults with terminal illnesses. -- I first heard of Dream Foundation in 1997 when the charity requested a visit to Graceland for a dream recipient. I've been honored to travel and represent the organization across the country at special events and corporate meetings, as well as in public service announcements, television and print interviews. Dreams provide comfort and closure, not only to the recipients, but to their family members as well.
