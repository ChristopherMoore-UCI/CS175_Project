"We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires which makes more fires with the wind being so strong." Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. the fire department responded to 140 calls for wires down before the evening outbreak. Detroit firefighters received assistance from fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods. "We had winds from 30-50 mph and have a number of downed power wires," said Detroit Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. "A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires," said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. "We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires."
