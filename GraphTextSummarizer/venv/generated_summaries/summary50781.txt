On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called several Republicans trying to persuade them to support a bill that would reverse a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors. The cuts in Medicare payments -- part of a scheduled cost-saving formula -- went into effect July 1, although the Bush administration said it will hold off on processing claims until mid-July to give Congress time to reach a compromise. Senate Republicans joined the White House in objecting to the Democratic-back bill because it paid for the increased payments to doctors by trimming government support for private insurance programs that provide coverage to Medicare patients. The American Medical Association, a powerful doctor's group, said its members may be forced to reduce service to Medicare patients if the cuts go into effect. Doctors say they would take on fewer Medicare patients if the cuts go into effect.
