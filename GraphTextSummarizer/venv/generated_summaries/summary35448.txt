-- A video showing seven Estonians pleading for help in gaining their release -- a month after they were abducted while bicycling in Lebanon -- makes it clear their kidnappers "want to keep contact," Estonia's foreign minister said Wednesday. In the video, which was sent as a YouTube link in an e-mail to the Estonian foreign ministry, one of the abductees reads in English from a statement calling on Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Saad Hariri, and the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and France to do anything in their power to get them back home. Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Paet was in Abu Dhabi Wednesday for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the European Union and Gulf Co-Operation Council, during which he secured pledges of cooperation from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in finding the seven. Paet told CNN that the men were abducted by "local criminals" in the Bekaa Valley on March 23 as they bicycled into northeastern Lebanon from Syria. However, authorities say, they are unable to determine the Estonians' whereabouts because the people who abducted them operate in cells, meaning members of one group have no information about -- or direct contact with -- members of another.
