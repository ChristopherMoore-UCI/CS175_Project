Tijs Tummers, secretary of FIFpro's technical committee, said players have had enough of games being blighted by incorrect decisions over goals. Other issues under review include whether players who concede penalties through professional fouls should also be sent off, and whether players should continue to be allowed to feint their run-ups when taking penalties. -- Football players are pushing for the sport's world governing body FIFA to bring in technology to decide whether the ball has crossed the goalline. The row between extra referees and technology is on the agenda for the IFAB meeting, with any changes to be implemented next season, after the World Cup. "The ultimate aim of football is scoring goals, and there's no greater injustice than when you have scored and it's not allowed because they say it did not cross the line," Tummers told CNN.
