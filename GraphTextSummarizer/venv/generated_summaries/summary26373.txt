At the time of al Megrahi's release, Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, son of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, told Libyan channel Al Mutawassit that "in all commercial contracts for oil and gas with Britain, (al Megrahi) was always on the negotiating table," adding that then-British Prime Minister Tony Blair raised al Megrahi's case each time he visited Libya. -- Relief expressed Sunday at the death of Pan Am 103 bomber Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi by relatives of some of his 270 victims was tempered by still-smoldering anger at his release from prison more than two years ago. CNN's Nic Robertson tracks down Lockerbie bomber Blair said that while Libya brought up al Megrahi, no deals were ever made when he was in power to arrange for his release. He felt the United States didn't do enough to keep al Megrahi behind bars. The full truth about the bombing may have died with al Megrahi, who never provided details.
