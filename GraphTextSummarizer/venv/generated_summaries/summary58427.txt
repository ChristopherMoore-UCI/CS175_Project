While thinking about our own infection control processes and planning for imported cases, we need to remember that the sure-fire way to prevent domestic EVD cases is by pitching into the global effort in West Africa. Public concerns about the infection haven't been allayed by public health officials, despite many of us stressing that we are well-prepared for detecting and responding to imported cases. Understandably, countries around the world -- particularly those affected (Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Spain and the United States of America) -- have been examining their defenses against importing cases. Here the notion of "public health emergencies of international concern" was introduced, as was the need for countries to establish a minimum core of public health capacities. In response to the IHR and the clear need for multi-agency and ministry planning to be in place, most countries developed pandemic plans.
