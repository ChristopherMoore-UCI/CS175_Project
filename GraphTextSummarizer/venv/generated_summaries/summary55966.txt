"Firing an assault rifle at the White House to make a political statement is terrorism, plain and simple," U.S. Attorney Ron Machen said in a statement that also made reference to this week's Washington Navy Yard shooting. According to the FBI, Ortega-Hernandez's friends reported that he made anti-government statements beginning in 2010. An Idaho man who fired an assault rifle at the White House and struck the residential wing in 2011 pleaded guilty on Wednesday to terrorism and weapons charges. " He bought the assault rifle from a private seller the previous March for $550, and later bought more than 1,200 rounds of ammunition and a scope, federal authorities said. He admitted that the attack was an act of terrorism.
