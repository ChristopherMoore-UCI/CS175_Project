South Sudan erupted into violence December 15 when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup. "It is essential that security and stability return to South Sudan immediately so that displaced people can return to their homes, fields, herds and fishing grounds," said Sue Lautze, the U.N. agency's representative in South Sudan. " South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation. Since then, militia members loyal to Machar have battled government forces. The accident happened Saturday on the White Nile River near Malakal in the northeast of the country, said Col. Philip Aguer of the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
