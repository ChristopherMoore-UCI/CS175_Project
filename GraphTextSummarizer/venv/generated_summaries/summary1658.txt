-- Goals from Manucho and Flavio gave hosts Angola a welcome boost as they moved top of Africa Cup of Nations Group A with a 2-0 victory over Malawi on Thursday. Angola, who played under the gaze of president Eduardo Jose dos Santos, began the game brightly and almost took the lead in the opening minutes when Manucho volleyed Flavio's cross only for Malawi keeper Swadick Sanudi to smother the ball. However, Algeria -- known as the Desert Foxes -- dominated the remainder of the half and went close moments later when Karim Ziani's swerving, dipping cross almost caught out Soumaila Diakite in the Mali goal as it struck the top of the crossbar. The Eagles had the early pressure and Mustapha Yatabare's second-minute free-kick caused problems in the Algerian defence but Mahamadou Diarra was unable to find a teammate with his pull-back after beating Algeria keeper Faouzi Chaouchi to the loose ball. The tournament, which has continued despite the withdrawal of Togo after a deadly machine-gun attack, continued with Algeria clashing with Mali.
