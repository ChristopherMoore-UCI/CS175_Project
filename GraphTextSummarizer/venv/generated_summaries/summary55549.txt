" While Canada-born Greg Rusedski reached the heights of world No. 4 after gaining British citizenship in 1995, Raonic said he would remain loyal to his adopted country, having moved to North America from Montenegro at the age of three. "I met him and then went on a nine-match winning streak, so it was a very inspirational moment," Raonic told CNN Open Court's Candy Reid of his breakthrough victory and subsequent final appearance in Memphis. "He's got all the serves that anyone else that I've ever seen does," Fish said after losing to Raonic in the Memphis semis. These are impressive numbers at such a young age, but they pale in comparison to the statistics of the man who has had a massive influence on Raonic's burgeoning career. His father is a nuclear engineer and his uncle was a high-ranking politician in Montenegro, but Milos Raonic is forging an entirely different career path with his own kind of power.
