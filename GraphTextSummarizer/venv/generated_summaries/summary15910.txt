Holly Bobo was on her way to school when her brother saw her being led from their Darden, Tennessee, home into the woods by a man wearing camouflage, said John Mehr, special agent in charge for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Decatur County Mayor Michael Smith told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday that new evidence had been found in the search for Bobo, who was taking nursing classes at a Tennessee Technology Center campus in Parsons. Search teams were combing for evidence in parts of Decatur and Henderson counties, including in Natchez State Park. Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- have turned out in recent days to hunt for clues, while many more have attended memorial services or offered supportive thoughts online via several groups on Facebook. -- Investigators and community members in Tennessee continued their hunt Sunday for a 20-year-old nursing student, offering a fresh appeal for tips on the man they believe forcibly took her from her home last week.
