Monday's deal between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Disney's Marvel Studios allows them to share Spider-Man, meaning that the web-slinging superhero could also appear in movies with, say, Captain America or Iron Man. We understand that risk-averse Hollywood loves superhero movies, which earn big profits in overseas markets, jump-start lucrative franchises and sell lots of related merchandise. "We're <10 years away from a Spider-Man movie that reboots itself during the movie," tweeted New York Times culture reporter Dave Itzkoff. Some people are clamoring for new movies based on an alternate version of Spider-Man by Marvel Comics that replaces Peter Parker -- the hero from the original 1962 comic -- with Miles Morales, a teenager who is half Latino, half African-American. So, Sony and Marvel have joined forces to take the Spider-Man movie franchise in "a new creative direction," with the next installment planned to hit theaters in July 2017.
