That's because CNN has learned signals from commercial aircraft to Inmarsat satellites always include a code confirming the identity of the plane. Among other services, Inmarsat provides satellite communications for the ACARS, the acronym for Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System. Accident investigators, with the help of satellite experts, have used that information to determine the possible location of the plane. Malaysian officials, citing "satellite information" but giving scant details, this weekend refocused the search for the missing Boeing 777, moving attention to massive arcs on both sides of the equator. But when a plane is in remote regions, or over water and out of range of VHF radio, the signal is seamlessly switched to satellite.
