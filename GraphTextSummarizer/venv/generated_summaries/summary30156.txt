"Our initial motive behind the post was to affirm our stand against sexual harassment and gender discrimination and to remind passengers to dress appropriately in public places in order to avoid unnecessary trouble," subway official Chen Kuang told Xinhua. A Shanghai metro official has unleashed a wave of angry social media messages in response to a post earlier this week that scantily-clad women invite sexual harassment. One user who called himself "A man like me" said that that type of dress "naturally attracts sexual offenders, just like flies like rubbish." Despite the level of public outcry, the metro company has not yet deleted the original post. The pictures, published on China Daily, showed a woman holding up a sign that translated to "I can be slutty, but you can't harass me," while riding on Shanghai Metro Line No. 2. The Shanghai metro company said its intention was never to condemn women, but to educate them.
