In hindsight, it's hard to remember a time when De Niro, who turns 70 on Saturday, wasn't Robert De Niro, with his movie star image -- brusque, intense, Italian, New Yorky -- front and center. He famously plowed himself into the Method, gaining and losing weight for "Raging Bull," driving a cab for "Taxi Driver" and learning saxophone for "New York, New York." (In real life, De Niro -- despite his name -- is a mix of ethnicities, including German, Dutch and Irish, though he identifies most closely with his Italian heritage.) -- Robert De Niro has always liked to keep a bit of himself hidden from view. But, more recently, he has been Robert De Niro, the image taking the lead.
