"Russia's intelligence services are conducting a range of activities to collect economic information and technology from U.S. targets," it said. "We judge that the governments of China and Russia will remain aggressive and capable collectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, particularly in cyberspace," it said. But the report also warns that changing economic and political developments around the world could lead other nations to steal U.S. economic secrets.

Bryant said U.S. companies and the U.S. government produce approximately $400 billion of research and development each year.
