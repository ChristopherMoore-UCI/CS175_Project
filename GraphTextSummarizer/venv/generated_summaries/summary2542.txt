Watch Iraqis celebrate the transition Â» Seventy-three percent of Americans questioned in the poll favor the withdrawal of U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns, with 26 percent opposed. A national poll suggests that nearly three-quarters of all Americans support the plan to withdraw most U.S. combat troops from Iraqi cities and towns, even though most respondents said they think the troop movements will lead to an increase in violence in that country. The poll indicates that 52 percent think the level of violence in Iraqi cities will increase after U.S. troops withdraw, with 32 percent saying things will remain the same and 15 percent saying the level of violence will decrease. Since January, Americans have handed over or shut down more than 150 bases across the country, leaving U.S. troops in a little more than 300 locations that gradually will be handed over to Iraqi control. If violence does increase, the poll suggests Americans are clear about how to respond: "Nearly two-thirds say that the U.S. should not send combat troops back into Iraqi population centers, even if there is a significant increase in the number of violent attacks," Holland said.
