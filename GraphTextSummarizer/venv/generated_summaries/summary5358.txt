Whitey Bulger fast facts His former bookmaker, Richard O'Brien, was on the witness stand describing a meeting between Bulger and a man who owed him money. Among highlights from the first two weeks of testimony: -- In three days on the witness stand, former Bulger associate and hitman John Martorano casually detailed killing after killing, confirming to prosecutors that together he and Bulger were involved in 11 slayings, two of which put Bulger on the firing end of a gun in a killing. Jurors also will hear from former FBI Supervisor John Morris, who gained immunity after agreeing to testify about cash he accepted from Bulger in exchange for protecting the mobster from the law. Martorano testified that he thought Bulger's FBI confidant, John Connolly, was just doing a favor to Bulger's well-respected politician brother by looking out for "Whitey" and the gang. On Monday, the prosecution intends to introduce Bulger's full informant file, a 700-page document detailing his relationship with the FBI over 15 years.
