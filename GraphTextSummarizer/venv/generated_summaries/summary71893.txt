Making calls across the Northeast has been difficult following Sandy, and New York and New Jersey seem to be the hardest hit. Getting cell phone reception in waterlogged New York and New Jersey could get a bit easier. Sprint said it was experiencing "service impacts," but that it could not provide a specific number for the amount of people without service. AT&T was the most vague, only saying that it was monitoring its land line and wireless networks and working to restore service. The carrier said its networks were mostly doing well, but there were serious problems in lower Manhattan and general problems throughout New York City.
