'If you were to close the employment gap between Japanese men, which is 80%, one of the highest in the OECD, with Japanese women -- which is still around 60% -- we estimate that you'd add about 8.2 million workers into the Japanese workforce," says Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs, who has long championed the cause. According to Goldman Sachs, some 70% of Japanese women choose to leave the workforce after they've had children. A 2011 study by the Center for Work-Life Policy called "Off-Ramps and On-Ramps Japan: Keeping Talented Women on the Road to Success" found that three quarters of Japanese women want to rejoin the workforce after they've had children, but only 43% manage to get their careers back on track. That influx of female workers "could lift the asset level of Japanese GDP by as much as 14%," she adds. Despite equal employment opportunities enshrined into law in 1986, real equality within most domestic Japanese companies remains within the realm of fantasy-land.
