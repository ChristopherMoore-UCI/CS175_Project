Driven by the same desire, Slovenian frequent flier Bostjan Zagar has come up with the answer -- a foot-powered scooter-suitcase known as Olaf. 'Hardcore engineering' Zagar, who describes himself as a "hardcore engineering guy," says he grew up preferring scooters to skateboards because he liked being able to control the speed. Disappointed with available luggage solutions to this problem, Zagar used his background as an automotive engineer and his time waiting for flights to sketch up an alternative. With the final hours ticking down, Ljubljana-based Olaf's Kickstarter campaign has raised well in excess of its $27,000 target. "The idea comes from having to catch the next connection flight in three minutes when the gate is on the other side of the world and you need to move faster than those moving walkways," Zagar tells CNN.
