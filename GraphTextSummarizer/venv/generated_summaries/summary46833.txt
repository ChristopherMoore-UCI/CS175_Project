State broadcaster PTV reported that Hakimullah Mehsud, the Taliban commander in Pakistan, was wounded in a drone attack this month, and that he died and was buried last week. A Taliban source denied the report to CNN, saying that Mehsud has simply gone "underground" after being targeted by drone attacks. Mehsud has been the target of suspected U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN on Sunday that officials have received reports of the Taliban leader's death, but also could not immediately verify it. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN that "we cannot yet confirm" Mehsud's death.
