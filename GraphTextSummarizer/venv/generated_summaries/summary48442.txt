"Architecture covers a wide span across the history of mankind -- from the basic housing of the mud hut to the complex system of a medieval cathedral, all the way to a modern day skyscraper," said 36-year-old Feireiss, who lectures on architecture and culture at design colleges across Europe. It was this question which prompted editors Lukas Feireiss and Robert Klanten to compile their book "Closer to God: Religious Architecture and Sacred Spaces," which examines spectacular contemporary buildings from across the globe. "Architecture's usual criteria of purpose, access, capacity, construction, and financial viability are simply not enough -- in religious buildings the question of meaning, image and symbol are also integral to the task. "Religious buildings always have to bridge the gap of being literally a 'concrete' implementation of a highly abstract idea." "The whole building was organized to watch over the lives of the young males being educated there," explained architect Andres Jaque.
