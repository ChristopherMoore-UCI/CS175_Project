When Pate returned to the UAE in February, he was was arrested for "cyber slander against the UAE and his employers," U.S. Rep. David Jolly, R-Florida, said in a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry. Harf confirmed Pate was arrested on February 16 and was released on bail on February 24. A Florida man arrested in the United Arab Emirates for comments he posted on Facebook said he's sorry for his remarks. Pate, who is a helicopter mechanic for Global Aerospace Logistics, an aerospace company based in Abu Dhabi, was on vacation in Florida when he was notified by the company that there would be "steps taken against (him) due to a medical condition."
