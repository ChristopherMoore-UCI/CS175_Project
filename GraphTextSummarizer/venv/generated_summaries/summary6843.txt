" Nadal has suffered from several injury problems in recent years, notably when a knee problem meant he could not defend his Wimbledon title in 2008. Defending champion Rafael Nadal has been passed fit to take on American Mardy Fish in the Wimbledon men's singles quarterfinals on Wednesday. Nadal's message is in stark contrast to his mood after defeating del Potro in a hard-fought four-hour marathon played in blistering conditions. Top seed Nadal was a doubt to face Fish after being troubled with an injury to his left foot during Monday's last 16 win over Juan Martin del Potro. The Spaniard told reporters he came close to retiring hurt during the first set and shook his head repeatedly during a 10-minute injury break while his foot received treatment from the trainer.
