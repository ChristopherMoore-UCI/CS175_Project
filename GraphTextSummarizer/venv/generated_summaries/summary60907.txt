" Graetzel discovered how perovskite works and he's helping develop new solar cells as well as potential ways to add on to existing ones: "You can put perovskite on top of traditional silicon cells to make them more efficient," he says. "In a very short time, perovskite has begun to produce extremely high efficiencies and there's 'perovskite fever' going on," says Michael Graetzel, Director of the Laboratory of Photonics and Interfaces at EPFL. Perovskite solar cells may be the ones to watch, but the search for the most efficient, affordable and usable form of solar energy is a diverse battlefield. This is the amount of solar energy that gets converted into electricity and the higher this is, the more we meet our energy needs. Recently, a new material known as perovskite has seen the light of day and within just a few years it has started rivaling the efficiency of traditional photovoltaic solar cells, which currently maxes out at roughly 20 percent.
