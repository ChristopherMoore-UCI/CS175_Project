-- A prominent Egyptian blogger freed by an Egyptian judge on Sunday lambasted the military government and said "nothing has changed" since President Hosni Mubarak was ousted from power in February. Mohamed Hussein Tantawi is field marshal of the supreme council, Egypt's military rulers in the wake of former President Hosni Mubarak's ouster in popular protests at the beginning of the year. The 29-year-old blogger, who was outspoken for years against Mubarak's regime, was imprisoned October 30 amid battles between the military and pro-democracy protesters struggling to pave a clear path for their ongoing revolution. His detention, along with 27 men charged in the same case, sparked international and local support, as many activists had identified with his work for years. His sister Mona Seif, featured in a CNN documentary called "iRevolution: Online Warriors Of The Arab Spring," is a prominent activist and founding member of a group lobbying against trying civilians under military tribunals.
