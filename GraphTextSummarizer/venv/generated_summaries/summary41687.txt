Former supermodel Janice Dickinson accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, telling "Entertainment Tonight" in an interview aired on Tuesday that the comedian raped her. "The only story she gave 12 years ago to the media and in her autobiography was that she refused to sleep with Mr. Cosby and he blew her off. In the interview, Dickinson claims Cosby assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe. Cosby attorney Martin Singer called Dickinson's story "a lie" and said it contradicts her own autobiography and a 2002 interview she did with the New York Observer. Dickinson is the latest of a handful of women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault -- allegations the comedian has repeatedly said are untrue.
