"Right now, our biggest concern is the children," said Fadli Usman, World Vision Indonesia's rapid assessment team leader. The Mount Merapi volcano in Indonesia erupted at least three times Tuesday, forcing thousands of nearby residents to flee. Because it was still dark, it was hard to tell how the eruptions compared with previous ones, Awui said. Christian Awui, a rescuer at the scene, told CNN that the first thing that residents heard were sirens from an early warning system announcing the coming eruptions. Some nongovernmental relief agencies were poised to offer immediate help.
