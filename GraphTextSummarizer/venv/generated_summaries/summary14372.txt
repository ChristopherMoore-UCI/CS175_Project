City Center Mall booked "Freestyle Football" artist Iya Traore, from Guinea, to help draw more crowds in Doha You can nary drive a kilometer in Doha -- few Qataris actually walk the streets -- without passing a shopping mall. Little surprise then, that shopping mall developers and management have taken to providing more entertainment options to pull in the crowds: The obligatory movie theater, for example. And few of those malls are lacking hordes of people strolling from store to store. As long as the mall remains an outlet to spend petro-dollars -- and Doha's main, all-access social networking scene -- mall developers will have to step up their game to keep consumers happy. From the pricey jewel-adorned head scarf fashions to budget-conscious it-could-be-rat-leather shoes, food courts to suit Eastern and Western tastes, to perfume shops selling essences for more per ounce than many people earn in a month -- shoppers in Doha are spoiled for choice.
