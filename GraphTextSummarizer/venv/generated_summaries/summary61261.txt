The editor of a monthly magazine, Tissainayagam was arrested in March 2008 for printing articles critical of the Sri Lankan military's treatment of civilians during the country's war on the Tamil Tiger rebel group. After his arrest, the Tamil journalist was held without charge for several months, prompting outrage from human rights and press freedom organizations. A second group, Reporters Without Borders, said it too will honor Tissainayagam with a newly-created award for journalists who display great courage in countries where press freedom is lacking. A high court in the western Sri Lankan city of Colombo handed down the sentence to J.S. Tissainayagam on Monday, convicting him under the country's anti-terror laws. Sri Lanka has denied the accusations, and routinely rejects calls by human rights groups for independent investigations into its campaign against the Tigers.
