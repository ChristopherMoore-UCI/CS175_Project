Meanwhile, Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine did not agree to the Geneva Statement, and in defiance of the international deal, have dug in their heels. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe said in a statement it planned to send its deputy chief monitor to eastern Ukraine to help implement an international pact reached among Russia, Ukraine and its Western allies in Geneva earlier this week. Officials in Poland and Estonia have both expressed concern over recent Russian military movements and actions in and around Ukraine. The U.S. has accused Russia of fomenting instability in Ukraine and has imposed sanctions on some Russian officials. Pushilin has called for a referendum by May 11 on the separation of eastern Ukraine from the country as a whole.
