"The club has written to UEFA due to a series of incidents on the pitch in the understanding that objectively speaking it was evident that the referee did not apply the rules of the game," Barca spokesman Toni Freixa told a news conference Thursday. But the visitor continued to threaten and the post once again denied Cisse much to the frustration of manager Alan Pardew. The 23-year-old has enjoyed an outstanding season, scoring 22 goals in 38 appearances for a Tottenham side chasing a place in next season's Champions League. Swiss champion Basel, which knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League in 2011, grabbed a 30th minute lead when Valentin Stocker fired home from close range after Marco Streller's effort had hit the post. The Swede's 79th minute effort, which made the score 1-1, was fiercely contested by the Barcelona players.
