She continued, "Thad Allen has provided excellent leadership as the national commander of our massive response to the largest environmental disaster in our nation's history, and he will continue to leverage his decades of experience in civilian duty as the national incident commander for this spill." Adm. Robert Papp was sworn in as Coast Guard commandant on May 24, when Allen left the Coast Guard's top post as previously planned, to serve solely as national incident commander on the Gulf spill. That had several major consequences: Oil skimming ships had to return to shore, containment booms were thrown asunder and efforts to burn oil on the surface and break it down through dispersants were put on hold, along with efforts to position a third ship to collect oil at the spill site. Wednesday, it was affecting containment and collection efforts on multiple fronts, Coast Guard officials said. The Coast Guard briefing came on a day of change for the service branch, as Adm. Thad Allen, who has been overseeing the cleanup effort for the government, officially retired from the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard official said the seas also have disrupted containment booms, meant to limit the amount of oil reaching shore.
