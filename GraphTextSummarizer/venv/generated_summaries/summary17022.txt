Previous lawsuits by a variety of civil liberty and human rights groups naming Ashcroft and other top Bush officials -- including Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and FBI Director Robert Mueller -- have almost unanimously been tossed out by federal courts on immunity grounds. Al-Kidd later sued corrections officials; that suit was settled out of court. Material witness laws allow officials to detain those who may have knowledge of crimes committed by others to ensure they would testify in criminal proceedings, including before a grand jury and at trial. Chief Justice John Roberts said allowing such a lawsuit to proceed would impose a "heavy burden" on government officials and police as they do their jobs, for fear "if they guess wrong, it comes out of their pocket." But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg called al-Kidd's experience "obvious mistreatment" that perhaps should leave someone accountable. Al-Kidd was a college football player at the University of Idaho when he converted to Islam, changing his name from Lavoni Kidd.
