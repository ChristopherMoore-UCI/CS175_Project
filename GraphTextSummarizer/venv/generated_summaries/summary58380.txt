Bin Laden spiritual adviser Abu Ghaith testified that he never joined the ranks of al Qaeda and assisted bin Laden only as a speaker on spiritual topics. The jury watched videos produced after the meeting with the al Qaeda leader, of Abu Ghaith making passionate calls for further attacks on Americans, flanked by bin Laden on one side and an AK-47 rifle on the other. "This outcome ensures that Sulaiman Abu (Ghaith), a senior member of al Qaeda and an associate of Usama bin Laden, will never again set foot outside a prison cell." Known in the Persian Gulf region as a religious scholar and fiery orator, Abu Ghaith met the al Qaeda leader in Afghanistan in June 2001, according to testimony. Just after the attacks, the al Qaeda leader summoned Abu Ghaith to his remote mountain hiding place and asked him to help "deliver a message to the world" on the organization's behalf, the religious scholar testified.
