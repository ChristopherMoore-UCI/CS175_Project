Hayes also wants Americans to understand that each type of weather condition deserves a specific type of preparedness. To prepare for tornadoes, for example, it's critical that families identify a "safe room" in their house to go to when they hear a tornado siren or learn that a tornado warning is in effect, Hayes said. In the end, emergency managers, first responders, government officials, businesses and the public need to be equipped with better weather information and a plan to make fast, smart decisions to save lives and livelihoods, Hayes said. "You've got to be proactive in preparing for extreme weather," she said.
