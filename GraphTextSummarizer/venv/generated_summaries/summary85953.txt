Probably drawing on Persian myths, Matthew and Luke came up with Christmas stories that have almost nothing in common. In Luke we get a kinder and gentler Christmas, with no wise men, no mean Herod, no flight to Egypt. In fact, Christmas is as much a secular event as a spiritual one, a civil holiday that accounts for over 19% of yearly retail sales; that translated to $3 trillion in sales last year. The rhythms of the so-called Church Year are heavily dependent on Christmas, with the 25th of December as a peak of sorts -- a moment of hope that comes at the darkest time of the year, not incidentally related to winter solstice, a calendar moment when the day is shortest, the night longest, at least in the Northern Hemisphere. Indeed, this child was "laid in a manger," one of many similarities with the Christmas story.
