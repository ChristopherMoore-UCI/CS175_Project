Last October, a Ukrainian court found Tymoshenko guilty of abuse of authority for signing overpriced gas contracts with Russia and sentenced her to the seven-year prison term. But EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said Tymoshenko's claim had been confirmed by the Ukrainian Ombudsperson's Office. Tymoshenko was "subjected to physical violence during the transfer from her cell to a hospital on 20 April," read a statement released Thursday by Ashton's office Ashton called on Ukraine "to examine promptly and impartially any complaints of torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment," according to the statement. -- A judge on Saturday postponed the tax evasion court hearing of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who is serving a seven-year prison sentence following last year's conviction of abuse of authority. Amnesty International has slammed the verdict as "politically motivated" and called for the release of Tymoshenko, who was prime minister from January to September 2005 and December 2007 to March 2010.
