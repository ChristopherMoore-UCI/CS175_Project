Rescuers said their efforts were hampered by strong currents and cold water, Xinhua said. The boat , which had 25 people aboard, was "testing water" in the Hubei channel, China's Xinhua state news agency said. Xinhua reported that the owner of the boat had not followed procedure for the water-testing operation and had not filed a route. At least 21 people died and one more is missing after a survey tugboat sank on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, state media reported Saturday. One of the rescued passengers, identified as translator Wang Chenkai, told Xinhua that he tried to hold onto one of the Japanese engineers but the current broke his grip.
