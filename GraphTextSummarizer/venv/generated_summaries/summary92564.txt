The NATO flight training course at the Spanish base has 750 participants, including pilots, ground crews and other support, from nine countries: the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Denmark and Greece, the Spanish air force reported on its website last week. It was expected to be a four-week program, from January 19 to February 13, with training to prepare pilots for tactical missions, including nighttime missions, the site said. Nine were French military personnel, and two were Greek pilots, a senior Spanish defense official told CNN. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he was "deeply saddened" by the crash. The jet crashed on takeoff, hitting other planes on the ground during a NATO training exercise, said the source, who by custom was not named.
