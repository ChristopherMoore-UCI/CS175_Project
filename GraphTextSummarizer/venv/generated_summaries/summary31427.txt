Jolie announced in a New York Times op-ed published Tuesday that she had undergone double mastectomy surgery after learning she has an elevated risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer. -- CNN "Early Start" co-anchor Zoraida Sambolin has been diagnosed with breast cancer and will have a double mastectomy, she told viewers Tuesday while discussing film star Angelina Jolie's decision to have the surgery as a preventative measure. "I struggled for weeks trying to figure out how tell you that I had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was leaving to have surgery," Sambolin said in a posting to her Facebook page Tuesday. She said she is opting for surgery similar to Jolie's. During her "Early Start" appearance, Sambolin said the decision to opt for a mastectomy was a difficult one, but was made easier by reading Jolie's perspective.
