-- Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday called on South Sudan to punish those responsible for shooting down a U.N. helicopter and taking the lives of four Russian crew members. His words come a day after the South Sudanese armed forces admitted to shooting down the helicopter in eastern South Sudan. The Sudan People's Liberation Army said it was an accident, according to spokesman Philip Aguer. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan said Friday four Russian crew members were killed but that there were no passengers on board the aircraft. The troops thought the aircraft looked to be the type that had dropped munitions to militias in the area, Aguer said.
