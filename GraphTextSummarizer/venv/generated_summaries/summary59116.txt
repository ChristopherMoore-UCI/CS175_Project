-- Kay and Mike Alexander's journey to obesity is a familiar road for many married couples. The Alexanders' strategy is a powerful one, says Rachel Berman, director of nutrition for Caloriecount.com, a site Kay Alexander used to calculate calorie totals for her new recipes. In addition to counting calories, Kay Alexander exercised more. "I put on about five to 10 pounds per year for 20 years," Kay Alexander says. They reinvented many of their favorite dishes, such as mashed potatoes, substituting cauliflower for the potatoes.
