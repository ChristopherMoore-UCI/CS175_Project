The judge said he was confident that some individuals who are anti-abortion would still be able to make an impartial decision, but suggested the issue be examined on a juror-by-juror basis if the court recognizes a pattern of exclusion during jury selection. Wilbert said that would require further argument -- particularly an offering from defense attorneys regarding the evidence they plan to present in support of that premise at trial. Rudy also asked that the judge prohibit prosecutors from excluding potential jurors because they have anti-abortion beliefs. "I will leave the door open on the issues surrounding use of force in defense of another," the judge said, adding he does not mean it's "wide open." Scott Roeder, 51, is set to stand trial January 11 on one count of first-degree murder in the death of Dr. George Tiller, who was shot to death at his church May 31.
