Note, though, that there's no way to draw data from online streaming and cyberlocker download sources — which means that total piracy numbers are probably significantly higher than these. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (estimated downloads: 8,400,000) 2. Now You See Me (estimated downloads: 7,000,000) 9. High grossers like "Man of Steel" and "Gravity" are absent as well, though "Gangster Squad," with its modest worldwide gross of $105,200,903, somehow eked out the number 7 spot. "An Unexpected Journey" was followed closely by "Django Unchained," which has an estimated download count of 8.1 million — just 300,000 fewer than "The Hobbit," even though "The Hobbit's" worldwide box office take was more than twice what Django made.
