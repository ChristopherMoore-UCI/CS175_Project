Last weekend's Bob Hope Classic winner, Venezuelan rookie Jhonattan Vegas, was one of 13 players on 69 along with Woods, U.S. Ryder Cup player Hunter Mahan and Colombian Camilo Villegas. That left him on 14 major wins, the run halted by first injury and then the damaging revelations of marital infidelities which led to a self-imposed exile from tournament golf. He was five shots behind leader Sunghoon Kang after the South Korean rookie claimed a one-stroke first-round advantage from Americans Rickie Fowler and Alex Prugh. Woods was paired with Rocco Mediate, who he beat in the famous playoff to win the 2008 U.S. Open despite being hampered by leg injuries. Starting on the 10th in perfect playing conditions, Woods picked up birdies on the 12th, second and sixth.
