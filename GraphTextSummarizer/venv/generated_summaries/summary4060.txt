Now safely ensconced in Manila's "Hobbit House" - a dwarf-themed blues bar in Manila's scruffy Ermita district - he is part of a group of dwarves who plan to build their own community for about 30 of the city's "little people" - the preferred term for people with dwarfism. The founder of the Hobbit House, 71-year-old Jim Turner, says dwarves in the Philippines suffer the same amount of prejudice as little people anywhere else in the world. A former Peace Corp volunteer who came to Manila in the 60s, Turner later worked in Filipino television in the 1970s when dwarves and transvestites were a staple fare of the film industry. Far from exploiting the dwarves, Turner maintains the bar gives hope and employment to people who sometimes hail from the worst slums in Manila. It has since become so popular that he opened up a second Hobbit House in the beach resort of Boracay and the venues now attract a steady stream of little people looking for work.
