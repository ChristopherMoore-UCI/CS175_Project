NBC's "The Voice" -- "Idol's" closest competitor -- has gained ground with judges Cee Lo Green, Adam Levine, Christina Aguilera, and Blake Shelton. -- "American Idol" lost two stars this week when judges Steven Tyler and Jennifer Lopez announced they would not be returning next season, but the hit Fox show could gain itself The Queen. Fox's "The X Factor" recently added pop star Britney Spears after booting former "Idol" judge Paula Abdul and Nicole Scherzinger of the Pussycat Dolls. The addition of Franklin could help Fox stop the ratings slide of "Idol," which saw it lose its spot as the top show of the year to NBC's "Sunday Night Football." And as the Queen of Soul would do, she's already thinking about bringing along a sidekick: songstress Patti LaBelle.
