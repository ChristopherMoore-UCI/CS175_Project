-- Iranian authorities confiscated the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize given to human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, Norway said Thursday. Ebadi received the prize for her focus on human rights, especially on the struggle to improve the status of women and children. A statement from the Nobel committee at the time said, "As a lawyer, judge, lecturer, writer and activist, she has spoken out clearly and strongly in her country, Iran, and far beyond its borders." Such an act leaves us feeling shock and disbelief," Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store said in a written statement. Store said in the statement that it marked the "first time a Nobel Peace Prize has been confiscated by national authorities."
