Freezing eggs for one's own future use has become a growing trend, with an estimated 5,000 women nationwide making use of the technology, according to Dr. Daniel Shapiro, medical director of the egg bank at Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta. -- When Dr. Rachel Wellner got a text from her brother Tuesday night that his wife was in labor, she was speaking at a fancy charity event for breast cancer research. If freezing at 39 or 40, it's 20 to 25%, and if freezing eggs over age 40, the success rate will be less than 10%. A test for levels of anti-Mullerian hormone can help predict whether doctors will get enough eggs to make the procedure worthwhile. That's why the American Society for Reproductive Medicine hasn't endorsed egg freezing, calling it experimental and unproven.
