Two other groups -- the Syrian Network for Human Rights, based in London, and the Damascus Center for Human Rights Studies in Syria -- issued a report saying the Syrian military shelled Inkhel for three hours and then raided homes, carrying out "extrajudicial executions" against three people "while four others were slaughtered with knives" and snipers killed two more people. U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford said Wednesday that members of the Syrian military face international criminal prosecution if they continue to support the regime's "barbaric actions" against the Syrian people. It carried three repaired Syrian helicopters that will still be sent to Syria, the reports said. -- A Syrian military pilot flew to Jordan and was granted asylum Thursday, a day after the United States warned members of the Syrian military they could face international criminal prosecution for attacks on civilians. The defection came as the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported at least 128 people, including at least 15 children, killed across the country Thursday.
