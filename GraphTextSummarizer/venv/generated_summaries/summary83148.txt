I am not a "Let's join the traveling soccer team and spend hours every week on the road" mom. I am not a "playdates every weekend" mom, a "spectator at every event" mom or a "spontaneous family trip" mom." Armed with endless ideas and step-by-step instructions, I could create wonderful memories with Elyse despite rarely leaving home. I might not be able to run Elyse around doing fun activities and having experiences outside the home, but I can create fun and memories inside the home. Because of this, my older daughter, 6-year-old Elyse, spends a lot more time at home than many of her peers.
