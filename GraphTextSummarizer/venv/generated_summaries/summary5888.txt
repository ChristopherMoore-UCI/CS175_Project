Watch how the safety record at Murray's mines stacks up Â» An effort to send rescuers through the collapsed mine tunnel to attempt an underground rescue was suspended last week, after a new cave-in killed three rescuers and injured six others. Rescuers trying to find six miners will begin boring a sixth hole down into Utah's Crandall Canyon mine Friday, and the search will stop if no signs of life are found, the coal mine's co-owner said. Cameras lowered into previous holes drilled into the mountain turned up no signs of the miners, and tests showed that oxygen levels in parts of the mine were too low to sustain human life. "This is the last hole," Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy, said Wednesday evening. Bob Murray, CEO of Murray Energy Corp., says he is hurt by criticism he did not do enough to find the miners.
