But Trenka, who repatriated to South Korea in 2008, is part of a vanguard of American adoptees who have led the fight to stop overseas adoptions from Korea and change the cultural stigma tied to unwed mothers. As recently as 2005, South Korea was the fourth largest provider of children to U.S. families, sending more than 1,600 orphans that year, according to the U.S. State Department. Under the law, birth mothers must nurse babies for seven days before the child can be considered for adoption. If you force birth mothers to register for adoption, they're just going to abandon their children. South Korea was a pioneer on international adoptions.
