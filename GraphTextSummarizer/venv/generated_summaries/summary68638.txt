The state of Florida is advertising for crocodile response agents to handle complaints from residents and, in the relatively rare event it is necessary, to capture and move crocs. It is unlawful to kill crocodiles in Florida. "(The crocodile) is moving back into places where they have not been seen in decades," said Lindsey Hord, crocodile response coordinator for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. " After 32 years of this type of work, Hord has fond feelings and memories for certain crocodiles. "It is the agency's hope that people will co-exist with crocodiles," said Hord.
