Xherdan Shaqiri put Bayern in front in the 33rd minute at the Mage-Solar Stadium, but paid the price for failing to add to their advantage when Freiburg substitute Nicolas Hofler leveled with four minutes remaining. -- Bayern Munich dropped their first Bundesliga points of the season under new manager Pep Guardiola Tuesday -- frustrated by a late SC Freiburg equalizer in a 1-1 draw. Muller and Shaqiri both had chances to double the advantage but Freiburg were rewarded for their endeavor when Sebastian Freis crossed for Hoefler to beat Manuel Neuer from close range. Meanwhile, Bayern's Bundesliga rivals Schalke 04 secured their passage to this season's Champions League group stages with a thrilling 3-2 win in Greece over PAOK Thessaloniki. An unbeaten Bundesliga run of 29 games, dating back to last season was also extended, but there was a worrying development for Guardiola when captain for the night, midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger, limped off with an ankle injury near the end.
