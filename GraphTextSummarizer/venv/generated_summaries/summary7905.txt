" 2009: Folk singer Richie Havens remembers Woodstock Max Yasgur provided Woodstock's venue by leasing out his 600-acre dairy farm near the hamlet of White Lake in the Catskill Mountain community of Bethel, New York, 100 miles north of Manhattan. A lot of sex was going on at Woodstock and, according to Spitz, a lot of women forgot to pack their birth control so supplies of birth control pills were flown in. Spitz called Woodstock "the beginning of the end of the '60s" because it, along with the moon landing, represented a bright period after the deaths of John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Robert Kennedy, and before the breakup of the Beatles and the deaths of Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison. New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller declared a state of emergency in White Lake. "Woodstock was where Bob Dylan lived," said Spitz, "It's where The Band hung out and he just liked the whole feel of the word.
