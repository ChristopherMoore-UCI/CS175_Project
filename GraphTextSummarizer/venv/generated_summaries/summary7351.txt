Spain is plagued by forest fires every summer, when dry weather sets in along with high temperatures. On Thursday, a 44-year-old firefighter died while driving a fire truck to fight a forest fire in eastern Teruel province, the regional Aragon government said on its Web site. He was the sixth firefighter this week to die from forest fires raging around Spain. Spanish media reported that a fire in the town of Mojacar, in southern Almeria province, forced the Thursday night evacuation of 3,000 people. On Thursday, more than 800 Spanish troops were also fighting numerous forest fires across Spain, the Environment Ministry said.
