According to these sources, the president has made calls to top donors, and conference calls are planned this week to supporters and key Democratic groups. Obama's team has been asking campaign bundlers to raise $350,000 each, no easy task since campaign finance laws limit gifts to $2,500 per donor. But these days, the likely Republican presidential contenders are making endless visits to key early voting states and meeting with supporters across the country. Former deputy press secretary Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney, former aide to then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, have been approached by Democratic donors who are concerned about countering the influence of Karl Rove and the Koch brothers in the upcoming 2012 election. Biden is already planning to be in New Hampshire on Monday and will meet with key supporters in that crucial early voting state.
