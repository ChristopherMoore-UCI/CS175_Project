Derrick Estell and Tamara Upshaw, the woman alleged to have driven a getaway vehicle, may try to go Dallas County -- a place Estell has visited before, according to Garland County Sheriff's Department Deputy Scott Hinojosa. At the beginning of the conversation, Glenda Estell says "it's all good," then asks if his shackles are off and questions "is there two or three in there?" Previous phone conversations between mother and son that "all have random mentions of the plan for Derrick to escape custody, just at various intervals between normal conversations," the arrest affidavit states. Upshaw had been staying with Glenda Estell and was with her the day of Derrick's escape, according to the affidavit laying out probable cause for Glenda Estell's arrest. Tips on Estell's whereabouts have run into dead ends and law officers in Dallas County were working to see if he were in that community. The same document details a July 28 phone call between Glenda and Derrick Estell, while the latter was in the detention center's booking room, just before the escape.
