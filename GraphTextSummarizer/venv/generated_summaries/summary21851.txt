The Agra blast occurred a day after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned the nation's senior police officers about India's vulnerability. The blast blew out window panes and damaged the hospital's waiting room, where the three injured people were, said P.K. Tiwari, the inspector general of police in Agra. A bomb exploded Saturday at a private hospital in the tourist city of Agra, India, injuring three people. India's Home Ministry said it had dispatched commandos to Agra and was in the process of collecting evidence from the scene. The bomb went off at Jai Hospital's reception area, said Brij Lal, spokesman for Uttar Pradesh police.
