As in other LEGO video games, two people in the same room can drop in and out as separate characters and solve all the puzzles. Once each level is completed in story mode, free play mode is unlocked, allowing you to use any of the characters you have available to solve puzzles that couldn't be previously figured out. This review was done playing on the Xbox 360 in story mode, co-op mode and free play. Even on ship levels, players will need to go up into the rigging or down into the ship's belly to find all they need to find. Players can use up to eight different characters on each level during story mode, but that can lead to a crowded screen.
