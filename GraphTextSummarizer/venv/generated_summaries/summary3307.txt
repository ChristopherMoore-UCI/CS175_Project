"With your winning, you made bleeding Syria cheer," said United Arab Emirates singer Ahlam, a judge on the show. The show's judges didn't hesitate to place their fingers in Syria's wounds. "God willing your winning will be a remedy to the injuries of Syrians," said Lebanese singer Nancy Ajram, another judge. In the latest finale, the winner -- Hazem Shareef of Syria -- broke with the trend and refused to carry his country's flag in his victory celebration. Though Shareef ditched the national colors, he did dedicate his "victory song" to Syria.
