And last week, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has signed a decree banning foreign same-sex couples from adopting Russian children. Russia has faced criticism for its policies involving homosexuality leading up to the Olympics in Sochi. In June, its parliament passed a law that makes it illegal to tell children about gay equality. The move also bans singles from countries where same-sex marriages are legal from adopting Russian children. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Russia, unlike some other countries, does not criminalize homosexual relationships.
