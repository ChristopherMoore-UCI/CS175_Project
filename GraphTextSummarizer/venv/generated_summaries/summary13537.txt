At the federal level, the President will also sign a presidential memorandum directing his agencies to allow federal employees to have access to at least six weeks of paid leave when a new child arrives or to care for ill family members, and propose that Congress offer six weeks of paid administrative leave as well, said Jarrett. President Barack Obama will renew his push for paid sick days and paid family leave for the millions of American workers who don't have either during a visit to Baltimore on Thursday, according to Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to the President. The push for paid sick days and paid leave stems, in part, from last year's first-ever White House Summit on Working Families, said Jarrett. In his 2015 budget, the President will propose $2.2 billion to reimburse up to five states for three years for their costs associated with implementing a paid leave policy, $35 million in grants to states and $1 million through the Labor Department for feasibility studies around providing paid leave programs, Jarrett told CNN. Jarrett, who used an unconventional outlet to outline Obama's expected announcements -- in a blog for LinkedIn -- said the President will call on Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act, which would allow millions of Americans to earn up to seven days per year of paid sick time.
