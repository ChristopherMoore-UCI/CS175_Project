-- Juventus took an important step towards retaining the Serie A title with a battling 1-1 draw at the Stadio San Paolo of nearest rivals Napoli Friday. However, Napoli did level just before the break as Gokhan Inler's fierce shot deflected past Gianluigi Buffon. Juve might have added to their advantage while Napoli's leading scorer Edinson Cavani continued his lean spell -- failing to net in his last seven matches. Nobody was injured in acts described on Italy's Sky TV by Juve general director Guiseppe Marotta as "deplorable and with little to do with sport." Negotiating the testing away fixture with honors even left Juve six points clear of Napoli at the top with just 11 games remaining.
