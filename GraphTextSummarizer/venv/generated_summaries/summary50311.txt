Rumors started after a picture of a track list featuring collaborations with Rihanna, Justin Timberlake and Nicki Minaj circulated online, but while that may not exactly be credible, it is clear Queen B is planning something. According to a product page on Amazon UK, "Beyonce Vol. 2," a four-disc import, will be released on November 24. Whether the November surprise is a new album or an updated reissue of "Beyonce" remains to be seen. Chatter heated up over the weekend that Beyonce will be dropping another secret album, and Amazon just gave fans even more reason to be hopeful. In December, the superstar shocked and delighted fans with a straight-to-iTunes album that quickly went to the top of the charts.
