James headlines a list of marquee names who also are free-agents-to-be or likely free agents this summer, including Miami's Dwyane Wade, Toronto's Chris Bosh, Phoenix's Amare Stoudamire, Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki and Atlanta's Joe Johnson. Full transcript of Lebron James interview Even President Obama has weighed in, telling TNT's Marv Albert last month that James would fit in with the club that Obama pulls for, the Chicago Bulls. Sports Illustrated's website has a "LeBron James Watch" blog, ESPN.com has a "LeBron Tracker" page devoted to his next move, and the Cleveland Plain Dealer's site has a "LeBron-O-Meter" that swings with each stay-or-go rumor. King asked James about reports that he, Wade, Bosh, Johnson and others were planning to talk to each other before they settled on where to go. And the New York Daily News reported last month that Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he thinks James would love living in New York, should he choose the Knicks or the Nets.
