" South African sign language interpreter Francois Deysel tweeted: "Please can someone ask the interpreter to step down from stage, it is embarrassing and making a mockery of our profession. " The man showed no facial expressions, which are key in South African sign language, and his hand signals were meaningless, Druchen said. "This proves that he is not involved in the deaf community and doesn't know South African Sign Language," it said. "To the best of our knowledge, he has not undergone any formal training in South African Sign Language or Interpreting offered by any recognized institution which offers these training courses." " DeafSA said the man also did not use the established, recognized signs for Mandela, South African President Jacob Zuma or his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, among others.
