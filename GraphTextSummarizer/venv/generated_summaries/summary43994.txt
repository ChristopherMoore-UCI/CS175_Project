The French government said last year that it would pay for the removal of PIP implants for women in France. He was arrested in January of last year in connection with an investigation after the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. -- The founder of a French company that made controversial breast implants has gone on trial, accused of fraud and causing involuntary injury. Proceedings against Jean Claude Mas, who founded Poly Implant Prothese, or PIP, and four others connected to the company continued Thursday, a day after the trial opened in Marseille. A British Department of Health study published last June found that the PIP implants do not cause cancer and aren't toxic, but that they do have a high rupture rate.
