And Patricia Arquette, the best supporting actress winner for "Boyhood," has made a career of combining intriguing film choices with steady TV work. He's young -- just 33 -- and could just as easily aim for big-budget movie stardom as chewy character roles. J.K. Simmons, who won best supporting actor for "Whiplash," has been a character mainstay for years; he might start getting bigger billing, but the work should remain steady. A few more films like "Jupiter Ascending," the current Wachowski siblings' bomb that features Redmayne in a major role, and he may be the answer to Oscar trivia questions in 2025. If there is such a thing as an "Oscar curse" -- that malady that suddenly grips some Oscar winners, plunging their once-bright careers into "Aeon Flux"-like darkness -- best actor winner Redmayne could be a likely victim.
