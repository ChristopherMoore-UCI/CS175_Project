Jeremy Bryant, 37, who describes himself as a die-hard Seattle Mariners fan and "the one starting the wave," is the clubhouse chef for the Mariners. Bryant's beloved deep fryer struck out, though he admits he occasionally trafficks a corn dog from the stadium for player who wishes to remain anonymous. When word spread that the first item blacklisted by the nutritionist was dark-meat chicken, Bryant's cell phone rang. In an effort to bring the cuisine of Japan to the home field, Bryant served Japanese chicken wings to the player on one of his first days. "No way, I couldn't believe my heroes were eating food like this," recalled Bryant, a graduate of the Culinary Arts Program at South Seattle Community College.
