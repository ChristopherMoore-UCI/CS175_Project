-- Czech authorities announced Saturday that they have arrested a 29-year-old man who expressed admiration for Anders Behring Breivik, the self-declared ultranationalist who has admitted killing 77 people in Norway last summer. Ostrava police chief Radovan Vojta told reporters Saturday that authorities exercised "increased caution" when they went into the suspect's apartment, fearful it might have been rigged with explosives. Video broadcast on Saturday by CT24, a public broadcast station in the Czech Republic, showed the handcuffed suspect flanked by police. The Czech News Agency added, citing police, that the suspect indicated in e-mails that he was an admirer of Breivik. The Czech suspect was arrested August 10, according to the Czech News Agency, though authorities didn't announce it until Saturday.
