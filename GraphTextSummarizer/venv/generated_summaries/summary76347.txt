The Vulcan statement added that the team is "mindful of the responsibility related to the wreckage of the Musashi as a war grave and intend to work with the Japanese government to ensure the site is treated respectfully and in accordance with Japanese traditions." Navy dive bombers also hit the ship 16 times, but it was the torpedo hits that doomed the Musashi. According to U.S. Navy documents, torpedo planes from U.S. aircraft carriers scored at least 10 hits on the battleship over the course of four hours. The director of Japan's Kure Maritime Museum told CNN after viewing the information posted by Allen that it appeared that the vessel was the Musashi, although further pictures were needed to know for sure. The other underwater photograph shows one of the Musashi's valves on which the Japanese characters for "main valve handle" and "open" are legible.
