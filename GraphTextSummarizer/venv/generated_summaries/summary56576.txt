Woods, 33, struck a fire hydrant and a tree with his 2009 Cadillac SUV in his luxury neighborhood near Windermere, Florida, early Friday, police said. -- A shoeless Tiger Woods snored on their lawn while the golfer's wife stood silently by in the minutes after his SUV crashed into a tree, neighbors told Florida investigators. Adams said he never smelled alcohol on Woods' breath. Woods appeared to have a cut lip, but he wasn't bleeding much, Adams told the troopers. " It was a cool morning, so Adams and Harris covered Woods with a blanket and put pillows under his head, Adams said.
