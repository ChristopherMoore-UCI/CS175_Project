That should have led the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) -- the police force in Northern Ireland at the time -- to pursue further investigation that could have either implicated or cleared the priest, the report said. "Throughout the Troubles (the 30-year period of violence in Northern Ireland), the Catholic Church, along with other churches in Northern Ireland, was constant in its condemnation of the evil of violence," they said. Tuesday's report was issued by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, an independent body that investigates complaints against the police. A government official wrote to the RUC in December 1972 to say the secretary of state for Northern Ireland met with Cardinal William Conway to express "disgust" at the priest's behavior, and that the cardinal said he knew the priest was a "very bad man." He said 1972 was one of the worst years of violence in Northern Ireland and the arrest of a priest could have aggravated the security situation.
