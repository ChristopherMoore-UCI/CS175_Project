But police said Wilson shot Brown after the teen attacked him and tried to take his gun. That it could potentially serve as exculpatory evidence -- or at the very least, used by Wilson's supporters to back the officer's account of what transpired on Canfield Drive on August 9 -- immediately drew suspicion and anger from leading activists who portended an ominous reaction from Brown supporters. Forensic tests have found the blood of Michael Brown on the gun, uniform and police cruiser belonging to Officer Darren Wilson, who fatally shot the unarmed teen two months ago in Ferguson, Missouri, The New York Times reported. Wilson told investigators he was trying to leave his car when Brown shoved him back in, the Times reported Friday night. Wilson is white; Brown was black.
