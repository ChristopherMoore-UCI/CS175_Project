Chardy, who has upset a number of leading players in his career, British hope and No.2 seed Andy Murray included, was simply outclassed on Centre Court. -- Novak Djokovic gave a perfect illustration of why he's the top ranked player in the world as he dismantled France's Jeremy Chardy to reach the Wimbledon fourth round Saturday. Williams, bidding for her 17th grand slam title in her Wimbledon defense, was only briefly troubled by her veteran opponent before racing to a 6-2 6-0 win under the Centre Court roof late Saturday. The never say die fourth seed had to come from two sets to one down before clinching the decider 6-2. In the women's singles, top seed Serena Williams was an equally emphatic winner against 42-year-old Kimiko Date-Krumm of Japan.
