" "Judge Judy" is the highest-rated regular series in all of TV syndication, regularly outdrawing such iconic shows as Wheel of Fortune and top-rated talkers like Ellen and Dr. Phil. Other than the extension through 2020, there were no details announced about the contract for Sheindlin, 72, who has been starring on Judge Judy since September 1996. This past season, Queen Bee and CBS launched "Hot Bench," a show that quickly has become one of the highest-rated new hits on daytime television, averaging 2.3 million viewers a day (when multiple airings are combined). "Judge Judy" is produced by Big Ticket Pictures, a division of CBS, and is distributed by CBS Television Distribution. The new contract includes a first-look production deal with Queen Bee Productions, which is owned by Judy Sheindlin.
