The Libyan government has denied rebel allegations that Moammar Gadhafi loyalists have been raping women, despite videos captured on cell phones that appear to show sexual abuse. Rebel fighters said they have found videos of rape on cell phones confiscated from captured or killed Libyan soldiers. The Gadhafi regime had initially not responded to CNN requests for comment on the abuse allegations but Libyan Prime Minister Al-Baghdadi Ali al-Mahmudi said Friday at a news conference that women are "our sisters" and Libyan soldiers would not commit such heinous acts. An opposition spokesman, however, said the video illustrated a pattern of abuse by Libyan soldiers. Al-Mahmudi said there was no proof that Libyan soldiers were behind the abuse.
