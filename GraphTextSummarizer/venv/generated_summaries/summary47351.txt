The twin-engine Cessna 421 remained afloat with its tail sticking out of the water for some time before it sank Thursday afternoon, said Petty Officer Elizabeth Bordelon, a Coast Guard spokeswoman. The plane went down about about 120 miles west of Tampa, Florida, at 12:08 p.m. after circling the eastern Gulf for more than two hours, said Chief Petty Officer John Edwards, a Coast Guard spokesman. A Coast Guard plane from the Tampa area and the cutter Coho were still taking part in the search Thursday evening, and the Coho was expected to remain at the scene overnight, Bordelon said. The Coast Guard plane and two F-15s from the North American Aerospace Defense Command were still watching the Cessna before it went down, the Air Force and Coast Guard reported. The crew of a Coast Guard search-and-rescue plane watched as the Cessna made what appeared to be a soft landing, Edwards said.
