Tapping in for par on the last, Woods was winning his 79th PGA Tour title and 18th WGC crown. The Swede made a testing two-putt on the final green to also close with a 70 and finish in a share of the runners-up spot with reigning champion Keegan Bradley on eight-under. Woods, who finished on 15-under 265, will be paired with Bradley and Davis Love II for the first two rounds of the PGA Championship on Thursday and Friday. The World No.1 was never threatened with playing partner Henrik Stenson concentrating on his battle for second place. Woods, whose last victory at a major came in the 2008 U.S. Open, has flattered to deceive in this season's three to date, with indifferent play on the weekend wrecking his chances.
