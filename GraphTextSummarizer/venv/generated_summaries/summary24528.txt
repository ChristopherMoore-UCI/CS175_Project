-- Call it a political "fumble." Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who's fighting for his political survival against independent candidate Greg Orman, got a highly coveted endorsement last week from Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder, who appeared in a 30-second ad for Roberts. The Capital-Journal also reported that Kansas State President Kirk Schulz said Roberts' campaign refused to grant the university's request to have the ad taken down. "I made a mistake," he said at a press conference Saturday after Kansas State's football game against Oklahoma State. "He is as good as it gets for the state of Kansas," Snyder said in the spot. Video for the ad was shot on Kansas State's campus, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal.
