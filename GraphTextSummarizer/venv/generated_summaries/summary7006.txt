The virus is still limited to the two nations, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, despite rumors of it spreading to other countries. It spreads in the blood and shuts down the immune system, causing high fever, headache and muscle pain, often accompanied by bleeding. It's the first emergence of Ebola in western Africa, which means doctors and health officials in the region don't have any experience with the virus. In a statement on its website, WHO said Guinea has reported a total of 208 clinical cases of Ebola, including 136 deaths. The aid organization Doctors Without Borders has called the outbreak unprecedented because previous cases have been limited to a small area.
