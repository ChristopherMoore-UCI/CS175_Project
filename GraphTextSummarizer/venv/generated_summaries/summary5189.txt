Here's how it works, CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said Saturday: Strong high pressure develops over Eastern Europe and China and strengthens northeasterly winds from the South China Sea, bringing heavier rainfall over Malaysia, Indonesia and southern Thailand. The flooding has forced more than 132,000 people to evacuate, Malaysia's official Bernama news agency said. While the region is accustomed to monsoons, the "northeast monsoon" that has gripped Malaysia, Indonesia and southern Thailand is particularly harsh. Strong currents and interrupted power supply are adding to the chaos, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak told reporters. "Clean water supply too cannot be delivered, and flood victims at the temporary relief centers had to endure darkness without electric supply," he said, according to Bernama.
