McCarthy plays Mullins' repugnance at her partner's inhuman professionalism with a cringing spontaneity, as when she puts up her hand for a high five, and Ashburn has to go and wreck it by slapping and then clasping that hand. With her naughty-angel features, and her italicized gumption that's so stylized it turns sarcasm into a blunt-witted form of sincerity, McCarthy plays Shannon Mullins, a proudly slobby lethal weapon of a Boston police detective who favors fingerless leather gloves, keeps an arsenal of firearms (including a rocket launcher) in her refrigerator, and doles out cut-to-the-quick insults the way that most of us say ''Hello!'' As he proved in "Bridesmaids" (2011), the one other major film he's directed, Feig understands how women who don't like each other express their antipathy â€” in ways both more direct and less direct than what men do. Movies: 10 All-Time Greatest Mullins gets paired with her opposite number: Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock), an uptight, by-the-book FBI agent in ugly off-the-rack pants suits. There's a very funny scene in which Ashburn and Mullins, who have teamed up to nab a drug lord, go undercover at a dance club, where Mullins tries to transform Ashburn's ''bank teller'' outfit into something halfway clubby.
