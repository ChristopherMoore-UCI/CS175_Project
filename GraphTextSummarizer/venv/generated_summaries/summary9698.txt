In an audio statement released after the siege, Zubayr noted the attack took place "just 10 days after the anniversary date of the blessed 911 operations" and called it an "epic battle" launched to punish Kenya for the 2011 invasion that drove Al-Shabaab out of much of southern Somalia. And from his hideout somewhere in southern Somalia, Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, the emir of Al-Shabaab, planned the most devastating terror attack in Kenya since the U.S. Embassy bombing in 1998. Zubayr is 36 years old, according to most accounts, and originally from Somaliland, now a vaguely autonomous part of northern Somalia. Zubayr's reliance on force in an organization that has long worked as a loose collective has made him a legion of enemies inside Somalia, and even led to criticism on some jihadist forums sympathetic to al Qaeda. Zubayr's vision has been to transform Al-Shabaab from an insurgent outfit focused on Somalia into a terrorist group capable of devastating attacks beyond its borders.
