Sledge was picked up after he was spotted in Dillon, South Carolina, driving a stolen car, arrested and brought back to North Carolina, where he was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the Davises. Josephine Davis and her daughter Aileen Davis were discovered in September 1976 inside their home in Elizabethtown, North Carolina. During the more than three decades Sledge was in prison, he maintained his innocence, filing numerous post-conviction motions on various grounds.

Sledge, who was wrongly incarcerated for 37 years, addressed the Davis family directly, saying, "I'm very, very sorry for your loss. A man who spent more than half his life in a North Carolina prison for two murders he didn't commit walked out a free man Friday, holding his belongings in two white plastic bags.
