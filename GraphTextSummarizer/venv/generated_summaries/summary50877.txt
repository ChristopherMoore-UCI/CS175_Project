Islamist extremists tried to enter Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, during a predawn attack after the army fought them off last week. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, as well as bombing government buildings. " Though one has claimed responsibility for Sunday's blast, Boko Haram has carried out a spate of suicide attacks in Potiskum in recent weeks. Boko Haram failed attempts to seize the key Nigerian city of Maiduguri on Sunday, the militants' second attack there in a week. "Fighting has been going on since 3 a.m. as Boko Haram battles soldiers and vigilantes," said Mahmud Kyari, who lives in Maiduguri.
