"This is a totally new kind of process that we hadn't thought about for Mars, and it changes the way we view the evolution of the planet," said lead study author Joseph Michalski of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and the National History Museum in London. The researchers used data from instruments aboard several orbiters: Mars Express, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the Mars Global Surveyor and Mars Odyssey. (But Mars rover operations, including driving and using scientific instruments, are continuing this week, a NASA spokesman said). The volcanic eruptions likely represented the biggest explosions in the history of Mars, Michalski said. Water discovered in Martian soil Why it matters Supervolcanoes were instrumental in shaping geological formations and the climate on our own planet, and the same goes for Mars, Michalski said.
