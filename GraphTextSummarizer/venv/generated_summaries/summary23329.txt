Webber won at the Hungaroring last year from Alonso and Vettel, while Hamilton failed to finish. The Briton trails world champion and current standings leader Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull by 82 points, and is fourth in the drivers' championship, but Hamilton is confident he is back in contention for the title he claimed in 2008. The 26-year-old headed home Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber of Red Bull to secure his second maximum-points haul this season and the 16th of his career. -- McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton believes he is back in the fight for the 2011 Formula One world championship after claiming a much-needed victory at Sunday's German Grand Prix. Hamilton reigns in Germany "We're back in the fight though, and I really hope we can carry this forward and keep the momentum going." Hamilton spent large parts of the Nurburgring race battling at close quarters with both Webber and the Spaniard Alonso, and he felt the intense competition helped him to perform at his best.
