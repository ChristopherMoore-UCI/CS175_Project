Maui police first issued a missing persons alert for Carly "Charli" Joann Scott on Wednesday, two days after her mother reported her missing. While it was burnt, police said that its vehicle identification number was legible and tied it to Scott. The next day, a member of the search party looking for the Hawaii resident found what police only described as "possible evidence." "We are asking anyone who is assisting in the search to call the (police) department if they find any suspicious items, however, please do not touch, move or recover the item as it may be evidence in this case or another case that the department is investigating," the police said. The ex-boyfriend claimed that he'd assisted in searches for Scott, though her family had become "hostile" to him lately. CNN affiliate KGMB/KHNL reported that Scott's ex-boyfriend -- who said he loved her and that the two "occasionally hooked up" -- told them that he'd been with her last Sunday night.
