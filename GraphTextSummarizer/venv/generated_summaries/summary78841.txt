David Cerny attends the 'Entropa' exhibit with Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra. Cerny, and his main collaborators Kristof Kintera and Tomas Pospiszyl apologized to Czech Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek and other government ministers Tuesday, according to a statement on the artist's Web site, for " not having informed them about what is true and for having misled them." With Bulgaria depicted as a Turkish toilet and Romania as a vampire theme-park, the work by Czech artist David Cerny has provoked an angry response from some member states. At the official unveiling of the work at the EU headquarters in Brussels Thursday, Alexandr Vondra, Czech Deputy Prime Minister for EU affairs, said: "Entropa is a provocation of a kind. Poland recreates the WWII flag-raising at Iwo Jima, only with the U.S. Marines and the Stars and Stripes replaced with Catholic clergy brandishing the multi-colored gay pride flag.
