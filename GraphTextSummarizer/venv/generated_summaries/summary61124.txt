Garzon spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court, which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases. The case centers on Garzon's investigation of human rights abuses under Gen. Francisco Franco, the dictator who ruled Spain for four decades, until his death in 1975.

Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America.
