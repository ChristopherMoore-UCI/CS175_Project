What you need to know about mad cow disease In South Korea, one of the world's largest importers of U.S. beef, the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy led retailer LotteMart to remove American beef from store shelves. The first U.S. case of mad cow disease in six years sparked fears of illness that prompted two South Korean retailers to suspend the sale of American beef. The Agriculture Department confirmed the first case of mad cow disease in America on December 23, 2003, in a cow born in Alberta, Canada, in April 1997, only four months before the United States and Canada began banning the use of brain and spinal cord tissue in cattle feed. Consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the Web-based consumer advocacy group Consumeraffairs.com, which advises the avoidance of brains, neck bones and beef cheeks, bone marrow and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone. "If the cow were exposed to the typical strain of BSE via animal feed -- and the government says that's not the case here -- that would have represented a significant failure," she said.
