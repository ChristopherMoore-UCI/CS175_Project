Winston didn't play during the 2012 season but came to Florida State as one of the nation's top quarterback recruits, according to recruiting rankings. Dennis M. Jones, who left the post in October, said when he was the city's top cop that he always knew about cases involving athletes, even if the players weren't charged. -- Heisman Trophy hopeful Jameis Winston and his accuser had consensual sex the night she told police he had sexually assaulted her, the attorney for the Florida State star quarterback said Thursday. The case began in December when the woman, a student at Florida State in Tallahassee, reported she had been sexually assaulted. Tallahassee police have released a heavily redacted incident report documenting a sexual assault allegation in early December 2012.
