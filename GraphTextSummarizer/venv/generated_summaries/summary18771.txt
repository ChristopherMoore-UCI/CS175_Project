" Justice officials opened an investigation into the Zimmerman case last year and will include testimony from the Florida trial. -- Florida authorities have delivered all evidence related to the George Zimmerman investigation to federal officials, who are weighing whether to pursue a civil rights case. Various civil rights groups have protested nationwide to demand the Justice Department bring federal charges against Zimmerman. Justice officials are investigating whether Zimmerman violated Trayvon Martin's civil rights when he shot the African-American teenager. "Independent of the legal determination that will be made, I believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised," Holder said last week.
