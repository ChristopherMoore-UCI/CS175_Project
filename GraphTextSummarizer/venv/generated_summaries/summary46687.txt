With some exceptions, radio contact with air traffic control is always available when a flight begins the landing phase of the trip. It would be understood for pilots and controllers experienced with the route to be aware of such gaps in radar coverage and communication. The code is assigned by air traffic control. The code sometimes changes from airspace to airspace or country to country, but it has to be re-assigned by air traffic control and not by the discretion of a pilot, unless an emergency is declared. But another system on board could have saved the day, or at least more accurately pinpointed the position for air traffic control.
