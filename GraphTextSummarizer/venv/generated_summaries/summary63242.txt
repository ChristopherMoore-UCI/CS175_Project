The curfew had already been lifted in more than 30 provinces and districts, including Thailand's tourist hotspots such as Phuket, Pattaya, Krabi and Koh Samui. The Thai military instated the curfew when it seized power after months of unrest that had destabilized the elected government and caused outbursts of deadly violence in Bangkok. The nighttime curfew imposed in Thailand after last month's military coup has been lifted, Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha said during his weekly address Friday. The curfew posed a problem for Thailand's soccer fans who wanted to watch the World Cup games with friends -- many of the matches start between 11 p.m. and 3 a.m. local time. But not Bangkok.
