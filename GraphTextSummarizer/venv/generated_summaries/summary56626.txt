-- Burglars broke into a Southern California home that appears to be that of pop music star Miley Cyrus, police said Saturday. The burglary was reported around 4:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET) Friday at a residence in Studio City, according to Los Angeles police Officer Rosario Herrera. It threatened to put a damper on a big weekend for Cyrus, who celebrated her 21st birthday on Saturday. But they did provide an address of a residence that is known to journalists as belonging to Cyrus. Authorities found no evidence of a forced entry, nor were any suspects seen at the property, Herrera said.
