-- Chelsea Handler, the foul-mouthed, alcohol-swilling, cutting, irreverent and occasionally naked host of E!'s hit talk show "Chelsea Lately," is taking her act and moving it to Netflix.

Chelsea Handler to host Netflix talk show The last episode of "Chelsea Lately" will air on Tuesday night. On other talk shows, the former "Friends" star is like most other celebrities: sticking to the script (or the blue cards) and answering only what was discussed backstage with some assistant producer. No word on whether he'll be joining her at Netflix -- TMZ says he isn't -- but in the meantime, fans will have to be satisfied with his recommendations on serving tacos, using Tinder and healthy living.
