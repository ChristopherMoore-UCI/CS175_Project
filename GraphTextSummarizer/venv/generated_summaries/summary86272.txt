Underwear is a big hitter on the traditional holiday gift list and now soccer stars are muscling into the market. David Beckham's pants hit high streets in close to 40 countries when the former LA Galaxy and Manchester United maestro teamed up with Swedish fashion store H&M in 2012. "Christmas comes round once a year but footballers are in the shop window continually," Steve Martin, the global CEO for brand agency M&C Saatchi Sport and Entertainment, told CNN. " The aesthetic allure of Ronaldo, Rodriguez and Beckham is an undeniable factor in why their underwear packs a punch. Beckham stopped traffic as an underwear model for Emporio Armani before collaborating with H&M while the perfectly manicured Ronaldo oozes style on and off the pitch.
