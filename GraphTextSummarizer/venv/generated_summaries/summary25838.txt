Prosecutors accused Tazhayakov and his roommate, fellow Kazakh national Dias Kadyrbayev, of trying to protect Tsarnaev three days after the bombings by removing a backpack and a laptop from Tsarnaev's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, which Tazhayakov also attended. Prosecutors: Friends knew suspects' identities before public Prosecutors told jurors Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers -- Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev -- before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev, "i think they got his brother," hours before the public knew their names or their relationship to one another. The jury found Azamat Tazhayakov guilty of obstructing justice and conspiring to obstruct justice, in connection with the removal of a backpack with potential evidence from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings. We will certainly push that the evidence, and my client's intent did not match up with the actions of the case," Tazhayakov attorney Mathew Myers told reporters Monday. The only thing Tazhayakov took from Tsarnaev's room, Myers said, was a pair of headphones that rightfully belonged to him.
