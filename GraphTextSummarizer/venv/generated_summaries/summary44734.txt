Fernandez's popularity has been in decline since her re-election last year, due in part to economic problems. Many demonstrators said a key issue drove them to the streets: the possibility that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner could push through changes to the country's constitution and run for re-election. Some critics have said the voting-age change, a year before a key mid-term election in Argentina, is an attempt by Fernandez's party to garner more votes and increase the odds that lawmakers will change the constitution to allow her re-election bid. -- Throngs of people banged pots and pans Thursday, as they protested government policies in Argentina. Protester Romina Daviani said a variety of reasons, including high crime and inflation in Argentina, had brought them to the streets.
