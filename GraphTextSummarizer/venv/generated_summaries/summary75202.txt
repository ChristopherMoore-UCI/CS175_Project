-- A storm has barreled into the Southeast and sections of the Northeast, coating power lines and roads with ice and leaving thousands without power. Forecasters warned that gusty winds in several states may topple ice laden trees and power lines. "Elevated surfaces such as trees, power lines and highway bridges and overpasses will accumulate ice most easily. Oklahoma City was coated with ice and shivering with a daytime high of 20 degrees, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. They said the outages were caused by trees falling on power lines, and that power should be restored by late afternoon.
