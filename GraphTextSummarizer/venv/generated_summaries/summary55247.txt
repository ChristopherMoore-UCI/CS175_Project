"We are going to make sure that everyone who played a part in the heinous crime that has attacked the peace and dignity of the great state of Tennessee faces a consequence for that," Stowe said Monday night. Bobo's remains were found Sunday in Decatur County, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Monday night. Two men have been charged in connection with Bobo's death: Jason Wayne Autry and Zachary Adams. Bobo's brother has told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading Bobo away from their home in the town of Darden in April 2011. After three years of searching, the remains of Holly Bobo have been found in Tennessee.
