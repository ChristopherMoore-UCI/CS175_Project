Oakland County Sheriff Mike Burchard says, "It is my fondest hope that we can give that closure not only to the Hoffa family but also to the community to stop tearing that scab off with every new lead and bring some conclusion." Hoffa's life came to its mysterious conclusion after decades of truly remarkable accomplishments. More than a dozen times investigators have followed what are invariably described as "credible" leads to a suspected Hoffa burial site. " Hoffa's family has responded to the latest tip and search as they always do, by suggesting they hope it works. And once again, the target is a nondescript field where Hoffa might...just might...be buried. Hoffa still fascinates after 40 years This time the story being told involves Hoffa being beaten with a shovel, and buried alive beneath the concrete slab of a now long-gone barn.
