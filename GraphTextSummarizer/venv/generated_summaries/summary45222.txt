" Afghanistan attack: AFP reporter among 9 dead in Kabul hotel Iraqi journalist shot dead in Baghdad Swedish journalist shot dead in Kabul Suicide bombings are increasing around the country, and earlier this month, Swedish journalist Nils Horner was gunned down in broad daylight on a busy street in the capital. Until a few days ago, this was the workplace of Sardar Ahmad, one of Afghanistan's most prominent journalists, who was a senior reporter for Agence France-Presse. "He'd tell us it wasn't time to leave, that there was still so much work to do to improve Afghanistan," said Esmat Kohsar, who worked in the same office as Ahmad. What's the point of him living?" cries Taraj Ahmad, Sardar's nephew.
