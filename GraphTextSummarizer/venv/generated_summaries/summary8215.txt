-- Even if U.S. and Iranian negotiators manage to meet the November 24 deadline for a nuclear agreement with Iran, America faces a very inconvenient reality in the Middle East: We're stuck in a kind of Middle East Bermuda Triangle where messy outcomes are more likely than neat solutions, and where ambiguity and uncertainty will rule over clarity and stability for years to come. Right now it is a veritable black hole with at least four subconflicts: ISIS vs. America; Bashar al-Assad vs. the so-called moderate Sunni opposition; jihadis vs. jihadis; and sooner rather than later, perhaps, America vs. al-Assad. America will have its hands full in this region for years to come. Even though we killed Osama bin Laden and dismantled al Qaeda's central core, the gravest threat to our security right now isn't ISIS at all but an affiliate of an al Qaeda we were supposedly to have destroyed, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). But it must give up any illusion that it can somehow produce solutions.
