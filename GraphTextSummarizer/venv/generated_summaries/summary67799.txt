"As we gather this information, we reiterate our position that Hamas is a terrorist organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has used kidnapping in the past." Netanyahu: Israeli forces can use 'all measures' to free teens 'We'll hug them soon' Gilad Shaar, 16; Naftali Frenkel, 16; and Eyal Yifrach, 19, have been missing since late Thursday or Friday and were last seen around Gush Etzion, according to the IDF. -- Israeli soldiers have so far detained more than 150 Palestinian suspects in the search for three teenagers who Israel says were kidnapped, the military announced Sunday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Monday with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and told him to "assist in returning the abducted youths and in apprehending the kidnappers," according to Netanyahu's office. "The consequences of the partnership with Hamas must be understood: It is bad for Israel, bad for the Palestinians and bad for the region," Netanyahu said. The thread quickly became contentious, with pro-Palestinian users alleging many Palestinian children have been kidnapped by Israeli soldiers and imprisoned.
