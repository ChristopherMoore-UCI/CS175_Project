"We explored and will continue to explore all available options for funding and/or selling Saab and it was determined a formal reorganization would be the best way to create a truly independent entity that is ready for investment," said Jan Ake Jonsson, managing director for Saab Automobile. -- Swedish car manufacturer Saab, a fully owned subsidiary of General Motors, announced Friday that it will "file for reorganization ... to create a fully independent business entity."

Reorganization will give us the time and means that help get these products to market, while minimizing the liquidity impact of Saab on GM. "Saab has an excellent foundation for strong growth, assuming we can get the funding to complete engineering, tooling and manage launch costs.
