At the Dongjie Village in hardest-hit Zhouqu county, more than 5,000 rescuers and villagers stood still atop mudslide debris with their heads bowed, Xinhua said. Another 490 people are still missing a week after torrential rains triggered the mudslides on July 8, the state-run Xinhua news agency said. Power has been restored to about 76 percent of homes, and wells have been dug to supply more water, Xinhua said.
