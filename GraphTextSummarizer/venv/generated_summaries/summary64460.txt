" "Ms. Barrino flew defendant/husband to places such as Atlanta, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Barbados" where he "attended celebrity parties, concerts, photo shoots and award shows with Ms. Barrino." While Barrino is not directly involved in the current legal case, North Carolina is one of only a few states that allow a spouse to sue a third party who interferes with a marriage for alienation of affection. A North Carolina woman, in a child custody case filing, charged that Barrino carried on a year-long affair with her husband, Antwaun Cook, who is the father of her two young children. "Fantasia is certain that she is not responsible for the deterioration of the Cook's marriage," manager Brian Dickens said in a statement to CNN Monday. "Fantasia will weather this storm with the dignity and grace that she has exemplified throughout a life in which she has repeatedly overcome obstacles and challenges," Barrino's manager said.
