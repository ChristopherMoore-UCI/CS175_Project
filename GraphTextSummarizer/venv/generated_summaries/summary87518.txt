"Depression is a major public health issue," said Dr. Kelly Posner, an assistant professor at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. He added that patients sometimes see ads for antidepressants on television and ask doctors for the drugs -- and that studies show these requests work. The use of antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs -- those that affect brain chemistry -- has skyrocketed over the last decade. and you get a lot of prescriptions for antidepressants," he said.
