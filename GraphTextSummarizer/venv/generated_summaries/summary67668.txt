French health agency spokesman Joelle Perrin said in a televised press conference that the strand of E. Coli was not the same as that found in German bean sprouts. The infection is not thought to be linked to a recent deadly E. Coli outbreak centered in Germany. All seven, aged from 18 months to 8 years old, are being treated in a hospital for hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) -- a form of kidney failure related to a rare form of E. Coli -- according to the Nord-Pas-de-Calais regional health agency. Seven children are seriously ill in the French city of Lille after an E. Coli outbreak linked to frozen ground beef, French health authorities said Thursday. French regional health authorities have identified frozen ground beef sold in Lidl stores under the brand Steaks Country as linked to the infections in Lille.
