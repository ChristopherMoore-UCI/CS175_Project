Their offspring had earned Coburn and Perry more than $2.3 million in prize money before the Preakness, also chalking up wins at the Santa Anita Derby, San Felipe Stakes and California Cup Derby. After its Preakness success California Chrome became front page news after New York racing officials decided to allow the three-year-old to wear a breathing strip during the Belmont Stakes. Having won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes -- the other two legs of the Triple Crown -- California Chrome would become the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to achieve the ultimate feat in thoroughbred racing should he triumph in New York next month. California Chrome was born to a mare named Love the Chase, purchased by Coburn and Martin for $8,000 with a view to breeding. California Chrome has worn the strips during his last six wins, including those first-place finishes at the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.
