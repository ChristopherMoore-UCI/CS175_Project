Democrats lost big on Election Night in 2014, but Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts argued Wednesday that some of the results were positive for the liberal wing of her party. Liberal groups have also argued that the 2014 election proved that liberal Democratic policies, like those Warren championed on Wednesday, are the future of the party. "Warren was the most popular Democrat on the campaign trail for a reason: Her message of taking on Wall Street, reducing student debt, and expanding Social Security benefits is popular everywhere," wrote Adam Green and Stephanie Taylor, heads of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, in an opinion-editorial for The Hill. They are ready," Warren said at the Center for American Progress "Making Progress" policy conference at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. In particular, Warren highlighted a Hart Research project of battleground voters in 11 states across the country.
