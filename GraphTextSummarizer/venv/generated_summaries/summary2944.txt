-- More than 30 people were killed Monday in southeastern Kenya in the latest outbreak of tribal violence. The Pokomo are largely settled farmers, and the Orma are traditionally pastoralists, tending cattle and goat herds. There has been long-running tension between the two groups over grazing rights and water sources, but it boiled over last month when the Pokomo attacked an Orma village after an apparent land dispute. The massacre comes just days after nearly a dozen people were killed in the same region in what appears to be continued tit-for-tat violence that erupted last month. Samuel Kilele, the police commissioner of the coast, said hundreds of police were in the area, but rugged terrain and poor infrastructure made it hard to get there.
