Welcome to Terminus Rick, Daryl, Michonne and Carl finally arrived at Terminus -- sneaking in through the back, of course. Despite Daryl begging for mercy, Joe's men started to beat him to death, while others set upon Carl and Michonne. We caught up this week with Rick, Carl and Michonne -- interspersed with flashbacks to the comparatively idyllic life back at the prison -- and they too had a rough road to Terminus. Last week, several survivors, including Glenn and Maggie, arrived at Terminus in what was promised to be a safe haven, but was it really? The moment Rick noticed one of the denizens of Terminus wearing Hershel's watch (now owned by Glenn), he pulled a gun on someone -- and wait, isn't that woman wearing Maggie's poncho, too?
