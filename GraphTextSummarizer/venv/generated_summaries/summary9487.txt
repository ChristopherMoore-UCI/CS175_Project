Saleh told Brennan that the GCC initiative laid the groundwork for exiting the political crisis through national dialogue involving all political parties, Yemen's state-run Saba news agency reported. But even during his treatments -- which included eight surgeries -- Saleh was under pressure to embrace a political transition plan developed by the Gulf Cooperation Council that included plans for him to step down, following months of widening anti-government protests and sentiment in his country. Pro-democracy activists said that if Saleh is allowed to come back to Yemen, it would reveal the amount of hatred the United States and Saudi Arabia have for the youth revolutionists. -- President Ali Abdullah Saleh will return to his country Sunday, a homecoming that also marks the 33rd anniversary of his rule, a senior ruling party official said Wednesday. Zaid Thari, a political advisor for Saleh's ruling General People Congress Party, said the president's health is improving quickly and that Yemenis will celebrate his return.
