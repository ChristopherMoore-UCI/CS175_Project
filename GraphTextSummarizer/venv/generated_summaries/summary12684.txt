The vote for a National Constituent Assembly is being billed as the freest and fairest since the strongman who ruled Tunisia for nearly a quarter century, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, was overthrown by street protests last January. Islamist groups protested in Tunis this month after a TV network broadcast an animated film called "Persepolis," which at one point depicts God, regarded as an act of blasphemy to many Muslims. -- Tunisia, the country where the wave of popular Arab discontent started and spread, will fittingly hold the Arab Spring's first election Sunday, a contest pitting secularists against Islamists. Ahmed Najib Chebbi, a leading secularist politician, said he believes "we live with this threat" from Islamist parties. "They use scare tactics to frighten businessmen, women, and foreign countries, but I don't think this has worked."
