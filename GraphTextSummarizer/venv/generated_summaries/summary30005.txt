The Iranian government cracked down on media reports about the protests, so demonstrators took to Twitter to get the word out, inspiring the phrase, "Twitter Revolution." The account quickly amassed more than 100,000 followers and heralded a new wave of parody Twitter feeds. Buzz quickly grew, and by the end of the week, daily Twitter usage had tripled. Twitter and Facebook play a key role in "Arab Spring" uprisings as people in Tunisa, Egypt, Syria, Libya and other countries used the social networks to message each other and organize protests. Within minutes of news reports about an Egyptian cobra escaping from its enclosure at the Bronx Zoo, an anonymous jokester created a witty Twitter account that imagined the freed snake sightseeing its way around New York City.
