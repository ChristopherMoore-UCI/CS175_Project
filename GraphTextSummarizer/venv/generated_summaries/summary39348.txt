He said he expects the question "is ultimately going to find its way to the U.S. Supreme court," noting that many federal courts have recently issued rulings overturning state bans on gay marriage. The controversy surrounding the issue underscores the tension inherent in the Republican Party's efforts to expand outreach beyond the GOP's traditional base of social conservatives, as the nation as a whole moves towards widespread acceptance of gay marriage and more   state legislatures overturn gay marriage bans. But his Tuesday comments came in contrast to remarks he made in a speech at Catholic University in July defending state legislatures' and voters' rights to oppose gay marriage without judicial interference. Rubio said if ultimately the Supreme Court issued a ruling protecting gay marriage as constitutional, opponents of gay marriage would be "in the same boat as opponents of Roe v. Wade," the SCOTUS decision that established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. But the senator, who is contemplating a presidential run of his own, said he would respect federal courts' decisions to overturn gay marriage bans.
