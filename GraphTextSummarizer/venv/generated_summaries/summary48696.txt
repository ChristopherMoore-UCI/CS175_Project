By forming temporary coalitions with the Green Party and other minor parties, the PRI can block presidential vetoes, Salazar said. "He got a beating because of the economy," said Ana Maria Salazar, a television and radio political commentator in Mexico City. But since the PAN did not have control of either house of Congress, Calderon has been compromising and making deals with the PRI and other parties since coming to power.
