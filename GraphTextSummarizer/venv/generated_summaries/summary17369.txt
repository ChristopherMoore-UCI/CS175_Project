In his opening remarks this weekend, King Abdullah of Jordan said that "double action" was needed to deal with the disgruntled youth and a potential doubling of refugees in his country. On one side, the oil rich Gulf states like Saudi Arabia pump billions of dollars into diversification; on the other are the oil importers which includes Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan. The International Labor Organization(ILO) put youth unemployment at 28.3% in 2012 and says it will not reverse course for the next 5 years. But what has happened because of these delayed reforms there is more and more people coming into the labor market, therefore you see higher rates of youth unemployment. The panel I chaired "A New Vision for Arab Employment" presented all those concrete ideas and fielded tough questions from the audience and youth outside the forum who were watching online.
