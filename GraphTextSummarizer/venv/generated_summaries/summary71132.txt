-- Dramatically steep seaside cliffs, quaint multicolored hillside buildings and sweeping views of the sea captivate visitors as they enter scenic Positano, perched along Italy's Amalfi Coast. Many tourists consider Positano, on the south side of the Sorrentine Peninsula,  to be one of the most picturesque of Italy's coastal resorts, and business owners welcome the heavy stream of visitors who come to town each year. The town is known for its lemons, and Positano shop owners capitalize on this by selling lemon sweets, perfumes, soaps and home decor, among other things. In the town's steep, narrow streets, you'll discover many shops selling fashionable clothes handmade in Positano. If hiking is part of your agenda, take a walk from Positano along the Amalfi Coast on various panoramic trails.
