Hundreds of security forces attempted to restrict the protesters' movements, and tear-gas canisters could be seen flying toward the crowd, said hospital director Mohammed Qubati. Crowds marched through downtown Sanaa, where government forces allegedly gunned down protesters -- the latest in a series of confrontations between those loyal to embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh, demonstrators and rival factions. The violence comes one day after thousands of women demonstrated in front of Yemen's Foreign Ministry in Sanaa, demanding U.N. intervention in the ongoing unrest in the Persian Gulf nation. -- Eleven people were killed Tuesday during clashes with Yemeni security forces after anti-government protests again filled the streets of the country's capital, according to a hospital official. Others carrying sticks and knives also advanced toward the crowds, Qubati added.
