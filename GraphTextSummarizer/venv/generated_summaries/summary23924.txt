Wuppertal Zoo has a long history of raising polar bears, with the first cub born there in 1931, the zoo's website says. -- There's a new polar bear on the block -- meet Anori, half-sister to Knut, who made her public debut this week at Wuppertal Zoo in Germany. Anori shares a father with Knut, the cub who became an Internet star after he was abandoned by his mother and hand-raised by a zookeeper. In 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service listed the polar bear as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Knut died suddenly at age 4 in March 2010 at Zoo Berlin, to the sorrow of many worldwide who had followed the cub's progress.
