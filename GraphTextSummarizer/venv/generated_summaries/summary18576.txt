"We are honored that the legendary Jack Nicklaus will lead fans as their host and teacher in understanding the nuances that the greatest players in golf consider and think about regarding course setup and hole locations -- and the effect their selection will have on the eventual outcome of the 95th PGA Championship." -- Golf fans from around the world will have a chance to make history at next month's PGA Championship with just a click of a button. "The chance for golf fans to interact with the PGA Championship and play a role in shaping the outcome of the final round fascinates me," Nicklaus told the PGA's official website. Fans have been given the unique opportunity to design part of the course setup by deciding just where to place the pin on the par-three 15th at Oak Hill Country Club, Rochester, New York. PGA President Ted Bishop believes the social media interaction will help boost the profile of golf's final major of the season.
