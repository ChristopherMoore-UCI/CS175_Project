Meanwhile, state-run Syrian media reported Saturday that the first shipment of aid has reached the Yarmouk Palestinian Refugee Camp outside Damascus, where dozens of people have died of starvation and lack of medical attention since the camp was cut off by warring factions last November. "By voting to go to Geneva 2 with a mission to negotiate an end to the war, the opposition has chosen a path that will ultimately lead to a better future for all Syrians," Kerry said in a statement Saturday. "It is about establishing a process essential to the formation of a transition government body -- governing body -- with full executive powers established by mutual consent," he told reporters. Any names put forward for leadership of Syria's transition must, according to the terms of Geneva 1, be agreed to by the opposition and the regime led by President Bashar al-Assad, according to Kerry. The Syrian National Coalition voted Saturday to attend next week's peace talks in Geneva.
