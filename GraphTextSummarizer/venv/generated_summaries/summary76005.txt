Although Brett Major wrote that the University of Nebraska needs to "take a stand against Ron Brown," neither he nor his parents called for Brown's firing. "It's about those athletes and creating an environment in NCAA athletics that they feel comfortable in." Major and his parents, who are both Nebraska graduates, wrote a letter to the university saying they believe "more should have been said" by university officials to make it abundantly clear that discrimination against LGBT individuals has no place at Nebraska. -- When University of Nebraska-Lincoln assistant football coach Ron Brown stood in front of the Omaha City Council in March to speak against a proposal to protect sexual identity, he was merely exercising his right as a private citizen, he would later say. "But I have no evidence that he's done that." One of Brown's biggest fans over the years was Brett Major, who was born and raised in Omaha and, like most Nebraskans, bleeds Husker red. Major, an active member of the Christian faith who is also gay, credits Brown with helping strengthen his relationship with Jesus Christ.
