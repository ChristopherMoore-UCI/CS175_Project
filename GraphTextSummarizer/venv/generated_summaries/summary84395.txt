Philly priest gets 3 to 6 years in abuse case Pope to Vatican: 'Act decisively' on sex abuse case Joseph J. Gallagher, 78, and Mark S. Gaspar, 43, are two of the 26 priests who were suspended by the archdiocese after a 2011 grand jury investigation into the archdiocese's handling of child sex abuse allegations. They were placed on administrative leave while the church looked into allegations of abuse and misconduct. Gallagher is the priest at the center of a wrongful-death suit filed against the archdiocese by the family of Daniel Neill, who killed himself in 2009 after his allegations were deemed not credible by church officials. According to the 2007 grand jury report, Neill reported that Gallagher repeatedly fondled him when he was a minor and served as an altar boy in Bristol, Pennsylvania.
