Fears of all-out sectarian war have increased since fighting broke out at the end of last year to the west of Baghdad in Anbar province, where al Qaeda-backed militants and Iraqi security forces have been battling for control of Falluja and Ramadi. Roads were blocked around the Iraqi capital following the attack, and areas leading to Baghdad's fortified Green Zone were closed. Six gunmen were killed in the police operation to retake the Ministry of Transport in northeast Baghdad. Police earlier said that the militants had overrun the Ministry of Human Rights building, adjacent to the Ministry of Transport. -- Iraqi police have won back full control of a ministry building stormed by gunmen who took civil servants hostage, the Interior Ministry and security sources said Thursday.
