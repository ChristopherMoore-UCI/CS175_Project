-- Jared Remy, the son of famed Boston Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy, pleaded guilty in a Massachusetts court Tuesday to killing his fiancÃ©e Jennifer Martel just days after he was arrested for assaulting her. Remy is the son of famed Red Sox color commentator Jerry Remy. Remy was arrested on August 13 for assault and battery after Martel told police that Remy had grabbed her neck and head and "slammed her face against a mirror" in the bathroom during an argument, according to a Waltham police report. Remy was arrested by Waltham police after the incident and charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. Martel could be heard on the call, which was released by police, saying "(Remy) is just a very violent person who is on lots of medication who might need serious help.
