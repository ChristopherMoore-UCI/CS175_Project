Chris Christie, the New Jersey GOP Governor and possible 2016 White House contender, is slamming President Obama for passing the buck on the U.S. being ill prepared for the ISIS threat. Unlike senators contemplating white house campaigns, questions about U.S. policy in the Middle East are not in Christie's daily wheelhouse as chief executive of New Jersey. In an interview with CNN, Christie said he was "disturbed" by the fact that Obama told CBS's "60 Minutes" that the director of national intelligence admitted "they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria. " When pressed on the fact that the president has in fact gotten a coalition of Arab countries together to help the U.S. in airstrikes, Christie responded that he doesn't think he has a "complete plan. I think that makes people a little less certain of his footing on these things," Christie told CNN.
