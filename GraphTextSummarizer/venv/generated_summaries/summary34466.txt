"Libs SHUTUP," reads one tweet, which goes on to assert that Indiana's "Relgious Freedom Restauration Act (sic)" is modeled on federal legislation signed by President Bill Clinton in 1993. Some have likened the new law to permitting businesses to discriminate against black people, if perchance their religion dictated that. The new law could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers if serving them would contravene the business owner's religious beliefs. And so it has proved with Indiana's new "religious freedom" law, signed Thursday by Gov. Mike Pence. "My team just canceled travel to IN due to the #ReligiousFreedomRestorationAct," tweeted a user under the name Mark C Somerville, who says he works for @salesforce.
