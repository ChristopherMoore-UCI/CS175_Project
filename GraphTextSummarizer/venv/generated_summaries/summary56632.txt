Pakistan's new Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar met her Indian counterpart S.M. Krishna in New Delhi in an engagement that saw no major breakthroughs over outstanding disputes but a commitment to pursue dialogue. Under U.S. pressure, Indian and Pakistani leaders held meetings last year in a bid to put their dialogue back on track, but no dramatic headway has been made. Earlier this year, New Delhi and Islamabad agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 Mumbai strikes, which have been blamed on Pakistan-based militant groups. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari hailed results from the dialogue in September 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings. Pakistan was quick to condemn the July 13 bombings of Mumbai while New Delhi was careful not to finger Islamabad.
