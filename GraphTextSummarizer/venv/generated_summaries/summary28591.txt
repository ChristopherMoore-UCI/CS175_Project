Dubbed the "Black Issue," the magazine celebrates models of color from the past and present, including Donyale Luna, Liya Kebede, Naomi Campbell, Iman and Chanel Iman. Chanel Iman is one of several models of color featured in the "Black Issue" of Italian Vogue. She's already scheduled another town hall meeting for September, and she's also planning a mixer to introduce fledgling models of color to industry players. "All the agents were happy about the issue because it gives us hope that other people will catch on and decide that it's OK to use more black girls," said Carlos Ojeda, an agent at New York Models. "I started seeing more black models on the runway back in February," she said, pointing to the shows of designers like Diane Von Furstenberg and Michael Kors as examples.
