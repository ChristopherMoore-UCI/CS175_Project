While the iPad is the only tablet currently approved by the FAA to replace current flight kits, other tablets could be authorized as well. AA is striving to go all-digital by the end of 2012, replacing pilots' bulky 35-pound bags full of navigational charts, log books and other flight reference materials with the 1.5-pound Apple tablets. -- iPads will soon be ubiquitous in American Airlines cockpits, but don't expect pilots to be playing "Angry Birds" instead of paying attention to the flight path. It's unclear if or how soon United will match American in getting the FAA's approval for iPad use during all phases of flight. Many airlines are using flight apps, which don't require Wi-Fi once installed on the tablets.
