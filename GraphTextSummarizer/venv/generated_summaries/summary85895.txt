In March 2008, the Mexican military joined with Mexican states and local law enforcement in the fight against drug cartels in border cities. "They started killing police officers, and not when they were doing police work, but when they were coming out of their homes and getting into their cars to go to the police station," said Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz, whose own family has recently received death threats. The growing violence over rival drug cartels had concerned the couple, but Mexico was a part of their lives and they were sure the violence stayed between rival drug gangs, who were fighting over a lucrative drug route into the United States. Marisella Molinar was killed while driving her boss, a target of cartels, across the border into El Paso, Texas. The violence has been the worst in Juarez, where cartels have killed police officers, forced the chief of police to resign and threatened public officials.
