Highlights include historic hearses, celebrity death memorabilia and how-to lessons on embalming and burial. If you want to spend the night in the company of such unusual history, check in at the Sturgis House, a funeral parlor turned bed and breakfast in East Liverpool, Ohio. The Peoples Mortuary Museum is part of a working mortuary in Marietta, Ohio, and it boasts a collection of classic hearses from past centuries, even a horse-drawn hearse from 1895. The Famous Endings Funeral Collection in Dover, Ohio, is a must-see for history buffs curious about celebrity deaths. Irving attended services at the Old Dutch Church as a child, and the author is buried in the adjacent Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (others buried there include Andrew Carnegie and Elizabeth Arden).
