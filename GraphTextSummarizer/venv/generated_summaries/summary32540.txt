Psy: When I first spoke with Snoop on the phone to discuss the collaboration idea, Snoop loved the title of the song, and I immediately suggested to him during that first conversation to shoot the music video in Korea and show us getting drunk and getting hungover in the most traditional Korean way. That's actually a pretty slow start for the Korean superstar, considering "Gangnam Style" became the first video to pass two billion hits a week ago, while his follow-up single "Gentleman" also broke a record for the most views in 24 hours -- it currently has 694 million views on YouTube. Promotions for the new song kicked off Sunday on Jimmy Kimmel, with the unlikely trio of Kimmel, Psy and Snoop heading to a local karaoke bar in Los Angeles and bringing the house down with their yodeling. The "Hangover" video shows Psy taking Snoop on a ridiculous guided tour of what he does best -- hardcore drinking, Korean-style. This involves endless bomb shots, hanging out at a jjimjilbang (Korean bathhouse), throwing up and karaoke with strangers -- with one particularly surreal scene of Snoop, Psy and and two Korean women blithely skipping through an amusement park, presumably drunk.
