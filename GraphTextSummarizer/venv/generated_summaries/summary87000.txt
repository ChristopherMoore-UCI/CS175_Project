Storms were just gearing up Tuesday evening, Myers said, advising residents to stay indoors. At one point, a storm churning through Nebraska was more than 10 miles tall, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. In Omaha, cars jammed streets with residents rushing home as a storm moved in, darkening afternoon skies over the city with ominous clouds, CNN affiliate KETV reported. Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad issued a storm disaster proclamation Tuesday night for Pottawattamie County, where the storms hit while voters were heading to the polls for primary elections. Sustained heavy rainfall could bring widespread flooding, Myers said.
