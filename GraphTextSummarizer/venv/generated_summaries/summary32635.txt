In July, you can ditch the crowds in the pristine, rarely visited northern Serengeti and more popular Masai Mara Game Reserve. A lot of freebie entertainment is available, from Cirque du Soleil shows (tickets in other cities go for $100-plus) to fireworks over the St. Lawrence River to the world's largest movie screen. The Hokitika Wildfoods Festival (March 9) offers such delicacies as huhu grubs, sheep brains, gorse flower wine and wasp larvae ice cream. Weather report: Beach weather (mid-20s C/mid-70s F) without the crowds. Weather report: Dry with pleasant temps, average high of 28 C/82 F. Who should avoid: City dwellers who hate the outdoors and/or camping.
