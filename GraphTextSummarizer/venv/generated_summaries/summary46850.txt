The club's license had expired in August and had not been renewed, local fire official Moises da Silva Fuchs told Globo TV. The fire started around 2 a.m. after the acoustic insulation in the Kiss nightclub caught fire, said Civil Defense Col. Adilomar Silva. Investigators have received preliminary information that security guards stopped people from exiting the club, he told Globo TV. Glauber Fernandes, a reporter from CNN affiliate Band News, explains. "People started running," survivor Luana Santos Silva told Globo TV.
