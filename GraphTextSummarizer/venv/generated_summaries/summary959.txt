During those first rough days, Canadian officials tried to reassure the nation and the world that the host country would do well on medals, and that they had planned for weather pitfalls. It was with a smile that Canada wrapped up the games, having won the most gold medals any nation has won in any Winter Olympics and having won back the hockey gold medal it feels should permanently reside here. Despite a slow start and some disappointments in events that were supposed to be almost sure things, the Canadians won a record number of gold medals. The total included golds by the four-man bobsled team led by driver Steven Holcomb, the first gold medal ever by a skier in Nordic Combined (Bill Demong), and the expected brilliance of Shaun White in the snowboard halfpipe. With the Winter Games closing Sunday night, you could almost hear the voices of Canadian officials saying, "We told you everything would work out."
