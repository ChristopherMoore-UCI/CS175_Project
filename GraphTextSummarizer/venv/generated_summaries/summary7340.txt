While our list might not be complete, it's worth taking a moment to remember these lost girls: The Missing: Teresa Kay Davis, age 18, 1973 Laurie Lynn Partridge, 17, 1974 Angela Mae Meeker, 13, 1974 Loralee Sue Lhotka, 20, 1975 Carlotta Maria Sanchez, 12, 1979 Andria Ann Bailey, 16, 1979 Christina Lee White, 12, 1979 Carla Kaylene Owens, 14, 1981 Kase Ann Lee, 16, 1982 Patricia Ann LeBlanc, 15, 1983 John Tessier was aware of the Grimes case; he mentioned it to an Air Force recruiter on December 4, 1957. Barbara and Patricia Grimes, ages 15 and 13, vanished in December 1956 on the way to see the Elvis Presley movie "Love Me Tender." He returned four years later, but by then Kathy Sigman and her family were living on the other side of town. Many amateur sleuths told us they devoured the tale of the 1957 kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph in a single sitting.
