Race organizers made the unanimous decision in February to move the race after determining that conditions were worse than last year in critical areas, and "therefore not safe enough for the upcoming race," Iditarod Chief Executive Stan Hooley said in a press release. The lack of snow could be attributed to a highly amplified jet stream that brought warm air from the Pacific to the region, said meteorologist  Dave Snider with the National Weather Service in Anchorage. An unseasonably warm winter has left parts of Alaska's Iditarod trail without snow, exposing grass and gravel and forcing the famous dogsled race to move 225 miles north. While snow has fallen east of the Alaska Range over the past couple of weeks, other parts of the trail did not get much or any of it, Hooley told CNN affiliate KTVA-TV in February. Anchorage collected only 20 inches of snow this season, compared with a seasonal average of 60 inches.
