-- "About 20" cases of a polio-like syndrome have been identified in California children over the past 18 months, a Stanford University researcher says. " The CDC is aware of the small cluster of cases in California but is not actively involved in an investigation, a spokesman told CNN. Dr. Keith Van Haren, a pediatric neurologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford, has written a report about five of the early cases. "About 20 cases have been identified in the U.S. so far, all in California, and all occurring in the past 18 months," Van Haren said in an online posting Monday on the hospital's website. Most people who become infected with an enterovirus do not get sick or experience only mild symptoms, said Dr. Steven Oberste, chief of the Polio and Picornavirus Laboratory Branch at the CDC.
