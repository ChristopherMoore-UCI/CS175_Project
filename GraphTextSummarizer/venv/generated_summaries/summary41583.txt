It's the only day all year that BASE jumpers -- whose acronym stands for these fixed points: building, antenna, span and earth -- can legally jump off the bridge. For the second year, a smaller group of jumpers got to use a human catapult system in 2013 to get flung off the bridge. The bridge festival, billed as the largest extreme sports event in the world, is expected to attract nearly 100,000 people to Fayetteville. Vendors surrounding the bridge will offer snacks, crafts and other ways to less strenuously celebrate the jumpers. They like to tackle the bridge challenge, slithering on ropes attached to the bridge from the catwalk underneath the to the gorge bottom, watching the parachutists go by.
