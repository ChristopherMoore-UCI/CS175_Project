A gunman carrying a variant of an AK-47 rifle opened fire on uniformed Nevada National Guard members as they were having breakfast at the Carson City restaurant Tuesday morning. Another National Guard member, who was taken to a hospital and underwent surgery, later died -- bringing the toll to four, said Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong. The suspected gunman was identified as Eduardo Sencion, 32, who lived in Carson City and worked at a family business in South Lake Tahoe, California, authorities said. Sencion had no previous criminal record on file but his family indicated he may have had mental health issues, Furlong told reporters. The death toll from a shooting at a Nevada IHOP restaurant has risen to four, officials said early Wednesday morning.
