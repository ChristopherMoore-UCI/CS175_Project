For the past 10 years, the Melbourne, Australia artist has been building intricate cardboard sculptures in the form of whimsical flying machines and rickety roller coasters. Each of these pieces has glue, yes, but they also have built-in structural integrity, much in the way an architect uses hidden elements to build a robust building. He'll think up some strange contraption and simply begin cutting pieces of cardboard and piecing them together with AVP glue. He prefers working with the scalpel ("I go through four or five a day," he says) and uses only three gauges of board: 1mm, .8 mm and .2 mm. So even though they're technically sculptural, I feel like they're drawings in cardboard."
