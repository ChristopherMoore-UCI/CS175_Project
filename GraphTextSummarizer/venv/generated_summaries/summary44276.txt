Richmond captures the solitude and expanse of places like central Wyoming and Montana in his latest photography project, "Last Best Hiding Place," which releases in book format in June in the United Kingdom and in the fall in the United States. He said he was surprised by "the scale of development on halt in the towns outside Salt Lake City." He named his photography series "Last Best Hiding Place" after a phrase he came across during his travels, referring to those living "slightly under the radar" in remote parts of the American West. Tim Richmond's fascination with the American West began as a boy in England, watching cowboy movies on TV. " Richmond spent one summer traveling with a group of rodeo cowboys, captured in one image simply doing their laundry. "The film 'Hud' with Paul Newman in 1963 or 'Bad Day at Black Rock' with Spencer Tracy ... and 'Junior Bonner' with Steve McQueen as a sort of rodeo rider," said Richmond.
