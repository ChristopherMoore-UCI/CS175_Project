An emergency dispatcher in Edgefield said there were no reports of damage or injuries tied to the tremor. Friday's quake was actually the 13th earthquake in South Carolina in the past 12 months, the South Carolina Emergency Management Division said. A 4.1 magnitude earthquake struck Friday night in west-central South Carolina, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. The quake was the strongest to hit South Carolina since 2002, local emergency management officials said. Though it may seem rare, South Carolina does experience a number of earthquakes, officials said.
