" Federer is coached by Paul Annacone, a former student of Bollettieri who also worked with Sampras for several years. The world No. 1 can match Federer's grand slam haul if she retains her U.S. Open title at Flushing Meadows. The 17-time grand slam champion is "in a very vulnerable state" ahead of his opening match at the U.S. Open on Monday, according to top coach Nick Bollettieri. The power of players such as Nadal is making it so much harder for the classically elegant Federer, says Bollettieri. Bollettieri is concerned that an underwhelming end to his career could undo the Federer legacy.
