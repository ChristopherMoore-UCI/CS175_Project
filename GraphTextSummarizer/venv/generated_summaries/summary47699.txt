-- A Texas actress in a troubled marriage was arrested and charged Friday in connection with ricin-tainted letters that were mailed last month to President Barack Obama and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, authorities said. The three letters were mailed from Shreveport, Louisiana, last month, federal authorities say. The FBI found "very low concentrations" of ricin on the letters, a spokesman said last month. She was arrested in Mount Pleasant, Texas, authorities said. Investigators found that her computer storage devices contained the text of threatening letters sent to the president, but the couple's computer records show her husband couldn't have printed them out because he was at work at the time, an FBI arrest affidavit said.
