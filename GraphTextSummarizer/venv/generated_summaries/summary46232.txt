The militants attacked the Halane military base in Mogadishu, Somalia's largest base for African Union troops, according to the African Union Mission in Somalia. Five Al-Shabaab militants are dead after they attacked an African Union military base in Somalia on Thursday, AU officials said. Two militants detonated themselves inside the Halane base and three were shot dead by AU troops during the raid, AMISOM spokesman Ali Aden Houmed said. "Our Mujahedeen forces detonated a car bomb at the entrance of the Halane compound ... then managed to enter the facility," Sheikh Abdiaziz Abu Musab said. The AMISOM statement said other personnel at Halane are "safe and secure."
