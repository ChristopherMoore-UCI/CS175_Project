Let's go to the more interesting fact: they are going online to find love, passion and sex. In fact, a lot of medical evidence indicates that if they do have physical affection, love and sex they will live longer. What did they think she was going to do: Make a man out of paper machÃ© or cookie dough? "'What will my friends say," they ask me, "if they see me on Senior Friend finder or J Date?"
