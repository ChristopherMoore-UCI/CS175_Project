"With the number of college graduates who can't find work or who can only find work well beneath their skill level, I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans," Romney said before a campaign event in Astor, Pennsylvania on Monday. The issue is fast becoming a political football, and one President Barack Obama hopes to score with young voters. Though a drop off in turnout among young voters is predictable when there's no presidential candidate on the ticket, there are other reasons the Obama team has to worry about a lower turnout. At the Pennsylvania event he told reporters, "I think this is a time when young people are questioning the support they gave to President Obama three and a half years ago." One issue the Romney campaign is certain to hit on: the unemployment rate among 20-24 year olds is five points higher than the national average. And a recent Harvard University Institute of Politics survey showed that while young people still overwhelmingly support Obama, they are now less likely to vote this fall, more disillusioned about the economy and politics in general.
