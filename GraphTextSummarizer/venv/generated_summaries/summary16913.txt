Clash, who was suspended and later resigned from his Sesame Street after the first allegations surfaced in November, "can go about the business of reclaiming his personal life and his professional standing," his lawyer told CNN Monday. " In November, Clash issued a written statement saying: "I am resigning from Sesame Workshop with a very heavy heart. Personal matters have diverted attention away from the important work Sesame Street is doing and I cannot allow it to go on any longer. Three lawsuits alleging sex abuse by Kevin Clash, the puppeteer who gave Sesame Street's Elmo his voice, were dismissed by a judge who ruled the accusers waited too long to sue. Sesame Workshop is the nonprofit educational organization behind Sesame Street, according to its website.
