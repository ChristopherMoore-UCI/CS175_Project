Saving Van Gogh's home from dereliction Van Gogh (1853-1890) created some of the world's best known and most loved paintings, including "Sunflowers," "Irises" and "The Starrry Night," and a number of self-portraits. " Van Gogh, Kahlo speak from beyond grave Van Gogh wrote about the wrestlers picture -- which he painted as an assignment during his studies at the art academy in Antwerp -- in a letter in January 1886: "This week I painted a large thing with two nude torsos -- two wrestlers," adding that he was delighted with the result. -- A painting dismissed for years as the work of an unknown artist has been identified as a piece by Vincent Van Gogh, after x-rays revealed an image of two wrestlers fighting underneath the floral still life. "The x-rays show that it had not hardened completely when the still life was added, causing some cracks in the paint of the flower picture, which suggests it was painted less than half a year later." Meedendorp said there was always the possibility of discovering other "unknown" Van Gogh works in future. "There were a lot of things about it that were strange -- it couldn't quite be trusted [as a piece by Van Gogh]."
