-- Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych offered amnesty to the protesters detained after mass anti-government rallies in Kiev, Ukrainian protesters, angry about the government's decision last month to spurn a free-trade agreement with the European Union in favor of closer economic ties with Moscow, have stood their ground in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, paralyzing the center of the capital. Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west and a more Russia-oriented east. Opposition leader and boxing world champion Vitaly Klitschko said Friday that his Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reform party will take part in the round-table talks and that he believes that the only way out of the political crisis is a complete reboot of power, namely early presidential and parliamentary elections. On Thursday, the European Union's top diplomat said the Ukrainian President intends to sign a deal on closer EU ties after weeks of the mass protests.
