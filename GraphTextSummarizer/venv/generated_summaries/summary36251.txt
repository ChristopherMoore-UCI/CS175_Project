Here, it's all about how low you can go -- with people battling it out at auctions to win the chance to show off license plates with the lowest digit. "As low as the number goes, as high the price goes also," said Abdullah Al Mannaei, who runs the license plate auctions in the capital city, Abu Dhabi. The money that the government raises auctioning off plates goes to a fund that helps victims of car accidents. "I have a number plate on my car, which was worth 35,000 (dirhams) four years ago," Al Mannaei said. The license plate "5" hangs from his shiny red Rolls Royce.
