A spokesman for the group of security guards, Moussa Ag Abdoulaye, appeared on RTB and reaffirmed the group's committment to the president and called for a cease-fire from other military groups. A small group of presidential security guards revolted Thursday night over a promised housing allowance, firing shots inside the presidential compound and taking to the streets, shooting guns, stealing cars and robbing people, according to officials with the Ministry of Defense. Before Tiao was an ambassador, he was president of the Superior Council of Communication of Burkina Faso, which regulates the media. The announcement came after several incidents triggered violence in the western African nation, sparked by different events. According to media reports, a man sued a group of five soldiers, claiming they allegedly forced him to take off his clothes and walk home because he had dated a soldier's girlfriend.
