Eatocracy: Buying food is a political act I don't know about "food deserts," but I do know just as there is a link between education and poverty, there appears to be a correlation between poverty and health. Recently Michelle Obama's campaign to get healthier foods into poor neighborhoods came under new scrutiny because two studies found her notion of "food deserts" -- poor urban neighborhoods where access to fresh fruits and vegetables are supposedly nonexistent -- doesn't quite jibe with the research. In 2008, health care costs stemming from obesity were estimated to be $147 billion. The rise of Type 2 diabetes in children coincides with the rise of child obesity and childhood poverty. But nary a word on the campaign trail about the billions that are being spent each year due to this low income-obesity cycle that is not only potentially cutting short the lives of millions of poor Americans, but eating away at the paychecks of a middle class that needs that money to make healthier food choices for their own families.
