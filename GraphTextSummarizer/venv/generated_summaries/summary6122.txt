You're likely to have caught him in small roles in TV shows such as "Kojak," "Charlie's Angels," "Magnum P.I.," "Miami Vice," "The X-Files," "Law and Order," "ER," and "Grey's Anatomy." You may not recognize Lauter's name, but his long, thin, bald visage has shown up in many places. After a four decade-long career, Lauter died Wednesday at age 74 of a rare cancer, mesothelioma, caused by asbestos exposure, his publicist  said. Lauter seemed to have been the opposite of the out-of-work actor, in demand for roles up to the end. From "Mannix" in early 1970's and on TV regularly since then, Lauter played detectives, sheriffs or mobster heavies.
