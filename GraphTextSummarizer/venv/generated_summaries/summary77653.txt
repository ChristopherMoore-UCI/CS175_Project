Oprah.com: 4 food blogs we love I'm from a region -- between the San Francisco Bay Area and Napa Valley -- that's riddled with farmers' markets, an area where Ethiopian or Cambodian cuisine is as plentiful as burgers, and where culinary legends (Alice Waters, the Kellers Hubert and Thomas) and hidden-gem restaurants (Oakland's Doña Tomás, St. Helena's Meadowood) abound.
