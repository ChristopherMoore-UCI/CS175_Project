The Kimberley Process was developed in 2000 when a group of diamond-producing countries met in Kimberley, South Africa, to combat the trade in conflict diamonds. The decision follows the controversial sale of a batch of diamonds from the Marange diamond fields in Zimbabwe, some of which are owned by companies associated with President Robert Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. A major international environmental group is pulling out of the process to guarantee that diamonds do not come from conflict zones, saying the Kimberley Process had refused "to evolve and address the clear links between diamonds, violence and tyranny." Davis said the Mugabe government has to rely on diamond income because of the intense international pressure on it. "Diamonds are an absolute godsend for them and a curse for the rest of Zimbabwe," he said.
