Rosalind Wiseman, author of the New York Times bestseller "Queenbees and Wannabes," which was the basis for the movie "Mean Girls," believes we are seeing mean girl behavior at younger ages. In our own conversations, we should also be mindful about how we're feeding into the stereotypes about girls and boys, said Wiseman, whose latest book "Masterminds and Wingmen" focuses on how boys have to deal with "mean boys" too. "Mainstream media is portraying girls at younger ages who are mimicking the worst of obnoxious, stereotypical girl behavior ... "With girls, the more they watched, the more likely they were to perpetuate these behaviors so there's something about the nature of this type of behavior that girls feel comfortable perpetuating," said Martins. After taking into account factors that could influence television viewing and aggression, such as socio-economic background and academic success, Martins and her co-author found a significant relationship for girls but not for boys between watching these shows and taking on socially aggressive behaviors.
