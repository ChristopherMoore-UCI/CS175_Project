So he takes the gig, hitting the road in his shag-carpeted RV to reunite his old news team: Paul Rudd's mutton-chopped muckraker Brian Fantana, David Koechner's casually racist sports reporter Champ Kind, and, of course, Steve Carell's imbecile meteorologist Brick Tamland. But as things chug along and Ron and his posse start feuding with James Marsden's more polished news team (''I bet his poop smells like sandalwood''), the film starts to flag and feel a little too familiar, going through the same paces and beats established by the first film -- right down to a baroque battle royale in Central Park with a parade of rival TV news teams. The plot of the film involves Ron selling his journalistic soul (wait, did he ever have one?) by hyping sensationalistic stories like O.J.-style freeway chases and Fox News-esque appeals to flag-waving patriotism that will snag ratings and make him a big deal again. Ron doesn't have to wait long for a second chance, thanks to a fledgling 24-hour news channel called GNN that needs talking heads to fill up its graveyard time slot.
