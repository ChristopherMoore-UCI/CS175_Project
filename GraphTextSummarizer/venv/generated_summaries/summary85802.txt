With provincial elections scheduled to take place in five days, ongoing attacks have politicians worried that violence could skew the outcome, if Iraqis who fear attacks on polling centers stay at home. The attacks took place in at least six provinces: Baghdad, Anbar, Babel, Kirkuk, Salaheddin Diyala, and Nasriya, police officials across the country told CNN. Most of the attacks in Baghdad targeted Shiite areas, police told CNN. Attacks elsewhere hit security checkpoints, Shiite areas and political offices. Al Qaeda in Iraq, made up of Sunni extremists, has claimed responsibility for many attacks in recent months.
