New Zealand will join four other challengers, Artemis Racing of Sweden, the UK syndicate Ben Ainslie Racing, Luna Rossa Challenge from Italy and Team France, who will battle to earn the right to challenge Oracle for sailing's most prestigious honor. The announcement was made Tuesday at a glitzy ceremony in New York, attended by Hollywood film stars Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, who have been residents of Bermuda. The 2013 staging in San Francisco saw Oracle make a successful defense of the Cup in one of the most exciting finales in its history, beating Team New Zealand in the deciding race. Oracle Team USA will make its defense of the America's Cup in 2017 off the island of Bermuda, a British overseas territory in the Atlantic Ocean. Renowned as a playground for the rich, Douglas, whose mother is Bermudian, is developing a resort complex, he first revealed on official Facebook page back in April.
