Amnesty laws protecting former military officers were stripped in 2005 under the leadership of the late president Nestor Kirchner. Sixteen former Argentine military officers received sentences ranging from 18 years to life in prison for their roles in human rights abuses committed during Argentina's 1976 to 1983 dictatorship. His wife and successor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has also been a vocal proponent of putting former officers on trial. On Wednesday night, inside a packed courtroom in downtown Buenos Aires, she learned their fates.
