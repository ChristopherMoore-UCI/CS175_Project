-- President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at Tuesday's kids' "state dinner" at the White House, an event thrown by the the first lady to welcome the winners of the second annual Healthy Lunchtime Challenge. After lunch, recipe winners were treated to a performance by 15-year-old singer Rachel Crow before getting a tour of the White House kitchen garden. "We have seen that when kids like all of you get involved in creating your own healthy meals, the results can really be amazing and delicious and fun," Michelle Obama told the young chefs. The Healthy Lunchtime Challenge is a recipe contest for kids across the country, launched in 2012 by Epicurious -- a website about food -- to promote healthy eating for children in the United States. Winning recipes included Picky Eater Pita Pizza Pockets, made by 8-year-old Jacob Hirsch from West Bloomfield, Michigan, and Bring it on, Brussels Sprout Wrap!
