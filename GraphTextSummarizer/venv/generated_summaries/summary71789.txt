But Oliver Miles, a former British ambassador to Libya, said there was no comparison between the two countries -- or between Syria and Iraq, another high-profile example of international intervention. Syria is a larger country than Libya, it's a more complicated country than Libya, it doesn't offer any scope for foreign intervention." " But Azzawi said such pragmatic attitudes were making the situation worse, accusing foreign powers who failed to act of "participating in the bloodshed in Syria" by default. "I think the situation in Syria is absolutely dreadful, and if I could think of a way that the British government, or any other government, or the United Nations could intervene effectively, I would be all for it, but I think intervention would probably make things worse," he told CNN. Mousab Azzawi, of the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said events in Syria amounted to a "humanitarian crisis," just like that seen in Libya prior to the NATO intervention, and that the situation merited a similar response.
