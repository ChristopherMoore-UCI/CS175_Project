-- Oscar-winning actress Celeste Holm died at her home in New York on Sunday at the age of 95, her niece, Amy Phillips, confirmed. Her Broadway debut in "The Time of Your Life" in 1939 was a small part, but it brought her to the attention of New York critics. Her many charitable works include the chairmanship of Arts Horizons, an organization that brings the arts to school children through the Metropolitan area; The Actors Home of Englewood, New Jersey; and UNICEF. Holm's stardom took off in her third film, "Gentleman's Agreement," in which she won the best supporting actress Academy Award for playing fashion editor Anne Dettry. Holm won the best supporting actress Academy Award for "Gentleman's Agreement" in 1947.
