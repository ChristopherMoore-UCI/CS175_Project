-- Cesc Fabregas scored his first goal for Barcelona as the European champions defeated Europa League winners Porto 2-0 in Monaco to win the Super Cup on Friday. There was nothing to choose between the sides after the break, but Barca showed their squad depth by bringing on new signings Fabregas and Chilean winger Alexis Sanchex, and they started to take control of the match. A defensive mix-up left Messi through on goal, and the Argentine maestro dummied Porto goalkeeper Helton before expertly sliding the ball home. With four minutes to go, Porto had Rolando sent off for hacking down Messi, and the 10 men then fell behind to Fabregas' effort. And Porto's misery was complete in the final minute when Fredy Gurain was also shown a straight red card for a late challenge on Javier Mascherano.
