The area of the zoo in which the Siberian tiger killed Carlos Sousa of San Jose has been deemed a crime scene, San Francisco Police Chief Heather Fong said. Along with Siberian tigers, an endangered species, the zoo has rarer and smaller Sumatran tigers. The 4-year-old tiger was born at the Denver Zoo and came to San Francisco in 2005. Regular safety training and annual emergency drills are required by these mandatory accreditation standards. The two survivors were in stable condition Wednesday and doing well, San Francisco General Hospital said.
