Journalist Barbie Nadeau reported from Grosseto; CNN's Hada Messia reported from Rome; CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report. Schettino's lawyer, Paolo Bastianini, told CNN his client had received death threats. Though the captain made a mistake by coming too close to Giglio, his maneuvers after the accident saved thousands of lives, van Wijnen told CNN. Schettino faces allegations of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck, abandoning ship, failing to report an accident to the coast guard and destroying a natural habitat. The case centers on several questions, including why it allegedly took Schettino more than an hour to issue an order to abandon ship and why he allegedly left the vessel before all passengers had abandoned it.
