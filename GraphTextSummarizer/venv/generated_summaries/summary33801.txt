-- Yemen's embattled president, still recovering from a violent attack last month, met with a top U.S. counterterrorism official in Saudi Arabia Sunday. As Brennan and Saleh met in Saudi Arabia, clashes erupted between government security forces and armed tribesmen in one of the epicenters of Yemen's anti-government movement. His speech from Saudia Arabia transfixed his home country, which has been enduring months of anti-government protests and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militant activity. The United States has been aiding Yemen's military in its fight against Islamic militants amid fears that al Qaeda is exploiting the political chaos and leadership vacuum engulfing the unstable and impoverished Arabian Peninsula country. On Sunday, Saleh thanked Brennan for U.S. support of "Yemen's unity, security and stability," according to Saba.
