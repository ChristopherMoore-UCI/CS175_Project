-- Russian President Dmitry Medvedev called on the ruling United Russia party Saturday to endorse Prime Minister Vladimir Putin for president in 2012. Putin in turn suggested that Medvedev should take over the role of prime minister if the party wins parliamentary elections in December, in what would be a straight swap of roles. Putin said he was sure the United Russia party, whose election ticket will be headed by Medvedev, would win December's parliamentary elections. Medvedev, who said he accepted Putin's proposal that he stand for prime minister, said the government had succeeded in restoring a country that had been in "a deep decline, in a systemic crisis" a decade ago. For more than two years, Putin and Medvedev have repeatedly said they would decide together which of them would run for the Russian presidency in 2012, fanning the flames of intrigue.
