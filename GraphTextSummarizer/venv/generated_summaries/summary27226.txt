Trevor Muir (left), 23; Darcy Shepard, 18; Harriett Shepard, 94; and Dave Shepard, 74, are ready to jump. Two members of the family had jumped before -- including family matriarch Harriett. The oldest jumper was Shepard's 94-year-old great-grandmother, Harriett Shepard. Florida Skydiving says Harriett Shepard is the oldest person to jump at the center. Harriett Shepard jumped three years ago, at age 91, because she wanted to know what it felt like.
