The company claimed unique status among tour operators in the nation's capital by having the exclusive contract for sightseeing bus tours of Arlington National Cemetery. "This is a bittersweet time for the (National Park Service) and Tourmobile, as they have faithfully served the needs of millions of visitors for over 42 years," said Steve Whitesell, regional director of the park service's National Capital Region. Another thing that set Tourmobile apart from other tour operators was the type of buses it used -- more like trams that are common at theme parks. Starting Tuesday, wlth Tourmobile no longer running, there will be no bus tours for visitors at Arlington National Cemetery until a new contract is awarded through bidding that will be overseen by the National Park Service. Today is the final run for Tourmobile," said Bruce, a tour guide for Tourmobile Sightseeing.
