"Liquid water is a requirement for life as we know it, and a target for Mars exploration missions," lead author Javier Martin-Torres said in a statement. But scientists say evidence of water ice at the planet's poles and now more evidence toward the theory of widespread brines keeps them hoping they'll find evidence that life at least once existed there. It's not going to be enough to slake the thirst of the elusive Mars bunny, but scientists say new research seems to support the theory that what looks like a bone-dry red planet during the day could be dotted with tiny puddles of salty water at night. "Conditions near the surface of present-day Mars are hardly favorable for microbial life as we know it," he said, "but the possibility for liquid brines on Mars has wider implications for habitability and geological water-related processes. So if brines can exist there, that strengthens the case they could form and persist even longer at many other locations," possibly explaining channels seen on Mars that appear be formed by running water, he said.
