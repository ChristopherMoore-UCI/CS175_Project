Infuriated, Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, annexed the strategic Crimean Peninsula, where it has a key naval base. The comment sheds light, I think, on how Vladimir Putin sees the world outside the walls of the Kremlin. At the recent G20 summit in Brisbane, President Putin was cold-shouldered by his Western counterparts. But it may help explain why Russia is doing what it is doing, and why sanctions are not changing -- and may never change -- Kremlin policy. NATO expansion into former Eastern Bloc nations has eroded Russia's security.
