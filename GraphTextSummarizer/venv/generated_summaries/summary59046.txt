In Miami, only one semester of physical education is required for high school students, and middle school students can have a parent waive the regular class. While technology doesn't change the physical environment by adding trails or gyms, it can make a positive impact, says competition judge Joan Dorn, branch chief for physical activity and health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. " Another finalist, the Healthy Schools, Healthy Families' "Just Move" program in New York and New Jersey, added five-minute breaks into students' daily routine while addressing another obstacle in the fight to add physical activity in schools: how to avoid taking away classroom time. Nine regional finalists were announced Tuesday; each will receive $25,000 to invest in physical activity programs. "So we want to find the most effective ways that people are increasing physical activity for kids, and then help those ideas grow to scale so that they can help even more children."
