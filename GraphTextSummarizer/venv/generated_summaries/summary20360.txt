Located just off General Romulo Street it was formerly Marikina Shoe Expo, a mix of shoe outlets for nearby factories. -- Manila often gets a bad rap, derided as dirty, chaotic, and an incoherent mess of unfinished urban areas and slums. Heading back towards the central area of the city and Manila Bay, visit Cubao Expo. Those hankering for excellent western food and a glimpse of Manila's long-lunching business-types should head to Apartment 1B on Lafayette Square. The covered lanes are a hive of stalls and intriguing local life.
