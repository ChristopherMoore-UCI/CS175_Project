"New Zealand qualified for the World Cup, now we've won our first game at the Club World Cup so it has been a great year for New Zealand football," said Auckland City FC goalkeeper Jason Spoonley after his team beat Dubai's Al Ahli in their first round match, an amazing feat for a club that doesn't have a single professional player. On Wednesday night, TP Mazembe, a Congolese team hailing from the country's second city of Lubumbashi, and New Zealand's Auckland City FC will play a FIFA Club World Cup fifth place play-off in an unseasonably wet and no doubt half-empty stadium in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates. "It has been the dream of my career to play at the FIFA Club World Cup," said Mputu, who has begun to attract the attentions of English Premier League clubs. For Spoonley, who was in the All Whites' squad, both that qualification and the Club World Cup victory gives football in New Zealand, a country dominated by rugby, a huge lift back home. For winning the O-League, the Oceania Champions League, Auckland City FC received nothing.
