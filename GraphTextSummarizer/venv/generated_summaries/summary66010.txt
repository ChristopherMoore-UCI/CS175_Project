Numerous pet projects still found their way into appropriations bills despite the supposed moratorium on earmarks, the Pig Book's authors say -- and despite Congress certifying each appropriations bill as earmark-free. Well over a year after Congress voluntarily imposed a ban on pork barrel spending, the number and cost of earmarks have dropped dramatically, a report said Tuesday -- but the snouts are not out of the trough altogether. The report names Inouye; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada; Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi; and Senate appropriator Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, as among those critical of the continuation of the moratorium. It finds that the number of earmarks has decreased by 98.3% from 9,129 in fiscal year 2010, when the Pig Book was last produced, to just 152 in fiscal year 2012. "While the lower number and cost of earmarks are a vast improvement over prior years, transparency and accountability have regressed immeasurably."
