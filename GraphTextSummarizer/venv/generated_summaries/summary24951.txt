A group of tweens even pooled their money to trek from the Valley to Hollywood -- sans adults and sharing a digital camera -- to take pictures of Jackson's star on the Walk of Fame for a video they wanted to create.

Maria Pace, who is almost 20 years old, said she can remember how Jackson helped ease the path of her younger years.
