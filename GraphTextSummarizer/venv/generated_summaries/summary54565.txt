"We are in ongoing discussions with two potential providers with a view to having GLT installed for the start of the '13-14 season," EPL spokesman Dan Johnson told CNN.

UEFA, which runs European competitions such as the Champions League and the Europa League, is opposed to the use of technology, instead preferring to continue with the use of extra officials behind the goal. Goal-line technology (GLT) was used for the first time at the Club World Cup in Japan and the EPL plans to have it in place for the 2013-14 season. " However, the EPL's position on GLT is not mirrored throughout European football.
