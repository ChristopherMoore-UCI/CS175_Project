Thirty developed countries have lower infant mortality rates, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, all of them spending much less than we do on health care These include teen pregnancy prevention programs, such as the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy; family planning services (the Women, Infants and Children -- or WIC -- nutrition program, which provides federal grants to states, is one good example); Back-to-Sleep education campaigns that help reduce the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome; full coverage of prenatal care and child health; and cessation programs for pregnant women who use tobacco or other substances. It will take a village of support to lower infant mortality and improve health and development of our nation's children. Preventing infant mortality is not just about prenatal care. If a measure of a successful society is its ability to prevent infant deaths, then there is an ugly truth in the United States today that public health officials know but the public largely does not: Too many of our babies are dying, and they don't have to.
