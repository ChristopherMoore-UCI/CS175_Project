The eight indicted men include Uriel Sharef, former member of the central executive committee of Siemens AG; Herbert Steffen, former CEO of Siemens Argentina; and Andres Truppel, former CFO of Siemens Argentina. Also named in the indictment are Ulrich Bock, Stephan Signer and Eberhard Reichert, former senior executives of Siemens Business Services; and Carlos Sergi and Miguel Czysch, who were agents of Siemens in the alleged bribe scheme. According to the indictment, the Siemens executives paid millions in bribes in 1994 to secure a bid to create a national identity card system in Argentina. To top it off, once the project met its demise in 2001, Siemens filed an arbitration claim against Argentina claiming wrongful termination of the contract and seeking $500 million in lost profits. -- Eight former executives and agents of Siemens AG and its subsidiaries have been indicted in a bribery scheme alleging that they paid or promised Argentine officials $100 million to land a contract worth 10 times as much, the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday.
