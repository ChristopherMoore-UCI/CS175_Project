The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that the number of civilians fleeing the violence in Libya to Tunisia "has dropped significantly since Wednesday afternoon," with armed, pro-government forces manning the Libyan side. Like many Bangladeshi migrant workers, al Islam had borrowed some $4,000 to pay employment agencies to give him a job in Libya. "Tens of thousands of people from many different countries are fleeing Libya, and we commend the governments of Tunisia and Egypt for their response, even as they go through their own political transitions," Obama said. The conditions at the airport were dramatically better than the scene that awaited many migrants immediately after entering Tunisia from Libya. Many said that, as they sought to get out of Libya, they were stopped and searched by Libyan security forces who confiscated their cell phones and computers.
