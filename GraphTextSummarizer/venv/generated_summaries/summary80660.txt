2 children beheaded by militants, Afghan authorities say Reports surfaced Monday of Taliban militants beheading two children in Kandahar province, acts that the militant group has denied. Last month, a suicide car bombing on a coalition convoy in central Kabul killed at least 12 people, six of them American and six Afghan. The blast, which occurred near the U.S. Embassy on Tuesday afternoon, comes amid the Taliban's spring offensive against Afghan government and coalition targets. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement e-mailed to media that government judges are oppressing and mistreating people in several parts of the country. The fighting ended with all seven attackers dead, Afghan officials said.
