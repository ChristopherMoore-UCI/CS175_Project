The shooting took place about 23 miles north of downtown Mexico City at approximately 3 p.m. ET, an ICE official said. Gunmen opened fire on two U.S. immigration agents in Mexico on Tuesday, killing one and injuring the other, officials said. The two agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were attacked Tuesday afternoon while driving between Mexico City and Monterrey. "ICE is working with the U.S. State Department, Mexican authorities and other U.S. law enforcement partners to investigate the shooting," the agency said in a statement. According to ICE, the agency has about 30 officers assigned to its office in Mexico City.
