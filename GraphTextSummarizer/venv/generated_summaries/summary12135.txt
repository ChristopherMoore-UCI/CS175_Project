Even an attempt to swim the Channel -- and a failed attempt at that -- is incomparable to the sacrifices people make on a day-to-day basis for our country," said Daniel Decker, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who is studying at Oxford University on a Marshall Scholarship from the Navy. Erwin initiated the idea of the Channel swim as a fundraiser about six months ago and recruited Decker, Gardiner, Shipley and U.S. Naval Academy graduate Joseph Hess to the cause. "We got every layer of clothing we could on him, and we had to give him bear hugs to give him some body heat," said Gardiner, another graduate of the Naval Academy, who is studying at Queens University in Belfast, Ireland, on a Navy Marshall Scholarship. -- A small boatload of graduate students endured seasickness, hypothermia and huge swells in a 16-hour swim across the English Channel to raise money for veterans on the 65th anniversary of D-Day. " Yet the group, which consists of two Rhodes scholars and three Naval Academy graduates who will enter SEAL training after school, considers the mission a success, in terms of honoring veterans of the past and present.
