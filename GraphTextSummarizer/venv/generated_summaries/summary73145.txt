The alleged threat came to light in late November when, court documents say, a person contacted the FBI's New Orleans field office to say that Younis had described during a Facebook chat how he could build a pipe bomb and detonate it under a sewer in Georgetown, a neighborhood in Washington. -- A Virginia man who allegedly threatened during a Facebook chat to detonate explosives in the Washington area was arrested last week and is undergoing a mental evaluation, according to federal court documents that came to light Tuesday. The Younis case is the second this year involving alleged threats to Washington's Metro system. The FBI said Ahmed had conducted surveillance for undercover agents whom he believed to be al Qaeda co-conspirators. In October, authorities charged Farooque Ahmed, 34, a naturalized citizen and a native of Pakistan, with attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization after he allegedly assisted in planning an attack on Metro stations in the vicinity of the Pentagon.
