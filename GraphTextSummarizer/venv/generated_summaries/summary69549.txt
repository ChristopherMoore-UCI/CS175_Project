I hit decent shots in there and just got some of the worst lies." Players Championship leaderboard Woods had claimed before Quail Hollow that he had put his problem swing behind him and was slowly building back towards something approaching his best. The 36-year-old broke a 17-month drought in March with victory at Bay Hill but came to TPC Sawgrass -- where his only win was back in 2001 -- in poor form having missed the cut at Quail Hollow, only the eighth time that has happened in his career. The US PGA event, often referred to as the "fifth major," is worth a cool $9.5 million but Woods is unlikely to taste any of that bounty having already fallen nine shots off leaders Ian Poulter and Martin Laird. Laird,, a two-time winner on the PGA Tour whose last victory came at Bay Hill in 2011, completed a flawless round to be one shot clear of American Blake Adams. -- It was another bad day at the office for Tiger Woods as he shot a two-over-par 74 in his opening round at the Players Championship Thursday.
