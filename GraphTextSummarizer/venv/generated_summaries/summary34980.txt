Democrats are looking to turn up the heat on Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy as he heads into the final days of his runoff battle with Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu with two ethics complaints focused on his work at Louisiana State University. Documents published last week by a number of local Louisiana political blogs suggest Cassidy might have billed the school for more hours of work than he completed. Both a Louisiana citizen affiliated with the Louisiana Democratic Party and the American Democracy Legal Fund filed complaints with the Office of Congressional Ethics on Wednesday alleging that Cassidy's work for the university violates multiple ethics rules and guidelines and calling for an investigation. Landrieu's campaign has vehemently denied that it had anything to do with the documents coming to light, but Bob Mann, an LSU professor and veteran Louisiana political reporter, told CNN on Tuesday he had heard from multiple news outlets in Louisiana that Democratic operatives had been shopping the documents around for at least a month, and found no takers. The complaint against Cassidy also argues that his work for LSU did not meet the requirements to be considered teaching work, and thus wasn't exempt from the ban.
