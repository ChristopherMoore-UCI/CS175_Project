Several inmates were exercising in an outside area under the supervision of prison officers and private security guards when the two accomplices used vehicles to breach a gate and barbed wire barriers around the prison grounds. The border guards and French police are also involved in the hunt for the four men, police said. The two prisoners who escaped from Orbe prison Thursday evening were named by the Vaud canton's police department as serial criminal Adrian Albrecht, 53, and Milan Poparic, 34, a Bosnian national. Police patrols, canine teams and security officers are combing the area for clues to their whereabouts. They brought two ladders to help Poparic and Albrecht escape over the barbed-wire of the prison yard, police said.
