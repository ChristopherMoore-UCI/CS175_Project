In fact, Pew's study differentiated between tablets and e-readers and found that another 5% of Americans currently own an e-reader. It's true that some e-readers have some functionality that's also seen in tablets (especially the Barnes & Noble Nook Color, which can be hacked into an inexpensive Android tablet). According to Rebtel, tablet ownership figures did vary by nation of origin: "French-Americans claim the highest percentage of tablet owners (17%), followed by Mexican-Americans (15%), Nigerian-Americans, and Ghana-Americans at 14% respectively -- rounded out by Ethiopian-Americans at eight percent and Cuban-Americans at seven percent. Still, Rebtel's research begs the question: If immigrants are more likely than the U.S. population at large to buy tablets, why might that be? -- Are immigrants to the U.S. more likely than the general American population to adopt tablet computers?
