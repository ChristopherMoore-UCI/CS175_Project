Economic liberty and social justice and civil rights -- we cannot have one without the others. It was their deaths, along with hundreds of actions by courageous civil rights workers during the Freedom Summer of 1964, that mobilized the Congress to end the filibuster and approve the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and gave much needed momentum to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Throughout my years in politics and public service, I have carried with me one of the sayings of Fannie Lou Hamer. The three youths were civil rights workers in Mississippi who had taken their summer to help eligible citizens to register to vote, a right that state and so many others down South had denied for more than one hundred years. If it weren't for events like Freedom Summer and for the thousands of people who participated in that and so many other events, I wouldn't be here.
