-- A new type of walk-through security machine will debut at several U.S. airports in the coming days as the Transportation Security Administration tries out the latest in body scanning technology. In a written statement issued Thursday, Barry Steinhardt of the ACLU said the technology can pick up graphic body images and even medical details like whether a passenger has a colostomy bag. It's called "millimeter-wave passenger imaging technology," and it produces a more detailed picture than the metal detectors in use now at airports to screen for weapons and explosives.. Steinhardt called the screening an "assault on the essential dignity of passengers that citizens in a free nation should not have to tolerate. Passengers who are asked to undergo a second screening can choose a pat-down search or the millimeter-wave test.
