The opinion, written by Judge Jacqueline Shogan, acknowledges that there "has been some recent tendency to permit publicity (of) juvenile court proceedings on the theory that this will act as a curb to juvenile delinquency." But the court also expressed concerns that the harm caused by publicizing juvenile proceedings "may be great." The defense then must present a sufficient case to move a case to juvenile court. -- A Pennsylvania court has ordered that the juvenile trial of Jordan Brown -- a boy accused of killing his father's pregnant girlfriend three years ago -- be closed, despite a push by several newspapers to allow public access. At the time, Brown was thought to be the youngest person facing a life sentence without the possibility of parole, according to an Amnesty International statement.
