In the Europa League draw English Premier League team Liverpool were drawn against Portuguese club Benfica. Josep Guardiola's reigning champions Barca will face English Premier League side Arsenal in the quarterfinals -- a repeat of the 2006 final which the Spanish club won 2-1. Juventus' conquerors Fulham were drawn against German champions Wolfsburg while Hamburg pulled Belgian side Standard Liege. If Liverpool get past Benfica they will face one of the Spanish teams in the semifinal, meaning either an emotional return for striker Fernando Torres to former club Atletico, or for manager Rafael Benitez to the team he used to coach, Valencia. There is an all-Spanish tie in the last eight after Atletico Madrid and Valencia were drawn against each other.
