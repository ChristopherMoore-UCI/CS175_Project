Iran and Israel have been engaging in an increasingly heated war of words about the possibility of Israel striking Iranian nuclear facilities. "Samsung Electronics is aware of a recent news report in Iranian media regarding an advertisement aired by HOT cable network of Israel," Samsung said in a statement. -- Senior Iranian lawmakers are considering a boycott of Samsung, the South Korean electronics and appliance manufacturer, because of a controversial Israeli ad that pokes fun at the nuclear crisis, state-run Press TV of Iran said Friday. Press TV said the commercial "implies that Israel is powerful enough to easily destroy Iran's nuclear facilities or assassinate the country's nuclear scientists." The spot plays off the widely held belief that Israel is behind a series of recent explosions and assassinations connected with Iran's nuclear program.
