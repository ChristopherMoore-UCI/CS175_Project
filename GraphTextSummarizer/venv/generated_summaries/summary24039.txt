It was clear that Dr. Laura had a beef of her own when it comes to black folks being too sensitive about matters of race, and that's why she tried to use the example of black comedians using the N-word to buttress her position that the woman should really pipe down and not be so sensitive about such issues. Dr. Laura also would fail at political analysis in her assertion that a lot of black folks voted for President Obama because he's half-black. First, Dr. Laura needs to step back and realize that yes, black comedians use the N-word onstage, and it is something that I have protested and called for all African-Americans to stop using. No child wants to enter into a verbal battle with his or her mother or father who may hold racist views, or willingly accept racial stereotypes. I fundamentally believe we can get people to see their racial bigotry or insensitive views and offer them a pathway towards healing, but that can only happen when we're willing to challenge one another -- friend or foe -- and look into the mirror and confront our own deeply embedded views on race.
