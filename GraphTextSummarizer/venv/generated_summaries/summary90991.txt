As Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen argued in 2012, "Ransom payments lead to future kidnappings, and future kidnappings lead to additional ransom payments. ISIS' rationale seems similar to other terror groups: Kidnappings help raise money and, if ransoms aren't paid, make a point, such as the groups are not to be messed with and even civilians are in danger. But just as kidnappings are the norm for such groups, so is asking for ransom. That ISIS wants ransom isn't unexpected. The U.S. Treasury Department estimated in 2012 that al Qaeda and its affiliates (which don't include ISIS, though the terror groups have similarities) compiled $120 million from ransoms over the previous eight years.
