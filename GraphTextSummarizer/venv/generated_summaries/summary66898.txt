The victims in the killings, which happened in northern Mexico, were migrants from Central and South America who were on their journey north. From Guatemala he crossed into Mexico and made it with a large group of migrants to the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas. The migrants were taken to a house, where they were tied up in groups of four, Lala said. Mexican officials confirmed Wednesday that a second person survived the attack but authorities said they would not reveal the second survivor's identity for safety reasons. In an interview with Ecuadorean state television, the survivor, identified as Luis Freddy Lala, spoke about the harrowing ordeal.
