Jun Lin, 33, was attending Concordia University in Montreal, said Montreal police Commander Ian Lafreniere. Magnotta, who was born as Eric Clinton Newman and also uses the alias Vladimir Romanov, fled by plane from Montreal to Europe, Lafreniere said. Magnotta knew Lin, Lafreniere said, but would not say with certainty what their relationship was or whether it was sexual in nature. Normally, the name of a victim would not be released in a case like this but Lafreniere said police identified Lin to put the families of other missing persons at ease. The much-talked-about killing was the worst police officers in Montreal have seen in decades, Lafreniere said.
