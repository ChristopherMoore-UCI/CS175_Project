Ahmad admitted to communicating with someone in Pakistan named Talha Saeed -- Saeed's son -- who asked Ahmad to make the video. At sentencing, prosecutors said Ahmad conspired to recruit others and to raise money for Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, also know as LeT. The government said Ahmad "expressed his intention to return to Pakistan to complete the LeT commando training course and be launched on a martyrdom mission." The United States labeled Lashkar-e-Tayyiba a "foreign terrorist organization" in December 2001, and under pressure from Washington, Pakistan banned the group in 2002. "Mr. Ahmad directly supported the mission of a designated terrorist organization through his creation of online propaganda, fundraising and recruitment efforts," said FBI Assistant Director James McJunkin, who heads the Washington, D.C., field office. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which means army of the pure, is the military wing of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a radical Muslim organization that aims to bring about Islamist rule in parts of India and Pakistan.
