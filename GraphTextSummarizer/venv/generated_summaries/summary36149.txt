"We hope that Penn State officials will stop patting themselves on the back and start instituting real reforms to make the campus safer for students," said Clohessy, whose group includes members who were allegedly molested by religious figures of all denominations. "For years now, Penn State enthusiasts have repeatedly reassured everyone who'd listen that the university's problematic culture about sex crimes had been 'reformed," Clohessy said. Penn State University President Eric Barron said in a separate statement Wednesday that the university will work with Kappa Delta Rho's national headquarters to determine whether the fraternity should be reinstated. In 2012, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was convicted on 45 counts of sexually molesting boys and sentenced to a  30- to 60-year prison term. The university is also considering whether fraternities will continue at Penn State, Barron said.
