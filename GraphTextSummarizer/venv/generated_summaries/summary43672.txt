Russia denies involvement, with Russian President Vladimir Putin saying Ukraine's military operation against the rebels is to blame for the tragedy. -- Outside the Dutch Embassy in Moscow, people have left flowers and cuddly toys at a makeshift memorial for the lives lost in a conflict-scarred corner of eastern Ukraine. With rebels in control of the crash area, and reports of bodies and wreckage being tampered with, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told reporters he had a "very intense" conversation with Putin on Saturday. The messages give a sense that the people who have left them do feel that Russia has an element of responsibility in what is playing out in eastern Ukraine. Rutte said he told Putin "the opportunity expires to show the world that he is serious about helping." The tributes at the Dutch Embassy in Moscow include a hand-drawn picture of a plane broken in midair with the caption "children should not die," in a child's handwriting.
