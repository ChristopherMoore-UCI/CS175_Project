-- NBA star LeBron James has become a minority shareholder in English soccer team Liverpool after penning a representation deal with the club's owners. James, who plays for the Miami Heat, has partnered his own sports marketing firm, LRMR Branding & Marketing, with Fenway Sports Management (FSM) to represent him exclusively worldwide, Liverpool's official website confirmed. I see myself trying to do the same things they have." Tom Werner, chairman of FSG and Liverpool, told the Wall Street Journal: "We're not interested in talent or athlete representation but we think he is one of the most remarkable athletes of his time. According to LRMR chief executive Maverick Carter, the idea is to build James' worldwide portfolio by acquiring equity in global firms. FSM is in the portfolio of companies owned by Fenway Sports Group, who own the Anfield club, and as part of the deal with James the 26-year-old has received a stake in the Premier League outfit.
