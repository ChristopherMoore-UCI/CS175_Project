Chelsea Clinton: We can make a difference Good works and decent lodging The Sierra Club offers volunteer trips year-round at some of the country's top tourist destinations. Pauline Frommer, co-host of the nationally syndicated radio program "The Travel Show" and speaker at this year's New York Times Travel Show, says volunteer vacations offer children what they often don't get enough of in school. "As volunteers, children can get down on the ground," says Frommer, who recommends Global Volunteers trips. Children have raised money by holding bake sales, asking family and friends for donations and conducting tag sales. Children as young as 12 can help out by scooping ice cream and serving meals, and children who love performing can even be part of the evening entertainment.
