As in games past, Nathan is a treasure hunter who follows clues to find lost riches in far-off lands and gets help from other characters in his missions. While developers wouldn't say if this was the final act for Nathan Drake, there are moments in the game that answer lingering questions from previous games. The latest in the franchise from Naughty Dog, "Uncharted 3" returns to follow hero Nathan Drake on yet another historical adventure that promises fortune and glory but invariably involves a lot of danger. The game's storyline follows the path of "Seven Pillars of Wisdom," the T.E. Lawrence book that inspired the epic movie "Lawrence of Arabia." Amy Henning, the writer for the "Uncharted" series, pulls elements from Lawrence's book and weaves them into a stunning narrative about Nathan's search for a lost city called Iram of the Pillars.
