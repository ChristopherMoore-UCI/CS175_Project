Senior Palestinian negotiator Nabil Sha'ath told CNN that the requests were part of an ongoing strategy to achieve statehood outside the framework of talks with Israel. " American sponsored talks between the two sides fell apart in September when Israel resumed settlement construction the in the occupied West Bank after a ten-month freeze. Instead the United States is now focusing its efforts on separate talks with each side in hopes of developing a framework agreement on core issues of the conflict that could lead to the resumption of peace talks. Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay have all moved to recognize an independent Palestinian state in recent weeks, and Palestinian Authority officials are hoping to convince more countries to follow suit. "The fundamental cause of the of breakdown in talks was because of the consistent refusal of Palestinians to engage with Israel.
