Wi-Fi users have been warned to protect their computers against potential hackers at Wi-Fi hotspots. The original survey conducted by AirTight Networks found the most common name for rogue Wi-Fi points was "Free Public Wi-Fi." "You'd have no idea if somebody sitting down to a laptop was a casual traveler trying to collect their email from an open port, or actually they were setting up a rogue access point," Remnant said. The rapid spread of Wi-Fi networks to cafes, hotels and even entire cities is providing hackers with more opportunities to ply their trade. Security experts warn that hackers may be masquerading as free public Wi-Fi providers to gain access to the laptops of unsuspecting travelers. "We certainly haven't seen any kind of sudden epidemic of hackers in open hotspots or anything like that," said the group's marketing director, Kelly Davis-Felner.
