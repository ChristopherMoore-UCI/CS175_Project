Now one company believes they have the solution that will both save space and keep city living cost effective -- shipping containers. The country's low interest and mortgage rates have driven sales of affordable middle income housing in recent years. "I started the business because I thought there was a need for affordable housing and a cleaner and greener option," Van Tongeren said. According to Jamie Van Tongeren, the company's CEO, the concept provides a clean and productive way to provide affordable urban housing. Windows are cut out, containers are welded together and stacked on top of each other to provide multiple floors and rooms while insulation panels are installed to contain heat.
