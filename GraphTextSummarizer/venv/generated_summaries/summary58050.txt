Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison said Saturday investigators determined that the Vortex ride had been tampered with and "critical safety devices were compromised. Dolores Quesenberry a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Labor, said operators are supposed to perform system checks three times a day during the fair and record the results in a logbook provided by the state. CNN affiliate WRAL reported that three of those hurt were still hospitalized at WakeMed Hospital in Raleigh as of Sunday. Wake County District Attorney Colon Wiloughby said Monday the investigation is ongoing and that it was unknown at this point if and when anyone else would be facing charges. According to the sheriff's office, Tutterrow is an independent ride contractor for a company that only had one ride at the fair: the Vortex.
