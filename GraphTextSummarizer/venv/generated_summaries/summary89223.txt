A big worry is that Syria's troubles will reopen the wounds of Lebanon's civil war, which raged from 1975-1990, potentially pitting the Sunni community, which tends to back the Syrian rebels, against Hezbollah, a powerful pro-Assad Shiite militia. In April, the Lebanese army announced it had intercepted a cargo ship bound for Tripoli -- the northern epicenter of support for Syrian rebels in Lebanon -- that was filled with weapons it believes were meant to be delivered to rebel forces in Syria. Tensions have risen in recent months as thousands of fighters from the militant Shiite group Hezbollah have poured across the border into Syria and thousands of Syrian refugees have fled into Lebanon. This comes as evidence emerges that Syrian rebel groups are receiving small arms smuggled from Lebanon and Turkey. While that has helped turn the tide for Hezbollah's patrons, it has also angered many in Lebanon.
