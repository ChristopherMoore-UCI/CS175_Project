-- As we gear up for the 71st annual Golden Globe Awards on Sunday, allow us to turn the focus to the real winners of the show: besties Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. In honor of the BFFs whose friendship and careers have been pretty impressive, here are five trivia facts about Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, and the duo that is TAmy (as we like to call them, because that's what you do with beloved Hollywood couples). In addition to being one of the stars of the late-night comedy show, the show's creator and producer Lorne Michaels hired Fey as a writer in 1995, and she would later become the show's first female head writer. Neither has won in those years, though Fey won in 2008 before Poehler was nominated. The aspiring actresses met in a 1993 improv class where Poehler was reportedly impressed by Fey's joke about Catherine the Great.
