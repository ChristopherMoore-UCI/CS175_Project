Within minutes of the parliamentary Culture Media and Sport Committee publishing its judgment about Rupert Murdoch's behavior and deeper condemnation of the culture at News Corporation the British regulator of television and broadcasting, Ofcom, reiterated in response to a query that it is investigating his status as a leading shareholder in BSkyB. The committee's words -- made publicly and with the protection of parliamentary privilege from legal action by Murdoch or News Corp -- also take Murdoch back decades to one of the greatest rivalries of his career with the late Czech-born publishing magnate Robert Maxwell. This choice of wording is powerful for two reasons: One immediately damaging to News Corporation and its ambitions to take full control of the prize asset of British Sky Broadcasting, and the second personally damaging for the 81-year-old Murdoch. News Corp and Murdoch still have to face months of further revelations about telephone hacking at the News of the World, over-close relationships with police and civil servants and his empire and the embarrassing exposure of just how close relationships were between News and politicians of all major parties in Britain. Murdoch, who values his personal reputation for probity as much as he honors the memory of his father Keith as a campaigning journalist and newspaper proprietor, will not miss the similarity of the language used by the select committee in Tuesday's judgment and that used by then Board of Trade's damning judgment in 1971 that Maxwell was "unfit" to run a public company. Labour and Liberal Democrat members of the select committee forced the "not fit" judgment through the minority of their Conservative committee colleagues though the other stinging criticisms of News Corporation were unanimous including that it had been misled by News Corp executives.
