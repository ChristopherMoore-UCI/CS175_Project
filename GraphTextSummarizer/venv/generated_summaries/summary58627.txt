Mickey, 22, and Balajthy, 23, met in middle school band class. The couple started a long-distance relationship when Mickey went to Lock Haven University in their home state of Pennsylvania and Balajthy attended the University of Maryland. " Once Mickey enrolled in nursing school at Marymount University in Arlington, Virginia, she couldn't ignore their weight any longer, especially after learning about diabetes, heart disease and obesity the first semester. I wasn't driven to lose weight and didn't think I could," Balajthy said. " After eight months, Mickey and Balajthy are down to 145 and 195 pounds, respectively.
