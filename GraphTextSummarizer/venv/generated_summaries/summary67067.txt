-- Former "Desperate Housewives" actress Nicollette Sheridan returns to the stand Friday in her legal battle with show creator Marc Cherry and ABC over the TV killing of a character she played on the hit comedy series for five seasons. Cherry's lawyers contend show writers began planning Britt's demise in May 2008, four months before the alleged battery, as a way to shock viewers and raise ratings. Her wrongful termination lawsuit contends Cherry killed off Edie Britt, the sassy, blond woman Sheridan played, in retaliation for her complaints about being hit. In his opening statement Wednesday, Mark Baute, Sheridan's lawyer, challenged the authenticity of those writers notes, accusing Cherry's defense of an "effort to backdate the decision" with a fake story that the character's death was planned months before the hitting incident. Five months and 11 episodes later, Cherry informed Sheridan that Britt would die during a show taping the next day, ending her five-year run on "Desperate Housewives.
