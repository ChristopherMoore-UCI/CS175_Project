"They knew that nobody lives on that street, and (the car) just looked odd sitting there," Sheriff Butch Burgess told CNN affiliate WATE. "We are continuing to identify the victims as it is still an active crime scene," the spokeswoman told CNN on Thursday evening. -- A passer-by found four people shot dead Thursday in a car parked alongside a rural Tennessee road, a mystery that has left authorities scrambling to identify the victims and hunt for whomever is responsible. According to the Renegade Mountain Community Club, the area around where the bodies were found had been a retirement resort, a ski resort and a golf club, though it's now mostly home to a small number of families. The bystander quickly called the Cumberland County Sheriff's Department, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Kristin Helm said.
