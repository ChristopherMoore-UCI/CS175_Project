My wife and I then filled the surprisingly roomy trunk with our luggage and various gifts (the weekend being the occasion of my father-in-law's 70th birthday) and prepared for our journey to the Staffordshire moorlands in central England.

Muscular sports cars aren't common sights on my street (someone once parked a Porsche Cayenne Turbo here but he got a dirty look for it). This omnipresent reminder of speed is good news for my (unblemished) driving licence as it is horribly easily to drive way too fast in the M6. The aggressive front air intakes, 19" alloy wheels and carbon fiber roof mean that this isn't any ordinary 6-Series Taking delivery of the M6 at my home in Brighton, southern England, I felt the car looked ever so slightly out of place.
