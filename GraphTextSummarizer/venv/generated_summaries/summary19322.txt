One answer may be that the kinds of sanitation facilities offered to developing country households are not terribly appealing. A small but dedicated community that includes governments, NGOs, donors and research institutions is working to expand access to basic sanitation services in developing countries. In many developing countries, mobile phone penetration is expanding at a faster rate than sanitation. This shift toward aspirational marketing is one important step toward generating greater household demand for improved sanitation services. When adopted on a wide scale and maintained properly, these solutions can dramatically improve household and environmental sanitation.
