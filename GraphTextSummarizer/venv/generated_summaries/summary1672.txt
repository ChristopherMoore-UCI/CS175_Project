But Vine celebrities like Smiles, KC James and Curtis LePore have millions of followers. They are not household names like Robin Thicke, Bruno Mars or Beyonce (though many real stars do have large Vine audiences). The result was a "Super Vine," when thousands of fans show up in person to meet a Vine star and then film the mass gathering to post on Vine. When Smiles arranged to meet her then boyfriend, fellow Vine star Curtis Lepore, in real life for the first time in New York City, they invited all their followers. Vine itself is not profitable, but posters with big followings can make money by plugging brands on their own channels or appearing in Vines for companies.
