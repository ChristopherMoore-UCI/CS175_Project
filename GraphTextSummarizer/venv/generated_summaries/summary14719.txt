Mother of pregnant woman on life support: Change the law Last month, Erick Munoz discussed with CNN affiliate WFAA his wife's wishes and how their shared occupation had helped shape her views. "We have recently received Marlise Munoz's medical records, and can now confirm that Mrs. Munoz is clinically brain dead, and therefore deceased under Texas law," attorneys Jessica Janicek and Heather King said in an e-mail. Erick Munoz filed an emergency motion as well as a complaint against John Peter Smith Hospital, both with the same goal: to have the hospital disconnect the machines so that her family can take her body and give her a proper burial. Soon after that, she was taken to John Peter Smith Hospital, where Erick Munoz says he was told that his wife "was for all purposes brain dead." If they're relying on that provision, I think Texas law in that respect does not compel the provision of life-sustaining treatment.
