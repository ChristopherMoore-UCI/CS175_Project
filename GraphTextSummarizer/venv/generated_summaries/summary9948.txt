"On the return, as the match went on, I think it was that Kei started to serve a bit better, which made it more difficult." Nishikori became the first man to break Federer in this year's tournament, perhaps not a surprise since he is second only to Ferrer in percentage of return games won in 2014. He didn't have to save any match points against the Swiss great -- the Japanese No. 1 fended off four of them to oust Ferrer, last year's finalist in Miami -- but Nishikori rallied to beat Federer 36 75 64 under the lights on Stadium court Wednesday. The 21st-ranked Nishikori has now eliminated Federer twice in a row after upsetting the 32-year-old at the Madrid Masters in three sets last year. Still, Federer led by a break twice in the second set, only to see Nishikori -- whose career has been interrupted by arm and abdominal injuries -- break immediately back. He reached the final at the Indian Wells Masters earlier this month and there was a real possibility of the 17-time grand slam champion making the Indian Wells and Miami finals in the same year for the first time since claiming both titles in 2006.
