Juan Williams, one of the moderators, was asking Mitt Romney about his immigration policies when he was interrupted in mid-question. It was especially annoying because the live audience was booing their disapproval at inappropriate times. Measuring presidential debates by audience noise-meters with a needle that moves up and down. And I've seen debate judges (people who should know better) in intercollegiate tournaments have their decisions influenced by a noisy audience â€” even judges trained to be impartial and objective. Then the live audience ganged up on Ron Paul.
