-- President Barack Obama and visiting Russian President Dmitry Medvedev pledged cooperation on stronger economic ties Thursday, announcing a deal for Russia to again accept U.S. poultry exports and touting U.S. support for Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization. He noted agreements announced Thursday on energy technology trade and the readmittance of U.S. poultry exports to Russia as signals of Russia's serious intent to become a WTO member. Russia was a major importer of U.S. poultry but banned the product earlier this year in a dispute over the safety of a chlorine rinse used in the United States. However, Medvedev said Russia backed the U.S. goal of a stable Afghanistan, saying that helping to build a secure government and economic growth there would prevent the kind of military quagmire the Soviets experienced in the 1980s. However, Obama offered no estimate of when the country would join the 153-nation group that sets rules for international trade.
