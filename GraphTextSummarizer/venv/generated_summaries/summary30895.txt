The opening goal came in the 10th minute when Bendtner was on hand to fire into an empty net after goalkeeper Helton had rushed out to block the on-coming Andrey Arshavin. The Serie A side took a 28th-minute lead when Juan Vargas netted from a tight angle after a week clearance from goalkeeper Jorg Butt. Bayern made the scores level 3-3 on aggregate on the hour mark when Mark Van Bommel drilled home a low shot after good work from Frank Ribery. Their qualification was sealed with a stunning strike from Dutchman Arjen Robben, who skipped past a couple of challenges before firing home a thunderbolt shot from a full 30 meters out. Then, with their Portuguese opponents chasing the game, Arshavin collected the ball on the break after a Porto corner was cleared.
