The opposition said 56 people died Wednesday across Syria, including 29 in the rebel stronghold of Idlib, where activists reported Syrian military forces had seized control following a four-day onslaught. Throngs of security forces Wednesday infiltrated villages in the port city of Latakia, searching for activists and setting homes afire amid sporadic gunfire, according to the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, or LCC, an opposition activist network. The civilian death toll mounted in Syria Wednesday as the U.N.-Arab League envoy for the country, Kofi Annan, considered a response from Syrian authorities to proposals laid out in weekend meetings, officials said. Syrian state-run media Wednesday said security forces "have brought safety and security back to the city" of Idlib, "which witnessed terrorist acts by armed gangs." Al-Assad's regime routinely insists "armed terrorist groups" are behind the bloodshed in Syria. Both opposition groups and the government reported a massacre in Homs, but opposition activists accused regime forces of carrying out the attacks.
