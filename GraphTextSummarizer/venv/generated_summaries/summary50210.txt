StubHub is expecting big numbers in 2015 from a different crop of touring (or rumored-to-be-touring) artists: Adele, Coldplay, Foo Fighters, Taylor Swift and U2. "Traditionally, we think of pop music as the one that is going to drive the most interest in ticket sales â€” your Beyonce, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga.... Bryan, the reigning CMA Entertainer of the Year, had 1.7 million fans attend his shows this year â€” numbers combined from three different trips: the That's My Kind of Night Tour, the Farm Tour, and the Spring Break 2014 Tour. As for Bryan's spot on StubHub's list, Billboard begs to differ: It places his 2014 touring at Number One among country treks but 14th overall. "I don't think we realize how huge country music is," StubHub executive Glen Lehrman tells Ad Week.
