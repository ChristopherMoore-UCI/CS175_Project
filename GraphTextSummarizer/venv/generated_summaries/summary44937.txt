Three other shooting victims who were flown to MedStar Washington Hospital Center are expected to survive, hospital Chief Medical Officer Dr. Janis Orlowski told reporters about three hours after the attack began around 8:20 a.m. Monday. " Mabus said Monday that it could take 24 to 35 hours for Navy officials to account for everyone. -- All 12 of the victims killed in Monday's shooting rampage at Washington's Navy Yard were contractors or civilians, authorities said Monday night. Dr. Orlowski gave more details later in the day about her patients, including a Washington Metropolitan police officer who was in surgery Monday afternoon "for gunshot wounds that "involve bones and blood vessels of lower legs." "He was most concerned about being able to talk to his mother and wanted to make sure he was able to speak to her before he went into surgery," Orlowski said.
