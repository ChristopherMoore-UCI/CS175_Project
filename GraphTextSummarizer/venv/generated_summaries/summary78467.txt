" Heidfeld has a long association with Mercedes, which took over the world champion Brawn team at the end of last year. Since then he has competed in 167 grands prix, achieving 12 podium finishes, but was left without a team when BMW pulled out of F1 last year. He was supported by the German manufacturer as a junior driver, and then was test driver for McLaren Mercedes for the 1998 and 1999 seasons before earning his first race drive with Prost in 2000. "I am very pleased to be joining the Mercedes GP Petronas Formula One team," the German told official Web site www.mercedes-gp.com on Thursday. Nick Heidfeld has joined Mercedes as back-up for Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg to complete the new team's line-up for the 2010 Formula One season.
