But now, Bassem Youssef -- Egypt's most famous satirist known as his country's Jon Stewart -- has the public profile of a politician in retirement, leading study groups at the Harvard Kennedy School. "It's talking about political satire, humor, how (people can) be all for a certain program or a joke, but when the joke turns on them, they kind of like turn on you," he said. " His incredible story from cardiac surgeon to satirist to political target is the subject of a documentary currently in production, directed by a senior producer for Stewart, with whom Youssef developed a close relationship. " It may not often reach a Western audience, but Youssef said that YouTube is filled with Arabs making fun of ISIS -- for example, setting the group's favorite "anthems" to images of belly dancers. " He is also writing a script for a movie comedy, and building a platform to identify talent in the Arab world and allow more people to experience the extreme and unexpected success he did.
