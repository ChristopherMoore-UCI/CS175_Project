EnviroMission says its tower will stand for 80 years, far longer than the average life for a field of solar panels, which some would see as an alternative with a smaller upfront cost. The technology works like this: Unlike normal solar photovoltaic panels that convert the sun's light into energy, the EnviroMission tower would create solar-thermal power, from both the sun and the wind. As the hot air moves into the tower, it would turn 32 turbines, spinning them fast enough to create mechanical energy, which generators convert to electricity. A small tower began operation in China last year, according to the Xinhua news agency. According to EnviroMission, the amount of carbon pollution created by the manufacture and shipment of the cement and other materials needed to build the facility will be offset after 2Â½ years of operation.
