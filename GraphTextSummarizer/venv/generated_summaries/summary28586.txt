CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said that al Qaeda "actually announced a year ago that they were going to do this campaign of releasing prisoners from prison and they conducted something like seven prison assaults, a couple of which have been quite successful." Interpol last month issued a global security alert, asking member nations to help determine whether the recent escapes are linked. Recent prison breaks have been cited by analysts as one of several reasons the United States heightened its security and closed various embassies last month. It cited "suspected al Qaeda involvement in several of the breakouts which led to the escape of hundreds of terrorists and other criminals." Prison breaks occurred last July in Pakistan, Iraq and Libya, and have been a known strategy of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri. -- At least 49 inmates broke out of a prison in Tunisia on Sunday night, the country's state-run Tunis Afrique Presse reported.
