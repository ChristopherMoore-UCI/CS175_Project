Former FIFA security chief Chris Eaton told CNN World Sport that investigations need to be more proactive. It is estimated that â‚¬16 million ($21.7m) had been bet on matches by criminals, yielding an â‚¬8 million ($10.8m) profit, with the highest single bribe of â‚¬140,000 paid in Austria. In 2010, UEFA banned Debrecen goalkeeper Vukasin Poleksic for two years for failing to report that he was approached to fix matches by a betting syndicate before a match against Fiorentina in October the previous year. "The support of law enforcement bodies, legal investigations, and ultimately tougher sanctions are required, as currently there is low risk and high gain potential for the fixers." FIFA already works closely with Interpol, the worldwide police agency, while its European Union counterpart said there had so far been 50 people arrested in 15 countries in an investigation involving 425 match officials, club officials, players and criminals. Reports have claimed that one of the European matches in question was a UEFA Champions League match between English club Liverpool and Hungary's Debrecen.
