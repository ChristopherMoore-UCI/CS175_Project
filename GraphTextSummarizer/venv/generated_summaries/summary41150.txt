Jeff Barrows, the director of the association, said by e-mail there are four centers that house young victims of sex trafficking, with one more building being renovated. Years later, after being rescued and going through a "restoration" program, she met Grant, a popular Christian music singer who grew up near Seattle, Washington, never giving thought to sex trafficking. Write your congressmen to tell them to do more for the victims of sex trafficking, Grant said. "I personally believe that the U.S. is doing very well in prosecution, but could make some major strides in protection and prevention, especially when it comes to domestic minor sex trafficking victims," he said in the e-mail. Barrows said his group will make sure shelters follow "established standards of care" and said Grant has been instrumental in helping "She has shown leadership by realizing the need to develop best practices in this field so that efforts to help these victims are not haphazard or at worst, cause further harm to them," he said in the e-mail.
