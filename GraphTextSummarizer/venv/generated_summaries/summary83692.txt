Officials say Moreno Flores, who was considered one of Guzman's lieutenants, did business with drug traffickers from Costa Rica and Guatemala from his base of operations in Chilpancingo, capital of the state of Guerrero. Mexican officials say Jose Carlos Moreno Flores was a major drug lord in charge of trafficking and operations for a large Mexican cartel in the coastal state of Guerrero, where the beach resort of Acapulco is located. Violence in Chilpancingo had recently increased because a group of Sinaloa Cartel operatives led by Moreno Flores have been fighting a turf war with a rival group known as "Los Rojos" (The Red Ones). "The Fever" was also allegedly in charge of the cultivation, harvesting and distribution of marijuana in the fertile mountain region of Guerrero state. According to Mexico's Ministry of Defense, Moreno Flores was caught Sunday in Mexico City's Tlalpan District.
