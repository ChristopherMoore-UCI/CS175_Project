-- San Antonio Spurs snatched Game One of the NBA Finals after a "crazy play" from Tony Parker gave Gregg Popovich's team a 92-88 win away to defending champion Miami Heat. The Frenchman's off-balance jump shot beat the shot clock by one-hundredth of a second to steal home court advantage from Miami. It was the Heat's LeBron James who tried, in vain, to stop Parker's buzzer-beater -- which landed with just 5.2 seconds left in regulation. Game Three, set to take place on Tuesday, will see the series switch to the AT & T Center in San Antonio. I thought I lost the ball three or four times," Parker told reporters after finishing with a game-high 21 points at the American Airlines arena.
