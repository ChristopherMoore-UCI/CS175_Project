Doguroo, a doggie day care and grooming center, sponsored several Santa photo sessions in front of a huge sparkling tree at Central Park in Atlanta's Atlantic Station's this December. The Humane Society of New York held a Toys for Dogs event this year, where pets could get their photo taken with Santa in exchange for donated toys for homeless dogs. A $5 donation bought a framed digital photo of the owner's choice with as many critters that can squeeze into Santa's lap or on his bench. FurKids, a no-kill animal rescue organization, provides a Santa and photographers at PetSmart stores around Atlanta. Santa "Mike" has volunteered his lap every December for a half a dozen years to raise money for FurKids so the charity can save abandoned cats and dogs and get them adopted.
