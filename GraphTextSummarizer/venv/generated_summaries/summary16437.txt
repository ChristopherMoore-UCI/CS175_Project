In November, another event by the Muslim group -- held at the Chessington World of Adventures, Legoland's sister park about 45 minutes away -- went off without threats or complaints, park spokeswoman Edwards told CNN. Those who had booked rooms were given refunds, but the move didn't satisfy Sarah Shenton Plews, who posted on the park's Facebook page that she was "Extremely upset!" and asked, "Can u arrange for someone to come round and tell my 5 yr & 8 yr???! " A Muslim group had sold more than 4,000 tickets to the private event, set for this Sunday at a theme park in suburban London, when park officials canceled it last week. "Sadly, our right-wing extremists took a huge offense to it," park spokeswoman Liz Edwards said. But now -- after critics of the group filled the park's Facebook page with threats -- it's not open to anybody.
