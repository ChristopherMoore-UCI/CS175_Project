Abba Aji Khalili, a vigilante leader in Maiduguri, said, "The survivors had to trek to nearby Lassa village 25 kilometers away and Madagali town in neighboring Adamawa state before people got to know what had happened. Boko Haram Islamists abducted 60 females, including children, and killed 30 men last week in a raid of a village in northeastern Nigeria, two sources said Tuesday. Northeastern Nigeria is the home of Boko Haram, the militant Islamists who abducted scores of schoolgirls in April. The militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. "They took away 60 women, including small girls, after holding the village hostage for four days and killing 30 men," said the local official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals from Boko Haram.
