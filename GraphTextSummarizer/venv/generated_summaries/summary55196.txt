The specialist who works at one of London's heart attack centers said there would now be concern about whether the young footballer had suffered brain damage. -- Fabrice Muamba, the soccer player who collapsed during a game Saturday, may never return to professional football, according to a London heart specialist. In an interview with CNN affiliate ITN, consultant cardiologist Dr. Iqbal Malik, from Hammersmith Hospital, said it was "very much in doubt" that he could resume his professional career. Players pray for recovery Dr. Malik said the treatment he received on the pitch was crucial to his survival, and his chances of making a recovery better than someone who collapses in the street due to the medical facilities at the stadium. The 23-year-old Bolton Wanderers player, originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, is currently in a critical condition at the London Chest Hospital after collapsing during a match with Tottenham Hotspur.
