TV fathers have "evolved' from real people like Sheriff Andy Taylor, Beaver's dad Ward Cleaver and Heathcliff "Cliff" Huxtable, to cartoon dads like Homer Simpson, and Seth MacFarlane's caricatures in "American Dad!" I think and pray for the fathers across the nation who are raising America's next generation, and of those still advising the current, grown up, generations. Our public portrayal of fathers has shifted during my life. On this Father's Day, I think of my Dad, my grandfathers, uncles and my two brothers who are good dads to their kids. There are, of course, instances of bad fathers, men who weren't up to the job.
