Beneath the Pope's face, the coins would read, "Tribute from the Argentine People to Pope Francis. -- Just a few days after Pope Francis decried capitalism, Argentine lawmakers weighed a new way to honor him: putting his face on a coin. But the news was met with a more tepid response from President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who sent a dry letter of congratulations that failed to mention that Francis was the first Pope from Argentina and the Western Hemisphere. A proposal to create a commemorative coin as a tribute to Latin America's first Pope passed in Argentina's lower house on Thursday, Rep. Oscar Cachi Martinez said in a post on his official Facebook page. "We believe that the way of being, the charisma and the humility of Pope Francis have managed to revive global sympathy for the Catholic Church," he said.
