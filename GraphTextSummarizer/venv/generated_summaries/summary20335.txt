Bo Guagua, a graduate student at Harvard Kennedy School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, received two citations for failure to stop at a stop sign, records from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation show. The Porsche is not registered to Bo, according to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation official. Taking on allegations that he leads a playboy lifestyle, the son of embattled former Chinese Communist leader Bo Xilai denied rumors Tuesday that he used to drive a Ferrari. Rumors of Bo's allegedly flamboyant college lifestyle have played poorly in China, where his father, a former kingpin in the metropolis of Chongqing, promoted a revival of Maoist-style "red culture" while pursuing a widely publicized -- but brutal -- crackdown on organized crime in the city. The car is instead registered to James Jun Cui, whose relationship to Bo was not immediately clear.
