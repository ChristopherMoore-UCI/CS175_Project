Obama announces 23 executive actions, asks Congress to pass gun laws Although Senate Democrats like Dianne Feinstein will still make a high-profile push to renew the assault weapons ban and limit ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, senior Democratic sources say it is hard to see those measures getting enough support to pass the Democratic-led Senate. Democratic leadership sources emphasize what Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a PBS interview in recent days: They will not vote on any legislation unless they have 60 votes, enough to break a filibuster. Democratic leadership sources say they intend to spend next week -- the first week the Senate is in session -- canvassing red-state Democrats to see what, if anything, is doable. The focus is on the Senate because Senate Democratic leaders know that House Republicans will not act on anything until the Senate does. In the short term, that would mean not only getting red-state Democrats on board, but at least a handful of Senate Republicans as well.
