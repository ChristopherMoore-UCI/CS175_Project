Two members of Russian punk band Pussy Riot who were freed from prison Monday will continue to be a headache for President Vladimir Putin's government, they told CNN. " Dissing Putin Pussy Riot's 2012 performance of a "punk prayer" that criticized Putin, who was prime minister at the time, was held at a Russian Orthodox cathedral. The release of the two punk rockers was approved last week when Russian lawmakers backed a sweeping amnesty law announced by Putin. They were not deterred by their tough time in prison, where meals were rancid and punishment included hypothermia and bathroom lockouts. " Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova said they don't regret going to prison and missing time with their children.
