Obama promised increased spending to help war veterans cope with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury, calling those "the defining injuries of today's wars. More money will be spent to treat and screen war veterans for post-traumatic stress and brain injuries, Obama says. The VFW and ladies auxiliary delegates applauded when he promised to eliminate wasteful Pentagon practices that he said squander billions of dollars that would better be used for supporting U.S. troops and veterans. In a thinly veiled dig at the previous administration, he complained that U.S. forces were being used for far more tasks than fighting wars. While pledging to never hesitate "to use force to protect the American people or our vital interests," Obama also said any decision to deploy U.S. forces would be based on strategic necessity and "good intelligence."
