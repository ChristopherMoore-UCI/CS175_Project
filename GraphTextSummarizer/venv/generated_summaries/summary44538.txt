Having such a firearm on university-owned property violates Gonzaga policy, a fact that led to the possibility that students Erik Fagan and Daniel McIntosh would be suspended or expelled. In a disciplinary board hearing on Friday, the board, made up of three faculty members and two students, found Fagan and McIntosh guilty of two infractions -- possessing weapons on school grounds and putting others in danger by the use of weapons, according to Chuang. At about 2 a.m. the next day, campus security officers returned to Fagan and McIntosh's apartment and confiscated a pistol and a shotgun from the apartment. The gun is owned by Fagan, who uses it to hunt periodically, and McIntosh has a state-issued permit to carry a concealed handgun, Chuang said. Fagan and McIntosh think being on probation goes too far because the penalty goes on their permanent record and means they aren't "in good standing" at private, four-year Catholic university in Spokane, Washington.
