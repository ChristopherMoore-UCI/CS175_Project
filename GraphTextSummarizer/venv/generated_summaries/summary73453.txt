The goal of this group is to bring tribes throughout the United States and Canada together in an effort to promote Native American-owned businesses and services. "Trash bags, everybody uses trash bags -- so just for an example, let's all get together and order trash bags and it's going to be cheaper on all of us," Bowers says, pointing out that there is a Native American trash bag supplier. Now the Seminoles are taking that wealth -- and the power that comes with it -- and using it to do something that has not been done before: organizing Native American tribes with the intent of spreading economic opportunities across Indian Country. Richard Bowers Jr. says the Native American Group is intended to help tribes with basic needs. With every Native American-owned casino, Bowers sees an economic opportunity for all.
