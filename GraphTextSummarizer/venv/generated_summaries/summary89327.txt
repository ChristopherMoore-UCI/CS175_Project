The volatile southeastern region is home to Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority and the PKK, a one-time separatist group considered a terrorist organization by the Turkish government. Initially, the PKK fought to carve out a separate homeland for Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority, which makes up roughly 20 percent of the Turkish population. -- A Kurdish separatist movement has denied involvement in a bombing Thursday that killed nine people in a southeastern Turkish province, an explosion that drew swift condemnation and a vow to respond from Turkey's prime minister. It was issued in response to a call from Kurdish intellectuals and civil society organizations. The Kurdistan Workers' Party, known as the PKK, said the cease-fire it declared last month, which is slated to expire September 20, "is still continuing." "Our decision will definitely remain the same unless a new serious situation emerges," said a PKK statement published on Firat News Agency, a pro-Kurdish website.
