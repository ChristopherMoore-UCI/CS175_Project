The situation has been exacerbated by drought, continual armed conflicts in central and southern Somalia and high inflation on food and fuel. -- Three aid workers have been shot over the last day in Somalia, two of them fatally, Somali media reports said. The second fatality was a member of the Sodra nongovernmental organization, which is helping with humanitarian efforts in Somalia. A growing percentage of the Somali population has become dependent on humanitarian aid. The head of DBG, in Nairobi, Kenya, said he will suspend all aid operations in Somalia for the time being.
