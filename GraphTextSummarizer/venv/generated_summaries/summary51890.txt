-- Students unhappy with school meals are taking it out on the first lady by sharing images on social media of lunches sarcastically tagged #ThanksMichelleObama. "I feel like many people would be upset too if the lunch they bought looked [like this]." Backlash followed from others who said students were wrong to blame Michelle Obama for the quality of school meals. They took effect in 2012 with the goal of including more whole grains, vegetables and fruits in school meals while reducing fat and sodium. Whitney, who attends Richland Center High School in Wisconsin, said students deserve better options, especially those who can't leave school grounds during the day. Others show patties on whole-grain buns accompanied by an apple where one could imagine a pile of tater tots residing in earlier times.
