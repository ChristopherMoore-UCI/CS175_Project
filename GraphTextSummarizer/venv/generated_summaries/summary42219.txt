Lopez Obrador never conceded after officials declared Felipe Calderon the winner of Mexico's election in 2006 and has been known to refer to himself as "the legitimate president of Mexico." But Sunday's protests in Mexico City attracted more than just students -- teachers, unions and various political groups were also there. The former Mexico City mayor is running again. After students jeered the candidate at a recent campaign event, Pe√±a Nieto dismissed the demonstrators as outsiders, dragged there by political operatives to cause commotion. Garcia, the protester, said he voted for leftist candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in the last election.
