Gardner, 31, pleaded guilty Friday to the murder of King, the murder of Amber Dubois, and assault with intent to commit rape of a third person. -- Calling capital punishment in California an "empty promise," the father of murdered teen Chelsea King said he supported a deal to take death off the table for his daughter's killer in order to bring closure to the community. " A resolution for the Dubois family also figured into the King family's decision to support the plea, Brent King said. Gardner was facing the death penalty on one charge of murder with a special circumstance of rape for King's death. The surprise change of plea came during a hearing Friday, after prosecutors charged him with murder with a special circumstance of rape for Dubois's death.
