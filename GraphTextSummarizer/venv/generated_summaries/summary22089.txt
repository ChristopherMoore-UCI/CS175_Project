How can it be that the number of vulnerable and abandoned children is increasing and the numbers of children finding their "forever families" through adoption is decreasing? When adoption is the best option for these kids, I totally advocate for a well-run system that serves these children and families I believe the biggest reason that intercountry adoption does not work at an optimum is because we have not put in the mind power and energy and resources needed to create a system that works ethically and expediently. By getting to the root of the problems, there is the possibility of creating an environment that will serve families and there will be fewer abandoned children that need to find another family. My dream would be that there would be no need for adoption and that every child could remain with birth families. The main grievance for families was the difficultly to adopt in Australia, where couples could wait as long as 10 years.
