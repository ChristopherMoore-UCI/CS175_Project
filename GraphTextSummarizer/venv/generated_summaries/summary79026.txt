Bush, 88, is the wife of the 41st U.S. president, George H.W. Bush, and the mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush. President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton sent their best wishes to Mrs. Bush for a full recovery. Former first lady Barbara Bush was discharged from Houston Methodist Hospital on Saturday, a family spokesman said. "I cannot thank the doctors and nurses at Houston Methodist enough for making sure I got the best treatment and got back to George and our dogs as quickly as possible," Bush said. She formed the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy in 1989.
