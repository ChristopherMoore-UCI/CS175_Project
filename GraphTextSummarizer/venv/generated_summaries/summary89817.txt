Laura Dekker left her home port of Den Osse at 9:10 a.m., her spokesman Peter de Lange confirmed. "She is traveling in her yacht, Guppy, with her father until Lisbon where she will start the official solo sailing trip around the world. "She will arrive in Portugal, near Lisbon, in two or three weeks," de Lange said. -- A 14-year-old Dutch girl set sail Wednesday morning on a journey to travel around the world. Last October, a Dutch court ruled against letting Dekker sail solo around the world, saying she is not experienced enough to make the trip on her own.
