Garcia's business involvement with Borriol began in 2003, explains club vice-president, Pedro Fernandez, when one of his friends persuaded him to help out. Borriol captain Raul Caballero says Garcia's assistance has been key to the club's prosperity. " Spain's dominance of international football and Barcelona's European Champions League success in recent years has been attributed to strong grassroots support for the game. " Garcia will be looking to rejoin his golfing teammates at next year's Ryder Cup in Gleneagles, Scotland where, if selected, he will make a seventh appearance for Europe in the biennial match against the U.S. Three years later, Garcia was installed as club president of the club, which plays in group six of Spain's third division and now has more than 150 members.
