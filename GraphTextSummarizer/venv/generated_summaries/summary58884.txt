Hemisphere is decked out with a host of toys for the discerning seafarer to play with -- smaller speed boats to go water skiing and wake boarding, water scooters and diving gear, as well as a jacuzzi on the fly bridge. Peteghem believes those in the superyacht market are increasingly conscious of their environmental image and are turning to sailing vessels as a greener solution to luxury travel. "The level of finishing and luxury of Hemisphere brings her to the category of a superyacht," says chief naval architect Marc Van Peteghem. The makers of Hemisphere believe this is first catamaran superyacht to hit the water and could revolutionize the way people think about sailing. The catamaran only has a draft of 3.1 meters, meaning it can explore areas previously out of bounds for superyachts.
