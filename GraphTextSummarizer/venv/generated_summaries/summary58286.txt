"Scrabble is culturally at an all-time high," according to Williams, who said board games tend to have a spike popularity during tough economic times. Competitors in the tournament included everyone from doctors and lawyers to truck drivers and school teachers, and ranged in age from 12 to 92, according to Williams. The champion of the 2010 National Scrabble Championship has a photographic memory, said John D. Williams, Jr., the head of the tournament that wrapped Wednesday at the Hotel InterContinental in Dallas, Texas. "He is probably the best Scrabble player in the world at this point," Williams said of the 43-year-old New Zealand security analyst, who lives in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Although, like most board games, Scrabble faces competition from newer forms of entertainment, like the internet and video games, Williams insists it is hardly showing its age.
