-- It is easy to dismiss North Korea's threats against South Korea as bluster, unless you're on this island, within sight of North Korean waters. Angered by tougher U.N. sanctions and joint military exercises by the United States and South Korea, Pyongyang has issued a range of bombastic threats in recent weeks. North Korea shelled Yeongpyeong Island in November 2010, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. The slew of fiery rhetoric from Pyongyang has included threats of pre-emptive nuclear strikes against the United States and South Korea, as well as the declaration that the armistice that stopped the Korean War in 1953 is no longer valid. It's a memorial to those who lost their lives, but also a reminder of the danger that North Korea poses to the South, and this community in particular.
