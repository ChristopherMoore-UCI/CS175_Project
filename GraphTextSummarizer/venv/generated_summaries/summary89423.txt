" Human Rights Watch, which condemned the lawsuit along with other NGOs, said the Thai navy should allow authorities to look into the allegations of trafficking and other mistreatment of Rohingya migrants. The Thai government says it is committed to combating human trafficking in Thailand but denies that the Rohingya are victims of trafficking. The charges relate to an article published July 17 last year that included information from a Reuters investigative piece that alleged some Thai naval forces have been profiting from the smuggling of ethnic Rohingya people fleeing violence in neighboring Myanmar. "Prosecutors should be investigating the poor treatment of Rohingya boat people instead of targeting journalists," said Brad Adams, Asia director for Human Rights Watch in a statement. According to Phuketwan, other Thai news organizations that also published the text at the center of the case have not been charged.
