IOC president Thomas Bach told reporters in Lausanne, Switzerland that organizers of Russia's first Winter Games had agreed to set aside areas similar to ones previously seen at Vancouver 2010 and the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing. "We welcome the announcement of the [Sochi 2014] Organizing Committee that in Sochi there will be protest zones that will be established for people who want to demonstrate against something," said Bach, who replaced former president Jacques Rogge in September. "The IOC needs to stand up better for their athletes quite frankly," she told reporters at the United Nations, where she was speaking to mark International Human Rights Day. German newspaper Der Spiegel reported Gauck made the decision in protest against human rights violations and the harassment of Russian opposition political figures, although those claims were denied by his office. The Czechoslovakian-born American, who came out as gay in 1981, criticized the IOC "for really putting their head in the sand" over the issue of Russian law.
