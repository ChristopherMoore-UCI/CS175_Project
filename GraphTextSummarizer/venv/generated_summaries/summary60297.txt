-- Claiming Barack Obama thinks a "free enterprise economy" is "the cause of our problems" -- not, as he sees it, the solution -- Sen. Marco Rubio argued Tuesday that the president's proposals would hurt middle class citizens more than help them. "The tax increases and the deficit spending you propose will hurt middle class families," Rubio said, referring to Obama. "The idea that more taxes and more government spending is the way to help hardworking middle-class taxpayers, that's an old idea that has failed every time it's been tried," Rubio said. But he added that first, "we must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws." Speaking about gun control measures, one of the most emotional parts of Obama's State of the Union speech, Rubio said he was for "effectively" dealing with such violence, then added, "but unconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to do it."

Obama's "solution to virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more," Rubio said.
