The band is set to perform at First Midwest Bank Amphitheatre in Chicago, Illinois, on Saturday night. Pooping pigeons forced the Kings of Leon to abandon their St. Louis, Missouri, concert after just three songs Friday night, the rock band's management said Saturday. An infestation of the birds in the rafters of the Verizon Amphitheatre bombarded the musicians as soon as they took the stage, according to Andy Mendelsohn of Vector Management. Followill, who describes himself as a "germophobe," said there was already poop on his pedal and carpet when he walked out on stage. "The Kings of Leon decided to carry on regardless," they said in a statement released Saturday.
