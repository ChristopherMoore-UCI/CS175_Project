In the article posted Wednesday on The Nation's website and headlined "Lou Dobbs, American Hypocrite," the leftist political magazine reports that Dobbs hired contractors who used illegal immigrants for landscaping work and caring for horses ridden by his daughter, Hillary Dobbs, a champion show jumper. But Macdonald said that the situation involved Dobbs and his Dobbs Group hiring contractors that she said used undocumented workers. -- Former CNN anchor Lou Dobbs said Thursday said neither he nor his companies have ever hired illegal immigrants and it was not his responsibility to check their papers. Another man whom the article says cared for Dobbs Group horses is quoted as saying the job required him to be available at all hours, day and night. Dobbs challenged an online article accusing him of hiring contractors who employ illegal immigrants on his properties.
