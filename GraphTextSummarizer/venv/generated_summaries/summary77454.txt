It warned that more attacks would come unless Hezbollah, a Lebanese-based, Iranian-backed Shiite militia, stopped sending fighters to support Syrian regime forces. -- Lebanese authorities have arrested the chief of an al Qaeda-affiliated jihadist group that has previously claimed terror attacks in Lebanon, Egypt and elsewhere, the Lebanese army said Friday. At least four people were killed and 77 injured in the explosion, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency. The United States declared it a terrorist group in 2012, saying it was responsible for a 2010 attack on a Japanese-owned oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz and had expressed interest in attacking Western interests in the Middle East. The group formed in the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon and has battled Lebanese government troops before.
