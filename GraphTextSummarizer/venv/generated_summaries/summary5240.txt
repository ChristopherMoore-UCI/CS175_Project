Thomas' victory Sunday broke her previous record of 181 wings and took top honors at the 10th annual Buffalo Chicken Wing Festival in Buffalo, New York. "This is the Super Bowl for the chicken-wing industry," said Drew Cerza, self proclaimed "Wing King" and festival founder. There was also plenty of competition -- a Miss Buffalo Wing pageant, a sauce-off contest, and a "bobbing for chicken wings" contest. Despite the Buffalo wing's invention in Buffalo at the city's Anchor Bar in 1964 -- "with," according to Cerza, "a sauce of Frank's hot sauce and butter" -- Buffalo was without a wing festival for decades. The Farrelly Brothers' 2001 movie was about a junk-food-loving dad, played by Bill Murray, who was trying to get to a national wing festival in Buffalo.
