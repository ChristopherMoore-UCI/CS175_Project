The Jackson family has been publicly split over the concert since brothers Marlon, Tito and Jackie, sister La Toya and family matriarch Katherine Jackson announced their support for it in July. -- Janet Jackson joined brothers Jermaine and Randy on Tuesday in opposing the October tribute concert for Michael Jackson because it takes place during the trial of the doctor charged in their brother's death. Instead, the audience will watch a video of Beyonce singing a Michael Jackson song. Members of the Jackson family taking the stage October 8 include several of Michael Jackson's brothers, "the next generation of Jacksons," and 3T, which consists of Tito Jackson's three sons, the promoters said. A fan uproar forced promoters to boot KISS from the lineup because of negative comments the rock band's bassist, Gene Simmons, made about Michael Jackson in the weeks after his June 25, 2009, death.
