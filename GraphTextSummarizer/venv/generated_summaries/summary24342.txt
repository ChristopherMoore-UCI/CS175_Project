-- Two men authorities say played a key role in a 2009 al Qaeda plot to bomb packed New York subway cars now face charges in Canada, although their whereabouts are unknown, police said Tuesday. U.S. authorities charged Imam in July with providing material support and receiving military-type training from al Qaeda, according to an indictment unsealed Tuesday in the Eastern District of New York. Imam was identified by the New York plotters as a weapons instructor who went by the name of "Youseff," police said. At a news conference in Winnipeg, Canadian police accused Ferid Imam, a former student at the University of Manitoba, of training Najibullah Zazi, the Afghanistan-born New Yorker who has pleaded guilty to trying to bomb the city's subway system. "This extensive and thorough national security investigation has provided us with the evidence we require to lay criminal charges," said Bill Robinson, assistant commissioner with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
