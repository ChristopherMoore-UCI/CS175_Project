" A growing number of Hispanic business owners are women, generating nearly $46 billion in sales nationwide last year, according to a study published this year by the Center for Women's Business Research. Fueled by immigration and population growth, Hispanic buying power will reach almost $1.2 trillion by 2011 -- about six times what it was in 1990 -- according to an estimate by the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia in a study released last year. Hispanic entrepreneurs like Art Pesqueira, pictured last year at his El Grande Tortilla Factory in Tucson, Arizona, are growing rapidly, statistics show. A U.S. Census bureau report issued last year tracked the growth of Hispanic-owned businesses between 1997 and 2002. Hispanic business ownership is growing three times as fast as the national average and Hispanic purchasing power is expected to reach more than $1 trillion by 2011, according to the Census Bureau and other studies.
