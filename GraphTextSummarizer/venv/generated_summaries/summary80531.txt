Earnest noted that the project is still being reviewed by the State Department to "determine whether it's in in the national interest." Congress' plans on the Keystone XL pipeline could also have implications for the Louisiana Senate runoff pitting incumbent Sen. Mary Landrieu against Rep. Bill Cassidy. As the House prepares to debate Thursday another bill to authorize the Keystone XL pipeline, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the administration's position on the controversial pipeline has not changed. Cassidy is sponsoring the House's bill Thursday and presumptive Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Cassidy will join the Senate's energy committee if elected. Landrieu, who is currently the chairwoman of that committee, is pushing for a vote on the pipeline in the Democratic-held Senate -- a measure that could give her a boost in her energy-rich state as she faces an uphill battle to beat back the challenge from Cassidy. Earnest said if the House legislation is anything like earlier bills, "the President's senior advisers at the White House would recommend that he veto legislation like that." "That continues to be our position," he said.
