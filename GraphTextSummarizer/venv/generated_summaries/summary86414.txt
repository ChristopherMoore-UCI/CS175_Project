Hill Democrats look to 'silent majority' on gun control Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley is from New York City, where being anti-gun isn't very dangerous politically. Will Senate Democrats act? "With the schedule we have, we're not going to get into the debate on gun control," Reid responded. They have since Al Gore lost the presidency by failing to win conservative states, an outcome many Democrats blame in part on Gore's push for gun control. But Arizona's Raul Grijalva is a Democrat from the kind of pro-gun congressional district his party is panicked about losing by pushing too hard on gun control. The president knows full well that Democratic strategists -- including those who run his re-election effort -- see gun control as political dynamite.
