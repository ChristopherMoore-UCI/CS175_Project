And CTV has been the career launch-pad for dozens and dozens of TV journalists, who now appear on our nightly network news programs. Gazing to the south of Latimer Square, a billowing column of dust blocked any view of the CTV building. As much as we are exhorted to uphold our plucky, resilient spirit, I have huge fears about how much repair and rebuilding work can be done in time for winter. Can our viciously wounded city continue to support and sustain 400,000 people while major infrastructure and rebuilding work is undertaken? A blood-soaked woman emerged out of the storm of dust and debris and after I assisted her to Latimer Square, it soon dawned on me that much of the city center was raining down on its citizens.
