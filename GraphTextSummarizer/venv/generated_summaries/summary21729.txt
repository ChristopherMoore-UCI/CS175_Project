New teams entering F1 often find it hard to close the gap on the midfield and front running teams. German media group Constantin Medien and U.S. company Bluewaters Communication Holdings are pursuing cases against Ecclestone surrounding the sale of F1 to private equity firm CVC in 2006. To underline how much money matters, teams must pay $5,000 to express their interest and a total of $130,000 to formally apply. The financial Austrian energy drink company took over the established Jaguar team rather than starting from scratch and also arrived with significant independent funding. If a potential competitor gets through the first round then the FIA will assess its technical ability, resources, funding, experience and the value it would bring to the F1 championship.
