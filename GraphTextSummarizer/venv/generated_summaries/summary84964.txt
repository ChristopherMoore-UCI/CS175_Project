The United States and most Latin American nations have condemned the coup, the first in Latin America since the end of the Cold War.

Zelaya had been at odds with the other branches of government over a referendum he wanted to hold Sunday. Roberto Micheletti, president of the Congress, was sworn in as provisional president.
