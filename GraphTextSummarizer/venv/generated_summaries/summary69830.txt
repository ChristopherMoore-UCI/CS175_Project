The agency had warned that snow accumulation in some areas, combined with freezing temperatures, could lead to hazardous driving conditions late Wednesday and into Thursday morning. Nearly the entire northern half of Alabama had received snow by 11 p.m. Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate WBRC. The weather system dumped significant levels of snow and ice on Missouri and Oklahoma, along with parts of Kentucky, Arkansas and the panhandle of Texas on Wednesday. "I don't know what today's going to be like." In parts of Kansas and Kentucky, road crews hustled to clear snow from interstates and highways Wednesday. In Atlanta, however, drivers were relieved to find the metropolitan area received only a dusting of snow and the roads were mostly clear Thursday morning as the temperature hovered around freezing.
