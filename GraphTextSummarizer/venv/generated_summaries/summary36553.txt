-- A British court's decision to issue an arrest warrant for former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni is "absurd," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday. Two months ago, British lawyers working on behalf of 16 Palestinian clients petitioned a London court to issue an arrest warrant for Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak while he was on an official visit in London. Israel said the warrant was issued "at the behest of radical elements" and "anti-Israel elements. Details of the arrest warrant were not immediately available -- news reports said it has been revoked -- but the prime minister denounced attempts to label Israeli officials as "war criminals. Netanyahu said Israel "will not accept a situation" in which Livni, Defense Minister Ehud Barak and former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert "will be summoned to the dock."
