"He was essentially being treated as a prisoner would be treated," Smith said Thursday, according to CNN affiliate WSB. CNN reached out Thursday and earlier Friday to the Wimbushes. Recardo and Therian Wimbush reported to authorities early Friday evening, Gwinnett County Police spokesman Cpl. State child protection workers went to the Wimbush home after receiving a tip and found the boy locked in an 8-by-6-foot room with no light bulb, books, toys or television, Smith said. The 13-year-old child and his nine siblings appeared to be in good health and showed no outward signs of physical abuse or malnutrition, Smith said.
