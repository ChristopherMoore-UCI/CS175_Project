Days after Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo disintegrated above California, killing one of its co-pilots, Virgin founder Richard Branson says making commercial space travel a reality is worth the risks involved. The accident killed co-pilot Michael Tyner Alsbury and injured co-pilot Peter Siebold, who managed to parachute to the ground. "But he was a test pilot, and test pilots are trying to discover things that 400 engineers and technicians on the ground can't necessarily see on the ground. I'm sure his parents and his wife and his sisters would not say that, but test pilots would say that, because the risk they're taking, they know the importance of what they're doing," he said. Scaled Composites said Sunday that co-pilot Siebold -- the company's director of flight operations -- was alert and speaking with family and doctors.
