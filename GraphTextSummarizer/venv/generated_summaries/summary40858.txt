Today's smartphone cameras are so advanced that mobile photography is becoming an art form in its own right, turning photo-sharing apps like Instagram into portable galleries for amateur photographers, and professionals like street style photographer Tommy Ton and chief official White House photographer Pete Souza. While Le Govic had preselected a number of established photographers to feature in this year's inaugural anthology (he's hoping it will become an annual publication), he also gave Instagram users the chance to put themselves up for consideration, using the hashtag #outofthephone to nominate their best works. Several projects are set for release next year, including books from award-winning documentary photographer Benjamin Lowy, and other photographers he believes are using the medium to its fullest. "You have the dark room in your pocket," says Pierre Le Govic, the Paris-based founder of Out of the Phone, the world's first publishing house dedicated to mobile photography. He first started following mobile photography on Instagram in 2011, and was surprised and impressed by the quality of work that hobbyists were creating.
