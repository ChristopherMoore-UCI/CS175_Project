"We knew while it was an urgent situation we could make the rescue without harming ourselves," said Peterson, who provided aid to the mother and son after Jones and Beatty brought them out of the burning vehicle. Within moments, Peterson and fellow paramedic Neil Jones, along with firefighter/EMT Jake Beatty, found the doors were jammed. Local resident Kathy Lamberth apparently had lost control of the Suburban, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. -- Jeff Peterson and his 30 volunteer comrades with the Community Fire Department in suburban Charlotte, North Carolina, were enjoying an early Christmas dinner Sunday afternoon when someone looked out a window and saw smoke, thinking it might be a car fire. Landen did not suffer injuries, WSOC said.
