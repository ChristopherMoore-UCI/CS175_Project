North Korea reserves most of its rage for matters like U.N. sanctions over its nuclear program and U.S.-South Korean military drills near its borders. The North Korean regime regularly works itself into a lather of rage about balloons floated over the border by South Korean activists. The South Korean government also began setting up groups of huge speakers along the border to blast propaganda across into North Korea, something it hadn't done for years because of a thaw in relations. Photographers who have spent time in the country say that particular care must be taken when snapping pictures of statues of North Korean leaders. That can include items like dollar bills, DVDs and tiny AM/FM radios that show the prosperity in South Korea, as well as documents criticizing the North Korean regime.
