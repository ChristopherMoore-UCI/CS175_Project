The first to leave the hospital was a 6-year-old boy, apparently one of the children Reyes helped in the moments after the Spanair MD-82 airliner crashed on takeoff from Madrid's Bajaras airport Wednesday. -- A woman who survived last week's Spanair airline crash in Madrid left the hospital Tuesday, saying she was "born again" by the disaster. Beatriz Reyes has been released from hospital after surviving the plane crash which killed 154 people. "I saw some kids and I got them out," Reyes said.
