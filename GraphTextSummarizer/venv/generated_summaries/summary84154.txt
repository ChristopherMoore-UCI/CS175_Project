Golf's European Tour insisted it should be following the death of Alastair Forsyth's caddie Iain McGregor on the final day of the Madeira Islands Open Sunday. "Myself and playing partners Adam (Gee) and Tano (Goya) met tournament officials and spoke to (European Tour chief executive) George O'Grady on the phone before taking the decision to play on, because we felt that was what Mac would have wanted. "Everyone at the European Tour extends our deepest sympathies to the friends and family of Iain at this time," read a European Tour statement. Brooks, however, was unable to bask in the glory of his maiden European Tour win, given the day's tragic events that had occurred earlier in the afternoon. After an initial indefinite suspension of play, and discussions with a number of players and caddies, the European Tour decided the tournament should be completed.
