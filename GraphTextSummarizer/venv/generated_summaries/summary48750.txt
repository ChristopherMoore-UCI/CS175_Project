Meanwhile, Roberto Carlos -- who played alongside Ronaldo for Real, Brazil and most recently Corinthians -- has also ended his stay in Sao Paulo and joined Russian team Anzhi Makhachkala. But Ronaldo has suffered criticism from Corinthians fans following the club's recent elimination from the Copa Libertadores by Colombia's Deportes Tolima. I'm closing my career as a professional player," the former Barcelona, Inter Milan and Real Madrid star told reporters at a press conference. Ronaldo's footballing achievements have at times been overshadowed by controversy, starting with his late withdrawal and then reinstatement before the 1998 World Cup final against France -- which Brazil lost 3-0. "I've never seen fans with so much passion," said Ronaldo, who was a boyhood supporter of Rio de Janeiro club Fluminense.
