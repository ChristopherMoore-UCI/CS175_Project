National outrage has percolated over Paterno's reaction to a graduate assistant's 2002 report that he had seen former Penn State defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky performing anal sex on a young boy in the shower room of the football complex. Paterno, 84, said on Sunday that he'd never been told the graphic details revealed in a grand jury report about sex abuse allegations but that he nevertheless passed the allegations on to his boss. The next day, Paterno passed the report up to his boss, Athletic Director Tim Curley, saying -- according to the grand jury report -- that the graduate assistant had told him he had seen Sandusky "fondling or doing something of a sexual nature to a young boy." He began his career at Penn State in 1950 as a 23-year-old assistant under head coach Rip Engle. Pennsylvania Attorney General Linda Kelly said Monday that Paterno is not a target of the investigation, which has resulted in charges against two top university officials accused of failing to report the abuse, in addition to Sandusky.
