Initially, Iraqi security forces used water cannons and batons on the crowds of demonstrators but later opened fire when protesters started attacking government buildings. -- A least one person was shot dead and 55 others -- including four police -- were wounded Wednesday when private security guards and Iraqi security forces opened fire on hundreds of demonstrators outside the governor's office in the eastern city of Kut, health officials said. On February 3, another rally was held in Kut as citizens protested against the lack of basic services, unemployment and corruption and called for improvement of food rations in Wasit province, a predominantly Shiite province about 68 miles (110 kilometers) south of Baghdad. In Falluja, hundreds of protesters walked toward the city council building and the mayor's office on Tuesday, demanding the resignation of the mayor and the head of the city council because of corruption and their inability to provide basic services to the people. Kut police tell CNN that Hamed was not in the city when protesters attacked his office and his house.
