Ask students: Why do you think that the framers of the Constitution organized the U.S. system of government this way? Federal powers listed in the Constitution include the rights to collect taxes, declare war and regulate trade. How does the government established by the Constitution embody the purposes, values, and principles of American democracy? How might the story of the U.S. read in the absence of a Constitution? Remind students that in 1787, the framers of the U.S. Constitution established a federal system of government that divided power between the national and state governments.
