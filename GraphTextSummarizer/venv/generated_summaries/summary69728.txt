Cristiano Ronaldo played a dangerous ball from the left into the Arsenal penalty area and young Gunners left-back Kieran Gibbs, who has deputized superbly for French international Gael Clichy in recent weeks, lost his footing -- allowing Ji-Sung Park to collect the ball and fire past goalkeeper Manuel Almunia. Van Persie stepped up to convert the penalty, but it was scant consolation for a well-beaten Arsenal side, as United moved to within 90 minutes of winning a fourth European Cup and a possible showdown against Premier League rivals Chelsea in a repeat of last year's epic final in the Moscow rain. The goal, the first Arsenal had conceded at home in Europe this season, justified manager Alex Ferguson's decision to select Park ahead of Carlos Tevez in the only change to the United side from last week's victory at Old Trafford. The half-time interval gave Arsenal some respite, but United looked far from finished as an attacking threat and could have extended their lead six minutes after the break when Ronaldo twisted and turned the Arsenal defense before firing a fierce shot that Almunia did well to turn around the post. -- Holders Manchester United remain on course to become the first side to retain the Champions League, as two goals in the first 11 minutes saw them defeat Arsenal 3-1 for a 4-1 aggregate victory and a place in the final against either Chelsea or Barcelona in Rome.
