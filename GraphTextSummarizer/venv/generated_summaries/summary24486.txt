She stopped me, asked whether I spoke English, and asked in all seriousness "Do you know where Dracula's bedroom is?" Bran Castle is less than an hour outside of Brasov. Despite a rather tenuous connection with the historic Dracula, the place tourists seem to flock to seek out the vampire is Bran Castle. Visiting Dracula's castle Poienari Castle is not on the main tourist route. Vlad Dracula lived from 1431 to about 1476 and ruled Wallachia, which was actually south of Transylvania. Most Romanians see Vlad as a bit of a hero, not the evil demon of "Count Dracula" fame.
