"In the 1980s, players weren't taking a stance," former Tottenham Hotspur player and current trustee of anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out, Garth Crooks, told CNN. " Barcelona full-back Alves, who posted a clip of the incident on Instagram, is not the first player to ignore the taunts Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch in 2013 after being abused by opposition fans during an AC Milan game in Italy, while other leading players like Manchester City's Yaya Toure, Samuel Eto'o of Chelsea and AC Milan's Mario Balotelli have all taken their own stances against racist abuse. " These days anti-racism campaign groups -- such as Kick It Out and Show Racism the Red Card -- are around to pressurize the football authorities when players like Alves are abused. And such has been the progress in the fight against racist abuse that, according to one of the legends of the game, what happened to Alves at the El Madrigal Stadium remains an isolated incident. "They're all prepared to say, stop you better do something about this or I walk," added Crooks.
