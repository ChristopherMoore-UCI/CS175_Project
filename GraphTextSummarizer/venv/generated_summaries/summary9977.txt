"Linda Carty's speech to Trafalgar Square shows that she is a terrified woman, and with good reason," said Clive Stafford Smith, director of Reprieve. Carty was born on the Caribbean island of St. Kitts to Anguillan parents and holds a British passport, Reprieve said. " Carty was convicted of taking part in the May 2001 murder of Joana Rodriguez, a 25-year-old Texas woman, Reprieve said. He said he asked Reprieve, a British charity that he supports, whether he could do anything for them, and they suggested he focus on Carty's case. A Scottish man who has taken an interest in Carty's case played her seven-minute recording over and over for an hour while standing atop one of Trafalgar Square's large statue bases, or plinths.
