-- Los Angeles firefighters spent Monday morning battling two fires, both in apartment buildings: one under construction, the other under renovation "That address had a multistory apartment building under construction, a total of seven floors in the wood-frame stage, approximately 1.3 million square feet of area space," Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Ralph Terrazas said. "More than two-thirds of (the building) was on fire, causing significant exposure issues for two nearby high-rise buildings," he added. The second fire was reported in a smaller apartment building about eight blocks away on West Seventh Street just after 4 a.m. Fire officials don't know whether the blazes are related, but it took 100 firefighters to get the second fire under control We estimate that it will be in the multimillion-dollars of loss range," Terrazas said.
