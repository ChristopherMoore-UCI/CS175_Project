With regard to the West Coast tape-delay, Chris Ender, a CBS spokesman, pointed out that the Grammys is a performance-driven show, and that the social media chatter during the East Coast broadcast "often drives more awareness and interest to viewers elsewhere. But CBS continues to delay the Grammys until prime time begins out West, when it says more people are at home and able to watch. Awards shows in general have been on a ratings upswing in recent years. Most awards shows are broadcast live coast-to-coast, something that matters more than ever nowadays because millions of people like to converse about the shows on the Internet while they're watching. " "We're continuing to do what works, delivering a broadcast that can be watched by the most amount of viewers," Ender said.
