The 22-year-old Dutch citizen was considered the main suspect in the 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba, where van der Sloot lived. In the Holloway case, van der Sloot told investigators during an interrogation that he knows the location of her body, a Peruvian police official said. Although van der Sloot was never charged in connection with Holloway's disappearance in 2005, U.S. authorities have filed extortion and wire fraud charges against him. A FBI affidavit says van der Sloot tried to extort money from Holloway's mother. In exchange for the money, the document said, van der Sloot showed the representative a house where Holloway's remains supposedly were buried.
