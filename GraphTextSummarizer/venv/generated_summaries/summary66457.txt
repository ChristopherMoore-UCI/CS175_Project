-- On June 11, 1962, three Alcatraz inmates -- John Anglin, Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris -- attempted to leave the infamous San Francisco Bay island prison in a bold escape attempt involving dummy heads, chipped-through walls and a raft made of raincoats. Based on models of tidal currents in the bay -- and inspired by an episode of the Discovery Channel's "MythBusters" -- the team of researchers showed that if the Anglin brothers and Morris left Alcatraz at midnight and headed north, they could have reached land. It's unlikely, though possible, that the Anglin brothers and Morris are alive today if they survived. However, Scott's successful swim across the channel to San Francisco -- six months after the attempt by the Anglins and Morris -- made it feasible that others could have done so as well. Hut allows that they could have survived the latter departure, though they were likely to have been picked up by police since they would have made landfall after sunrise.
