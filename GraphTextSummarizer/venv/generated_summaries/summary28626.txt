" Moore had been slated to portray Gloria Steinem in the Linda Lovelace biopic, "Lovelace." -- A woman called 911 soliciting help for actress Demi Moore, whom she said was "convulsing" and "burning up" after "smoking something," according to a recording of the call obtained Friday from the Los Angeles Fire Department. The star of "Ghost," "A Few Good Men," "G.I. Jane" and other films was rushed to a Southern California hospital late Monday night after the call. Earlier this week, a representative for Moore said after the incident that the actress -- who recently separated from her husband, Ashton Kutcher -- has been dealing with stress. The 911 call features an unidentified woman referring to Moore and saying, "She smoked something -- it's not marijuana, but it's similar to incense.
