"Desperately seeking a way out of its energy and economic dependence on Russia, Georgia considers Iran as an alternative supplier of energy, and both sides have renewed their drive for an energy partnership," writes Kornely Kakachia of Tbilisi State University in a recent diplomatic journal. For Iranian tourists strolling in the sun-drenched squares in the Black Sea town of Batumi, Georgia is a pocket of hospitality in a world that has largely closed its doors to them. "Georgia is very near to Iran, it is very easy to get a bus or a flight to come here... without needing a visa," gushed one Iranian visitor as she took in the historical sites in Batumi. In fact, Iran fits into Georgia's aggressive strategy to court foreign direct investment however and wherever it can. In 2012 we've already held investment seminars practically in all counties of gulf region," says Giorgi Tsikolia, First Deputy Director at the Georgian National Investment Agency.
