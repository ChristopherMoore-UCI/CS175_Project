Even expanding the flags represented by emojis, as Apple has done, comes at some peril. That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this. Apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis, kissing with a heart over their heads. Apple has "evolved" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples. Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include ... Santa Claus.
