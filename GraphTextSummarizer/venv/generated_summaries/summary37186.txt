Moreover, failed negotiations would anyway give hard-liners a victory by making it impossible for the United States to secure long-term international monitoring of, and safeguards on, Iran's nuclear program -- Iranian leaders could declare that Tehran has permanently given up enriching 20% uranium, while assuring the international community that it will limit low-enriched uranium purely for purposes of domestic energy "needs." History clearly shows that sanctions can get Tehran to the negotiating table, but will not compel Iranian leaders to capitulate to demands they deem contrary to Iranian interests. If the United States is serious not just about placing significant (if imperfect) limits on Iran's nuclear program, but also encouraging a political dynamic that strengthens reform-minded Iranian leaders and fosters a more cooperative Iranian foreign policy abroad, then Washington should make every reasonable effort to seal a comprehensive nuclear deal and secure Congress' support for it. What we should do instead is reach for an agreement that narrows the parameters of Iran's nuclear program while helping to create conditions favorable to broader political debate in Iran. As for military action, the consensus among U.S. military leaders and strategists seems to be that any effort to significantly damage or reverse Iran's nuclear program would require weeks or months of sustained bombing -- in effect another war, the outcome of which would be far from certain.
