-- Oskana Grigorieva's appearance on "Oprah" has been "postponed indefinitely," a source close to Grigorieva said. Grigorieva has accused Gibson of striking her in the face, while he alleges that she attempted to extort him to keep controversial recordings of their arguments secret. Grigorieva's visit with Oprah Winfrey "was about to happen, but has been postponed indefinitely," the source said. " Lawyers for Grigorieva have "ongoing communications" with "Oprah producers," said the source, who asked not to be identified since the source was not authorized to speak publicly about it. Police in Malibu Hills, California, opened the investigation earlier in July into an alleged domestic violence incident between Gibson and Oksana Grigorieva.
