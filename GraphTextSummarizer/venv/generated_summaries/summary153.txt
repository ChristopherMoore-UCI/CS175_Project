Amnesty International said northern Mali was teetering on the brink of disaster. Thursday, the regional group, Economic Community of West African States, met in the Ivorian capital, Abidjan, to discuss military intervention in Mali. "All the food and medicine stored by major aid agencies has been looted, and most of the aid workers have fled," said Gaetan Mootoo, Amnesty International's researcher on West Africa. Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu have experienced days of looting, abductions and chaos since they were occupied by armed groups late last week, the human rights group said. The Algerian consul in Gao and six employees were forcibly taken from the consulate and are being held by unidentified groups, the Algerie Presse Service reported.
