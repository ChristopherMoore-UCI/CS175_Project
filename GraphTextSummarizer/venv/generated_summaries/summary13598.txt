A judge in Tamaulipas state convicted Gonzalez of organized crime and kidnapping and handed down the sentence, which includes a fine equivalent to 2,251 days of minimum wage, the attorney general's office said. Three others were sentenced alongside Gonzalez, prosecutors said Thursday. -- One of the founding members of Los Zetas, a ruthless Mexican drug cartel that began as a group of army deserters hired by a drug lord, has been sentenced to 35 years in prison, the federal attorney general's office said. Federal police arrested Gonzalez in November 2008 in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. Another cartel member, Javier Paez Arredondo, was sentenced to 10 years for participating in organized crime.
