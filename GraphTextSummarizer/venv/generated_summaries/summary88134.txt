Three British citizens arrested in the United Arab Emirates after they were found plane spotting near Fujairah airport are to be released Monday, their lawyer, Nasser al-Hashem, tells CNN. Conrad Clitheroes, 54, and Gary Cooper, 45, were on a five-day visit to the UAE from Manchester when they were arrested. The third man, Neil Munro, is a British national who lives in the UAE. "We made our defense, and the judge made the decision to drop the case," al-Hashem said. As a hobby, plane spotters view and photograph aircraft around the world.
