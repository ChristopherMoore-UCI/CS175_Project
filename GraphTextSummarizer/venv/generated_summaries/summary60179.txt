Next weekend, "The Mortal Instruments," "You're Next" and "The World's End" all hit theaters. "Millers" is now a lock to surpass $100 million at the domestic box office, which would make it Sudeikis' second film to reach the milestone (alongside his previous Aniston team-up, "Horrible Bosses"), and Aniston's sixth. Like that film, "The Butler" tells a racially charged story that is playing particularly well with older women. "We're the Millers" maintained its spot in second place. Down in fourth place, Universal's "Kick-Ass 2" stumbled in its opening weekend with a meager $13.5 million.
