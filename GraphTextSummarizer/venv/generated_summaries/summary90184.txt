The 266-foot-diameter Kulluk remains upright and there is no apparent threat to its stability, said Sean Churchfield, the incident commander and operations manager for Shell Alaska. The Royal Dutch Shell oil drilling barge that ran aground off southern Alaska this week is sound and ready to be towed to safe harbor, a company official said Saturday, adding there is no evidence of any sheen in the vicinity. As much as 150,000 gallons of ultra low sulfur diesel and approximately 12,000 gallons of other petroleum products are on board the Kulluk, which had been working in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska's North Slope, until October. Most of the nearby shore is owned by a native Alaskan corporation on adjacent Kodiak Island, said Steven Russell, of Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation. The fuel on board the rig is used to power equipment and is not the result of the drilling operations Shell conducted off the North Slope, on the opposite side of the vast state from where the Kulluk now rests.
