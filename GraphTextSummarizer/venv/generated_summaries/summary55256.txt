Thursday's report highlighted several other examples of ways that government departments have used innovation to their advantage. Britain's Prison Service won praise Thursday for its innovative solution to the problem: recycle the mattresses for carpet underlay, or break them down for fencing or even roof tiles. "We have selected them as good examples of innovative approaches which have lessons for how innovation can be managed in government," the report said. There are enough of them each year to fill 30 double-decker buses, the National Audit Office said Thursday. They ended up coming up with several proposals to reuse the mattresses, and the Prison Service is now testing them out, the NAO said.
