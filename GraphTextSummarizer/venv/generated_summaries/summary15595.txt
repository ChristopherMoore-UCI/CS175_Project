" Richie promises the tour will be a mix of classic hits and fan favorites, ranging from his Commodores days to his 2012 release, "Tuskeegee." The crooner is gearing up for his "All The Hits All Night Long" North American tour, which kicks off Wednesday in Hollywood, Florida. " As a music industry veteran, Richie has some sage advice for those up-and-comers who resort to shock tactics when hitting the stage.

"There are days I have to stop, blink, and turn around just for a moment to say, 'OK, that's right, it has been that long,'" Richie said.
