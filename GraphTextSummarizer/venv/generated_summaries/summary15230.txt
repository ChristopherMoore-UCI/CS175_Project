The man charged with harnessing Neymar's talent is coach Luis Felipe Scolari -- the mastermind behind Brazil's last march to World Cup glory in 2002.

"He's a serious guy," Silva said of the national coach, who has also enjoyed time in charge of Portugal and Chelsea amongst many others. "Every day there's something going on in my head," Brazilian captain Silva, whose hands could grasp the famous old trophy 64 years on should Brazil be victorious, told CNN. Brazil's iconic Maracana Stadium may have been given a $500 million upgrade, but beneath the new shiny exterior, the scars of pain and anguish are still raw for many Brazilians.
