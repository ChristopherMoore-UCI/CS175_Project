-- Investigators in Georgia were looking Friday for a man who left the scene of a suburban Atlanta house fire that killed three children, authorities said. Authorities checked other area hospitals and did not find Gonzalez. "The children had significant burn injuries and significant smoke inhalation injuries," said Gwinnett County Fire Department Capt. Jake Smith said Ivan Gonzalez had been charged with two counts of murder Friday, a day after firefighters found him attempting to douse the blaze with a garden hose. Gonzalez, who Smith said received burns in the fire, told authorities he was a family member and was headed to the hospital to be near the children injured in the fire.
