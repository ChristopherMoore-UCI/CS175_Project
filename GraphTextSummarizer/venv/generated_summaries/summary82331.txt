It's not just because of porous borders, or a reluctance to punish employers who hire illegal immigrants, or because Mexico is a "failed state" that can't provide enough jobs for its own people. Their solution: a comprehensive reform bill combining enforcement with earned legal status for illegal immigrants, which they appear ready to introduce any day now. Until we can answer that question candidly and without regard for hurt feelings, we'll never be able to curb the future flow of illegal immigrants. Now, many of them want a guarantee that, if they go along with offering illegal immigrants what would this time be a conditional legal status (as opposed to "amnesty"), they won't have to go through all this again in another 24 years. And it's not as simple as what you hear from the left -- that trade deals like NAFTA have destroyed the Mexican economy and thus propelled immigrants north in search of higher wages.
