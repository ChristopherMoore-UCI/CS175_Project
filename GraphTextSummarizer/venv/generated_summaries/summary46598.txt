Snow falls on the bodies as people in the background wail, some shouting, "There is no God but God!" Baba Amr is a strategic point in Homs because it gave the Free Syrian Army the freedom to conduct operations, access other neighborhoods and launch attacks against the regime," said Osamah, the SRGC's media director in Hama. -- New videos posted from the Syrian flashpoint city of Homs suggest a fresh wave of killings by the Syrian military after the fall of the neighborhood of Baba Amr. The incident occurred as many of the rebel Free Syrian Army forces were abandoning the Baba Amr neighborhood of Homs, and as residents were trying to flee the city. Activists have provided CNN with footage purportedly showing the bodies of 17 civilians that were discovered February 29 in villages near Baba Amr following an all-out assault on the Homs neighborhood that had held off a government assault for weeks.
