It was found by Dutch orchid specialist Ed de Vogel during a field trip to the island of New Britain, near Papua New Guinea. Only a small amount of all known plant species flower at night, says Andre Schuiteman, an orchid specialist from the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London. The new species, called Bulbophyllum nocturnum, is the first which has flowers which consistently open up at night and close in the morning, say botanists. Botanists aren't sure why this species flowers after dark but suggest it might be because its pollinators are midges which forage at night. The first night-flowering orchid known to science has been discovered by botanists on an island in Southeast Asia.
