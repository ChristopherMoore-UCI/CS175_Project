President touts Obamacare benefits for moms Who will pay more under Obamacare? "Well, while our goal is to repeal all of Obamacare, I would remind you that the president has signed into law seven different bills that repealed or defunded parts of that law. Leading Republicans, such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, have also suggested suspending implementation of Obamacare until an investigation in completed into the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups. The next phase of the fight for the White House, according to administration officials, is a series of initiatives aimed at using social media, websites, on-the-ground efforts and targeting Spanish speakers and young people in particular to convince as many uninsured as possible to buy insurance when it becomes available on October 1. A full repeal is needed to keep this law from doing more damage to our economy and raising health care costs," House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a recent press conference.
