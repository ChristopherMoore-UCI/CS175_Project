The accident occurred when an SUV swerved to avoid a spool of wire that had fallen from a truck and slammed into a 7-ton U.S. postal truck, said Peter Rendina, a spokesman for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. The newsman and his wife waited at the crash scene until postal inspectors arrived, Rendina said. Brokaw, who was driving behind the postal truck, hit the rear of the truck, Rendina said. The driver of the SUV was thrown from her vehicle and killed, according to Rendina. The accident happened about 1 p.m. on New York's Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx, spokeswoman Jenny Tartikoff said in a statement.
