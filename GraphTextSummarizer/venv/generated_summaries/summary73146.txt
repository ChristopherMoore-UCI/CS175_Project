The music video was produced by the same team behind "Gangnam Style," and will feature K-pop girl group member Ga-In of Brown Eyed Girls. More than 50,000 fans are expected to pack Seoul's World Cup Stadium on Saturday to see "Gentleman," a performance that will be streamed live on YouTube. His video for "Gangnam Style" was the most viewed clip on YouTube with a staggering 1.5 billion views -- and growing. "The thought of danger never even occurred to me," said Seoul resident Sungoh Bang, who plans on attending the concert with a group of friends. Korean singer Psy, who became a worldwide sensation with his smash hit "Gangnam Style," is making another attempt at a global phenomenon.
