If he does sign with the Patriots, he will be reunited with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, who was the head coach of the Denver Broncos when they drafted Tebow in the first round in 2010. He will also get an opportunity to learn from starting quarterback Tom Brady, who in 14 years has won three Super Bowls and been the NFL's most valuable player twice. NFL.com, ESPN and other media outfits cited league sources in saying the 25-year-old former Heisman Trophy winner had come to terms with the Patriots on Monday. The Patriots declined to comment on the rumor, saying head coach Bill Belichick would have a 10:45 a.m. news conference. "I am sure it will be addressed then," team spokesman Stacey James wrote in an e-mail.
