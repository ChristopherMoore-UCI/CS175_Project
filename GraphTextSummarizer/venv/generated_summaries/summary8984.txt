That's a big deal for Apple's App Store, he said, since until now, that online marketplace for iPhone and iPad programs had been free of malicious software. Charlie Miller, a researcher at Accuvant and one of the world's best-known Apple hackers, said Tuesday that the bug proves the Apple App Store isn't as safe as advertised. "Until now, you could just blindly trust and download as many apps as you wanted and not worry about it," Miller said in an interview with CNN. -- A bug in Apple's mobile operating system allows hackers to take control of iPhone and iPad apps, using them to steal people's photos, contacts and even send text messages without the device's user knowing about it, according to a notable computer security researcher. He said that essentially reduces the App Store's security to that of the Google Android Market, since Google doesn't screen apps in the way Apple does. Apple did not respond to CNN's request for comment on the apparent security flaw, which Miller explains in detail on YouTube.
