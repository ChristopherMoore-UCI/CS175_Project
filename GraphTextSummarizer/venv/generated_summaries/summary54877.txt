The Regular Guys' Tim Andrews played the role of Harold White, becoming the face of the fictitious protest, doing interviews with CNN, the BBC and a host of other news outlets. Amid rumors that pop star Justin Bieber was considering a move to Atlanta, the Regular Guys, a morning show on Atlanta radio station Rock 100.5, put together a fake neighborhood group and pulled the wool over the eyes of the world's news organizations. Add to that, Bieber has had several encounters with law enforcement authorities in recent months. "The Buckhead Neighborhood Coalition is an organization put together by 'the Regular Guys Show,' " host Larry Wachs admitted Monday after the show's cast completed its "protest" in front of an on-the-market mansion. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering whether to charge Bieber with felony vandalism in the alleged egging of a neighbor's house on January 9.
