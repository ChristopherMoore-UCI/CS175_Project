In an intraparty feud about political strategy, the House minority leader on Tuesday called out the No. 3 Senate Democratic leader for saying that it was a mistake for Democrats to focus on passing health care reform in 2010. New York's Schumer added, "We took their mandate and put all our focus on the wrong problem -- health care reform. Schumer supported the Affordable Care Act, but from a political timing standpoint, he thought the party could have done other things before turning to health care. The 14 million figure Pelosi cites references those Americans who now have health care coverage since the law was enacted. But in moving to stake out the party's message going forward, Schumer put himself at odds with Pelosi, who was one of the fiercest champions of passing the legislation through the House in 2010.
