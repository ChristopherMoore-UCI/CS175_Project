According to a press release, LaBeouf collaborated with artists Nastja Säde Rönkkö and Luke Turner to create the exhibit, which is showing at the Stephen Cohen Gallery from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. The last item is an interesting choice, given that LaBeouf was accused of plagiarizing Clowes' work in December. Time magazine's Ryan Sandoval took the bowl of messages into LaBeouf's performance space, which he describes as a room about the size of a closet, outfitted with a table and two chairs. Before viewing the actor, the visitor stops at a table that bears "implements" -- some of which appear to correspond with LaBeouf's career. Some attendees to "#IAmSorry" have noted the project's strong resemblance to the work of Marina Abramovic, in addition to other artists.
