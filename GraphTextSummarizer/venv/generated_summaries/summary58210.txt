The warning is the latest concerning a phenomenon that has befuddled safety experts and terrified parents: the unintentional abandonment of children in cars. New devices intended to prevent children from dying of heat stroke in parked vehicles are unreliable, and should not be used as stand-alone measures to prevent such tragedies, the federal government warned Monday. Indeed, heat stroke is the leading cause of non-crash vehicle deaths for children under the age of 14, the safety agency said. In many cases, parents or caregivers -- stressed by heavy workloads or distracted by minor changes in their normal routine -- absent-mindedly leave children in cars, only to later discover them dead or suffering from hyperthermia. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said parents should teach children a vehicle is not a play area, and should store keys out of the reach of children.
