Federal prosecutors said Fairey, 42, lied about which AP image of Obama he used as inspiration for the posters, which were stamped with the words "Hope" and "Progress." "After spending a great amount of time, energy and legal effort, all of us at The Associated Press are glad this matter is finally behind us," said AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt. In his civil complaint, Fairey claimed to have used a photo taken of Obama and actor George Clooney by an AP photographer in 2006, though he actually used a different AP image -- a close-up of the current president, prosecutors said. Fairey was ordered to pay $25,000 in fines in a dispute that dates back to 2009, when he brought a federal lawsuit against AP, claiming that he was entitled to use the image under the fair use doctrine, according to a statement by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. "I accept full responsibility for violating the court's trust by tampering with evidence during my civil case with (The) Associated Press, which, after my admitting to engaging in this conduct, led to this criminal case by the Southern District of New York," Fairey said in a written statement. According to court documents, Fairey and AP settled the civil suit in January 2011 for $1.6 million.
