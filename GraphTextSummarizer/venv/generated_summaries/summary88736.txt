-- British rider Mark Cavendish won the fifth stage of this year's Tour de France after a mass sprint saw him narrowly beat Belgium's Philippe Gilbert and Spain's Jose Joaquin Rojas. Both Janez Brajkovic and defending champion Alberto Contador fell during the 164.5 kilometer stretch from Carhaix to Cap Frehel, the former being taken to hospital with head injuries. That's because we have been dominating in the last years," Cavendish, widely regarded as the best sprint cyclist in the sport, told the Tour de France's official website shortly after the race. "The reason why we dominate the sprint at the Tour de France is, well, for me personally I have put every other race on the back foot to be good at the Tour de France." Cavendish, 26, a sprint specialist who has now won 16 stages of the Tour de France since 2008, edged what had been an eventful, crash-filled race.
