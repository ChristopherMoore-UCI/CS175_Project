On the Monday before New Years 2009, a torchlight procession along Princes Street whisks a giant wicker lion to Calton Hill, where it's torched. Brilliant and colorful fireworks light up Australia's Sydney Harbour Bridge last New Year's Eve. Hop the ferry from Canal Street to Algiers Point (friendsoftheferry.org), where you can get a comparatively peaceful view of fireworks. Clad in bright colors, participants carry instruments (such as whistles) and umbrellas while parading from Keizersgracht Street past City Hall and into Rose Street. Between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m., aircraft will run hourly flyovers above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
