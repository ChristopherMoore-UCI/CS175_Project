Two years later, CEO and founder John Rigas was found guilty of conspiracy, securities fraud and bank fraud, among other charges, for raiding the company of hundreds of millions of dollars for his personal use. The victims fund amounted to nearly half of an estimated $1.5 billion in assets, including Adelphia stock worth about $567 million, that the Rigas family forfeited as part of a complex series of agreements announced by then U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. A news release from the office of Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, described the payout as the "largest single distribution to victims" in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice. His son Timothy was found guilty of conspiracy and 15 counts of securities fraud and two counts of bank fraud. -- Nearly eight years after Adelphia's founder was among those convicted for essentially looting the cable company, fraud victims can now get their share of a record $728 million fund, the top federal prosecutor in New York announced Monday.
