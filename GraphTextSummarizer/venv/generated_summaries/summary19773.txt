No trip could be complete without a trip up to Poas to see coffee plantations, beautiful views, and the slumbering but active volcano and gorgeous Botos Lake. Getting in and around Costa Rica The trip began with my flight into the San Jose area, which is where my Costa Rican host and friend, Jose, lives. I loved the Costa Rican refrain "La Pura Vida," which means "Pure Life." It seemed to be frequented mostly by Costa Rican families. The six-unit hotel has a small pool, beach furniture and clean, comfortable suites with kitchens -- including high-quality Osterizer blenders.
