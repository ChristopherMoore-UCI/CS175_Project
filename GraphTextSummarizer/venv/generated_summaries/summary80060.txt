Years ago, the president of the anti-choice Susan B. Anthony List made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under anti-choice laws was nothing more than fearmongering by pro-choice activists. But Indiana's harsh anti-abortion laws, and the broader culture that seeks to control the decisions pregnant women can make about their own bodies, make women far less likely to reach out for this help. Conservatives like to say that women are the "victims of abortion" and that laws such as the Indiana "feticide" measure are intended to "protect" them. New anti-choice restrictions and prosecutions won't change the fact that women will sometimes choose to terminate their pregnancies. But there's no escaping the reality it has been used to turn pregnant women into criminals.
