The show in question, "A Thick Red Line," explores social taboos. That episode caused an uproar in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia, where sharia, or Islamic law, is practiced. Abdul Jawad, 32, an airline employee and divorced father of four, spoke openly on the show about his sexual escapades, his love of sex and losing his virginity at age 14. Al-Jumeii doesn't represent the journalist, but said he is keeping tabs on cases dealing with "A Thick Red Line." Pre-marital sex is illegal, and unrelated men and women are not permitted to mingle.
