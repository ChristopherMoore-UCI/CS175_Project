Paul van der Sloot was briefly taken into custody in 2005 on suspicion of involvement in the Holloway case. Holloway's parents, however, have said they met with Paul van der Sloot and continue to believe he had the answers to questions regarding their daughter. Don't forget that." Holloway was last seen in the early hours of May 30, 2005, leaving an Oranjestad, Aruba, nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe. In the years since Holloway vanished, van der Sloot has consistently denied any involvement in her disappearance, police said. In it, van der Sloot tells a man he thought was a friend he had sex with Holloway on the beach after leaving the nightclub, then she "started shaking" and lost consciousness.
