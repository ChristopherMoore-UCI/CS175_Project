Hours after Ranta's release from prison, Sussman told CNN that his client intends to file a civil rights lawsuit against the city of New York and the New York Police Department. "David wants me to express appreciation to all of his supporters and well-wishers, not only from New York, but from around the world," Sussman said Saturday. "My office is happy to report that he's been stabilized and is being treated in cardiac intensive care at a metropolitan hospital," Pierre Sussman said in a statement released Saturday. CNN's Mary Snow, Aaron Cooper, Raelyn Johnson, Laura Ly and Jordana Ossad contributed to this report. "Mr. Ranta, to say that I'm sorry for what you have endured would be an understatement and grossly inadequate, but I say it to you anyway," Judge Miriam Cyrulnik said during an emotional hearing Thursday that left even the judge wiping her eyes.
