So, for at least that one day, let's just remember that America still leads the world in the principles that matter most: The rule of law, freedom of religion, equal rights, freedom from an oppressive government and, fortunately for the Philadelphia Inquirer, freedom of speech. We spend more on health care per person than Switzerland, Germany, Canada, or any other country you can think of. It just means that, for one day, I chose to celebrate the fact that America is still closer to perfect than any other country in the history of the world. But just because I had fun with friends and family doesn't mean that I believe America is perfect. We open our colleges and universities to more than 80,000 foreign professors, scholars and educators a year and we have more students in college right now than those three countries combined.
