Among the victims were 22 children and 15 women, said Nazrul Islam, the police chief of Bhola district where the accident occurred Friday. -- Authorities have recovered 54 bodies after a ferry crammed with people capsized in southern Bangladesh, police said Sunday. The boat had a capacity of 1,500 but was overcrowded with about 2,000 people who were traveling from the capital, Dhaka, to their homes in Bhola for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Adha. "Hopefully, in few hours, we should be able to confirm the exact number of missing (people)," Islam said. The boat toppled as passengers weighted down one side to disembark, Islam said.
