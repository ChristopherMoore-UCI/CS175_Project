The astronauts replaced a video camera that will monitor the docking of future Automated Transfer Vehicles, or supply ships. The spacewalk Tuesday was meant to replace a video camera and update cable connections to a module of the International Space Station. " Later, NASA spokesman Rob Navias said the object may have been a clamp used to attach cables, and it might have been left outside during a previous spacewalk. An hour or so after the first fly-by, a small round object made its way into the darkness of space. They will then attach cables connecting the rest of the station to the Russian Rassvet research module.
