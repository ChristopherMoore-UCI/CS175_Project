Steyne and Donald shared penalties before Piri Weepu's wayward pass was recovered by the Springboks and Fourie went over to punish the error. The All Blacks were trailing 17-3 early in the second half and got within four points before the Springboks sealed victory when Jaque Fourie went over eight minutes from time. The conversion was missed to complete a day of wayward kicking by the home side, but after a penalty by Donald, Steyn made no mistake the next time, with his kick three minutes from time finally ending the All Black challenge. Frans Steyn and Ruan Pienaar kicked penalties before the latter went over for the first try. -- World champions South Africa held off a second-half rally from New Zealand to win their Tri-Nations opener 28-19 in Bloemfontein on Saturday.
