According to Google Vice President Megan Smith, the percentage of women at this year's Google I/O was in the teens, up from a single-digit slice at last year's conference. "Incorporate more women into their commercials, make sure to advertise women tech-makers events throughout the year and eventually also expand the relevant age groups to focus on younger girls." Smith is influenced by the success of the Harvey Mudd school in southern California, headed up by president Maria Klawe. During his keynote address at the Google I/O developers conference this month, co-founder Larry Page said that Google had been focused on recruiting more women "forever" to ensure that the company didn't end up all male. The Women Techmakers Fireside Chat featured some of Google's high-ranking women, and the event was quickly filled to capacity with a mix of men and women. Another continuing part of Google's approach is community building for women already in the field so that they feel less isolated.
