-- One person was killed and at least 20 homes destroyed after a weekend tornado that struck a town in eastern Kansas, state officials said. The storm also damaged another 200 homes around Reading, about 100 miles southwest of Kansas City, said Sharon Watson of the Kansas Division of Emergency Management. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback issued a disaster declaration for 16 counties on Sunday, a step toward getting state and federal aid for the affected areas. It was among several storms that hit the area between 6 p.m. to midnight Saturday, authorities said. "The first significant calls of damage came in about 6:30 p.m. local in Shawnee County," Watson said.
