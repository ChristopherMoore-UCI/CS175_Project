"Part companion, part publicist, part chaperone and part guardian angel, Mr. Jones, who lives in Las Vegas and works for a pair of casino owners, specializes in setting up elaborately arranged outings for athletes where every detail from transportation and tickets to the members of the entourage is premeditated," writes Hannah Karp of The Wall Street Journal, in an article about Jones. Maloof first offered Jones a job as a personal assistant -- entertaining athletes was not in the job description. "Nowadays, armed with a complimentary suite at the casino, the keys to Mr. Maloof's Sacramento home and an allowance for first-class travel, Jones is free to perform his wingman role almost exclusively," Karp writes. He got the gig when he met Gavin Maloof, who with his brother Joe, owns the Sacramento Kings and the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas. These folks are like modern-day trailblazers; they change the routes in various settings, such as indoor climbing walls, foot trails and running races.
