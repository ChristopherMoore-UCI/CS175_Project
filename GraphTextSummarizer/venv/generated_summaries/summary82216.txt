-- Controversial breast implants made by the French company PIP do not cause cancer and are not toxic, but they do have a high rupture rate, a British Department of Health study reported Monday. German medical groups have recommended that women seek removal of the implants, saying they need not hurry but the devices could pose eventual health problems. The French government said earlier this year that it would pay for the removal of PIP implants, which a British medical group says were made from "nonmedical grade silicone believed by the manufacturers to be made for mattresses. Mas was previously arrested on January 26 in connection with an investigation for involuntary homicide and harm following the 2010 cancer death of a French woman with PIP implants. The implants are "clearly substandard," and are "significantly more likely to rupture or leak silicone than other implants," the report found.
