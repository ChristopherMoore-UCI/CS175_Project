Last year, Facebook announced Internet.org, a coalition of major tech companies working together to lower barriers to Internet access using more traditional methods, such as making it cheaper to get Internet on cell phones. Internet access is a cause major technology companies can easily get behind. The group is working with drones that can stay in the air for months at a time, bringing Internet connections to suburban areas. Two thirds of the world population does not have Internet access. Facebook's new Connectivity Lab will research and test experimental technology including drones, satellites and lasers to spread the reach of the Internet to isolated locations that currently do not have Internet.
