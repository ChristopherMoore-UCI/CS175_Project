" Domestic violence against women is not confined to economically-depressed, rural regions of eastern Turkey. Widespread violence against women "This kind of thing happens in every village," says Yeni, one of the founders of a grassroots local family protection association in the Saray district of southeastern Turkey. But barely two months later, a local criminal court asked that Sidika and her children be handed back to Faruk Platin. But Sidika's parents and siblings said Faruk Platin repeatedly threatened them when they tried to intervene. Niyazi Yakin, a member of the Kapikoy village council and a relative of Faruk Platin, says he personally asked Sidika if she was being abused, and she said no.
