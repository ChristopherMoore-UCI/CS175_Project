However, not all doctors are so conscientious about STD testing, Douglas said. A key area to work on is normalizing conversations about STDs and sexual health, he said. The report, "Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance 2007," also said that women and minorities in particular are more likely to have sexually transmitted diseases, or STDs. That fact isn't surprising, experts say, as studies on STDs in the past have also shown that women and minorities bear the greatest burden of STDs. But in the last two years, the trend has reversed, said Dr. John Douglas, director of the CDC's Division of STD Prevention.
