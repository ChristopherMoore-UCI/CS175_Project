Caught up in the bevy of activities surrounding the Medal of Honor ceremony, Meyer missed the deadline to apply to the FDNY, according to his attorney Keith Sullivan. However, we will respect the judge's decision," said Kate O'Brien Ahlers, spokeswoman for the New York City Law Department. According to Dwyer, the city generally offers the opportunity for members of the public to apply to become a New York City firefighter only every four years. Dakota Meyer, the 23-year-old Marine who received the Medal of Honor earlier this month, wants to join another well-known outfit celebrated for bravery in the face of danger, the New York City Fire Department. On September 15 Meyer met President Barack Obama and received the Medal of Honor in a ceremony at the White House.
