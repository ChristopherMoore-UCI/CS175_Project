The list of targeted fees and penalties collects $1.3 million from bingo operators, $1 million from processing child support payments, and $4.4 million for failure to remit taxes or fees. With 31 states facing budget shortfalls for next year, according to a study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, efforts to raise money from fees rather than taxes can be an attractive option. Yin says it's because public support for fees and penalties is higher than it is for taxes. Texas enacted $58.9 million in new fees and penalties while only raising $10.2 million in new taxes for 2012. "Taxes are harder to be perceived in a popular way even though taxes are largely doing the same thing [as fees and penalties]," said George Yin, a University of Virginia law professor and former counsel for the Senate Finance Committee.
