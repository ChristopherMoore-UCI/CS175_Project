" Liberman said Wednesday that Israel's allies should pay attention after the news of the Iranians plan to enter the Suez.. Millions of barrels of oil move through the Suez every day on the way to both Europe and North America. The development came a day after Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman said two Iranian warships were expected to pass through the Suez Canal Wednesday night on their way to Syria. The Suez Canal serves as a key passageway for international trade, allowing ships to navigate between Europe and Asia without having to go all the way around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. "This is a provocation that proves that the self-confidence and insolence of the Iranians is growing from day to day," he said.
