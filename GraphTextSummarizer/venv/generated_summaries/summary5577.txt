That's clearly the idea behind "Fun Size," which tells the story of a smart and responsible high-school senior (Nickelodeon's Victoria Justice) whose All Hallow's Eve turns into a disastrous adventure in babysitting. But it's the perfect setting for the brand of teen comedies that made John Hughes and Chris Columbus famous. You'd hope that "Gossip Girl" creator Josh Schwartz, directing for the first time, would have a better feel for such matter, but "Fun Size" blatantly and lazily traces mediocre versions of the genre. There remains a huge market for a great Halloween teen comedy, but "Fun Size" is the disappointing apple that your crazy-haired neighbor gives you instead of candy. Handler, on the other hand, looks literally pained, and fans of the talented comedian will wonder why she's already taking thankless mom roles after films like Bridesmaids proved a market for brassy female-driven comedies.
