The indictment states that Bosnian Serb forces acted under Karadzic's direction and worked to "significantly reduce the Bosnian Muslim, Bosnian Croat and other non-Serb populations" in municipalities that were seized. -- Radovan Karadzic, whose Interpol charges listed "flamboyant behavior" as a distinguishing characteristic, was a practicing psychiatrist who came to be nicknamed the "Butcher of Bosnia." Twice indicted in 1995 by the U.N. International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Karadzic faces charges of genocide over the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, and nine other charges related to ethnic violence during the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. During the next three years, he ordered Bosnian Serb forces to seize the majority of Bosnia and Herzegovina. From May 1992, the indictment alleged, Bosnian Serb forces under Mladic's command targeted civilian areas of Sarajevo with shelling and sniping during a three-year conflict within the city. Answering to him, according to the indictment, was Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic.
