Since Gingrich's first election to the House, 40 Republicans have entered the House and then moved on to the Senate. I am writing a book about these senators, who I call "Gingrich senators," because they so seamlessly infected the Senate with the same hyper-partisanship that pervaded the House. The current squabbling between the House and the Senate on the payroll tax cut extension perfectly epitomizes why congressional approval is in the single digits. What is less well known is that members who previously served with Gingrich in the House spread these highly partisan tactics to the Senate. Gingrich's strategy was successful in 1994 when the Republicans won a majority in the House and the Senate.
