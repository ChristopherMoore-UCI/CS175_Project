" Allen's deputy, Rear Adm. James Watson, has given BP until Sunday to provide alternative plans that adequately address substantially higher rates of oil flow. BP said it collected more than 15,000 barrels of oil on Saturday and more than 7,700 by noon Sunday. The sensors were requested by federal experts who have been trying to gauge how much oil has been pouring from the well, which experts say could have been spewing as much as 1.7 million gallons of oil a day into the Gulf. White House adviser David Axelrod said Sunday the Obama administration wants BP to set up a massive, independently administered fund for cleaning up the oil-stricken Gulf states. -- BP began deploying pressure sensors on its ruptured undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday in an effort to fine-tune estimates of the worst oil spill in U.S. history, government and company officials said.
