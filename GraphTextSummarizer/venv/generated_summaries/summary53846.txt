Though tea party leaders maintain the movement will not become a political party and comprises activists of all political stripes, Kremer said most tea partiers expected better from their GOP elected officials. On the campaign trail, the support of tea party groups has helped launch campaigns and is a force candidates ignore at their peril. "We're not a protest movement anymore; we've morphed into something else," said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, which has helped support tea party groups around the country. Candidates Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul have enjoyed strong early support from tea party groups and are working to leverage that momentum into victories in states such as South Carolina. For those who doubt the movement has moved toward the mainstream, the Tea Party Express will join CNN on Monday night to host a nationally televised forum where eight GOP presidential candidates will vie for tea party support.
