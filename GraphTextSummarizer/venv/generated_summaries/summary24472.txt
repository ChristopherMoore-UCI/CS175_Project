French military planes have been flying reconnaissance missions from the airport in Niamey, Niger's capital, trying to locate the hostages or their abductors. All the hostages said they are French and gave the names of French cities as their hometowns. French director Michel Germaneau was abducted in Niger and executed in July in nearby Mauritania. On the recording, four men and one woman are heard giving information, including name, age, nationality, hometown, job title and marital status. The French foreign ministry Thursday said a photograph of seven hostages in Niger -- including five French nationals -- has been authenticated and is an "encouraging sign" showing the hostages are alive.
