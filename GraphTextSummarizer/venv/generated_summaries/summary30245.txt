CNN: What about nuclear proliferation, the potential for spread of nuclear weapons due to greater use of nuclear power? The figure I quoted at TED was that 21 nations have nuclear power, only seven have nuclear weapons, and in every case they got the nuclear weapons first, then the nuclear power. CNN: Some critics of nuclear power say that it takes so long to license and build nuclear power plants it's not really a practical alternative? Well, things like, nuclear radiation is a terrible thing that we must all fear at any scale, and nuclear waste a thing that we must be horrified about, with it lasting hundreds of thousands of years and how dare we burden future generations with that. And the rest of the story on that is the next generation of reactors, the so-called fourth-generation reactors, most of them use what we now call nuclear waste as fuel.
