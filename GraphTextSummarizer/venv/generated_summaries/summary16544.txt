In states where the flu season started earlier, it may be slowing down, but there are still weeks of flu left. That strain of virus is "nastier," according to Frieden, and generally makes people sicker and results in more hospitalizations and deaths. At a press conference Friday in Atlanta, CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said the season has been particularly bad for people 65 and older. The CDC reports that most states are seeing widespread cases of flu. Frieden advises doctors to treat people who are sick with the flu with anti-viral medications.
