Ruddiman has studied and researched the idea of ancient man contributing to climate change for years now. He added, "There are actually studies showing if you cut down forests for farmland, you actually cool the planet, because of the glare from the cleared land." Ruddiman and study co-author Erle Ellis, an ecologist with UMBC, acknowledge that some models of past land use show it's only been in the past 150 years -- with a huge population explosion, the onset of the Industrial Age and the rise of fossil-fuel burning -- that global warming has accelerated. Lead study author William Ruddiman is a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia and a climate scientist. Caldeira told CNN that while ancient farmers may have played a tiny role in climate change, "it just wasn't a significant factor." Ruddiman said that starting thousands of years ago, people would burn down a forest, poke a hole in the soil between the stumps, drop seeds in the holes and grow a crop on that land until the nutrients were tapped out of the soil.
