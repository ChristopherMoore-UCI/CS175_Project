-- California Gov. Jerry Brown will seek an immediate stay of what he called an "unprecedented" federal court order to release almost 10,000 inmates to relieve prison overcrowding by the end of the year, he said Thursday. On Thursday, the three U.S. District Court judges expressed impatience with California officials, the defendants in the case. A three-judge federal court panel ordered the state to reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design capacity by December 31 and threatened to find the state in contempt if California does not report on its progress every two weeks, Thursday's ruling said. The Supreme Court in 2011 found that California's shortcomings in prison medical and mental health care resulted in "needless suffering and death" and recognized the federal court's prison reduction order was "of unprecedented sweep and extent," Thursday's ruling said. In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a three-judge federal panel's determination that California's medical and mental health care for inmates falls below a constitutional level of care and that the only way to meet the requirements is by reducing prison crowding.
