The medication produced dramatic weight loss in clinical trials, but some are concerned over potential side effects, including increased heart rate, birth defects and other issues. The 4,430 overweight and obese patients in the Qsymia studies experienced various levels of weight loss. "I believe that if the public were to 'buy' (Qsymia) after FDA approval, it would run the risk of severe, even fatal, consequences from another diet lemon," Dr. Michael Lauer writes in Annals of Internal Medicine, also noting that the drug led to a slight increase in heart rates. Patients in clinical trials experienced more dramatic weight loss with Qsymia than with Belviq. One of the ingredients in Qsymia is topiramate, an anti-convulsant that has been linked to birth defects such as cleft lip and cleft palate in babies born to women who have taken it for migraines or seizures.
