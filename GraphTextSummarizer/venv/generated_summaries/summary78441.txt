Scot Stephen Gallacher, a former Dunhill winner, was making superb last day progress until he accidentally played the ball of an amateur partner Steve Halsall on the 16th fairway. -- Branden Grace duly completed his front running victory at the Dunhill Links Championships Sunday after coming under last round pressure from Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen at St Andrews. "It feels awesome," the South African told the official European Tour website after a victory that has lifted him to third in the The Race to Dubai. Grace, winning for the fifth time in a superb 2012, four coming on the European Tour, ended two ahead of Olesen after carding a final round 70 for a record 22-under total in the tournament. European Ryder Cup heroes Martin Kaymer and Peter Hanson finished in a tie for 34th.
