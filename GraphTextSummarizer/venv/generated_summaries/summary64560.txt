The man in his 40s was in a group of three snowmobile drivers who triggered the avalanche, said Sheriff Brian Gootkin of Gallatin County. Authorities suspended recovery efforts for the night and will send a helicopter Thursday morning to retrieve the body. The county was under an avalanche warning after 8 inches of snow that was preceded by rain Tuesday evening. -- A man snowmobiling in Montana died when an avalanche buried him near Big Sky resort, authorities said. "It was not a good recipe," Gootkin said.
