The agreement for the Afghan delegation to meet Baradar was made Tuesday in London where British Prime Minister David Cameron held talks on the Afghan peace process and other issues with Karzai and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The delegation of the Afghan High Peace Council will hold talks with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, a former Taliban leader who was released last month from detention by Pakistani authorities. The planned visit plays into efforts to pursue peace in war-torn Afghanistan, where NATO and Afghan troops have been fighting the Taliban for more than a decade. -- An Afghan delegation plans to travel to Pakistan to hold talks with one of the founding members of the Taliban, the Afghan president's office said Wednesday. It is the latest gesture by Sharif's government, which took office this year, to improve ties with neighboring Afghanistan.
