Her adoptive parents, whom she calls "my appropriators," told her both of her biological parents had died in a Buenos Aires shootout in February 1976. The Argentinian Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF by its Spanish acronym) announced this week that forensic and DNA tests prove that human remains found in a Uruguayan cemetery are those of Roque Orlando Montenegro, known as "Toti," who went missing in February 1976 when he was 20 years old. The Argentinian mother of three, who lives in Buenos Aires, this week received confirmation that a body found in a Uruguayan cemetery is that of her father, Roque Orlando Montenegro, who disappeared in 1976 when she was just a few days old. Luis Fondevrider, president of EAAF, said that identifying the remains of Montenegro was a process that started 10 years ago in Colonia, Uruguay, across the Rio de La Plata from Buenos Aires. Victoria Montenegro had been seeking the truth about her father since she learned in the year 2000, when she was 24 years old, that the military couple who raised her were not her biological parents.
