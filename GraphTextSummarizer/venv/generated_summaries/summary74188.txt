Mallo has been keeping a low profile after suggesting the HUA's offer of World Cup trips had a political motivation. Adang did express his concerns over HUA's proposed World Cup deal, though. The link with the government was seemingly given credence when prominent HUA figure Marcelo Mallo -- a man who previously campaigned for former Argentina president Nestor Kirchner, the husband of current incumbent Cristina -- claimed fans from the barra could become "tools at the government's disposal" through their activity with the NGO. The idea was the brainchild of a non-government organization called Hinchadas Unidas Argentinas (Argentine Fans United) who claimed the scheme would reduce violence by bringing fans together. " However, prominent pressure group Salvemos al Futbol (Let's Save Football) -- a fans organization committed to increasing transparency and reducing violence in the game -- is convinced the government and the HUA are entwined.
