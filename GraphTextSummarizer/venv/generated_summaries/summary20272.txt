Richards wouldn't say how much he's spent on lights, just that it's less than the event brings in for charity. "It's like walking through a tunnel of lights with synchronized music," he said. The lawyer and his family strung more than a half a million bulbs around their house in the Australian capital city of Canberra to reclaim the title for lights on a residential property. In case you're wondering, that's 31 miles of lights. "I got the last bulb up last night just before Guinness arrived," he said Monday.
