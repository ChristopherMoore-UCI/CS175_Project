The attacks were stopped within a few hours in each case, said Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt. If they use their Facebook password for other sites, they should change those passwords as well. Once Facebook learns of a phishing attack, either by members notifying the company or employees noticing that a URL is being distributed to a lot of people, the company deletes the URL from members' pages, blocks fresh postings, and removes the redirect to the URL that appears in e-mail messages, Schnitt said. Unsuspecting Facebook users get a message from a friend urging them to "check this out" and including a link to a Web page that appears to be a Facebook log-in page, but it is a fake site that steals their information when they type in their username and password. To protect against phishing scams, Facebook users should make sure that the URL they are visiting says "www.facebook.com."
