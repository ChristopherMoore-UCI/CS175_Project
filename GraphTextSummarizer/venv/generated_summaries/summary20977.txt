Still, other laws -- such as those against  "shameless public acts" -- have been used in recent years to arrest and prosecute gay men in recent years, Ahram Online notes. The authority's spokesman, Hisham Abdel-Hamid, said the inspection found that they "have never had sex with other men." Very soon after, on September 8, Egypt's forensic authority announced that seven of the arrested men had been physically inspected and were determined to be "not gay," according to another Ahram Online story. The men will face three years of probation upon their release, according to Egypt's state-run Ahram Online. In September, a judicial source told Ahram that six men were arrested and soon thereafter sentenced to two years in jail with labor for "committing debauchery" after an apartment raid.
