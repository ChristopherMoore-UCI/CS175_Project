The agreement also includes a promise to consider abolishing military tribunals and to consider adopting a 1952 law that opposition groups hope would prevent former President Hosni Mubarak's National Democratic Party from having a role in national politics for up to 10 years. Military leaders plan more meetings with political parties to iron out more differences, said Major Alaa Iraqi, a spokesman for the Supreme Council. The coalition of parties had also sought an agreement to hold presidential elections immediately after parliamentary voting scheduled for November, as well as a promise to hand control to a civilian government next year. The agreement, reached Saturday, includes promises to open more Egyptian parliament seats to political parties and consider canceling the country's emergency law. The Egyptian cabinet is scheduled to meet Tuesday to discuss an agreement between political groups and the ruling military council on election policies, the status of the country's unpopular emergency law and other issues.
