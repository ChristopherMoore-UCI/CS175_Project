But since ratings aren't as strong as they used to be -- the show's averaging a 1.1 rating among adults women 18-49, down 21 percent from last year -- and given how Katie Couric's syndicated talk show is coming to ABC stations this fall, it's still possible that the good people of Port Charles may lose their home in daytime. Though "All My Children" and "One Life to Live" are history, "General Hospital" -- for now -- is firmly ensconced in ABC's daytime lineup. A move to summer nights would certainly buy ABC some good will with daytime fans, who are still reeling over the cancellations of "AMC" and "OLTL" -- especially since a plan to continue them online was quashed late last year. But it could have a future in primetime: EW has confirmed that ABC entertainment chief Paul Lee is pondering one scenario that would allow the soap to air as an evening summer series. Back when Katie Couric's talk show deal with ABC-Disney was announced, the company also said it would be giving the last hour of daytime back to its affiliates in September 2012.
