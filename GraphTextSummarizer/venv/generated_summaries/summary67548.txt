-- Dozens of oil tankers carrying fuel for NATO forces caught fire Saturday after gunmen attacked in Pakistan's western Baluchistan province, local police said. The attack is the latest in a series of strikes against vehicles in Pakistan carrying fuel for NATO forces in Afghanistan. Ihsan Ullah Ihsan, a spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, said Wednesday's attack was carried out by a special squad created especially to attack American assets in Pakistan as a response to the increase in suspected U.S. drone strikes. Unknown assailants attacked 28 vehicles with a machine gun and rockets, said Meeran Bukhsh, a police official in the Bolan district. The convoys are generally operated by contracted Pakistani firms, using Pakistani trucks and drivers.
