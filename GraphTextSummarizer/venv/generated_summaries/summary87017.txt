Hillary Clinton stood with those protesting the deaths of two unarmed black males at the hands of law enforcement on Thursday, telling an audience in Boston that "our country deserves a full and fair accounting" of what happened. "Each of us has to grapple with some hard truths about race and justice in America," Clinton said. "We all know there are decent, honorable, brave police officers out in our communities every single day," Clinton said, before telling the audience the fact that African-American males are more likely to end up in prison than their white counterparts was a byproduct of an "out of balance" criminal justice system. Clinton identified with both the peaceful protestors and law enforcement during her speech. " Clinton also called out the federal government for sending military-style equipment -- which Clinton called "weapons of war" -- to local police forces.
