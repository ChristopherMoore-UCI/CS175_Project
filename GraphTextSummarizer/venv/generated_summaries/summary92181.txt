The British team have tasted victory in the last two rounds of the world championship, with Hamilton, 26, taking the checkered flag in Germany and his compatriot and teammate Jenson Button claiming maximum points in Hungary last weekend. " Hamilton, who has registered two wins so far this season, led for large parts of Sunday's Hungaroring race and battled for first place with Button before slumping to a fourth place finish. Despite their recent form, McLaren are still some way behind Red Bull and their reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel, who currently leads the drivers' standings and is 88-points clear of Hamilton in third position. Formula One's mid-season break may have only just begun, but McLaren's Lewis Hamilton says he "can't wait" for the competition to resume in Belgium later this month. This sport is all about pushing the limits, and having a teammate that challenges you is part of that." Hamilton and Button will next take to the track for the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa on August 28.
