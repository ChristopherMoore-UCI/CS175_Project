-- Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, who was due in court Thursday for his trial, has been hospitalized after falling ill, his lawyer told CNN. That month, Musharraf declared a state of emergency, suspended Pakistan's constitution, replaced the chief judge and blacked out independent TV outlets. " Musharraf could be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty if convicted on charges of treason. "Gen. Musharraf has full faith in the judiciary and trusts the legal system to clear his name," Aasia Ishaque told CNN. Musharraf said he did so to stabilize the country and to fight rising Islamist extremism.
