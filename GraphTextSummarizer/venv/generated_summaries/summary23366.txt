The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services said approximately 3,600 Liberian nationals are facing delayed enforced departure, but Liberian community leaders think the number may be twice that because, they said, many Liberians went underground and did not reregister with immigration services, knowing the delayed enforced departure status meant leaving the country. In 2007, citing the progress in Liberia, President George W. Bush signed an order of "delayed enforced departure" for Liberians who had been under temporary protection status, giving them 18 months to return to Liberia. Temporary protection status is an immigration status somewhere between political asylum and refugee status. Seyondi Roberts, a hairdresser, said 65 percent of her customers are Liberians facing delayed enforced departure. He and his wife were granted temporary protection status but now both face deportation.
