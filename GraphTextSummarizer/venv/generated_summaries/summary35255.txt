And Americans now trust Republicans in Congress more to do what's best for the nation than Obama, by 47-42 percent. Forty-four percent believe it will be Obama's fault, while 42 percent blame Republicans. But while Americans might be split on how to tackle the country's immigration problem, they agree on one thing — that shutting down the government is not an appropriate response to Obama's move, a tactic floated by some Republicans. According to the poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University and published Tuesday, just 45 percent of Americans believe Obama should issue an executive order to address the immigration issue if Congress fails to act, while 48 percent oppose such a move. While the poll shows a majority of Americans, 51 percent, are happy the GOP has taken over the Senate, two-thirds of the nation expects more gridlock over the next two years, and they're split over who will be to blame.
