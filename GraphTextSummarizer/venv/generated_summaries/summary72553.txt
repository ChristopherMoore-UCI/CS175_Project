Sarasota, Florida-based L-3 Communications Aviation Recorders makes about 60% of flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorders used on U.S. aircraft, according to vice president of engineering Tom Schmutz. Here's how advocates say such a system would work: Currently flight data recorders use computer chips to record information about how the plane is working in flight. Jim Cash, the NTSB's chief technical adviser for vehicle recorders, who's been studying flight recorder technology for decades, is optimistic about a solution. Two years ago in Washington, the Air France crash spurred U.S. aviation safety officials to look into uplinking critical flight data to orbiting satellites from airplanes flying across vast oceans. The time saved by having immediate access to aircraft data offers critical safety benefits, said Feith, because experts could warn airlines sooner about potential equipment problems blamed for the crash.
