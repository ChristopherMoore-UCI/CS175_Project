A young Reggie Lewis, wearing his  No. 35 Boston Celtics jersey, dominates the middle of the 11-foot-by-14-foot artwork. Lifetiles don't use electricity, moving parts or tricky lighting -- just an elaborate and painstaking process done out of Seder's Eye Think Inc. studio near Boston. Seder patented the painstaking technique but thinks most other artists wouldn't have his patience, even if they had his know-how. "I started making movies when I was 12 years old," he said, "so I was always into motion pictures and especially into optical tricks and techniques that trick the eye." Although his books' success have gained Seder some newfound publicity, the Lifetiles are truly his life's work.
