The news came after word that police were searching for a person who called in a bomb threat during the visitation Thursday night for Kaufman County District Attorney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, at a church in Wortham. While authorities have not publicly named any suspects or a potential motive in the cases, Kaufman sheriff's deputies arrested two men this week and accused them of threatening the safety of public officials. -- As friends and family attended a private funeral for a Texas prosecutor and his wife who were gunned down in their Kaufman County home, investigators on Friday announced the arrest of a man accused of threatening the safety of a deputy district attorney. The McLellands' bodies were discovered on March 30 at their home, almost exactly two months after McLelland's chief felony prosecutor, Mark Hasse, was killed in a daytime shooting outside the county courthouse. The couple's bodies were found inside their home in Kaufman County.
