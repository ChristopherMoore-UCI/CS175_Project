Last month, a public information broadcast on Tibetan television outlined, in great detail, collective punishment measures for communities where self-immolations take place: the families of those who set fire to themselves will have any state benefits removed, communities where protests take place will not receive investment for local projects for three years; government officials will be "removed." Although protests by fire have captured the attention of the international media, there are other protests across Tibet that have not gained such coverage. -- As I write, we have just received news of what we believe to be the 29th Tibetan in the past month to set fire to themselves in protest at Chinese rule in Tibet. Free Tibet has documented a number of incidents of collective punishment of communities where protests have taken place. At Free Tibet we have seen protesters die from their injuries and survivors disappear by Chinese state authorities. Over five days in January, in three separate incidents, Free Tibet received reports that five Tibetans were shot dead, many more wounded, when security forces opened fire on peaceful protesters.
