For last year's event, a giant game of Pong set the Guinness World Record for the "Largest Architectural Video Game Display." Frank Lee, director of Drexel University's Entrepreneurial Game Studio, used the Cira Centre's own LED arrays to transform it into a fully interactive version of "Tetris." "Have you ever seen square patterns in a wall, floor or building that look like 'Tetris' blocks? " "Tetris" is one of the top selling video games of all time, with the Game Boy version appearing at No. 6 in the "Guinness World Records 2014 Gamer's Edition." That's called the Tetris effect," explained Rogers. That is a dream come true for the hundreds of millions of 'Tetris' players around the world.
