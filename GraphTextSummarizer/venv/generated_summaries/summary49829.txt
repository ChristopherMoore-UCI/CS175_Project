In his argument against the amendment, Indiana delegate Jim Bopp characterized civil unions as "counterfeit marriage." Bopp, an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, pointed to the popularity of constitutional amendments that ban same-sex marriage and argued that the party benefits politically from its opposition to it. Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council, made a strong argument against Fenton's motion, calling "traditional marriage" a cornerstone of a healthy society. "As a Roman Catholic, there's nobody in this room who believes (more than I do) that the definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, but those are my religious beliefs," Fenton said as she made the motion Monday. The draft affirmed the support of state constitutional amendment efforts under way to restrict same-sex marriage. "This suggests that strongly supporting traditional marriage is actually quite popular and would enhance the support of our candidates," Bopp said.
