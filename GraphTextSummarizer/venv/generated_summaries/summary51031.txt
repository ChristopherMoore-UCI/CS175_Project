Romney to speak at California RNC meeting Bush has a full slate of fundraisers for both his Right to Rise leadership PAC and the Right to Rise super PAC, an independent committee that would be likely to support his presidential bid. Bush will then head out to the desert for two Right to Rise super PAC fundraisers, followed by an evening reception to benefit the leadership PAC. On Thursday in Los Angeles, the former Florida governor is the featured guest at a reception and discussion for his Right to Rise leadership PAC co-hosted by Brad Freeman, a close friend and top financial backer of his brother, President George W. Bush. Another member of the host committee is former ambassador Charles J. Swindells, who was appointed as U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand and Samoa by President George W. Bush. Former Missouri Sen. John Danforth, who was considered as a vice presidential running mate for President Bush and later served as his special envoy to the Sudan and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, will be on the honorary host committee for the evening Indian Wells fundraiser, as well as the earlier events to benefit the Bush-aligned super PAC.
