The complexity of transplants Federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012, but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed. An August 7 letter from the hospital, which Bell provided to CNN, said that "Anthony is currently not a transplant candidate due to having a history of noncompliance, which is one of our center's contraindications to listing for heart transplant." Noncompliance generally means that doctors doubt that a patient will take his medicine or go to follow-up appointments. Caplan said Anthony should be counseled and worked with intensively so he understands what's expected post-transplant. It's about the same for heart transplants, as well, he said. Teenagers aren't automatically ruled out for heart transplants, but "the consequence that 'you are going to die if you don't take these medicines' is far from the mind of a 17-year-old," said Davies, the cardiothoracic surgeon.
