A high priority will be the restoration of human rights, which have been badly eroded in recent years. Hopefully, those working to establish democratic practices and institutions worldwide will seize upon this development and convince their own fellow citizens that democracy and human rights are worth the struggle. For years, these activists have told us that when the United States engaged in torture and indefinite detention, their decades of struggle for rights began to erode. While the U.S. government has much work to do in this regard, there will have to be a concerted international effort to achieve meaningful protection of human rights, even as the issue of security continues to demand our attention.
