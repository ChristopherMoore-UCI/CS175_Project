-- India detains hundreds of people each year without charge or trial to "keep them out of circulation" in the northern state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to a new report released Monday by Amnesty International. The Amnesty report estimated that between 8,000 and 20,000 people were detained in the past two decades; 322 of them were held between January and September of last year when a wave of unrest swept the region and people took to the streets in deadly anti-government protests. Amnesty said the Indian government has relied on the safety act in dealing with a resurgence of street protests. "Despite this apparent shift in the nature of the unrest, Jammu and Kashmir authorities continue to rely on the PSA rather than attempting to charge and try those suspected of committing criminal acts," Zarifi said. "The Jammu and Kashmir authorities are using PSA detentions as a revolving door to keep people they can't or won't convict through proper legal channels locked up and out of the way," said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Director. The Indian state is divided into mostly Hindu Jammu and Muslim Kashmir, where many residents argue that the territory should have been a part of Pakistan when the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947.
