Both Paradis and Giangrande are among the growing number of members of Facebook fan pages dedicated to Super Bowl commercials. Giangrande says he enjoys the beer ads and prefers commercials that make him laugh, too. Although 106.5 million people tuned into last year's Super Bowl, it's the buzz before, during and after the game about an ad that advertisers really care about. Viewers interested in the ads this year will get to view a variety of spots featuring beer, soda, cars -- and celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Justin Bieber and Ozzy Osbourne, to name a few.
