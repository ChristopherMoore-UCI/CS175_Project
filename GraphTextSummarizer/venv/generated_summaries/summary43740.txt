In the evening, a string of anti-World Cup protests were staged in different cities. Across the country in Recife, also a World Cup venue, soldiers were deployed to rein in crime and looting after police went on strike there. Anti-World Cup protesters and homeless activists vowed to keep up the pressure through the global event that ends on July 13. Taking advantage of the global attention focused on the country for the world soccer championship, other groups are staging protests to air their grievances. With barely a month until the World Cup opens in Brazil, violent protests and strikes are breaking out across the country by groups angry about the changes the sporting event has brought -- and what it hasn't.
