Daccache said: "They are in prison, but many of have said they feel free for the first time because it's the first time they can talk about anything they want. They are not saying their crimes were the best solution, but in some ways they had no other choice." Daccache said several other inmates were in jail for drug trafficking and their young children were left on the streets. Many of the women have themselves been victims of circumstance all their lives and are now for the first time discovering they have a voice, according to Zeina Daccache, an actress and drama therapist working with the inmates. Libya's accidental child victims Daccache, who has a weekly political satire show on Lebanese television and also runs a drama therapy center Catharsis, said the project -- funded by the Swiss-based Drosos Foundation -- had empowered the women and for the first time gave them an opportunity to express themselves.
