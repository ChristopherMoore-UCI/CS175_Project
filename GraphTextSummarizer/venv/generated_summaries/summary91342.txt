The Greece-based Louis Cruise Lines ship was in the Mediterranean north of Barcelona when it was hit by three "abnormal" waves, each about 26 feet (9 meters) high, cruise line spokesman Michael Maratheftis said. Fourteen others were treated aboard the ship for light injuries but were hospitalized as a precaution when the ship returned to Barcelona on Wednesday night, Maratheftis said. The passengers, including three Americans, were from 27 nations, Maratheftis said in phone interviews from Cyprus. All of the passengers were to be flown home on Thursday from Barcelona at the expense of Louis Cruise Lines, Maratheftis said. "The next cruise has been canceled," and the Louis Majesty will remain in Barcelona for repairs, Maratheftis said.
