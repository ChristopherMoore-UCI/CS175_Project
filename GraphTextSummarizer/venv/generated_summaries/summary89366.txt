The barge was empty at the time of the initial explosion Wednesday night, but authorities believe a spark ignited vapors in it, causing an explosion that ignited a second barge, CNN affiliate WALA TV reported, citing Coast Guard Lt. -- A fire that sparked huge explosions and injured three workers on a pair of Mobile River barges is out, the U.S. Coast Guard said Thursday. Three workers who were preparing the barges for reloading Wednesday night were severely burned, according to Mobile fire officials. At the Fort Conde Inn across the river they sounded like "planes above you dropping bombs," general manager Alan Waugh told WALA Wednesday.
