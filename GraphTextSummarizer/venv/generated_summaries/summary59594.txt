-- Queen Elizabeth II's annual budget this year is £38.2 million ($57.8 million), down from £41.5 million ($62.8 million) last year, Buckingham Palace announced Monday. The drop comes mostly because the queen took fewer charter flights this year and refunded money to the government after selling her old helicopter, the palace said in its annual financial statement for the royal household. Queen Elizabeth II is worth an estimated £290 million ($446 million), making her the 245th richest person in the United Kingdom, according to The Sunday Times newspaper's annual rich list published in April. The budget runs from April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010. Her annual spending has fallen by 17 percent in real terms since 2001, the palace said.
