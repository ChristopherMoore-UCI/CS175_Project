The potential longer-term implications of the Akin controversy also were evident in Republican calls for him to withdraw from his Senate race where incumbent Democrat Claire McCaskill has been trailing in the polls. Jennifer Duffy, a senior editor at the Cook Political Report, said Akin potentially reignited the "war on women" rhetoric that factored prominently in the political debate earlier this year and for a time put Republicans on the defensive. President Barack Obama handily won over women voters in the 2008 election and holds an edge with that key bloc in his race with Romney, polls show. But Democrats sensed a political opening to shift the conversation away from the sluggish economy, saying that Republicans led by Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, were pushing policies that were anti-women. The Romney campaign has adopted a message that Democrats are the ones waging a "war on women."
