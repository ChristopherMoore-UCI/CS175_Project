-- The Alexander McQueen fashion house denied Sunday that it is designing the wedding dress of Kate Middleton, who's marrying Britain's Prince William next month. The Sunday Times says Middleton will wear a dress designed by Sarah Burton, the creative director of Alexander McQueen. Prince William, the second in line to the British throne, is marrying his college girlfriend Middleton at Westminster Abbey on April 29. But the newspaper claims Middleton was impressed by a wedding dress Burton designed for the daughter of Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the wife of Prince Charles. "This is not true," spokeswoman Myriam Coudoux said when CNN asked if McQueen creative director Sarah Burton was designing the dress.
