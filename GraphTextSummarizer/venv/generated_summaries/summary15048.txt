West's comments were simply extensions of U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann's infamous statement in 2008 about how then-candidate Barack Obama -- and many Democratic members of Congress -- held "anti-American views. It will only stop when members of the two parties start condemning extreme comments made by members of their own team. Fundraising off extreme statements is just the latest innovation -- something even more cynical than anything Joe McCarthy might have tried. "I have here in my hand a list of 205 communists ..." The ghost of Joe McCarthy's ulcerous accusations hung over a disturbingly casual comment this past week by U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Florida. This is the reason people were understandably offended at Miami Manager Ozzie Guillen's recent comments professing admiration for Cuban Communist dictator Fidel Castro.
