Britain's Royal Mint has unveiled a new portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, which will gradually appear on coins in the United Kingdom. "This change of royal portrait will make 2015 a vintage year for UK coins, and it will be hugely exciting for us all to see the new design appear on the coins we use every day. " Royal coinage portraits are usually updated every 15 to 20 years, the Royal Mint said. Capturing a portrait on the surface of a coin demands the utmost skill, and is one of the most challenging disciplines of the coin designer's art," chief executive Adam Lawrence said. It is the fifth portrait of the British monarch to be used on coins during her 63-year reign.
