Karzai also discusses Afghanistan's future relationship with the United States and his country's efforts to deal with the Taliban in the exclusive interview, to be broadcast Sunday on Fareed Zakaria GPS. Looking to the future, Karzai said the West should have confidence in Afghanistan's judicial processes after international forces withdraw. -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has said that a rape victim freed from prison after he intervened on her behalf has the right to make her own choice about whether to marry her attacker. "I can assure you that, once the international forces are withdrawn and not as many as there are today, Afghanistan will neither go into a trouble within the country or strife or into miscarriage of justice. A key problem is that Afghan law fails to clearly distinguish between rape and adultery, which is a crime under Sharia, or Islamic law.
