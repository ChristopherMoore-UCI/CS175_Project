Hundreds of dolphins that washed up on Peruvian shores died of natural causes, a government official said in a radio interview Tuesday. "One of the things that we can confirm is that ... the deaths of the dolphins were not caused by any human activity, and this is a very important subject," Peruvian Production Minister Gladys Triveno told RPP Radio. The report explained that the dead dolphins began washing up on the shore before the seismic activity started and that similar activity in the past has not been linked to marine deaths. This month, Peruvian authorities said warm waters off that country's coast were to blame for the deaths of more than 5,000 marine birds. The results ruled out a number of theories of the cause of death.
