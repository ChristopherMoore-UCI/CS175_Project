With Funes' win, El Salvador joined other Latin American countries that have elected leftist leaders in recent years -- Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Argentina, Honduras, Guatemala, Ecuador and Brazil. "Once Funes assumes office on 1 June, his government will face major challenges to boost the economy, cut government expenditures to trim the fiscal deficit and maintain support to the poor, who are being hit hardest by the economic downturn," analyst Heather Berkman wrote in a report last week for the Eurasia Group consulting firm. "This country is completely divided," ARENA party official Adolfo Torres said on CNN affiliate TCS TV on election night. "Cutting expenditures and reducing the deficit will be the most important challenges," Berkman wrote, adding that to "do this, the Funes administration plans to cut government spending and eliminate redundant presidential commissions; retarget propane subsidies (and perhaps eventually eliminate them); and propose a number of new taxes on alcoholic beverages, tobacco and new vehicles." Funes campaigned on a platform of fiscal reform that aims to increase the government's tax take incrementally, Berkman said. "The Salvadoran public asked for a change, and that change begins now," Funes said in an inauguration speech before an audience that included Latin American leaders and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
