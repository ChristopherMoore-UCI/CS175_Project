Before the rule, airlines could advertise the base fare or show it on the first screen of online fare results, adding taxes and fees later in the shopping process. The message: "New government regulations require us to HIDE taxes in your fares. "We are simply requiring airlines to post the full fare, and we leave it to them to break it down if they want," DOT spokesman Bill Mosley said. I'm not sure that's what our founding fathers had in mind," said Boxer spokesman Andy Stone, noting that the Department of Transportation has fined Spirit in the past for deceptive price advertising. Spirit Airlines isn't happy with the new airline price advertising rule.
