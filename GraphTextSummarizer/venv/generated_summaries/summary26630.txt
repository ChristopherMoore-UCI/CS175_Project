Inside the car, according to McCauley, Hernandez told Lloyd he was angry because of Lloyd's behavior at a Boston club they had gone to together several days earlier. Hernandez is accused in last week's shooting death of Odin Lloyd, whose body was found in an industrial park area less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Authorities charged former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez with first-degree murder on Wednesday, hours after police arrested him and the NFL team that once gave him a $40 million contract dropped him from its roster. Hernandez's American dream turns into nightmare scenario Investigation continues For several days, investigators searched the area near Hernandez's home as they investigated Lloyd's death. Earlier that same day, around 2:30 a.m., the prosecutor said, the 27-year-old Lloyd was seen leaving his Boston home with Hernandez in a silver Nissan Altima.
