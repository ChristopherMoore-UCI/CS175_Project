The fire broke out around 2 p.m. in Kalamazoo, said Brian Uridge, assistant chief of public safety. "Initially, we have information that the kids were left alone in the apartment, but we can't talk about charges because it's too early in the investigation," Uridge said. Two of the children were 3 years old, and the third was 1, Uridge said. "You could see smoke from blocks away," Uridge said. The children's parents were at the scene, Uridge said.
