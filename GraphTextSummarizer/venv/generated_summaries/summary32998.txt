Neera Tanden, one of Hillary Clinton's longtime confidants and former policy adviser, dropped whatever coyness was left regarding the former secretary of state's all-but-certain presidential run at an event on Tuesday night. Addressing an audience of about 150 people at an Asian-American and Pacific Islander Ready for Hillary event, Tanden -- president of the Center for American Progress -- said she was looking forward to seeing everyone in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. When Clinton ran for Senate in 2000, Tanden was her deputy campaign manager and issues director and went on to serve as legislative director in Clinton's Senate office. When Clinton ran for president, Tanden served as policy director and adviser. "When you are making decisions, whether you are secretary of state, or senator, first lady, or future president, it matters who is at that table," Tanden said at the event.
