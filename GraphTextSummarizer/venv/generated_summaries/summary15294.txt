-- Cristiano Ronaldo was to the fore as Real Madrid came from behind to defeat Sporting Gijon 3-1 on Saturday night and move three points clear of Barcelona at the top of Spain's La Liga. The team won and that's the most important thing." Barcelona, who face English club Arsenal in the quarterfinals of Europe's premier club competition, can draw level on 68 points with victory at Real Zaragoza on Sunday. But the expensively assembled Madrid team responded immediately, with Rafael Van Der Vaart making up for an earlier missed header as he pounced after Gijon keeper Juan Pablo failed to deal with Ronaldo's swerving free-kick. Bilbao edged ahead of Deportivo La Coruna on goal difference after the Galicians suffered a shock 2-0 defeat at home to relegation-threatened Valladolid. Gonzalo Higuain, who scored a hat-trick against Valladolid last weekend, wrapped up the victory 11 minutes later when he cut in from the right and surged towards the Gijon penalty area before slotting in a low left-foot effort.
