Earlier this month, he re-emerged in public for the first time and has made five appearances in closely controlled events, usually donning casual checked shirts. -- Fidel Castro appeared publicly in his trademark olive green shirt on Saturday for the first time since he fell ill and renounced power four years ago, according to a state-run website. Castro handed power to his brother, Raul, in 2006 after undergoing intestinal surgery and disappeared from public view. Castro made his appearance in Artemisa, a town about an hour outside of Havana, also making this his first reported trip outside the capital in four years, according to the website Cubadebate. State media have published occasional videos and photos of the historic leader wearing track suits.
