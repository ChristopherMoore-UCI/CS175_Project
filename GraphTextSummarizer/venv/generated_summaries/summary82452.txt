-- Black ice -- road ice virtually invisible to drivers -- played a "significant role" in last month's fatal bus crash in Oregon, an attorney for the bus company said Wednesday night. Attorney Mark Scheer also said bus driver Haeng Kyu Hwang had had 7 Â½ hours of sleep the night before the crash, suggesting that fatigue was not a factor, and said there is "no indication" that drugs and alcohol were involved. Further, Mi Joo does not require its drivers to maintain driver logs, as required by law, it said. He declined to comment on the claim that Hwang had violated work hour rules that week, saying he was not familiar with the driver's itinerary. On Tuesday, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration barred Mi Joo Tour & Travel Ltd., a Canadian company, from operating in the United States, saying in an order that Hwang had worked 92 hours in the seven days leading up to the crash, far exceeding the 70 hours allowed.
