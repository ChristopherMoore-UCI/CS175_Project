Citing Wikileaks disclosures of State Department cables, which some Polish officials believe show the United States put relations with Russia ahead of Poland's security interests, Komorowski said: "Like in marriage -- from time to time its worth taking your wife for a date." A speech by Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski at the German Marshall Fund of the United States on Wednesday broke that mold. Referring to 18th century Polish heroes of the American Revolutionary War, he said: "Pulaski and Kosciusko today would also have to fill in the visa forms if they wanted to come to the United States." Komorowski said, when he filled in his U.S. visa form, he was asked "whether I am involved in prostitution or if perhaps I was involved in genocide or whether I was a terrorist." "Well, I don't take it as an insult," the Polish president added. Komorowski also complained about the requirement that he submit visa form to visit the United States. Speaking off-the-cuff for much of it, Komorowski gave a frank and, at times, sarcastic evaluation of U.S.-Polish relations.
