The assault comes several months after Hamidi told CNN in an interview that he didn't feel safe and that his life was in danger, most particularly from what he described as corrupt officials, but sloughed off family pleas to quit his position in Kandahar city. "I was born in this province," Hamidi said in December, referring to Kandahar province. Two deputy mayors of Kandahar city have been gunned down by militants in the past year, according to the governor's office. -- The mayor of Afghanistan's restive southern city of Kandahar -- a resolute and proud public official who was regularly surrounded by armed guards and long under threat of death -- was slain Wednesday in a suicide bombing. But perhaps the most high-profile attack occurred earlier this month when Kandahar's provincial council chief, Ahmed Wali Karzai -- the president's half-brother and an influential power broker in country's south -- was gunned down by a longtime bodyguard inside his home.
