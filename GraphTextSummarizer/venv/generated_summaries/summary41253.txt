"Gov. Clements is responsible for the growth, success and election of Texas Republicans in every corner of our state," Perry said. Perry, the Lone Star State's current governor, remembered Clements as a "larger-than-life entrepreneur, public servant ... a mentor (and) the father of the modern-day Texas Republican party." He scored a surprise victory in 1978 to become Texas governor. -- William Clements, the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction, died Sunday at the age of 94. He then served as a deputy U.S. secretary of defense under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.
