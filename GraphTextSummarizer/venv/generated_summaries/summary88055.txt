With the help of drone strikes allegedly carried out by the CIA, Yemen's military put militants in the country's tribal region on retreat last year, but AQAP regularly carries out terrorist attacks on soldiers and officials. The two victims were advising Yemen's army as private security contractors, said the police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. counterterrorism officials have said that AQAP strives to attack targets outside of Yemen. -- Gunmen on a motorbike killed a Russian military instructor and wounded a second Tuesday in Yemen's capital of Sanaa, two senior police officials said. Yemen is also a home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which many analysts believe is the most dangerous wing of the terrorist network.
