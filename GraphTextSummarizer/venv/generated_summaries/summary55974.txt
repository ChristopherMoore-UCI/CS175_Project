-- President and Mrs. George W. Bush reported taxable income of $719, 274 for the tax year 2007 and paid $221,635 in federal income taxes, the White House said Friday. Some of the donations went to the following: the Crawford, Texas, Volunteer Fire Department, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, Malaria No More Fund, Martha's Table and a St. John's Church, most likely St. John's Episcopal Church in the District of Columbia, where the Bushes sometimes attend services. The Cheneys paid $466,165 in taxes through withholding and estimated tax payments, and will pay the remaining $136,486 upon filing their tax return. The tax return also reports a $150,000 advance received by Laura Bush for the children's book she co-authored with daughter Jenna. His wife, Lynne, earned a salary from the American Enterprise Institute, a think-tank, and reported book royalty income and a pension of $32,000 from Reader's Digest, of which she formerly was a director.
