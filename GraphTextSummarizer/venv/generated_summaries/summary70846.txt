" "Dawn of Justice" also brings in a number of other characters, including Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher). "The more time I spend with Henry, the more he's Superman to me," director Zack Snyder told USA Today of the British actor, who made his debut as the high-flying hero in 2013's "Man of Steel." Now, with the "Man of Steel" sequel "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Cavill and Snyder are eager to stretch the Kryptonian's identity, examining who he is as a protector of Metropolis and as an everyday gent. The photo comes just a few days after Cavill was spotted on the set of "Batman v Superman" dressed as Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent. He'll still be working with Lois Lane (Amy Adams) and Perry White (Laurence Fishburne) at the Daily Planet, but he'll also find himself moving into Gotham City, where Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg) presents a threat.
