Passenger travel fell a record 3.5 percent and freight fell more than 10 percent, according to International Air Transport Association figures. The union, which is seeking a 6.4 percent pay increase, is also concerned with the airline's recent buying spree of small regional carriers, such as BMI and Austrian Airlines, a practice that it said cannibalizes flights from union-flown routes. The labor unrest comes as the airline industry is digging out of the worst one-year drop-off in business, according to International Air Transport Association. The pilots' union previously had said resuming a normal schedule would take time, because the union had to inform striking pilots of the agreement before they could return to work.
