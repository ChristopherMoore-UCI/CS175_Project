"Like many kids involved in this border reality of straddling two cultures, he had a lot of stress about what's going on in Juarez," the high school principal, Brother Nick Gonzalez, said of Gonzalez. In one 48-hour span last week, for instance, at least 14 people were killed -- including a municipal police officer and a newspaper vendor who police believe was targeted due to her job, according to Juarez Police spokesman Adrian Sanchez. Even though the killings happened in Juarez, they re-open wounds for the students and the community of El Paso, Nick Gonzalez, the principal, said. At one time, teens Carlos Gonzalez, 16, and Juan Carlos Echeverri, 15, were classmates at Cathedral High School in El Paso, Texas. His family, which had lived in Juarez, had recently started renting an apartment in El Paso for safety reasons.
