Soledad Griensen Porras, 50, of Juarez was arrested Tuesday afternoon after one of the women in the shelter stopped police in the street asking for help, according to Adrian Sanchez, spokesman for the Juarez municipal police department. -- The director of a battered women's shelter in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was being held Wednesday on charges that she forced the women she cared for to commit sex acts with strangers, local authorities told CNN. It was unclear how long Griensen had owned the Mujeres Unidas Contra la Violencia ("women united against violence") shelter or how long its residents allegedly had been forced to perform sex acts, Sanchez said. Authorities were also investigating if children who lived at the shelter -- some as young as 5 years old -- were forced into prostitution as well, Arturo Sandoval, spokesman for the state attorney general's office, told CNN. "Griensen is the only person being held in relation to these charges," Sandoval told CNN.
