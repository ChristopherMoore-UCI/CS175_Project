-- Alabama lawmakers are calling on U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller to resign over allegations that he hit his wife "several times with a closed fist" in an Atlanta hotel room in August. I look forward to completing the family counseling that I voluntarily began several weeks ago and to successfully completing the requirements of the diversion." Toobin: Wife-beating is not a private matter U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Alabama, compared Fuller's infractions to recent incidents in the National Football League. Fuller spent the night an Atlanta jail after being charged with misdemeanor battery in the alleged domestic violence incident. U.S. Sens. Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby of Alabama released separate statements Thursday calling for Fuller's resignation. Shelby said Fuller has "lost the confidence of his colleagues and the people of the state of Alabama."
