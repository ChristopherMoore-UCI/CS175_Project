The 23-year-old set up a fourth-round encounter with fellow former No. 1 and compatriot Dinara Safina. Nadal progresses at Indian Wells Kleybanova's fellow Russian Maria Sharapova dropped her first service game against Aravane Rezai, but quickly regrouped to beat the French world No. 22 6-2 6-2. Nadia Petrova became the fourth Russian woman to progress, after the world No. 18 battled past 18-year-old American wildcard Christina McHale 3-6 6-4 6-2. "I started like I didn't have my cup of coffee or something, didn't have my peeps around, so that was disappointing," the three-time grand slam champion and world No. 18 said. The 20-year-old's next opponent at the Californian hard-court tournament will be world No. 24 Alisa Kleybanova, who upset 15th-ranked Italian Flavia Pennetta 6-3 6-4.
