The charges disclosed Thursday include conspiracy to violate U.S. arms export laws and sanctions on Iran, as well as fraud, money laundering and making false statements to investigators. -- Federal prosecutors say they have broken up a major effort to ship parts for fighter jets and helicopter gunships to Iran in violation of U.S. arms export laws. Iran purchased those aircraft before the 1979 revolution that toppled Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, a U.S. ally. In a raft of indictments announced Thursday, the Justice Department accuses executives from companies in Florida, Illinois, France and the United Arab Emirates with illegally supplying components for U.S.-built aircraft to Iran. Both American firms are accused of supplying parts for 1970s-vintage warplanes and helicopters to Iran through the French company Aerotechnic and Emirates-based Aletra General Trading.
