Just where to look for the house and grounds (and whether you're also looking for that all important lake, of course) depends which adaptation you favor: The 1995 TV version was filmed at Lyme Park in Cheshire (exterior scenes), and Sudbury Hall in Derbyshire (interior scenes). The cottage is now a museum of Austen's life and work, home to family portraits, manuscripts, and the table at which she wrote some of her most famous work. Other locations to feature in the 2005 film include Burgley, and the village of Stamford in Lincolnshire; Haddon Hall in Derbyshire (which also features in three versions of "Jane Eyre," "The Princess Bride" and "The Other Boleyn Girl"); and Groombridge Place in Kent (which also has links to Arthur Conan Doyle, and Sherlock Holmes) which doubles for the Bennets' home, Longbourn. Austen fans can visit the Jane Austen Centre, take the waters -- and then take their taste away with tea at the Pump Room -- and wander the streets that the novelist herself walked down: Royal Crescent, The Circus, Gay Street, Queen Square and Sydney Place, where Austen lived at Number 4. -- Jane Austen is one of the English language's best-known and most-loved writers.
