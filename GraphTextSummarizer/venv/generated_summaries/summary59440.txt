J.D. Salinger uses the word five times in "Catcher" with great power and specificity. As they look at crime scene photos of naked and murdered women, the word expresses disgust. Offensive from the beginning The f-word has a long history, and, unlike some other taboo words, seems to have been offensive from the start. While still not fit for polite society, it no longer carries the depth of taboo attributed to it in 1978 by that hero of foul mouthery George Carlin, who said in a comic monologue: "The big one, the word f---, that's the one that hangs them up the most." I have not yet seen the film, but am grateful to the dirty word counters, who have recorded a total of 506 uses of the f-word in the three-hour movie.
