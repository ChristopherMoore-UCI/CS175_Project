LACES currently has three programs in Liberia in Kona, Cotton Tree and Duport Road and has worked with 80 coaches and 700 kids. Fryatt dreamed of promoting social change and development through her favorite sport -- football -- and her dream became a reality in 2007 when LACES set up its first program in Liberia. But there is a glowing red sunset at the end of this story as an heroic organization of local football coaches is changing the face of Liberia. After she spent several months volunteering on board a floating hospital ship in Liberia, and playing for Liberia's Professional Women's Soccer Division, LACES was born. Before the end of the year LACES plans to roll out a new "Kick Out Corruption" campaign to tackle the problem of corruption in Liberia.
