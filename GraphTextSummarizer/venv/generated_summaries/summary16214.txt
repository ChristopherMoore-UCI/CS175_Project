-- A total of 37 former Cuban political prisoners landed in Madrid on Friday from Havana, boosting to 115 the number of former Cuban prisoners who have come to Spain since last July, a Spanish Foreign Ministry statement said. The latest arrivals are the last of a group of political prisoners whose release was negotiated last year among the Cuban and Spanish governments and the Cuban Catholic church, the statement said. The latest group includes Cuban dissident Orlando Fundora, arrested in 2003 among a well-known group of 75 dissidents. He was released later and has now decided to seek medical help in Madrid, said a Foreign Ministry diplomat, who by custom is not named. Since July 2010, a total of 115 former Cuban prisoners and 647 of their relatives have arrived in Spain, the statement said.
