Pryor's latest videos on domestic violence strikes a sharply critical tone as the ad's subject, Hill, says Cotton "voted against protecting women and children from domestic abuse. But the Pryor ad is trying to paint a stark contrast with Hill closing the ad by saying: "There's a big difference between Mark Pryor and Tom Cotton, one wants to protect women and children, the other doesn't." But Pryor's ad focuses on the context of Cotton's vote regarding the re-authorization of VAWA, and notes that one in four women are victims of domestic abuse -- a statistic backed by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. " Cotton campaign spokesman David Ray pushed back against the ad claiming Pryor is "making ridiculous election-year accusations." "While Senator Pryor is busy perpetrating a fictitious 'War on Women,' it is the Obama-Pryor economic policies that have harmed so many Arkansas women by increasing the cost of everything from health insurance to gasoline to groceries," Ray said in an email.
