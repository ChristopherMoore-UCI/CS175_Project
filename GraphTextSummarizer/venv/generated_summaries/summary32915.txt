-- Have you been wondering why Manitowoc, Wisconsin, is the first stop for President Barack Obama after his State of the Union address? But Manitowoc was forever etched into the history of space exploration, a fact that is now celebrated each year with Sputnikfest. On September 6, 1962 -- when Obama was but a mere lad, John F. Kennedy occupied the White House and the Cold War was raging -- a 20-pound hunk of smoldering metal fell from the sky and crashed in the middle of Manitowoc's Eighth Street. Elaine Schroeder, a Rahr-West Art Museum staffer, said she watched Obama's speech Tuesday night and after he spoke of the Sputnik moment, she wondered: Is this why he's coming to my town? It burned up in the atmosphere and ended up linking Manitowoc to Sputnik in a way no other American town is.
