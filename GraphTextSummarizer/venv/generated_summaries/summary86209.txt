The perception, in many foreign capitals, is that growing partisanship is also infecting U.S. foreign policy. This was demonstrated, for instance, during the 2008-9 financial crisis when Congress and the administration acted more swiftly and comprehensively than many other countries to counteract the worst economic turmoil since at least the 1930s. Then, as now, however, the country retains attractive qualities for many foreigners, including its popular culture and economic innovation. The gravity of this reputational issue for U.S. foreign relations was recently acknowledged by two former defence secretaries. Meanwhile, U.S. trade officials were forced to postpone second-round negotiations with Brussels over the proposed Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership.
