"Like others before him, President Obama shared how lonely, demanding and humbling the office of president can be, and how much he appreciated the counsel of people like Mr. Graham and the prayers of so many citizens," Ross said. At the end, Graham presented Obama with two Bibles -- one for him and the other for first lady Michelle Obama, Ross said. Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Graham at his family home, according to Graham spokesman Larry Ross. President Obama prayed Sunday with the Rev. Billy Graham at Graham's mountaintop home before leaving North Carolina to attend the memorial service for 29 West Virginia coal miners killed in a recent explosion. " "I am pleased to have had President Obama in my home this afternoon," Graham said in a statement, adding that Obama sought the meeting while on vacation in Asheville for the weekend.
