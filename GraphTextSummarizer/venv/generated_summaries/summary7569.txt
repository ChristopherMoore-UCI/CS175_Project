The idea that we can relegate certain groups to the margins, stifling any potential they may bring to the mainstream, seems a foolish lack of foresight in understanding that such prejudice harms society as a whole -- not only those relegated. I have never understood issues of any kind of prejudice and inequality to be anything other than a problem for all of society. We are loosely connected through industry friends and some of them are of color. The word has too much meaning and history for me as a black woman, but it is possible for others who are nervous and under the pressure of concerns to "get it right" to become confused and use the term "colored" in place of "people of color" when wishing to embrace black and other non-white ethnic groups. And, in my opinion, to change endemic injustices requires a holistic approach -- one that calls on all areas of society to come together to demand change.
