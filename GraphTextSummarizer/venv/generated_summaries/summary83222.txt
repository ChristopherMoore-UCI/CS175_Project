"The iPhone 4 is a more fragile device than its predecessors," said SquareTrade Marketing Vice President Vince Tseng. Some reports have indicated that Apple's use of glass on the iPhone 4's back has posed a problem for customers using protective cases. The company, which sells warranties for electronics products, examined about 22,000 reports from its customers who had iPhone 4s and about 20,000 for iPhone 3G devices, which debuted in 2008. When Apple announced it would give away free cases to help customers with cellular signal issues, Jobs said fewer third-party manufacturers offered cases at the product's launch. "Some customers didn't want to use a protective case," Tseng observed, based on reports, "because they wanted to admire the beautiful backside of the iPhone 4."
