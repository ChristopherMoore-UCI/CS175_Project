The project, which aims to make 1.5 million pages of ancient texts freely available in virtual form over the next three years, is a joint effort by the Bodleian Libraries at Oxford University and the Vatican Library. Dr. Leonard Polonsky, in a video clip posted on the project's website, said that it would ensure that fragile texts that "should be part of the inheritance of mankind" were safeguarded for future generations. Scholars will be able to zoom in on texts and images to study them more closely. -- Some of the world's oldest and rarest Bibles and biblical texts were placed online Tuesday in newly digitized form by two of the world's most venerable libraries. The project is focused on three main areas: ancient Greek manuscripts, Hebrew manuscripts and 15th-century printed books, known as incunabula.
