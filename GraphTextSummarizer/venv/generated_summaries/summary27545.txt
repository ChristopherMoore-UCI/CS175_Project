The debate goes on about safety standards in factories in Bangladesh and whether compliance measures are in place. They can't deny that it is because the recent spate of political violence has forced many garment and other factory owners to flout the rules and go for quick money. Each year, workers continue to die in factories, in ship breaking yards and on construction sites. Should the buyers pay more, as is always argued by the garment owners association, because the lower cost of production, compared with other markets, compels them to ignore safety standards? The buyers also have to lend a hand so that millions of workers are saved from a looming disaster and can live a life with dignity and safety.
