-- When Sen. John McCain's running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, announced that her 17-year-old unmarried daughter was pregnant, the news prompted a big response from the iReport.com community. Palin revealed Monday that her daughter Bristol is pregnant and plans to marry the father. Republican presidential candidate McCain was aware of Bristol's pregnancy before he chose Palin as his running mate, a top adviser to the Arizona senator said. "I think people's families are off-limits, and people's children are especially off-limits." iReporter Darla Jones of Roseburg, Oregon, who supports McCain, agrees that the media and public should leave Bristol and the Palin family alone. Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama said that families should be off-limits in presidential campaigns after learning of the news.
