The nutrition product, which was recalled last Thursday, was made by Birmingham, Alabama-based Meds IV, which did not respond to phone calls left Tuesday and Wednesday; its website was offline on Wednesday. Of two cases at Select Specialty Hospital, one died; of three cases at Medical West Hospital, one died; the one case at Baptist Prattville proved fatal, but the one case at Cooper Green Hospital did not die, said Dr. Jim McVay, director of healthy promotion and chronic disease for the Alabama Health Department. The infection would have entered the bloodstream easily and "with a pretty quick effect in terms of blood pressure and temperature," said Dr. Donald Williamson of the Alabama Department of Public Health in a conference call Tuesday night with reporters. "We don't know, and may never know, if the Serratia marcescens bloodstream infection played a role in the deaths of these patients," Dr. Elizabeth D. Ennis, chief medical officer of the Baptist Health System, said Tuesday in a statement. Of the five patients at Shelby Baptist Medical Center who were infected, two died; of the seven infected at Princeton Baptist Medical Center, four died, Ennis said.
