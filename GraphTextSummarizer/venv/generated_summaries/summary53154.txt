Police in Guangdong have seized 8.1 tons of drugs and made 10,836 arrests since July 2013, when the province launched a campaign to crack down on narcotics, said Guo Shabo, the public security bureau's deputy director in a statement. They recovered another 100 tons of raw materials for producing drugs, as well as guns, knives and a grenade, a spokesperson for the public security bureau told CNN on Friday. According to a recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 70% of the 326 illegal drug-making facilities shut down in China in 2012 were manufacturing crystal meth. Guangdong authorities did not give an estimated value of the drugs seized on Sunday, but the South China Morning Post newspaper said the haul would be worth around U.S. $232 million. In the massive crackdown on the region's illicit narcotic trade, police seized three tons of crystalline methamphetamine, also known as crystal meth or ice, and arrested 182 people with suspected links to 18 drug rings, according to a statement released Thursday by Guangdong's public security bureau.
