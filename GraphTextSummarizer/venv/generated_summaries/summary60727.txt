A trend away from the concentration of oil production in such an unstable, undemocratic part of the world bodes well. The loosening of oil markets has strengthened the world's hand against oil-rich Iran. The need for oil and natural gas -- much of it from Middle Eastern dictatorships -- shaped the foundation of global geopolitics. Another dark lining in this silver cloud is that cheaper oil and gas will reduce incentives to produce green energies. The United States built alliances with autocratic regimes as part of a commitment to satisfy its needs and preserve the free flow of oil, which became the life-blood of the global economy.
