To them, bin Laden wasn't so much a person as an embodiment of all things scary and evil, said Dr. Patricia Somers, an education professor who has studied college students affected by 9/11. Members of the 9/11 generation seem to have more in common with their grandparents than their parents; both experienced attacks from outsiders with a clearly identifiable evil frontman ­ -- Adolf Hitler during World War II and bin Laden during 9/11. So when the news came that bin Laden was dead, it was young people across the country -- from the campuses of Penn State to American University to Vanderbilt to Stanford --­ who filled the streets with a chorus of cheers, honking horns and fireworks that lasted well into the wee hours of Monday morning. He said he didn't feel like celebrating, even if capturing bin Laden seemed to be the first thing that had gone right for the United States in a long time. Yes, bin Laden needed to die, but he is still a human being.
