Indeed, in many ways, the crisis in the clown community mirrors the anxieties that are felt across many sectors of society -- class friction, social estrangement and an economy many still feel uncertain over. But this golden age has passed, and our ideas of clowns are now set against a backdrop of recession, social atomization and a distrust of traditional institutions. It also seems no coincidence that the narratives that employ scary clowns so often associate them with failed businesses -- empty music halls echoing with the ghosts of past laughter or abandoned theme parks repurposed as lairs. We also know that clowns inhabit fertile ground in terms of phobias -- after all, they can invoke anything from a fear of masks, to stranger danger, to our anxieties regarding public humiliation. But to those of us who have been following what is proving to be an unusually lively period of clown reports -- whether they be actual crimes or simply hoaxes -- neither the reports themselves, nor the peculiar interest in these incidents, is all that surprising.
