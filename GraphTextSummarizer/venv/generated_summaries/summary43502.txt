" The suit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in July, has been moved to U.S. District Court. If Ledger committed suicide, ReliaStar says, "we will pay only the amount of premiums paid to us." John S. Laviolette, a Los Angeles entertainment industry attorney whom Ledger appointed custodian of the policy, alleges in the lawsuit that ReliaStar Life Insurance Co. is trying to avoid paying on the policy by continuing to investigate whether Ledger's death was a suicide. ReliaStar says in legal papers that it has the right to investigate all aspects surrounding Ledger's death "to determine if the 'Suicide' provision is applicable." Matilda Rose's mother is actress Michelle Williams, whom Ledger met on the set of "Brokeback Mountain."
