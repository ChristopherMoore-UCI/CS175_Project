Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pennsylvania, said this week that the growing threat towards American religious freedom by the government could lead to "Christian persecution," similar to how the oppression of Jews and Christians evolved over time under Nazi Germany. Asked why such attacks on religious liberties exist in America, Santorum said it is mostly a result of government overreach. Arguing that the rise of the Nazi regime happened in a stable country where it was not expected, Santorum said that a similar situation could occur in the United States where, according to Santorum, religious liberties are "under direct assault" for the first time in history. The film, Santorum says, highlights where religious persecution comes from, what it is about and why it is a danger to society. Santorum discussed the topic as part of an interview about his new film, titled "One Generation Away," which is produced by a movie production company run by Santorum called EchoLight Cinemas.
