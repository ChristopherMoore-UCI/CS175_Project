"I think Mumbai is suffering today from the way the infrastructure is," Abhisheck Lodha, managing director of the company behind the World One project ,told me from the base of the residential towers. Industry is moving out to locations where costs are lower, leaving the center of Mumbai to high end services and finance. An economy cannot thrive without clear arteries to commerce and for Mumbai at least, they remain clogged. The World One towers over the coastline on a 17 acre site in the heart of the prime district of Upper Worli, Mumbai. The Reserve Bank of India is raising interest rates to cap price rises but that of course will not help business nor boost demand for both luxury properties and the rise of new cities in suburbs of Mumbai and Delhi.
