"Because HIV is more prevalent within those groups, the risk of HIV infection per sexual contact is higher. -- New York City's rate of HIV infection is about three times the national rate, according to estimates released Wednesday by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. "The populations that bear the greatest burden nationally -- blacks, for example, and men who have sex with men -- are highly represented in New York City," Health Commissioner Thomas Freidan said in a written statement. Rapid HIV test swabs incubate at the Iris House in New York in 2007. The agency estimates that 72 of every 100,000 New Yorkers -- a total of 4,800 individuals -- contracted HIV in 2006, more than triple the national rate of 23 per 100,000.
