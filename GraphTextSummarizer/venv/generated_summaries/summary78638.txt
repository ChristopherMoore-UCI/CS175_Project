School was not in session during the summer months, so students and school staff members were able to express their sense of loss as they felt necessary at any time. Students, former students, teachers and other community members began to fill the hallways of the high school building because they didn't know where else to go to find consolation. This helped for some, but families that experienced direct loss still had a long and painful journey ahead of them. Local pastors and priests provided ongoing support to the families who had lost family members, and this continued for several months. Long lines of mourners waited in silence for the opportunity to at least offer condolences to family members.
