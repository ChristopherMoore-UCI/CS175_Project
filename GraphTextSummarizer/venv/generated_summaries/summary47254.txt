"If you do it right, fasting can be very effective for weight loss," says Alia Al Moayed, a nutritional therapist and health journalist in Bahrain. "We see a fair increase in digestive-related complaints," admits Rabee Harb, a family doctor at Kuwait's Royale Hayat Hospital, who has noticed an uptick in cases of indigestion, gastroenteritis and peptic ulcer disease. Al Moayed notes that after Ramadan, her client list also fattens up. "There's a surge in uncontrolled diabetes cases during Ramadan," confirms Harb. According to Harb, it is only recently, with the advent of high-sugar, high-fat foods in the region, that the season has been met with health dangers.
