Square Cash can be used between friends, say as a way of paying back a buddy for picking up the tab last night, or for small businesses that have been using its plastic card reader to accept credit card payments. Created by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, the current Square model charges 2.75% of the transaction cost plus a 15-cent fee -- a price in line with what larger retail stores pay in order to accept cards. -- Square, the mobile app and hardware that turns a smartphone into a cash register, is now letting users send and receive money as easily as sending an e-mail. That user will then receive an e-mail prompting them to link a credit card to their account. In addition to e-mail, there is a Square Cash app for Apple's iOS devices and for Android.
