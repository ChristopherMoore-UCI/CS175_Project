Lanka-e-News said journalists have suffered "unprecedented" losses since the president came to power, including the killing of reporters and editors. Last night a caller threatened me that I would be killed," said Bennet Rupasinghe, news editor of the widely read website. These attacks, intimidation of journalists are government's response to any view or facts they (the government) dislike," Mangala Samaraweera, the media head of the main opposition United National Party (UNP), told CNN. President Mahinda Rajapaksa has ordered the "police to conduct an immediate investigation," spokesman Bandula Jayasekera told reporters. "Since he was forced to leave, I have been facing a string of threats and intimidation for exposing corruption and reporting on matters disliked by those in high authority," Rupasinghe said.
