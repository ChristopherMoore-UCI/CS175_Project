So this is [Burke's] effort to increase the size of the pie rather than fighting over the small remaining undecided slice of the current pie." Obama's other stops this week -- Thursday in Maine for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike Michaud, Friday in Rhode Island for remarks targeting women voters, and Sunday in Connecticut for Democratic Gov. Dan Malloy -- are also meant to turn out Democrats in states where he still remains somewhat popular. In Maine, Obama's objective will be to get Democratic voters to "act like Democrats," said Brian Duff, a political science professor at the University of New England in Maine, citing past elections there that have seen independent candidates shave away support from Democrats. Democratic senators are working to convince swing electorates that Obama's policies aren't necessarily their own in North Carolina, Colorado and New Hampshire. He'll campaign mostly for governors, whose role outside Washington puts them further from the unpopular White House policies that give Democratic Senate candidates heartburn. And in Republican strongholds like Georgia and Kentucky, Democratic candidates are quick to promise total independence from an unpopular White House.
