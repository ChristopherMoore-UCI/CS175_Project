The all-star film grossed an estimated $52.4 million over three days and is likely to top $60 million by the time the Presidents Day holiday weekend is over. "Percy Jackson & The Olympians," based on the popular kids' book series by author Rick Riordan, earned an estimated $31.1 million for the three days while the R-rated horror remake "Wolfman," starring Benicio del Toro, grossed an estimated $30.6 million for a per-theater average of $9,497. Its high-grossing debut -- the best ever for Presidents Day -- coupled with solid numbers from the other two new wide releases put 2010's holiday frame into the record books with an estimated total gross of $193 million. These strong numbers from female-driven films have Hollywood noticing that women are strong drivers of box office.
