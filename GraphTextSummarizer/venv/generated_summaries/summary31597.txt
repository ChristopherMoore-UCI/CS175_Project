That's what police are investigating in the shooting death of Kristine Kirk, who called 911 Monday and, according to a police affidavit, said her husband, Richard Kirk, was hallucinating after he had "taken some marijuana." Police arrived at the home to find Kristine Kirk dead, a gunshot wound to her head. On Friday, Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey charged Richard Kirk with first-degree murder in his wife's death. "This is under investigation," Denver police spokeswoman Raquel Lopez said about the possibility of marijuana use. That's one of the reasons we're right to be regulating (marijuana)" During a search of the Kirk's home, police found a receipt in the basement for purchases made on the day of the killing at a marijuana dispensary called Nutritional Elements, according to a warrant.
