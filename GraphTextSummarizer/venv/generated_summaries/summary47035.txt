The pronounced piles of sand on her stomach and breasts led some of her Instagram followers to speculate that she was dropping pregnancy hints. The move is classic Beyonce, who has a history of game-ifying the message when it comes to personal announcements. She revealed her first pregnancy at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards by stripping off her blazer at the end of her performance to show off her baby bump. Gawker published a lengthy post in December citing evidence that Beyonce has been pregnant for months. That's what the Internet is agonizing over after she posted a photo on Instagram of herself on Sunday.
