" "It's medical documents, declarations, court opinions, transcripts, everything it seems," Garbus told King. Grigorieva and Garbus discussed the leaks in an interview scheduled to air Wednesday night on CNN's "Larry King Live. The confidential documents "were stolen probably from the court" and the leaker "got paid a good deal of money," said Martin Garbus, an attorney for Gibson's ex-girlfriend, Oksana Grigorieva. The judge overseeing the Mel Gibson child custody case ordered a probe into the leak of sealed court documents published on celebrity news website TMZ, a lawyer in the case said. "They say over 2,000 pages of documents were leaked and the district attorney's office has started an investigation," Garbus said.
