International economists often describe Transnistria as a state whose fortunes are built on smuggling booze and tobacco and selling old Soviet weapons. Transnistria split from the former Soviet republic of Moldova following a two-year war (1990-1992) that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed. At a flea market, old men traded Soviet army cap badges and shoulder flashes. As we headed early Sunday into downtown Tiraspol, it was easy to see Transnistria is a place trapped in time. As we rolled past decaying heavy industry and tumbledown Soviet-era apartment blocks, it was clear Transnistria needed more than a fancy nightclub to give it a touch of glamor.
