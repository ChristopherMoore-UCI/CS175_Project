The silver car crashed into the Edgewater Casino about 9:30 a.m., said Barbara Morgan, spokeswoman for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were at the scene, she said, because the department has a substation in Laughlin, about 70 miles southeast of the city. -- Two people died Wednesday when a car crashed into the front entrance of a Laughlin, Nevada, casino, police said. Clark County Fire Department spokesman Scott Allison said the driver, an elderly man, was not one of the fatalities. Witnesses said the car was traveling at a high speed when it hit the building, Morgan said.
