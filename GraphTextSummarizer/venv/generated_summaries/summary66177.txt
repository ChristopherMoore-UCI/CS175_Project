A second supply route through Chaman in western Pakistan was open during the Torkham closure, but the Pakistani Taliban has threatened violence on any route used for NATO purposes. Pakistan closed the main land route for NATO supplies crossing from Pakistan to Afghanistan after U.S. helicopter strikes across the border killed two Pakistani soldiers. A report from a NATO and Pakistan assessment team concluded that soldiers fired warning shots to let them know of their presence, but the helicopter crews assumed they were insurgents and fired the shots. -- The Torkham border crossing in Pakistan was opened for NATO supply convoy traffic Sunday morning, authorities told CNN. "We are very proud of the performance of this squad as they have been able to successfully target NATO convoys all over Pakistan," Khan said.
