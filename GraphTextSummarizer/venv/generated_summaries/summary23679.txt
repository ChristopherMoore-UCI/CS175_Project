On Monday, he sat down (didn't use a lectern) to talk with sports reporters about last week's ESPN report that implied the Ravens' top brass knew early on how bad the Ray Rice domestic violence case was and the team tried to influence Roger Goodell to give the running back a light penalty. In its report it said: "'Outside the Lines' interviewed more than 20 sources ... team officials, current and former league officials, NFL Players Association representatives and associates, advisers and friends of Rice." While denying that was the case, Bisciotti did admit again that he and the team should have done more to get the video that led to Rice being axed by his Ravens and suspended by the NFL. The Ravens owner said he wished the reporters for ESPN -- which issued a statement: "We stand by our reporting" -- had acknowledged to readers how big a role Rice's camp played in the story. The Ravens stopped pursuing the video when the charge against Rice was elevated from a misdemeanor to a felony.
