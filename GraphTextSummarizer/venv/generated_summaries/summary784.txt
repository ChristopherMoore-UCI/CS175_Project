-- Heads of South American nations lent support Monday night to President Evo Morales of Bolivia, who says opposition leaders are trying to overthrow his government. Morales attended the emergency meeting of the union, which is modeled on the European Union and aims to politically and economically integrate South American countries. Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador to Bolivia last week, blaming the American government for inciting the violence. Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, was elected in December 2005. On Monday, supporters of Morales, or his so-called militias, were gathering in Santa Cruz, and threatening to encircle the city, stoking fears that blood could be shed there.
