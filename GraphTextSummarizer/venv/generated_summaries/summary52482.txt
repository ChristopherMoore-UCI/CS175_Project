The Committee elected to invoke that discretion and waived Woods' penalty of disqualification. The joint statement explained: "In returning his score card, Woods had breached Rule 6-6d by returning a score (6) for the 15th hole that was lower than his actual score (8). Under Rule 33-7, a committee has discretion to waive that penalty in 'exceptional individual cases.' "The penalty for such a breach of Rule 6-6d is disqualification. but then came back really well with four birdies," said Dou, who was joint 11th after the first day's play in a group including compatriot Bin Yan.
