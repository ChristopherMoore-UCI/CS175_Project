-- Mexican authorities moved Saturday to tighten their communication about Friday's shooting of two U.S. Embassy personnel by federal police as the Americans drove in their SUV south of the capital with a Mexican Navy captain. It added that the Mexican government "has stated it will conduct a full and thorough investigation of this incident." Also Friday, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said, "We are working with Mexican authorities to investigate an incident this morning in which two employees of our embassy in Mexico City came under attack by unknown assailants. The incident occurred at 8 a.m. Friday, when the two embassy employees and the Mexican were en route through the mountainous area to a navy facility in the municipality of Xalatlaco, according to a statement issued Friday by the Mexican Navy, which gave the following account: The black SUV bearing a diplomatic license plate had just left the main highway that connects Mexico City with Cuernavaca and were driving on a dirt road that connects the small towns of Tres Marias and Huitzilac when a vehicle approached. In a statement issued late Friday, the U.S. Embassy described the Mexican as a Navy captain and said the three individuals were en route to a training facility when they were ambushed. Federal police, who were in the area working on a criminal investigation, participated in these acts, the statement said, but did not specify which vehicle or vehicles they were in.
