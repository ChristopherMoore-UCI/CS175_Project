In fact, last October, my partner Joy and I drove 14 hours to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for a long weekend. I actually enjoy flying now and look forward to heading back to sunny California in September. But fear quickly took over when I realized that not only did Fit Nation involve swimming in the ocean but also two trips to California (somewhere beyond even my driving desire). Although something can be said for long car trips with your family, I think back to the hours that could have been spent relaxing and enjoying vacation instead of being behind the wheel. We could have gotten a sweet rate on round-trip airfare and had more time at the beach, but I elected to drive instead.
