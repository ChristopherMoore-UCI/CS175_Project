To ease the impact, Blair says Egypt's next leader must launch projects to help the masses -- like improving transport and affordable housing -- that can be kick-started by billions of aid received from Gulf Arab states. "We've still got a few weeks before elections but the pressure is growing on both of them to come up with plans and that includes Sisi."

Sisi's lone opponent, left leaning politician Hamdeen Sabahi, has vowed to dish out millions of dollars in investments to help reopen government factories, create new jobs, build new housing and improve health care. Former army chief Abdel Fattah el Sisi pledges new roads, housing, airports, jobs and an end to the energy crisis. " Only then, he concludes, can Egypt's next president truly improve the economy and meet the demands of millions of Egyptians still waiting for a better life three years after revolution came to the country.
