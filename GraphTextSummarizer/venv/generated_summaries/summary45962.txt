17 Air Force officers stripped of authority to launch nuclear missiles A third missile wing is located at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. Air Force unit fails nuke inspection The errors were not related to the operation of nuclear missiles, one Air Force official said. But missile wing commander, Col. Robert Stanley, will feel more confident about passing the next inspection without him. The wing, which includes about 3,000 personnel in total, was not "decertified" to conduct nuclear operations, which would have indicated a more significant failure.
