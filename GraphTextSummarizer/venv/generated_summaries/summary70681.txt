Separation, despair, euphoria It's this deep desire to help Rwanda overcome the legacy of conflict that's been driving Nduwawe and Tubane's efforts -- a sentiment rooted within their troubled past and their personal tales of loss, struggle and survival. "When you are in the DR Congo there is a lot of misleading information, like 'in Rwanda there is no life,' or 'once you reach there you will be killed,'" says Nduwawe. "But I couldn't believe that!" Tubane's faith was rewarded in late 2003 when some relatives managed to finally trace Nduwawe in Rwanda's neighboring country. But in 1996, just after Nduwawe had traveled to the city of Bukavu by himself to take his university entrance exams, violence erupted in the eastern DRC, forcing his father and brother to head back to Rwanda. Nduwawe, six years older than Tubane, stayed behind with his father and brother and continued his school education.
