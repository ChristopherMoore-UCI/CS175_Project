" The U.N. envoy leading Geneva talks met together with opposition and government representatives Wednesday, the United Nations said. Meanwhile, groups of civilians were evacuating a besieged city Wednesday as opposition leaders unveiled a diplomatic road map they hope will lead their country out of a brutal civil war.
