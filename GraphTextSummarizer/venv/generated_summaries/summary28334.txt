Capello had been part of a managerial wish list published by the RFU featuring, amongst others, former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola, former Liverpool boss Rafa Benitez and World Cup winning Italian manager Marcello Lippi. " World Soccer Magazine's executive editor Keir Radnedge told CNN the Russian national team "wanted international pedigree, they felt this was important. Before moving into international football Capello won domestic and continental titles with AC Milan, Juventus, Roma and Spanish side Real Madrid. " Capello's first game in charge will be against Northern Ireland on September 7 when Russia begin their campaign to qualify for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Russia is hosting the 2018 FIFA World Cup and Radnedge believes this had a bearing on Capello's appointment.
