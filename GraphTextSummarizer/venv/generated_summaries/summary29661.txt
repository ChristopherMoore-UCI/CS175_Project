Weeks said he and his co-author, Robert Gorman, based their work on accounts in newspapers, which often ignored fan deaths caused by heart attack or stroke. Teams have been protected from legal liability for more than a century by the doctrine known as the assumption-of-risk rule, which holds that the dangers to spectators are widely known and that fans assume any risk, according to Gorman. "A lot of times, they don't identify the person who was killed," said Gorman, who is head of reference at the Winthrop University library. "They're not going up," said David Weeks, co-author of "Death at the Ballpark" (McFarland, 2009) and head of public services at the library at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Fan falls to his death at San Francisco's Candlestick Park Since 1969, he said, 23 people have died in incidents at Major League Baseball games, with "only a couple" of suicides.
