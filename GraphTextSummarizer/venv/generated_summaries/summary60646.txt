Foreclosure filings -- which include default papers, auction sale notices and repossessions -- reached 803,489 in the first quarter, according to a recent report by RealtyTrac, an online marketer of foreclosed properties. For Victor Guevares, winning a bid at a raucous foreclosure auction two months ago was just the first step toward achieving his dream of home ownership. CNN first met the Guevares family in March when he grabbed a home once worth $527,000 for less than half that price. Guevares spent the past 12 years renting and trying to save for his first home, and believes he came out ahead with the auction win. Foreclosures skyrocketed in March and the first quarter of 2009 to their highest levels on record as banks lifted moratoria on filings.
