The academy recommended performing two types of epidemiology studies -- a geography-based study of people with various cancers leaving near nuclear facilities, and a study of cancers in children born near nuclear facilities. The academy developed methods for assessing radiation near nuclear plants and for assessing cancer rates in nearby communities. More than 20 years after a major study said there is no evidence that people who live near nuclear power plants face an increased risk of dying from cancer, the federal government will look anew at the subject, starting with seven nuclear facilities from Connecticut to California. " In a pilot project to begin in the coming months, the NRC is commissioning the National Academy of Sciences to conduct cancer risk studies at six nuclear power plants and one nuclear fuel facility. Other cancer risk factors, such as smoking or exposure to medical radiation, may surpass the effect from power plant releases and "overwhelm the actual effect attributed to the releases," the group said.
