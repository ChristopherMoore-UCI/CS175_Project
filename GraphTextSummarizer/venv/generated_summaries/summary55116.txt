FDA has warned Americans away from online H1N1 medication and toward regulated distribution points. "Products that are offered for sale online with claims to diagnose, prevent, mitigate, treat or cure the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus must be carefully evaluated," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said. Tamiflu is one of two approved anti-viral treatments for H1N1. -- Americans should avoid buying treatments for the H1N1 virus, commonly known as swine flu, online, the Food and Drug Administration warned. The FDA issued the warning Thursday after it had purchased products over the Internet that were supposed to be Tamiflu and analyzed them.
