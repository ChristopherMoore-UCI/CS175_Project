Barcelona's nearest rivals in the title chase squared up to each other in the Madrid derby with Real overcoming Atletico 2-0 at the Bernabeu. With 13 wins and one draw so far, Tito Vilanova's side surpass the previous record for the best start to a season set by Real Madrid back in 1991-92. A stunning 30-yard free kick from Cristiano Ronaldo in the 15th minute put Jose Mourinho's men ahead before Mesut Ozil securing all three points with a strike in the 65th minute. The visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 40th minute when Polish defender Kamil Glik was shown a red card. Earlier on Saturday, Mauricio Pellegrino was sacked as manager of Valencia following a 5-2 defeat at the hands of Real Sociedad.
