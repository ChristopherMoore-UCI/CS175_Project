But Maynard had long been taught that Taíno Indians, the indigenous people of Puerto Rico, were "gone, dead and buried" for centuries, decimated by Spaniards who arrived on the island in the 16th century. Still, 14 years ago, Maynard founded the Puerto Rican Folkloric Dance & Cultural Center in Austin, Texas, to preserve the culture of indiginous Puerto Ricans. Growing up in the Bronx, New York, and spending summers in Puerto Rico, Maynard said she had no words to identify who she was. Four years ago, Maynard heard about the work of Dr. Juan Carlos Martinez Cruzado, a geneticist from the University of Puerto Rico. But for Maynard, it wasn't about gaining political power; it was a way to acknowledge her newly discovered Taíno heritage.
