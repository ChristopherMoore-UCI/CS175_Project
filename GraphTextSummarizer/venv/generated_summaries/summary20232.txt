The claim that Hunt lunged at officers with the sword "seems to be inaccurate," Edwards said, "based on witnesses who saw him running from police officers and our independent autopsy." " Hunt was arrested in January on several charges, including assault, child abuse and intoxication, according to county records. But the Utah County Attorney's Office said there is "currently no indication that race played any role in the confrontation between Mr. Hunt and the police officer. "When the officers made contact with Mr. Hunt, preliminary evidence suggests that Mr. Hunt brandished the sword and lunged toward the officers with the sword, at which time Mr. Hunt was shot. To hear prosecutors tell it, Darrien Hunt lunged at officers with a "samurai-type sword" before he was killed.
