Hong Kong authorities have vowed to conduct an impartial investigation into a video which appears to show several plainclothes police officers beating up a detained pro-democracy demonstrator. Embattled Hong Kong leader C.Y. Leung said there was a set and effective mechanism in place to deal with complaints against police. "It is stomach-churning to think there are Hong Kong police officers that feel they are above the law," said Mabel Au, the group's Hong Kong director. Civic Party leader Alan Leong told CNN: "This is an apparent abuse of police power that a society as civilized as Hong Kong would definitely not swallow. A total of 45 people -- 37 men and eight women -- were arrested for alleged unlawful assembly and obstructing police officers, police said.
