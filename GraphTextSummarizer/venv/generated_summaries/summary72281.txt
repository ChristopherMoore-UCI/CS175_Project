In a conversation with co-hosts Kelly Osbourne, Kathy Griffin and Brad Goreski, Rancic remarked, "I feel like she smells like patchouli oil ... or maybe weed. Coleman offered a response via an Instagram posting that said, in part, "To say that an 18-year-old young woman with locs (dreadlocks) must smell of patchouli oil or 'weed' is not only a large stereotype but outrageously offensive." The E! personality is on the receiving end of backlash over comments she made about  Disney star Zendaya Coleman during the network's "Fashion Police" show. Amid criticism for her comments about one star's hair, Giuliana Rancic may want to stick to critiquing the clothing at awards shows. Rancic tweeted an apology and said her remark was not about race.
