Among them are Vietnam vets Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, who was a prisoner of war for more than five years; Sen. John Kerry, D-Massachusetts; and Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia. The drop of veterans in Congress may be attributed in part to the end of the draft system in 1973, according to the Congressional Research Service, but Lynn's group says there is more to the drop off than just a decline in the number of vets in the population "The cost of running a campaign has skyrocketed, especially with the need to buy TV commercials, and that creates a barrier of entry to people coming out of the military (who) don't have the financial ability that others in different professions have," said Lynn, whose group is trying turn the decline around. "Over the past four years, Congress has elevated priorities and expanded benefits and services to all U.S. veterans to the highest levels in quality and funding in our country's history," said Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. "It's not always that veterans care more about defense issues, but those politicians who have served in the military understand to a much greater degree what they are voting on," said Seth Lynn, executive director of Veterans Campaign, a group that trains veterans to run for public office. -- Members of Congress are quick to say they support the troops and veterans, but the number of elected officials who have served has plummeted to its lowest point since World War II.
