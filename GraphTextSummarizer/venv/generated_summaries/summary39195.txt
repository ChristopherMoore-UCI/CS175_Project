There is something about those songs that transcends nostalgia, that parts the clouds, that brings smiles of contentment year after year, town after town. "Little Deuce Coupe" and "Shut Down" and "Surfer Girl" and "Surfin' U.S.A." -- they are America's enduring soundtrack of summer, they somehow never grow old, and there is a chance that, because of those songs, the Beach Boys may one day enter John Philip Sousa territory in the national memory, becoming a sustaining part of U.S. history.

Fifty years since they really were little more than boys, writing and singing the songs of summer for the first time.
