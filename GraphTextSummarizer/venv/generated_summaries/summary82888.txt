Known merely as VUAA1 for now, they say it works not just on mosquitoes, but also ants, flies, moths and a host of other bugs that, at best, are a nuisance and, at worst, carry deadly diseases like malaria. When it's a compound that, according to researchers at Vanderbilt University, is thousands of times stronger than DEET, works on many different insects and could very well save lives. The trick, Zweibel says, was taking the way bug spray as we know it works, then doing the exact opposite. In fact, the project began as an effort to curb malaria, which will probably be contracted by as many as 500 million people this year, said Laurence Zwiebel, a professor in the biological science department at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. "We decided to take a more aggressive approach and, rather than turn off the mosquito's olfactory system, we could look for something that would turn it too far on, to see if we could design a new generation of insect repellents based on overloading their smell system," Zweibel said.
