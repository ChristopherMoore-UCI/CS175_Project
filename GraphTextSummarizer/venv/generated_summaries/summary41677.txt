Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher announced their split on Thursday, but tensions have been building for some time. "The fighting could get pretty intense," an additional source says of Kutcher, 33, and Moore, 49. Unfortunately, their issues -- which went beyond Kutcher's alleged infidelities -- couldn't be resolved. Despite longtime problems, the exes did try to work on their relationship. "Ashton is unhappy; [Demi]'s unhappy," a source tells PEOPLE.
