Last January, Wiles, along with fellow tree climber Drew Bristow, launched an expedition of tree enthusiasts aiming to explore and officially document for the first time some of South Africa's greatest trees. " Outstanding trees South Africa has an exceptional heritage of spectacular trees, boasting a large diversity of more than 1,300 tree and shrub species, as well as more than 1,000 introduced species, according to Izak van der Merwe, a forestry scientist at the country's Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. "I wanted to show Africa's beautiful trees to the world, bringing more awareness -- therefore protection -- to people who may not necessarily be interested in trees normally," says Wiles, co-founder of the "Explore: The Ancient Trees of Africa" project. That fall, however, was never enough to uproot Wiles' childhood fascination with hauling himself up tree trunks and clambering up branches. The authorities asked him if he could help in officially recording the height of specific trees and Wiles proudly says that his project has added up to four trees to the Champion Tree list.
