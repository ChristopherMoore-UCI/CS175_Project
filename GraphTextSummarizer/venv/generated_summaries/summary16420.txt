However, in the years since, current and former employees, as well as congressional investigators, have complained that White House links to the episode weren't properly investigated, perhaps for political reasons, and that the punishment against Secret Service was too severe. An administration official said the White House's review was thorough and that purported hotel records wrongly implicated at least two people: one, the White House intern, and the other, a Secret Service employee. " Complaints that Secret Service employees were treated more harshly than a White House intern overlook one fact, the person close to the probe said. The Secret Service agents implicated are armed U.S. government employees charged with protecting the life of the president and should be held to a higher standard than an unpaid White House volunteer who technically wasn't a government employee, the source argued. According to current and former employees, low morale among some Secret Service employees is behind some of the recent lapses.
