After the youths arrived in New York they spent the Fourth of July weekend visiting ground zero, Central Park and Chinatown, and celebrating the nation's birthday with host families, Atlantic Bridge's director, John Oostdyk, wrote on the organization's website. The 15 Hungarians arrived in the United States on July 2 on a cultural exchange program organized by Atlantic Bridge, a Netherlands-based group that describes itself as "a Christian, international, cross-cultural team with a passion for young people." "When I saw the picture I realized how true it was when someone earlier said 'it is a miracle anyone survived this,' " Oostdyk said on Atlantic Bridge's website. The leaders of Atlantic Bridge did not respond to e-mails for comment Friday night, but the group's website provides a loose timeline of the youths' travels. Marshallton sent a youth group to Hungary through Atlantic Bridge in 2006, and a team from Hungary first came in 2007, the church said on its website.
