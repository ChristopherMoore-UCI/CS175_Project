"No one wants to see another prolonged, botched execution take place, so we are greatly relieved that the Court of Criminal Appeals stayed Charles Warner's scheduled execution, as both Mr. Warner and the State requested," Susanna Gattoni and Seth Day, attorneys for Warner, said in a statement. "The extreme secrecy surrounding lethal injection that led to Mr. Lockett's agonizing death must be replaced with transparency in order to ensure that executions are legal and humane," they said. Warner was convicted in 2003 for the first-degree rape and murder six years earlier of his then-girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter, Adrianna Waller. Warner had been scheduled to be put the death the same day as Lockett, but his execution was stayed. Warner's execution, which had been set for May 13, is now scheduled for November 13.
