-- Less than two years ago, Myanmar's leaders were doing all they could to silence pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. "This is not our triumph, this is a triumph of the people," Suu Kyi said as she arrived at NLD headquarters in Yangon Monday. "The election of Aung San Suu Kyi in a free and fair political contest would surely have to meet the criteria for getting rid of a large slab of the impositions that are currently put on the country," Farrelly said. By welcoming Aung Sun Suu Kyi back into the formal political fold, and also by trying to develop a set of institutions that are internationally legitimate, they feel that they should be able to pretty rapidly reposition themselves to become yet another Southeast Asian semi-democracy, and with that status they'd be able to enjoy all the benefits of full membership of international fora and everything that goes with that membership," Farrelly added. Then suddenly it all changed and suddenly they won a horrendous number of votes, a massive majority," said Monique Skidmore, from the University of Canberra.
