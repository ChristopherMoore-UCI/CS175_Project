Christie on possible Ebola lawsuit: 'Whatever' "We should not be issuing new visas to citizens of those counties until such time as Ebola in those nations have been brought under control," Rubio said. Hickox is in a public spat with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie over her 65-hour mandatory quarantine after returning from West Africa, which she argues was unnecessary. Rubio spent the day campaigning with Senate GOP hopeful Joni Ernst, who is in a neck and neck race with Democrat Bruce Braley. -- Florida Republican Senator and possible presidential hopeful Marco Rubio told CNN he believes that the nurse who was quarantined in New Jersey is a "hero." Rubio said he doesn't think that would be effective, and instead will introduce legislation when the Senate returns to work next month to stop new visas from being issued for people traveling from countries where the Ebola epidemic is severe.
