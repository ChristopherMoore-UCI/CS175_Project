Smith Jr., 26, is accused of "knowingly engaging in conduct with intent to convey false and misleading information," after allegedly making a Thursday morning phone call to police, reporting a false threat about a passenger with "liquid explosive" aboard Flight 1267. The 29-year-old birthday celebrant was arrested for unrelated outstanding warrants, said David Magana, a spokesman for Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.
