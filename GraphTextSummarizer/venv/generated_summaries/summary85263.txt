Before the Vine came out but after the fraternity chapter was suspended, the woman known as "Momma B" told CNN affiliate KOCO-TV that she was blindsided by the overall controversy. Two students expelled over racist chant The Oklahoma Daily, the university's student newspaper, posted a Vine dating from 2013 that shows an older woman talking over a rap song, saying "ni****" seven times in quick succession. The student newspaper reports that the woman appears to be Beauton Gilbow, who was the SAE chapter's house mom. "I was singing along to a Trinidad song, but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week," said Gilbow. "I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me," Gilbow said.
