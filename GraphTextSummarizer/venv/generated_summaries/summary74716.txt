When asked about "The Social Network" -- the film based on the founding of Facebook -- Zuckerberg boasted of fan mail from people who say his story inspired them to become entrepreneurs. This sentiment could create even greater disconnects between Facebook's service and popular apps, as is the case with Gmail and Ping. Small-time developers can freely make use of Facebook's offerings, but larger companies must work directly or be locked out. For example, Facebook's app "is on the vast majority of iPhones," he said at an event earlier this month at Facebook's Palo Alto, California, headquarters. His mission is to "enable others to build" social networking services, which can be accomplished using Facebook's platform, he said.
