"Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future," said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington. According to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks. Despite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind. " It's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research. Unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs, which still use wires, many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals.
