Pope Benedict XVI canonized five new saints Sunday, including a 19th-century priest who worked with ostracized leprosy patients in Hawaii before contracting the disease himself and dying from it. Hansen's disease is a bacterial disease characterized by skin sores, nerve damage and gradual debilitation. Jozef De Veuster, better known as Father Damien, was elevated to sainthood along with the four others in a solemn Mass that was moved indoors from St. Peter's Square to the St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City because of an early morning thunderstorm. The others who were canonized Sunday are: -- Zygmunt Szczesny Felinski, a Polish bishop who kept championing Catholicism after Russia shut down Polish churches in retaliation for the Polish uprising against Russia in Warsaw in 1861. Damien was born in Belgium and went to Hawaii in the 1870s in place of his ill brother.
