He also said his client, Amy Bishop, is "aware of what she's done and she's very sorry for it." Bishop is under suicide watch in jail, Miller said. Authorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986. The shooting was ruled accidental, but after a review of the incident after the Alabama shootings, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating issued a statement saying that probable cause had existed in 1986 to charge Bishop with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition. In an interview Thursday with CNN affiliate WHNT after visiting Bishop, Miller said, "I just think the case speaks for itself." " Bishop told him she does not remember the incident, Miller said.
