It will carry four astronauts and be based on designs originally planned for NASA's Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle, whose development was canceled by President Barack Obama. -- NASA plans a return to yesteryear by developing a space capsule that will carry humans into deep space, it announced Tuesday. "We are committed to human exploration beyond low-Earth orbit and look forward to developing the next generation of systems to take us there," NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said. We're not sure when but certainly as early as possible," said Douglas Cooke, NASA's associate administrator for exploration systems mission. This new spacecraft is NASA's first step forward in its next great leap, as the U.S. space shuttle program heads into retirement.
