They successfully undocked from the space station in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft at 10:02 p.m. ET on Friday after engineers used jumper cables to resolve the problem, NASA said. -- A Soyuz spacecraft carrying two cosmonauts and an U.S. astronaut from the International Space Station landed successfully in Kazakhstan early Saturday morning, NASA said. Alexander Skvortsov and flight engineers Mikhail Kornienko and Tracy Caldwell Dyson touched down in Kazakhstan at 11:23 a.m. (1:23 a.m. ET), NASA said. NASA said their scheduled departure was delayed Thursday after the opening hooks and latches on a docking port would not release. According to NASA, a Soyuz space capsule took the first crew to the orbiting laboratory in November 2000.
