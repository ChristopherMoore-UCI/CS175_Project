Fifty Atlanta students remained on school buses overnight, and seven of them still weren't home by 5 a.m. ET Wednesday, Atlanta Public Schools spokeswoman Kimberly Willis Green said. Across the state, and even extending into Alabama, there were reports of children spending the night in schools, their parents or school buses unable to navigate treacherous conditions that Georgia Department of Public Safety Commissioner Col. Mark McDonough said caused almost 1,000 accidents in the Georgia capital alone. In Georgia's Paulding and Douglas counties, west of Atlanta, schools reported about 1,800 collective students were sheltered at county schools, CNN affiliate WXIA reported. " There were uplifting stories amid the chaos, however, as the city schools' Twitter feed and a specially created Facebook page, SnowedOutAtlanta, which had more than 52,000 members as of Wednesday night, showed a steady stream of gratitude alongside the messages of frustration. Atlanta police delivered food to the kids, who were all home or returned to schools by 9 a.m. ET, she said.
