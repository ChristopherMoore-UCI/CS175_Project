"Reluctance of Indian Railways to own these casualties, which do not fall under the purview of train accidents but are nevertheless accidents on account of trains can by no means be ignored," said the report issued recently by the High Level Safety Review Committee. About 15,000 people die each year simply trying to cross India's mammoth network of railway lines, much of it left over from colonial days. People are dying, it said, because of unmanned train crossings and a lack of barricades, fences and pedestrian bridges. The report by the safety panel, set up in September after a series of rail accidents, said many of the deaths resulted from outdated technology and a lack of infrastructure. Another 1,000 people die because they fall off crammed compartments or in train collisions, the report said.
