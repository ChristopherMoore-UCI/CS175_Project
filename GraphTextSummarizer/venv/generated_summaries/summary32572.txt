NBC will air an episode of "Community" this spring in which Jeff Winger (Joel McHale) and his friends are re-imagined as puppets, it was announced at a PaleyFest panel for the show on Tuesday night. 'Community': James Brolin on playing Jeff Winger's dad The puppets — which were previewed at the panel — are designed and operated by Scott Johnson and Drew Massey, who gave similar treatment to David Boreanaz in an episode of "Angel. This isn't the first time that the comedy has transformed its cast into another form for the bulk of an episode: Jeff and co. were seen as stop-motion animation creations in season two′s "Abed's Uncontrollable Christmas," and as 8-bit video game characters in season three′s "Digital Estate Planning." In the installment, the gang embark on a balloon ride, crash in the woods and encounter an amiable mountain man (guest star Jason Alexander). Dean Pelton (Jim Rash) winds up getting the gang to discuss their adventures in the wild and work through their issues through the use of hand puppets; and in flashbacks, we see larger versions of the puppets.
