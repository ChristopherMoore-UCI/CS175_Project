Watch what happens to 'clunkers' Â» Democratic officials said several hurdles were cleared in order to allow the Senate to pass the bill with new money on Thursday night. The initial transactions are generating a more than 50 percent increase in fuel economy; they are generating $700 to $1,000 in annual savings for consumers in reduced gas costs alone; and they are getting the oldest, dirtiest and most air polluting trucks and SUVs off the road for good," Obama said in a statement Thursday night. The program under Obama's economic stimulus package pays people up to $4,500 for trading an older-model vehicle with low fuel efficiency for new vehicles that get better miles per gallon. White House aides said earlier that President Obama will quickly sign the bill into law to prevent any interruption to the popular incentive. The program was intended to run until autumn, but higher than expected participation caused the government to warn last week the program would run out of money without an infusion from Congress.
