A sticky situation for airline travelers None of the U.S. airlines contacted by CNN.com, including Delta, would comment on specifics of how food moves from manufacturing plants and commercial food kitchens to their airplanes. Peter Jones: Random sampling of food items is to test for pathogenic organisms to ensure against food poisoning. Visual inspection of trays and trolleys is just for quality assurance purposes rather than to protect against threats. It could happen not just in a flight kitchen but in any food preparation operation, where a malicious person could tamper with food. You are probably 100 times more likely to die in a plane crash than eat contaminated food on a plane.
