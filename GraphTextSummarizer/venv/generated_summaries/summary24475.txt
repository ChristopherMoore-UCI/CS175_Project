Since then, Staake has been on the road, "reading" the book to kids and adults -- describing the images, and letting listeners come to their own conclusions about what happens to the bird, boy and bullies. Wordless picture books have had a big few years. Several won the Caldecott Medal for picture book artwork, including "A Ball for Daisy" in 2012, "The Lion and the Mouse" in 2010 and "Flotsam" in 2007.

Staake had other projects and obligations -- books to write, New Yorker covers to draw -- and besides, he was sure nobody would publish it.
