BP shouldered some responsibility for the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster after an internal investigation of the spill, but assigned much of the blame to contractors Halliburton and Transocean. Multiple companies, work teams and circumstances were involved over time." Both Halliburton and Transocean sharply disputed the findings, with Transocean calling them "self-serving" and Halliburton insisting that the problem lay with BP's well design. Its owner, oil giant BP, began its final cementing operations to cap the well on Friday. A team of researchers in the Gulf of Mexico say they found an oily layer as thick as two inches coating the sea floor in some places, and they believe it may be from the BP spill. "This spill began with a bang, ends with a whimper, and leaves a number of issues still screaming for attention," Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Massachusetts, said Saturday.
