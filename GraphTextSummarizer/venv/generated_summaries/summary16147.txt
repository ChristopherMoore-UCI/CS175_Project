We just don't know right now," San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore told CNN's Anderson Cooper 360 on Wednesday. A massive manhunt is under way for DiMaggio, 40, whom law enforcement authorities describe as a friend of the mother, Christina Anderson. A San Diego County sheriff's detective previously had said the remains could be those of Ethan Anderson, one of two children for whom the Amber Alert was issued. An Amber Alert has been issued in Oregon for a 16-year-old girl and an 8-year-old boy believed to have been abducted by James DiMaggio, who authorities suspect kidnapped the children after their mother's body was found in his burned-down house in San Diego, the Oregon State Police said Wednesday. In the event of his arrest, a judge has signed off on a $1 million bond, said San Diego County Superior Court spokeswoman Karen Dalton.
