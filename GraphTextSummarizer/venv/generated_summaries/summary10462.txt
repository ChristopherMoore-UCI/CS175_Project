BBC director general Mark Thompson last week accused Iran of putting pressure on the family members of BBC Persian journalists. The report by Iran's Mehr news agency said Monday that "a number of deceived people, who were tasked with collecting news and information in Iran for the BBC, have been arrested by security forces. The accusation comes a day after Iran's semi-official Mehr news agency said that "a number of people" secretly working for the BBC Persian service had been arrested. "This includes an attempt to put pressure on those who work for BBC Persian outside Iran, by targeting family members who still live inside the country." There are no BBC Persian staff members or stringers working inside Iran," the broadcaster said in a statement.
