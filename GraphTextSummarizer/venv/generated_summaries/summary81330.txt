"I am not aware that the Department of Defense is behind any of the problems that WikiLeaks is experiencing," Col. Dave Lapan, Pentagon spokesman, said Friday. So we are monitoring where documents are emerging from," Crowley told reporters Friday. The United States is trying to track where WikiLeaks is publishing from, Crowley said. "I am not aware of any conversations by the United States government with either any internet host here or any government over there at this point," said spokesman P.J. Crowley. " The Pentagon's top spokesman, Geoff Morrell, said earlier this week that Secretary of Defense Robert Gates does not want to use the Pentagon's online resources to go after WikiLeaks because the impact of the documents being published is not severe enough to warrant it.
