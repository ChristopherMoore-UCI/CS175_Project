-- President Barack Obama will meet on U.S. Veterans Day with Chinese President Hu Jintao -- while both men are in South Korea -- as part of a hectic schedule of summit meetings, news conferences and cultural events on his upcoming four-nation trip to Asia, top administration officials said Thursday. "South Korea and North Korea were basically equally developed 60 years ago and now you see a South Korea that is closely allied with the United States, that has embraced democracy, that has embraced open market reforms, is one of the most dynamic, growing economies and powers on the East Asia stage, but also the world stage, as evidenced by hosting the G-20," Rhodes said. "If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time," Rhodes said, later adding, "We see core U.S. national interests that will be advanced by us playing a key role in helping to shape the future of the region and making clear that we're an Asian and a Pacific power." A message of the trip for North Korea will be the benefits to South Korea from its partnership with the United States and the West, according to Rhodes. According to Rhodes, Obama will attend a business conference in Mumbai and visit the Gandhi Museum, then head to New Delhi for bilateral talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the speech to Parliament and the state dinner.
