Raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized, or heated briefly, to kill harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli and campylobacter. Inspectors suspended the dairy's license to sell raw milk on August 4, after samples taken at the farm tested positive for campylobacter bacteria. Most of the infections occurred in people from Utah counties, though two were out-of-state residents from California and Idaho. The cases of campylobacteriosis have been linked to raw milk or cream purchased at Ropelato Dairy in Weber County, the department said in a statement Tuesday. Raw milk from Utah has sickened 45 people, according to the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food.
