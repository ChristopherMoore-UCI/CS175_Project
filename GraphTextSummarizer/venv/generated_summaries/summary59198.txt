Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug war Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Wednesday said "Australians are feeling sick in their guts at the prospect of execution for these two. Indonesia has long taken a tough line on drug smugglers, and Widodo has made it clear he doesn't intend to introduce a policy of leniency. Two Australians held by Indonesian authorities for nearly a decade appear to be just days away from execution by firing squad. The Indonesian administrative court last week dismissed a case filed by lawyers of the two Australians against President Joko Widodo. They are among a number of people from different countries who are also scheduled for execution.
