German sprint star Marcel Kittel, who had been in yellow after taking the first stage, was unable to keep pace on the climbs of the second day, but is expected to feature strongly on Monday's third leg from Cambridge to London when massive crowds are again expected. The "Manx Missile", he hails from the Isle of Man, was looking to add to his 25 Tour de France stage victories, targeting the opening leg and the flat third stage from Cambridge into London. The likelihood that Cavendish would not start the second stage did not deter the hundreds of thousands of fans who watched the action in the county of Yorkshire, exceeding even the expectations of local organizers. Kwatkowski's ride was some consolation for the Omega Pharma Quick Step team after key rider Mark Cavendish pulled out of the Tour before the start of the 200km second stage. -- Vincenzo Nibali was rewarded for a bold late move to win the second stage of the Tour de France in Sheffield Sunday and don the coveted yellow jersey.
