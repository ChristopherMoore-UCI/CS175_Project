The baby was found by a Carnival Dream crew member Wednesday morning in a guest cabin, said Special Agent Dave Couvertier, spokesman for the FBI field office in Tampa, Florida. Dutch authorities took custody of the infant's body and interviewed the 20-year-old mother, an American passenger, Couvertier said in an e-mail. " The baby's mother remained in St. Maarten and is expected to return to the United States within the next 24 hours, Couvertier said Sunday. The FBI's Evidence Response team was activated Saturday when the ship returned to Port Canaveral, Florida, he said. Carnival personnel reported the discovery to Dutch authorities on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten, where the ship was docked.
