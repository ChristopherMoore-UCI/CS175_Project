"I poke fun at other people, myself," Eminem recently told Rolling Stone magazine about using a slur against gay people in his rhymes. "I always say this about my music, and music in general: Music is like a time capsule," he told Complex magazine. These days there are a plethora of white rappers that can thank Eminem for further opening the door to the genre. "I mean as far as white people rapping, who gives a f**k," said actor/comedian Lil Duval to Vlad TV. It's an era where music artists strive to be shocking (Miley Cyrus, anyone?) while still in fear of running afoul of the political correctness police.
