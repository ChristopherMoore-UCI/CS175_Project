There have been a number of sightings of a man believed to be Frein -- a war buff obsessed with Eastern European military conflicts -- by both local residents and police, State Police Lt. Col George Bivens said without giving further details. Authorities have said that Frein hated law enforcement and that they believe that he's solely focused on hurting more officers but not civilians. Greg Huelbig, who owns the 402 Cafe about 100 yards away, said many residents were inconvenienced but understood the work of law enforcement. "They have no relationship with Mr. Frein, and the Pennsylvania State Police and FBI appear to be merely doing whatever they want up there and ordering people to allow them to go through their homes and vehicles, all in violation of the U.S. Constitution." Soiled adult diapers were also found, perhaps used by Frein to stay in a stationary position for long periods of time.
