The auction also reveals intimate details about Diana's sons, Princes William and Harry. On her birthday in 1988, Diana thanks Filderman for the gift of a letter opener and says she actually waited to open it on time. -- More than 30 letters and cards written by the late Princess Diana were up for auction Saturday in London, revealing personal details such as how she liked to open presents early and that she had trouble coping with media attention. Included in the auction are thank-you letters written by young William and Harry, both on children's stationery and in a childhood script. She refers to her son, Prince William, who was 3 at the time: "I could not resist opening my present, as a parcel of any shape or form has never been safe with me & I fear that William has also picked up this dreadful habit from his mother, as I find wrapping paper undone in the most extraordinary places!"
