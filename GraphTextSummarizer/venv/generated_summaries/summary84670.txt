"That was a big subtext of what they were doing this past week: to show that next year, 'You're gonna need us, so just remember that as you look at what's coming down the pipeline from Republicans, you can't take House Democrats for granted,'" continued Hirschfeld Davis, adding that Obama will need the Democrats to roll back some of the things the GOP wants to do to with his agenda. So they protested -- loudly -- about the details and the process, including venting anger that President Obama was supporting the compromise. The question is whether this is genuine tension between the principals -- both GOP establishment favorites -- or whether this is more of a staff feud, as we still see from time to time between the 2008 Obama and Clinton teams. But what has Republicans buzzing more than that is the repeated pot shots between Camps Bush and Romney in the past week or so, in reports about Bush's political maneuvering or about his venture capital work.
