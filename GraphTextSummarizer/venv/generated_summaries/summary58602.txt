-- Ivory Coast coach Sven-Goran Eriksson is set to play his injured captain Didier Drogba from the start of their crucial World Cup Group G clash against Brazil on Sunday. Drogba fractured his arm during a pre-World Cup warm-up match against Japan but still managed 25 minutes during Ivory Coast's 0-0 draw against Portugal in their opener on Tuesday. Brazil opened their campaign with a 2-1 win over North Korea but face stiffer tests against the Ivorians and Portugal in the so-called "Group of Death. "Always (on) the day of the game, not the day before," he replied to reporters who wanted to know if he was standing by goalkeeper Robert Green, whose astonishing blunder gifted the USA their equaliser in their Group C opener. " Drogba's goals powered Chelsea to the English league and FA Cup double and is clearly vital to the Ivory Coast cause despite still recovering from the surgery to his arm on June 5.
