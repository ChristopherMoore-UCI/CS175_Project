"As of right now, it's still too soon, which is, as I said, pretty frustrating." Woods won his first major at the Masters back in 1997. The world No. 1 is a quadruple winner of the year's first major and he has never missed the tournament since making his debut at Augusta in 1995. "I've had a couple weeks off and getting treatment and just working on trying to get ready for Augusta," added Woods. -- Tiger Woods has not given up hope of teeing off at the Masters later this month. A back injury looked to have ended Woods' 19-year run but the American says it's too soon to write him off for the tournament which runs from April 10-13.
