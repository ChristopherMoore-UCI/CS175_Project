Bullying over food allergies When they compared place of birth with allergic-disease prevalence, the scientists found that children born outside of the United States were less likely to develop asthma or allergies compared with those born in the United States: 20% of foreign-born kids developed allergic diseases compared with 34% of the American-born children. But this relatively high prevalence seems to be unique to the United States, so researchers delved into whether different environmental exposures, dictated by where children were born, could affect risk of allergic disease. Such factors could explain why having foreign-born parents seemed to lower risk of allergic disease in their children even further; the finding held even after the researchers accounted for differences in race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and whether or not the child lived in a metropolitan area. The results confirm those of previous studies that found higher rates of asthma among American children compared with kids from other countries, and investigators have also reported similar differences in allergic diseases between immigrants and native-born citizens in Italy, Israel and Australia. Even after the researchers accounted for factors that could affect rates of allergies, such as race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status, the strong association between being born in the United States and the higher risk of allergic diseases remained.
