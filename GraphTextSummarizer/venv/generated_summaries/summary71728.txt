A mini-map in the upper right-hand corner was very helpful in pointing to merchants, non-player characters who might send you on quests and the locations of those quests. Although the overall tactics of groups of enemies was good (minions charged as their archers and magic-users pinged from afar), they would also stand in place as I lobbed fireball after fireball at them. Experience points are the backbone of character development, allowing for increased abilities, powers and weapons. Player characters appear different as they don different armor and hold different weapons. There are major quests that help move the main plot along and minor quests that offer opportunities to earn more gold and experience points.
