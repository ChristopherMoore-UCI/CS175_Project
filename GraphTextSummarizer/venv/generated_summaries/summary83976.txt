Immediately after the referendum, Greece will still be a member of the EU: their implicit decision to default on loans from the EU ought to carry the automatic sanction that there will be no further disbursements of EU structural funds, agricultural subsidies, EIB loans and the like. Opinion polls suggest that the loan package will be rejected by Greek voters -- but there is a huge difference between answering the casual question of a pollster and a formal referendum, and one that could mark a turning point in the history of the country. The unfolding Greek tragedy will only encourage such states to put their probity beyond doubt, and their voters would have a very clear understanding of why their leaders were asking for such efforts. -- Greek Prime Minster Papandreou has called for a referendum on the terms of the loans from the eurozone and IMF. The risk of eurozone bank failures (and knock-on effects) has been a major incentive but, by the time of the referendum, all EU banks should have been analyzed even more deeply by their regulators and recapitalization plans prepared.
