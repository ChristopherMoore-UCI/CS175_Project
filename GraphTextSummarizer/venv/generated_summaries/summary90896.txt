Watch video of meteor-like fireball Â» Herwig said most of the reports the FAA received came in about midday Sunday in an area of Texas from Dallas south to Austin. -- Sonic booms and at least one fireball in the sky were reported in Texas on Sunday, less than a week after two satellites collided in space and a day after the Federal Aviation Administration asked U.S. pilots to watch for "falling space debris," authorities said. Video captured in Austin, Texas, shows a meteor-like object in the sky Sunday morning. Herwig told CNN the FAA received no reports from pilots in the air of any sightings but the agency recieved "numerous" calls from people on the ground from Dallas, Texas, south to Austin, Texas. Video shot by a photographer from News 8 TV in Austin showed what appeared to be a meteor-like white fireball blazing across a clear blue sky Sunday morning.
