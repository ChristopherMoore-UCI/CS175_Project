"Western consumers have better expectations rather than those who have an established history of drinking Georgian wines," says Davitashvili, who also says that the 300,000 bottles that Schuchmann Wine produces each year could be expanded to one million as China's thirst for wine increases each year. While little known to most wine drinkers in western countries, Georgia has traditionally had a reputation for producing the best quality wine from the region, especially among former Soviet states. "Georgia's wine players all suffered because of the name infringement and it hit the reputation of Georgian wine overall," says Cholobargia. One of the most common ways to produce fakes was to pass off substandard wine, sometimes not made in Georgia at all, as a better quality product. "In 2004 the wine industry started its reforms and by 2006 (counterfeiting and sub-standard quality wine) was partly solved," says Levan Davitashvili, of Schuchmann Wines, an independent winery in Georgia.
