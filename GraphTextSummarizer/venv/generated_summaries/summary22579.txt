We are asked to decide only if a genuine fact issue exists as to whether Dr. Knight engaged in unlawful gender discrimination when he fired Nelson at the request of his wife. Answering the question, he continued: "The issue before us is not whether a jury could find that Dr. Knight treated Nelson badly. In a subsequent conversation between Knight and Nelson's husband, Knight said Nelson had done nothing wrong and that "she was the best dental assistant he ever had," the decision read. According to the high court's decision, Knight complained to Nelson toward the end of her employment that her clothes were tight and "distracting." At one point, Knight told Nelson that "if she saw his pants bulging, she would know her clothing was too revealing," the decision read.
