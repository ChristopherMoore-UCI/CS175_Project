" Pastor: 'Put our trust' in God's will About 50 people with relatives on QZ8501 spent part of Friday afternoon inside a special church for police officers in Surabaya. " CNN's Gary Tuchman reported from Surabaya, as did CNN's Dominique Van Heerden. They didn't all necessarily know one another, having attended services at different churches mostly around Surabaya, the Indonesian city where the commercial airliner took off. So they did, holding their hands high at times, holding each other's hands in prayers at others. And pastor Lianggone Tejo Bunarto says he hopes that those shared beliefs help their loved ones cope now, as the search for more crash victims continues in the Java Sea.
