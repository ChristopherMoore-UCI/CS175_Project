Instead of a race to the tree to see what Santa brought, the focus on Christmas morning will be on spending time together with Lisa's cinnamon rolls, their faith, family games and the opportunity to "truly enjoy the few presents they did get" from grandparents and others. The gift of family Christmas hasn't been completely canceled in the Henderson household. It's not like her children suffer from a lack of toys, Lisa Henderson wrote. The family will still decorate and celebrate Christmas as the birth of Christ, and the children will still get presents from other family. John and Lisa Henderson of Hurricane, Utah, had finally had enough of their little hurricanes.
