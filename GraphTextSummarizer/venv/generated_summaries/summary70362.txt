John Donnelly, a former Vietnam War combat medic, grew emotional on the stand in the George Zimmerman trial Monday as he explained why he thought the screams for help heard on a 911 call made the night Trayvon Martin died were made by his friend, Zimmerman. A confrontation ensued, and Zimmerman said he was forced to kill Martin. Protests were held around the country, calling for Zimmerman's arrest in Martin's death. A witness who saw the fight between Zimmerman and Martin testified earlier in the trial that it looked like a "ground and pound" and that Zimmerman was on the bottom. After his school schedule changed, Zimmerman moved on to boxing training, where he didn't advance beyond learning how to jab, according to Pollack.
