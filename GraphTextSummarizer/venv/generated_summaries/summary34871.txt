Since the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, multiple warring parties have laid landmines, bringing the total number of mines to as many as 640,000 Halo Trust reports. Eight of the abducted were able to flee, said Dr. Farid Homayoun of Britain's Halo Trust. Afghan security forces have surrounded the area, and Halo Trust is trying to enlist the help of local tribal elders to secure the release of the remaining 60. Local police are also working to free them, said Herat province Police Chief Abdul Rauf Ahmadi said. -- The prospect of being blown up makes defusing landmines dangerous work, particularly in Afghanistan.
