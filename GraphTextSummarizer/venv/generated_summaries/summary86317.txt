U.S. troops may have come close to rescuing Mueller in July when they staged a daring raid at a location inside Syria in an attempt to find  journalist James Foley, whom ISIS executed in August, and other hostages.

The Mueller family confirmed her death on Tuesday and said ISIS took her captive in August 2013. In a note to Mueller's family last summer, ISIS said it had grown tired of waiting and demanded 5 million Euros by August 13, according to a source close to the family.
