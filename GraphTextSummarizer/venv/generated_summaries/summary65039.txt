" Woods will compete in the Wells Fargo Championship at Quail Hollow beginning Thursday. The video question and answer session was a first for Woods, who has opted not to carry out a news conference before the Wells Fargo tournament. -- Tiger Woods believes he has fixed the swing problems that led to his disastrous Masters showing last month, although he accepts that a chronic left knee problem will always compromise his efforts to improve. "I didn't touch a club for a week and then the last couple of weeks I've got back into it gradually and started ramping up my practice schedule, my practice time," Woods said. Woods has appeared increasingly keen to engage his fans in recent years, and especially since the scandal about his personal life erupted in 2009.
