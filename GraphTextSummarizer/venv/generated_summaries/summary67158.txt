"If you look at the top models, they probably make 10% to 15% of their money from the catwalk -- the rest is really made from endorsements and brands," said Ryan Schinman, chief executive of Platinum Rye Entertainment, which represents corporations that partner with celebrities. " Schinman pointed to the rise of social media in helping young models build a global following. "Celebrities are becoming a lot less affordable," said Schinman. BÃ¼ndchen doesn't make her millions simply from modeling -- she makes them through lucrative endorsement deals with everyone from H&M to Chanel, and her own line of sandals with footwear company Grendene. "The ability to sell has nothing to do with your profession -- it's down to your popularity and likeability," said Schinman.
