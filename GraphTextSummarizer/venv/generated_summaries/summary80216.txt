-- Turkish authorities have arrested 13 people in connection with blasts that killed 17 people in Istanbul last week, Interior Minister Besir Atalay said Saturday. Istanbul Gov. Muammer Guler, who called the blasts "an act of terror," said last week that the explosive devices were placed 15 meters (49 feet) from each other. Turkey -- a candidate for European Union membership -- has pushed its anti-terror campaign on multiple fronts. Video from last week's bombing in Istanbul shows bloodied people being loaded into ambulances. Tensions between  Turkey Â» and Kurdish rebels have risen over the Kurdistan Workers' Party's increasing attacks and Turkey's subsequent crackdown.
