Bitter protests and counterprotests by supporters and opponents of the government have threatened political stability in Venezuela over the past decade. Is this the first time Venezuela has had protests? Human Rights Watch weighed in, too, warning that Venezuela must avoid "scapegoating" political opponents. Venezuelans have taken to the streets in recent days, leading to gruesome clashes between protesters and police.
