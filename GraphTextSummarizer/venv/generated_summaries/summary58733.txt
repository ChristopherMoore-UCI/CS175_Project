A number of Italy's historic monuments, including the Colosseum and Pompeii, have suffered in recent years from damage and collapse. And buildings in the historic walled town of Urbino -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- are reported to be at risk of collapse under the weight of snow, following unprecedented blizzards in the area. David Pickles, senior architect at English Heritage, told CNN such damage was an extreme version of the natural wear and tear buildings face during everyday weather. In case of similar snowfalls in the future, Brughitta in Rome suggests using a type of cold-weather "blanket" for exposed monuments such as the nearly 2,000-year-old Colosseum. "There's a whole freeze/thaw cycle of damage to buildings where moisture gets into the stonework, into the pores of the stone, it then freezes and expands very significantly, it then breaks up the stone and then when it thaws, bits of stone will start falling off.
