Almagro edged the second set but an early break in the decider set Simon on course for his first title since winning the Medibank International in Australia back in January. -- Gilles Simon secured his second title of the 2011 season by defeating Nicolas Almagro to lift the German Tennis Championships in Hamburg. I had to win so many tough matches this week," Simon told the ATP World Tour's official web site. I had many break points and didn't do anything on many of them. Under the roof at the Rothenbaum Tennis Center, Simon, the number five seed, needed just one break of serve to take the opening set, after his opponent had squandered eight break points.
