-- The Obama administration is considering shifting lethal drone operations run by the Central Intelligence Agency over to the military, U.S. officials tell CNN. "It won't happen overnight," the U.S. official said, adding that operations in some countries would transfer to U.S. military control before other nations. "The CIA should not be doing traditional military activities and operations," Brennan said at his confirmation hearing. The military would operate and fly the drones, an administration official told CNN, but targeting would still be done jointly by various agencies. " CIA Director John Brennan has expressed a desire to move the intelligence agency back to traditional intelligence-collecting.
