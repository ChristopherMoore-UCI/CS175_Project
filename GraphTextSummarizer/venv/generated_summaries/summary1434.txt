Connected home devices are a growing market, and most systems are focused on creating vast networks of inexpensive connected objects, like front door locks, motion sensors, power switches and thermostats. Nest is releasing a new smoke and carbon monoxide detector called Nest Protect that will send a message to your mobile device when the alarm is triggered or when the battery is low, so you can be alerted to an emergency at home even while you are away. It also connects with other Nest Protect devices and can communicate which location is detecting a problem. Some existing "smart home" systems already include support for traditional fire and carbon monoxide alarms. Those alarms are just connected versions of traditional devices and do not have features like human voices or wave controls.
