The most recent chapter in the spinosaurus' long and very bizarre tale occurred last year when Nizar Ibrahim, a German-Moroccan palaeontologist from the University of Chicago, uncovered the most complete skeleton fossil of the species yet found in Morocco's Sahara Desert. "Resurrecting the spinosaurus -- his most famous discovery -- was the best way to bring Stromer back into the books of dinosaur palaeontology," he says. "Everything went up in flames, and Stromer lost all these incredible finds in a single night," recalls Ibrahim, who considers Stromer his role model. Early bones The first, and up until recently only, spinosaurus skeleton ever found was uncovered by a fossil collector working for German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer -- then one of the world's leading experts on the enigmatic dinosaurs of North Africa. (There were) giant sawfish and lungfish, flying reptiles -- some with wingspans of six or seven meters -- and lots of predatory dinosaurs.
