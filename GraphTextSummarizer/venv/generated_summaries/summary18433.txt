Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o grabbed his first hat trick for Chelsea to seal a 3-1 win Sunday which edged Chelsea to within two points of league leaders Arsenal. Chelsea kept the pressure on English Premier League title rivals Arsenal and Manchester City with a dominant victory over Manchester United -- and heaped more trouble on the defending champions. "Of course 100 matches is nice, it's one more fantastic thing for my career," Mourinho told broadcaster Sky Sports. The former Manchester City striker stroked home a late penalty, after Kaka was brought down, to seal a 1-0 win over Verona Sunday. For United, who are seventh in the table and 14 points off Arsenal's lead, and Moyes, victory over their chief rivals would be tonic enough for now.
