VALENCIA, Spain -- Defending America's Cup champions Alinghi of Switzerland have revealed they are to start building a multihull yacht for their duel against American challengers Oracle. The 33rd America's Cup had originally been scheduled to be held in Valencia in July 2009 as a traditional regatta involving several teams. Alinghi retained the America's Cup by beating Team New Zealand in a hugely successful event in Valencia in July 2007. Alinghi have promised a "big beast of a boat" when they take on American challengers Oracle. "Today we have a way forward," said Alinghi team skipper Brad Butterworth.
