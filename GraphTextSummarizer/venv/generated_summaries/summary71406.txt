"I had never met anybody that I thought loved the word of God as much as Victor Barnard did," Ruth Johnson, a former member of Barnard's River Road Fellowship, told "The Hunt." David Larsen, a former leader of the River Road Fellowship, said he helped Barnard set up a so-called "shepherd's camp" in the mid-1990s in Pine County to help bring more people into the church. Victor Arden Barnard, an American pastor wanted for 59 counts of sexual assaults in Minnesota, was arrested by Brazilian authorities on Friday, the office of the governor for the State of Rio Grande do Norte said Saturday. The complaint filed in Minnesota says Tornambe alleges that she was sexually abused by Barnard from the ages of 13 to 22 while she and her parents were members of River Road Fellowship. Barnard had moved to Washington state after an admission to affairs with married women caused the religious group to split, the complaint says. The manhunt began after a two-year investigation into allegations from two women about Barnard's alleged conduct while he was preaching to a religious group in Finlayson, Minnesota.
