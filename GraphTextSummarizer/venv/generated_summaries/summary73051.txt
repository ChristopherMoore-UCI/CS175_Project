One home has only about 10 feet of its backyard left after the slide on Whidbey Island, north of Seattle, CNN affiliate KIRO reported. That home's resident was able to escape, said Ed Hartin, fire chief at Central Whidbey Island Fire and Rescue. The homes are on a seismic fault that on rare occasions shifts, said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. Residents reported hearing a sound like thunder around the time of the slide, CNN affiliate KING-TV reported. -- A massive landslide in Washington has destroyed one home and threatens more than a dozen others, an official and CNN affiliates in the Seattle area reported Wednesday.
