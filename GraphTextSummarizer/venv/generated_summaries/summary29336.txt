"The presence of counterfeit electronic parts in the Defense Department's supply chain is a growing problem that government and industry share a common interest in solving," committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, the ranking member, said in a statement. It also found that part of the problem is the way the government buys parts. The investigation follows a Commerce Department study that found counterfeit parts pose a serious problem for the U.S. military. "The rise of counterfeit parts in the supply chain is exacerbated by demonstrated weaknesses in inventory management, procurement procedures, record-keeping, reporting practices, inspection and testing protocols, and communication within and across all industry and government organizations." The 2010 study by the Commerce Department found the problem of counterfeit parts touched nearly 40% of the DoD's parts supply chain, and was getting worse "rising from 3,868 incidents in 2005 to 9,356 incidents in 2008," the study said.
