" Earlier this year, Paul joined forces with Attorney General Eric Holder, to re-examine the way law enforcement sentences people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. Asked about comments he made Wednesday where he blamed the politician who created New York's high cigarette tax for Garner's death, Paul said the black market created by heavy taxation and regulation -- whether it be food, drugs or cigarettes -- forces police officers to arrest people for mostly menial, non-offensive crimes. "There's a black market because we have made the price of cigarettes so onerous that people are going to sell it illegally," Paul said. Republican Sen. Rand Paul could face a brutal battle against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a Democrat, in the 2016 battle for the presidency. In light of the recent verdict not to indict a white police officer in the chokehold death of an unarmed black man, Eric Garner, Paul said he is "shocked" that no statement has been delivered from the Staten Island police about whether the bystanding officers involved in the incident will continue to serve.
