-- The man who authorities accused of assaulting the 2-year-old son of NFL player Adrian Peterson now faces a murder charge. He also faces charges of first-degree manslaughter, aggravated battery of an infant and abuse or cruelty to a minor. After the game last Sunday, Peterson's teammate, tight end Kyle Rudolph, praised Peterson's determination and heart. State prosecutors released a grand jury indictment Monday that charges Joseph Robert Patterson with second-degree murder. In a text to a Fox Sports reporter, Peterson said he decided to play again for the same reason he participated in the NFL's skills testing event for potential draft picks a day after his brother died in 2007.
