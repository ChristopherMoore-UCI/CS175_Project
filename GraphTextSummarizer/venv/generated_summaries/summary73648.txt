Also known as the Festival of Colors, this celebration takes place on the last full moon day of winter, someday in February or March. The next Holi takes place on March 27, 2013. France Many sources claim April Fools' began in France after King Charles IX decreed that all citizens must begin their calendar on January 1, moving the start of the year back by three months. On April 1, the city erupts with parades, concerts, plays, art, fireworks, costumed locals and pranks galore. New Yorkers can run the "Backwards Mile" through Central Park or attend the April Fools' Parade, which has been announced for the last 26 years, but never taken place.
