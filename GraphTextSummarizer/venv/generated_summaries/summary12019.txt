-- Coalition forces in Afghanistan have killed the Taliban insurgents responsible for the downing of a helicopter that left 38 U.S. and Afghan personnel dead, the commander of U.S. forces there and NATO announced Wednesday. Allen said the strike didn't kill the Taliban leader that U.S. forces were hunting the night of the fatal attack, but he confirmed that Mohibullah was killed in the F-16 strike announced Wednesday. A precision airstrike killed Mullah Mohibullah -- a Taliban leader -- and the insurgent who fired what's believed to be the rocket-propelled grenade that brought down the helicopter, according to Gen. John Allen, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The Air Force Mortuary Affairs Office explained that a "dignified transfer" is not a ceremony, but rather "the process by which, upon the return from the theater of operations to the United States, the remains of fallen military members are transferred from the aircraft to a waiting vehicle and then to the port mortuary." Pentagon spokesman Col. David Lapan said the names, ages, hometowns and military units of the slain Americans will be released within the next 24 hours. The Afghan remains will be returned to their families once identifications can be made, U.S. officials said.
