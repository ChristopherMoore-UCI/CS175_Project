-- Fidel Castro threw his support behind his younger brother and successor, President Raul Castro, in some of his most explicit comments yet about the state of affairs in Cuba. In a meeting with students, Castro said he was "pleased, because the country is working, despite all of the challenges," according to state-run website Cubadebate. It was not clear if that means he will step down as first secretary. Fidel responded that he was not involved as the first secretary, but as "a soldier of ideas," according to Cubadebate. Raul Castro has begun a radical shakeup of the Soviet-style economic model, announcing the elimination of 1 million state jobs and the expansion of private business.
