According to U.S. District Judge James Robart, the 2011 plot to attack recruits at the Military Entrance Processing Center in Seattle "could have done incredible harm if it had gone forward." -- A Seattle man was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Monday for plotting to attack a military processing center using grenades and machine guns, the Justice Department said. "This defendant planned to attack a military center when there would be the largest possible gathering of new recruits and their families," said Jenny Durkan, the U.S. Attorney in Seattle. Abu Khalid Abdul-Latif, also known as Anthony Davis, pleaded guilty in December to conspiracy to murder U.S. military members and to conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, namely explosives. Abdul-Latif wanted to use grenades and machine guns and took steps to buy those arms.
