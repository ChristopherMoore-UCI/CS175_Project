Gunmen fired on police in a suburb of the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the prosecutor's office said. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls is scheduled to be in Marseille later Monday. The gunfire erupted in Castellane, a suburb in northern Marseille that's known for its drug-related activity. Shots were directed at a police car, and police returned fire, according to prosecutors. France has been under a heightened state of alert since last month's terror attacks in Paris that killed 17 people.
