-- A long-running conflict between the Pakistani government and the Supreme Court over old corruption cases against President Asif Ali Zardari appeared to move close to a resolution Wednesday as the two sides reached agreement on a crucial letter. Musharraf's attorney general, Malik Qayum, wrote a letter to Swiss authorities withdrawing Pakistani involvement in the cases against Zardari. The cases relate to money-laundering charges from the 1990s against Zardari and his late wife, former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
