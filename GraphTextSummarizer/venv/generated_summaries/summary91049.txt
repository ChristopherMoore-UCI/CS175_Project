The 1,500-mile feline journey is a "testament to the wonders of nature and the tenacity" of the species, said Daniel Esty, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. A necropsy and genetic tests revealed the lion's origins and travels, the Connecticut environmental agency said. There had been sightings of the large cat in Greenwich, Connecticut, its presence an anomaly in a state where none has been seen in more than a century. Police were informed of a collision between a vehicle and a mountain lion in the northbound lane, near exit 55, of Wilbur Cross Parkway in Milford. -- He was one cool cat, trekking half way across America before meeting an untimely death by car on a Connecticut parkway.
