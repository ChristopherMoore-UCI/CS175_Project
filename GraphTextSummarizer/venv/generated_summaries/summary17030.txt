If recent history is any guide, Apple's next iPhone will go on sale in mid- to late September and will likely to be called either the iPhone 6 or iPhone 5S. -- For the first time Apple stores will soon let iPhone owners trade in their old phones for credit toward a new one, according to multiple reports. Presumably, the 5 would be added to the list of phones that can be traded in for a discount on the next iPhone. According to Apple-centric blog MacRumors, several sources say Apple store employees are currently being trained on the new program, which could go into effect around Apple's September 10 event, when new iPhones are expected to be introduced. The company has released a new iPhone model every year, and the release dates have all been in the summer or fall.
