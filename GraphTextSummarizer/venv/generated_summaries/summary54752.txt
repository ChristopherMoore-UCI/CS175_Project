The youth-based February 20 Movement called for jobs and an end to corruption its members say stems from royal cronies. If people voted for the bloc of traditional loyalist parties, that would suggest they want to maintain the status quo, she said, whereas more votes for the PJD would signal a desire for greater change. The PJD is more moderate than Turkey's governing Justice and Development Party or the Islamists who won power in Tunisian elections last month, Storm said. Economic reform is needed to create more jobs for the country's young people, particularly many university graduates who are unemployed, Storm said. However, he is not obliged to choose the leader of the winning party, Storm said, which gives him more room to maneuver.
