But the faceoff between President Obama and GOP challenger Mitt Romney produced no shortage of humor on Twitter, where observers cracked jokes about everything from Romney's perceived swipe at "Sesame Street's" Big Bird to Jim Lehrer's passive moderating style. Linnéa Sandström ‏-- Romney has a bigger US flag pin than Obama. Somewhere Paul Ryan is kicking over trash cans in hopes of smoking out Oscar the Grouch Jim Sterling ‏-- Obama is winning in the "Looking amazingly condescending when the other guy talks" race. #eyeofthetiger Nisha Chittal ‏-- where is the orchestra from the Emmys when you need them! #debates Storify: Jim Lehrer, the silent moderator Sarah Littman ‏-- Mitt: "I like coal" Poor people will find it in their stockings if I am President.
