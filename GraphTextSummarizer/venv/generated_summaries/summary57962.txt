This is why it makes me furious whenever I hear the word apathy used of young gay men in relation to HIV, as if they had some kind of magical access to helpful, reliable advice and information, when nothing could be further from the truth. In these circumstances the A-word that interests me is not apathy, imagined as a form of culpable voluntary moral failing, but alliances, above all between different generations of gay men who share such closely parallel contemporary challenges. The other concerns the need for targeted support and education for African residents in the UK and gay men, especially relating to the advantages of regular HIV testing which should be understood as a fundamental aspect of self-care. In relation to HIV I think we can identify two relatively distinct sets of pressing contemporary issues. And reported infections among gay men in the UK reached an all-time high.
