-- Kathryn Bigelow, who made the Oscar-winning movie "The Hurt Locker" on the Iraq war, is in the preliminary stages of making a movie about the killing of Osama bin Laden and has gotten access to top White House, Pentagon and CIA officials about the raid. "Our upcoming film project about the decade-long pursuit of bin Laden has been in the works for many years and integrates the collective efforts of three administrations, including those of Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama, as well as the cooperative strategies and implementation by the Department of Defense and the CIA," the filmmakers said. Carney said the filmmakers have met with White House officials and that "the information that this White House has provided about that mission has been focused on the president's role." "There is no difference in the information that we have given to anybody that is working on this topic from what we gave to those of you in this room who worked on it in the days and weeks after the raid itself," Carney said. " "When people, including you in this room, are working on articles, books, documentaries or movies that involve the president ask to speak to administration officials, we do our best to accommodate them to make sure the facts are correct," Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters. There was a CIA ceremony on June 29 in recognition of all those who assisted in the bin Laden raid, but the CIA would not say if any of the filmmakers were among the nearly 1,300 people in attendance.
