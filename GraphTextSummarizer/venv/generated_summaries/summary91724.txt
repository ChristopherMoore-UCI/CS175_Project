While trade has dominated the headlines during Lee's visit, Washington and Seoul also share a common concern over North Korea. "We agree that North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the world," Lee said Thursday. "Most importantly, we believe in American workers." Partly as a result of the auto bailout, Detroit "is a city where a great American industry is coming back to life," Obama added. -- President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart hit the road together Friday, traveling to the heart of America's Rust Belt to tout a recently approved trade deal between Washington and Seoul. The trade deal is "a win-win" for America and South Korea, Obama told a crowd of cheering workers at the plant.
