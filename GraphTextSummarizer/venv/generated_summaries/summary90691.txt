The original video was viewed more than 12 million times, with alternate versions and parodies racking up millions more. Khil was considered one of the Soviet Union's great performers in the '60s and '70s. -- Eduard Khil, a Soviet-era singing star who found renewed popularity as the viral Web's "Mr. Trololo," died Monday, Russian media reported. "Oh no, Mr. Trololo (i.e. Eduard Khil) has died," Jon Fingas, an editor for tech blog Engadget, wrote on the site. According to New Music Express, the original lyrics, about a cowboy riding his horse home to meet his sweetheart Mary, were censored because they were deemed "un-Soviet."
