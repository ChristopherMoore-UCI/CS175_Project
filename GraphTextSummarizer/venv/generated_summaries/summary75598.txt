First, we need to emphasize that rescue and rehabilitation of oiled wildlife must be performed by trained wildlife professionals and volunteers. Sign up for NWF's Gulf Coast Surveillance volunteer teams to help spot and report oiled wildlife throughout the Gulf at www.nwf.org/oilspill. Beyond the short-term threats of oil poisoning and hypothermia, surviving wildlife face potential loss of their food sources and habitat. It is more than simply retrieving, washing and releasing wildlife contaminated with oil. The BP oil spill has brought into the public's eye the tragedy of oiled wildlife.
