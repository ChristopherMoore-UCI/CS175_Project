October: Portuguese police reopen Madeleine inquiry A thousand responses to new police appeal -- After a renewed push for leads in the case of missing British girl Madeleine McCann, authorities in the United Kingdom are turning to Portuguese officials for help. The development in the case comes roughly three months after new police sketches were released of potential suspects and UK police appeared in a TV appeal for information. Do Carmo said Portuguese police have been in constant contact with authorities in the UK. Pedro do Carmo, the deputy national director of the Judiciary Police in Portugal, said Portuguese authorities have not yet received the letter, but he noted the latest lines in the Scotland Yard investigation focus on three people.
