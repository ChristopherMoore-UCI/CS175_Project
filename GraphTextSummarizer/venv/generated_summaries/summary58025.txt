An important post-cancer issue "Finding a simple and accessible way to protect fertility in young breast cancer patients while not harming cancer outcomes is an important issue," said Dr. Lori Minasian, deputy director of the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Prevention and one of the study's co-authors. Moore agrees, saying that goserelin may also be applicable with cancers that are treated with similar chemotherapy drugs, like lymphoma, but that more research is needed. Although the study results are narrowly applicable to hormone-negative breast cancer, the concept may have broader applications in other cancers, said Dr. Clifford Hudis, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. What followed were mammograms, ultrasounds, biopsies and then the diagnosis: She had breast cancer. Goserelin is normally prescribed to women with advanced hormone-positive breast cancer to put them into menopause and stop estrogen production, which can fuel cancer growth.
