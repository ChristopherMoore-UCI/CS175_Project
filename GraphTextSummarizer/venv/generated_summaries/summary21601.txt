The founder of the Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission, Elizardo Sanchez, recently put the number of political prisoners in Cuba at 167, the lowest number in decades. Amnesty International called on the Cuban government Thursday to immediately release all political prisoners, whom the human rights group calls prisoners of conscience because "they acted non-violently and were imprisoned under Cuban legislation which illegitimately criminalizes political dissent." Attorney Rolando Jimenez Posada is serving a 12-year sentence on a conviction of "disrespecting authority and revealing secrets about state security police" after his peaceful manifestation of support for political prisoners, Amnesty International said. Last month, Cuba released dissident Darsi Ferrer and ailing prisoner Ariel Sigler, who is awaiting approval from the U.S. government to join family members in Florida. -- Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas said Thursday he ended his months-long hunger strike after the nation's Roman Catholic Church announced Wednesday that the Cuban government will soon release 52 political prisoners.
