Didier Deschamps' side had plenty of opportunities to win the game but found Ecuador goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez in inspired form. The Swiss finished with six points from three matches, one behind group winner France, which drew 0-0 with Ecuador. Ecuador captain Antonio Valencia was shown a straight red card for a poor tackle on France's Lucas Digne. France, which faces Group F runner-up Nigeria in the next round, wasted a number of good opportunities against a side which played the majority of the second half with 10 men. France, meanwhile, will take on Nigeria in Brasilia on Monday following a low-key contest with Ecuador.
