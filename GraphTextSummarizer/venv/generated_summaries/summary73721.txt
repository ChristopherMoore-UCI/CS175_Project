Authorities closed in on Zetas boss Omar Trevino Morales in predawn darkness, capturing him in an operation without firing a single shot, said Monte Alejandro Rubido, head of Mexico's national security council. Trevino Morales is believed to have been at the helm of the Zetas since 2013, inheriting the post from his brother, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales. "The Zetas represent the worst in global organized crime: violence, intimidation, corruption, and brutal killings," DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a statement. Still, reports of violence, corruption and extortion continue to flow from the areas of northern Mexico where the Zetas operate. There are 11 pending criminal cases against him, and the crimes Trevino is accused of committing make him "one of the most dangerous and bloodthirsty criminals in Mexico," said Tomas Zeron, director of criminal investigations for the Attorney General's Office.
