Stern -- Smith's longtime partner and attorney -- appeared before a Los Angeles judge Wednesday morning for formal arraignment, along with co-defendants Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor. Howard K. Stern,  Anna Nicole Smith's longtime confidant, arrives at Los Angeles Criminal Courts on Wednesday. California Attorney General Jerry Brown, when he announced the case in March, said the doctors and Stern devised a plan to use fake names so Smith could be prescribed "thousands of pills. The three are charged in California with several felonies, including conspiring to furnish controlled substances, unlawfully prescribing a controlled substance and obtaining fraudulent prescriptions from June 2004 through January 2007 -- only weeks before Smith's death. -- Howard K. Stern and two doctors entered "not guilty" pleas to charges of conspiring to provide drugs to Anna Nicole Smith before her fatal overdose in 2007.
