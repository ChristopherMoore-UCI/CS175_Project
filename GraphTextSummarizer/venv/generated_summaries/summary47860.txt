He pointed to what he said appeared were contradictions coming from the Palestinian side, asking, "how can Israel have full security while they're still digging terror tunnels and making rockets?"

"Because Israel will not demilitarize either, will not even commit itself that it will never use military arms against Gaza. Israel blames Hamas for civilian deaths, saying militants fire rockets from civilian areas and encourage people to stay despite Israeli warnings of impending attacks.
