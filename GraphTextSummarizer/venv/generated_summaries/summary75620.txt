The consequences of an arrest are severe, especially for young people of color who are already disproportionately subjected to criminal justice system intervention and incarceration. But what many people don't know is that the state decriminalized this offense more than 30 years ago, making private possession of less than 25 grams of marijuana a violation punishable by a $100 fine. New York City spends about $75 million every year on arresting people for recreational marijuana possession. Thousands of people are then arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession, punishable by up to three months in jail and a $500 fine. But it cannot be criminal activity for one group of people and socially acceptable behavior for another when the dividing line is race.
