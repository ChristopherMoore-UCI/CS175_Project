All three leaders have canceled planned commencement addresses after protests by students at Rutgers University, Smith College and Haverford College respectively. Kudos to the rabble rousers in the Class of 2014 making waves across the country protesting the political views of commencement speakers. So to those of you who haven't raised objections to commencement speakers yet, or who are getting a jump on 2015, here's some advice:  Let them come. And the University of California at Berkeley was arguably extremely violent in its handling of Occupy protesters under the leadership of Chancellor Robert Birgeneau. Bonus: Even the well-known folks often give boring commencement speeches, so if you can make your protest entertaining, your fellow students will be even more grateful.
