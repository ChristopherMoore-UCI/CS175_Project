Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Gaza for three days, in what they say is retaliation for repeated rocket attacks into southern Israel by Hamas. In Yemen, thousands of demonstrators gathered in the capital, Sanaa, shouting slogans in support of Gaza and its residents and burning Israeli and U.S. flags. The dramatic developments in Gaza over the past three days have driven Arab citizens to the streets, where they have displayed anger directed first and foremost at their own governments. We can't tell them we heard about the Gaza disaster of 2008 but didn't do anything." Show Gaza your support." Students at the University of Qatar boycotted their classes and demonstrated their support for Gaza.
