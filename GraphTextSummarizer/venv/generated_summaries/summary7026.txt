In February 2010, Harrell was arrested in Meridian, Mississippi, by federal agents following a search of his Florida residence, Clay County authorities said. Somer Thompson went missing in October 2009 in the Clay County town of Orange Park, Florida. A few weeks later, on April 1, 2010, Harrell was indicted on the four additional counts -- first-degree murder, kidnapping, sexual battery and lewd and lascivious molestation -- related to the disappearance and death. Succinctly answering questions posed by 4th Judicial Circuit Judge Don Lester, Harrell admitted to the facts of the crime, including taking video and pictures of Somer Thompson. The slain girl's mother, Diena Thompson, said she couldn't bring herself to forgive what Harrell did to "an innocent child." "835 days ago, you lured my baby into your lair with trickery and malice in your soul," the mother said, after following her son to the stand to give the final victim's impact statement.
