Gabby and Mark: The new 'Bradys' of gun control Nevertheless, allowing CNN's cameras to exclusively capture Kelly shooting a gun with Giffords looking on is meant to help advance their political cause: curbing gun violence.

Exclusive: Gabby Giffords still appreciates gun culture The speed of background checks Kelly also showed off a gun he recently bought -- videotaping the transaction -- for the sole purpose of demonstrating how easy it is to get a background check, and why he and Giffords want the checks expanded to private sales such as gun shows. Giffords is seen as a good spokesperson for new laws to curb gun violence, even though she can't speak very well.
