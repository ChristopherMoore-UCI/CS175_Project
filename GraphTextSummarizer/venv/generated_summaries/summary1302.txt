Osmek and a crew of about 20 helpers use low-tech and high-tech methods to guard against bird strikes. Wildlife biologist Steve Osmek checks a radar screen for information on birds close to the Seattle airport. Osmek uses a laser with a scope on it to shine a green light near birds. But the airport's most valuable tool, Osmek says, isn't one that scares off birds -- it's one that helps find them. After studying the radar long enough, Osmek can tell from flight patterns what kind of bird he is looking at.
