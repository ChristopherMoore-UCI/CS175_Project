An average of five local police officers have been killed per month in Juarez during that period, municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said. -- A municipal police captain was fatally shot while driving to work on Thursday in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, becoming the 49th municipal police officer killed since October 2010, authorities told CNN. The shooting happened about 2:30 p.m. in southwest Juarez, Sanchez said. Juarez is considered a flash point in Mexico's nearly five-year war on organized crime.
