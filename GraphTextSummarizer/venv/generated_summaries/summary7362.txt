Somebody immediately piped up saying, "Of course they have to fire them because of liability." Liability?! These two Best Buy employees tackled a shoplifter they saw busting out of their Denver, Colorado-area store with stolen electronics. Clark Howard says Best Buy should have lauded employees who ran after a shoplifter, not fired them. After all, I'm the guy who chased down my own mugger on a Madrid subway train during a staff trip to Spain. I could understand if Best Buy were so cowardly and afraid of a lawsuit that they felt these two employees should be sent to "Best Buy re-education camp."
