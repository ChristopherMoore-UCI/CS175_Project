The official announcement comes as the Vatican reels from accusations that it did not do enough to stop child abuse by priests, nuns and other Catholic authority figures across Europe for decades. Benedict is working on an official statement, or pastoral letter, to Catholics in Ireland, where a damning government-backed report into child abuse by priests prompted four bishops to resign last year. The pope's visit comes at a time of heightened tensions between Rome and the Church of England following the Vatican's outreach to disaffected Anglicans last year. Benedict will give "a major speech to British civil society" at Westminster Hall in London and will beatify the 19th-century theologian and educationalist Cardinal John Henry Newman at a public Mass in Coventry, England. The move comes some 450 years after King Henry VIII broke from Rome and created the Church of England, forerunner of the Anglican Communion.
