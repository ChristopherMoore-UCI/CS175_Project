The survey by the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project illustrates the indispensable role that text messaging, and mobile phones in general, play in the lives of today's teenagers. -- As most parents of adolescents know all too well, text messaging has become the preferred method of communication for American teenagers, with one in three teens sending more than 100 texts a day, a new survey says. Forty-three percent of teens who take their phones to school reported sending at least one text message from class a day, despite the fact that many schools have banned cell phones in class. The research, made public Tuesday, confirms that teens make and receive far fewer phone calls than text messages. Lenhart said the growth of wireless carriers' unlimited texting plans has made it easier for teens to communicate via text message.
