The message came from a complete stranger, identified on Facebook as Bernie Sarratea, as part of a CNN Change the List campaign to get people in Hawaii to vote in the upcoming election. We featured six nonvoters from Hawaii as a way to highlight the diverse reasons people in the Aloha State don't vote. The sous-chef on Hawaii's Big Island did not plan to vote when I met him in October because he had such trouble at his polling place during the primary election this year. A fourth plans to vote in the future, but did not register in time for tomorrow's election (that's yet another reason Hawaii should pass a same-day voter registration law). Incidentally, a 50% turnout rate is exactly what Hawaii needs to hop off the bottom of the national voter turnout list, if the numbers hold from the 2008 presidential election.
