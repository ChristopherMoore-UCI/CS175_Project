"Here at Smitten we actually make every single batch of ice cream to order," explained store founder Robyn Sue Fisher. "A smaller ice crystal makes a smoother, more luscious texture," said Fisher, "so our ice cream is actually a lot creamier than other ice cream in addition to being a lot more fresh." "My mom used to tell me that I had two stomachs and one of those was solely reserved for ice cream," Fisher said. "I was totally broke and that's why the only thing I could do was sell ice cream out of a Radio Flyer wagon -- which was a super amazing way to learn about what people wanted," said Fisher. So the little girl with the big appetite invested her life savings, teamed up with some engineers and spent five years prototyping ice cream machines in her backyard.
