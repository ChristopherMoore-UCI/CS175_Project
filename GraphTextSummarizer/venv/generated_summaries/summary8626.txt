Given Baengyeong island's proximity to North Korea, North Korean involvement was feared, but South Korean officials have played down that scenario. That patrol vessel was capsized after a gunfight with North Korean naval units. South Korean officials later confirmed that one of their ships had fired on a radar contact that turned out to be a flock of birds. North Korean state media remains silent on the issue. Presidential spokeswoman Kim Eun-hye told reporters there were "no unusual signs" of North Korean activity near the scene.
