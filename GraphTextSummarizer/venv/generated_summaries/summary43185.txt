"It gives us a very clear picture of the first president and his determination to be president according to the rules bound by the Constitution and later by the Bill of Rights," said Chris Coover, senior specialist in books and manuscripts at Christie's. It was sold at auction and has had several notable owners since that time, including William Randolph Hearst and the Heritage Foundation, according to Christie's. This piece of American history was part of the personal archive of noted collector H. Richard Dietrich Jr. Two similar versions were created for Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Attorney General John Jay. "These notations highlight key passages concerning the president's responsibilities, testifying to Washington's careful, conscientious approach to his powers and responsibilities in his groundbreaking first term," according to Christie's.
