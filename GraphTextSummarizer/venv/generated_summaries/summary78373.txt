-- A New York police officer getting her hair done over the weekend thwarted a would-be robber in a beauty salon, shooting the weapon from the gunman's hands, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said in awarding the officer a promotion. I don't fuss about much," Jones responded modestly, asking reporters to address her as "Jonesy" instead of Detective Jones. "To describe Officer Jones as cool under fire would be a gross understatement," he added. Kelly said Jones was a customer in a salon Saturday when a man walked in with a gun. After the man ordered the customers and employees into the bathroom, Jones reemerged with her weapon drawn, identified herself as a police officer, and told the man not to move, Kelly said.
