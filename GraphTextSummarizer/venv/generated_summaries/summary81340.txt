-- Yemeni jets launched an aerial assault Thursday against suspected senior al Qaeda operatives meeting in a remote location, and about 30 militants were killed, according to the Yemen news agency SABA. Without mentioning a number, the Yemeni Embassy in Washington said in a news release, "Preliminary reports suggest that the strike targeted scores of Yemeni and foreign al Qaeda operatives." Also among those targeted was Mohammed Saleh Oumair, who spoke a few days ago at a rally in Abyan province in southern Yemen, the government said. In late July, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the U.S. Central Command, and an accompanying delegation met with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh. The apparent purpose of the meeting was to plan a retaliation operation after Yemeni forces raided militant hideouts last week in Abyan and in Sanaa province, where the nation's capital is located, the embassy said.
