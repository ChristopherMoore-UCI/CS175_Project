The move also comes after Egyptian Prime Minister Ibrahim Mehleb, late Monday night, declared Tuesday a public holiday "in compliance to citizens' wishes," state TV reported. -- Voting in Egypt's presidential election will be extended into a third day Wednesday to allow citizens a greater chance to vote, election officials announced Tuesday in a move criticized by both candidates' campaigns. Extending the voting period for no real plausible reason will open the door to possible vote violations and rigging," said Hussein AbdelGhany, a top adviser to Sabahy. The election commission extended the voting in part so that people living in areas away from where they are registered can return to vote, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported. The election, initially scheduled only for Monday and Tuesday, pits former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi against Hamdeen Sabahy.
