As the author of three children's books on American history, I've visited many classrooms across the country to share the adventures of Ellis the Elephant, my time-traveling pachyderm, with children ages 4 to 8. Today, unfortunately, many of our students are failing to learn American history, including our founding principles and values. Just 20% of fourth-graders, 17% of eighth-graders and 12% of 12th-graders were at grade-level proficiency in American history in the 2010 exams. With education surveys showing dismal results, we must find creative ways to teach our children American history. Like children's books, educational video games, too, have enormous potential to make history come alive.
