Born as Jatin Khanna in 1942, Khanna married fellow actor Dimple Kapadia in 1973. They had two daughters, Twinkle Khanna and Rinke Khanna. The death of Khanna, who starred in dozens of movies in a career spanning five decades, prompted tributes from fellow actors and the Indian government. "He was called the first superstar of the Indian cinema and his popularity as a romantic hero in the 1960s and 1970s is a part of our film folklore," Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote in a condolence message to Khanna's family. He went on to star in a string of hit romantic movies, and his shy smile won him legions of devoted admirers.
