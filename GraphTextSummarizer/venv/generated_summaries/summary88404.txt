Watch Amy Chua defend her methods of parenting Chua, a second generation Chinese American, mother of two and Yale Law School professor, argues that Chinese moms churn out whip-smart kids precisely because they don't allow childhood frivolity like sleepovers or play dates, along with just about everything else that is social, fun or distracting, including TV, video games, sleepaway camp and auditioning for the school play. "On their own," Chua writes, "Children never want to work, which is why it is crucial to override their preferences." Getting kids to do their homework is challenging enough, but tacking on extra hours of mom-generated exercises? Chua claims that heaping shame and ridicule on her children drives them to success. For Chinese moms, a less-than-perfect child is a disgrace to the family, a slap-in-the-face to the parents -- utter shame.
