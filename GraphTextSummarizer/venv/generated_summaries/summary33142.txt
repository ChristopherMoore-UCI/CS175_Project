-- The New Jersey Attorney General announced criminal charges Friday against state troopers involved in the unauthorized high-speed State Police escort of a caravan of high-performance sports cars dubbed "Death Race 2012" by local media in March. For their alleged part in the license plate changes, Nassry was charged with third-degree tampering with public records or information and fourth-degree falsifying or tampering with records. Authorities also announced disciplinary charges against four other troopers in connection with a similar State Police escort involving similar vehicles in 2010, and disciplinary charges against a trooper who improperly handled a speeding ticket issued to a member of a driving club in his Lamborghini in 2010. State Police officials revealed new Standing Operating Procedure addressing escorts Friday too. The new procedure outlines when escorts are authorized and places an emphasis on public safety a statement said.
