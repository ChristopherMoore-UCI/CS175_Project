In addition to the Romney spot, the Chamber of Commerce is set to unleash more New Hampshire ad spending in coming weeks, the sources said. The chamber is launching the ad Friday on behalf of Republican Senate nominee Scott Brown, who trails Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen by anywhere from 2 to 10 points, according to recent polls. On top of the New Hampshire ad spree, the Chamber of Commerce is set to air ads Friday in Arizona's 2nd Congressional District and Colorado's 6th District, two of the country's most competitive House races. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is readying an advertising blitz in the New Hampshire Senate race with a new television spot starring Mitt Romney, sources familiar with the ad buy told CNN. New Hampshire is familiar turf for Romney, who convincingly won the state's first-in-the-nation presidential primary in 2012 and campaigned with Brown in Stratham earlier this summer.
