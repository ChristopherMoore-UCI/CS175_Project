The United States can learn from the experience of other countries where people maintain wide-ranging rights to carry weapons, but have taken measures that effectively brought an end to gun massacres. Importantly, people who have mental illnesses that put them at risk of violence should be blocked from owning weapons. There are two common denominators: guns and mental illness. Can we have a moment to set aside strategic long-term political objectives -- just a brief interlude -- and work together to try to prevent more people with mental illness from arming themselves and killing the innocent? On the other side, gun control advocates brandish their arguments while relatives of the latest victims cry out in pain and despair.
