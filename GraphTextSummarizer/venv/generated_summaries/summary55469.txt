Jeff Zucker, President of CNN Worldwide, described the award-winning pieces as "powerful and provocative acts of journalism." " Judges commented that: "CNN correspondent Arwa Damon and photojournalist Sarmad Qaseera arrived quickly in Benghazi to find valuable clues in the wide-open but looted and burned ruins of the consulate. The judges said Damon provided insight into the mind of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the September attack on the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi. In February, CNN won "News Channel of the Year" at the Royal Television Society Awards in London, while last November, the international news network was also honored with three awards for its outstanding storytelling efforts at the Foreign Press Association Media awards. The IRE Awards, which recognize the most outstanding watchdog journalism of the year, announced CNN's coverage of the U.S. Consulate attack in Benghazi as the winner of the "Investigations Triggered By Breaking News" category.
