Clinton, Obama's former secretary of state, said the President gave a "very clear explanation and robust defense of the action he has ordered" regarding airstrikes against the terrorist group ISIS in Syria and Iraq. The United States and a coalition of member countries conducted their second day of airstrikes in Syria and Iraq on Tuesday, targeting terrorist cells and organizations in the region. Earlier in the day, Clinton's husband -- former President Bill Clinton -- echoed his wife, telling CNN's Erin Burnett that he supports the airstrikes. Hillary Clinton publicly backed President Barack Obama's authorization of Syrian airstrikes during a panel discussion in New York  Wednesday and attempted to dismiss previous disagreements she had with the Obama administration on Syria. Clinton has not always agreed with Obama on his policies in Syria.
