Theo Zwanziger, an executive committee member of football's world governing body, was giving evidence  on the welfare conditions of migrant workers involved in construction projects for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. On Tuesday, World Cup organizers in Dubai, who had been set a deadline by FIFA, unveiled an updated 'workers' charter' -- which pledged to address concerns over wages and accommodation for overseas workers and pledged regular inspections of construction sites. "FIFA is pleased with the commitment of the local organizers to use the hosting of the FIFA World Cup to accelerate adequate uniform working standards in Qatar," it added. "We welcome the concrete steps taken which were announced by the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy to ensure the welfare of workers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup," said a spokesperson. Other speakers addressing the parliament highlighted Qatar's kafala system -- which allows employers to withhold pay and prevent overseas workers from leaving the country by withholding their passport.
