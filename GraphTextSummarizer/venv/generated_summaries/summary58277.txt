New polls over the weekend showed key races moving in the GOP's favor, especially in Iowa, where Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst's lead over the Democratic candidate is growing. Biden was in Florida this weekend campaigning with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist as part of a trip that also took him to California and Nevada. Vice President Joe Biden isn't buying the growing consensus heading into Election Day that Republicans are poised to take control of the Senate. "I don't agree with the oddsmakers," Biden said in an exclusive interview with CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. The vice president has played a crucial role for the administration during this election season, appearing with Democratic candidates across the country at a time when President Barack Obama's popularity is waning.
