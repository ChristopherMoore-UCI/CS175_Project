" U.S. officials privately acknowledge they have provided secret intelligence on several al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula targets to Yemen's government, but won't say whether U.S. aircraft or drones took part in the strikes. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula issued an Internet statement claiming responsibility for AbdulMuttalab's failed attempt to bring down Northwest Airlines Flight 253, calling it retaliation for what it said were U.S. airstrikes on Yemeni soil. Mohammed al-Basha told CNN's "The Situation Room" that conversations with AbdulMutallab's former acquaintances have not yet turned up links to the local al Qaeda group, which has claimed responsibility for AbdulMutallab's attempt to bring down a Northwest Airlines flight on Christmas Day. "I think the al Qaeda statement that came out recently saying that this is an attack in retaliation for what happened the 17th and 24th of December is unfounded, because we know that he bought the ticket a few days before that, so there's no link for the time being," al-Basha said. Al Basha rejected suggestions that Yemen has not been strong enough in its fight against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, but noted the nation has "a serious problem."
