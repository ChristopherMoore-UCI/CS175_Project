A newlywed woman died after plunging about 2,000 feet in a BASE jumping attempt in Utah's rugged Zion National Park, authorities said Sunday. The risky activity is illegal inside Zion National Park, authorities said. Butler, 29, then hiked out of the remote area to find help, alerting park authorities at about 6:30 p.m. Bellows jumped first on Saturday afternoon, but her parachute didn't open properly, Butler told authorities. The Salt Lake City couple were said to be experienced BASE jumpers -- in which participants leap from fixed objects, such as mountains or buildings, using parachutes to slow their falls.
