Those include new regulations requiring sterile compounding pharmacies to report volume and distribution to the state for the first time; the hiring of additional inspectors; and legislation filed earlier this month creating additional regulations and requirements. -- Massachusetts health officials on Tuesday ordered 11 compounding pharmacies to completely or partially shut down, after unannounced inspections were conducted in the wake of a fungal meningitis outbreak. The state's Department of Public Health began inspecting 40 sterile compounding pharmacies after the multistate outbreak last fall was linked to steroid injections distributed by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center (NECC). According to its report, state and federal investigators "identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk. A second compounding pharmacy surrendered its license after inspectors reported "significant" issues that could affect sterility, state health officials said.
