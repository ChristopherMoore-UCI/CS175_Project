A defense attorney for one of the suspects told CNN affiliate KPRC that the number of suspects could increase. Broussard told CNN on Tuesday that it took authorities months to investigate the incident and obtain indictments and arrest warrants. The incident allegedly happened November 28 at two residences in Cleveland, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by CNN on Tuesday. The case has sharply divided the community, according to CNN affiliate KHOU, which reported the girl was 11 years old. "There have been leads during our investigation that have alerted us to other possible persons of interest," Broussard told CNN.
