-- The head of the International Monetary Fund is being questioned by police in connection with the alleged sexual assault Saturday of a Times Square hotel housekeeping employee, New York Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne told CNN. Since being detained, Strauss-Kahn has declined to answer questions from New York police investigators nor has he made a statement, Browne said. The IMF executive "offered no resistance" when he was led off the plane, after which he was turned over to New York police, added the official. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey police pulled Dominique Strauss-Kahn off of an Air France flight destined for Paris at John F. Kennedy International Airport after the alleged incident, according to Browne. New York police asked their counterparts at the Port Authority to hold the plane.
