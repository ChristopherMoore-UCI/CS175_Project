-- An FBI agent was arrested in Pakistan this week after he attempted to board a domestic flight between Karachi and Islamabad with ammunition and knives, police said Wednesday. He appeared in court Tuesday to face anti-terrorism charges, which restrict unauthorized weapons and ammunition on commercial flights, and he is scheduled to appear again Saturday. The man was arrested Monday with fifteen 9 mm bullets, three small knives and a wrench, according to police Superintendent Malir Rao Anwar. Rao Anwar said he expects the case to go to trail, calling it a matter of "upholding Pakistan's dignity and honor. The agent was visiting Pakistan as part of an assignment to train local police, a U.S. law enforcement official said.
