It seems that President Obama won his first Nobel Peace Prize, for, well, being President Obama. I am reminded of when Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf decided to retire the jersey of longtime White Sox player Harold Baines. But with Barack Obama, who surprisingly picked up his first Nobel Prize on Friday, the reaction was not altogether positive from either the left or the right. But what exactly has President Obama done to deserve such an award? John Feehery says he's proud Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize, but now the president needs to earn it.
