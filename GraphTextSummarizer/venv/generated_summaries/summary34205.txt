"The richest 1% have seen their share of global wealth increase from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014," Oxfam says in a report Monday. The report comes a day before President Barack Obama is expected to unveil proposals that close tax breaks on the wealthy. "Of the remaining 52% of global wealth,  46%  is owned by the rest of the richest fifth of the world's population," the report says. The remainder of the population only possesses 5.5% of global wealth. So says a new report, which estimates that the richest 1% will have as much wealth as the other 99% combined by next year.
