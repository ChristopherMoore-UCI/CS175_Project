" Attending class with the same cohort of students over the past three years has helped a lot, Kwong said, and students have learned to make an effort to include Tsang in conversations. Chiu also said that Tsang was the only student at Ebenezer to have used their lips -- and is the sole case she is aware of in Hong Kong. While her academic feats -- she scored 5**, the highest possible grade, for Chinese, English, and Liberal Studies, 5* for Chinese Literature and English Literature and 4 for Math â€” have won her much acclaim in Hong Kong, Tsang admits that she surprised herself. While Tsang may not be the very first person to resort to lip-reading Braille, she appears to be a rare case. She also lacks sensitivity in her fingertips, which denies her the ability to feel the raised dots of Braille characters.
