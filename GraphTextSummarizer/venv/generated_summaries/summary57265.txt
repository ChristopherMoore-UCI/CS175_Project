Alsruhe said she is flying to Denver on Tuesday afternoon on another flight. After a hectic morning, passenger Stormie Alsruhe, 30, was just settling into her seat on Southwest Airlines Flight 449 looking forward to enjoying her coffee. The plane was "taxiing to its gate at LaGuardia Airport when its left horizontal stabilizer and the winglet of a moving Southwest Airlines 737 made contact," American said in a statement. Two planes bumped into each other on the tarmac at New York's LaGuardia International Airport around 11 a.m. Tuesday. The Southwest aircraft bound for Denver has been taken out of service for inspection and repairs, the airline said.
