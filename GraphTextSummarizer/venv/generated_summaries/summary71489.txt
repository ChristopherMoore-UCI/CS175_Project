" Estranged wife accused Haskell of dragging, hitting her Karla Haskell wasn't the only person who had sought protection against Ronald Lee Haskell. Utah police said Melannie Haskell in August of 2013 reported a protective order violation in which she alleged Ronald Haskell threatened her and her lawyer. Ronald Haskell was subsequently charged with domestic assault and domestic violence in the presence of a child. That came after a three-hour standoff in Texas, at the end of which Ronald Lee Haskell was taken into custody. Texas authorities said Haskell entered a Spring, Texas, home demanding to know the whereabouts of his estranged wife, Melannie Haskel.
