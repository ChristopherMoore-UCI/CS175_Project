From inflatable Wii racing karts to iPad joysticks and plastic assault rifles tailor-made for living room juntas, there's no shortage of weird, wild and occasionally even useful peripherals for handheld and set-top systems alike. Of all the goofy gewgaws (e.g. plastic sword, shield, fishing rod, machine gun and jet-ski inserts) offered for Wii and PlayStation 3, we're partial to these motorcycle handlebars from InterWorks Unlimited, Inc. Crank up "Born to Be Wild," twist the Wii remote to rev up, and you too can join the ranks of balding middle managers who spend their Sundays hitting the road on their virtual hog -- while reclining in a well-worn La-Z-Boy. This plastic attachment lets you turn your PlayStation Move motion controller into a full-fledged rifle, theoretically providing greater accuracy and atmosphere in shooter games like the suddenly timely "SOCOM 4: U.S. Navy SEALs." Go ahead -- screw up your face and do your best "Terminator" impression. Designed for use with popular fighting games such as "Marvel vs. Capcom 3," it lets you plug in its 13-foot USB connector cable to enjoy customizable button mappings, turbo functionality and that classic quarter-munching feel. Given the Nintendo 3DS handheld 3-D gaming system's anemic 3- to 4- hour battery life, this useful combo charging dock and capacity-boosting rechargeable battery comes in especially handy by offering double the juice.
