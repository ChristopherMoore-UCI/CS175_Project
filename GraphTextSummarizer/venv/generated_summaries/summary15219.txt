Images of parents and family members clambering up school buildings and clinging on window ledges to pass cheat sheets to their children have left authorities in despair. Bihar Education Minister PK Shahi told reporters that children won't learn if they're constantly helped by family members. Earlier this year, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a nationwide campaign urging parents to send their children, especially daughters, to school and properly educate them. After photos started making the rounds on social media, police officials took the man into custody and charged him with "breach of the peace." According to local police officials, the girl's parents offered her several incentives, such as chocolates and toys to entice her, however when the girl was still reluctant, her father decided to take matters in his own hands.
