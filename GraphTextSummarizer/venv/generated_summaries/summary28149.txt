In St. Paul, residents are using pumps to remove water from their properties, said meteorologist Chris Franks at the National Weather Service. "The summers is pretty much over," said Gil Roscoe to CNN affiliate KARE. Today, that same pavilion is under several feet of water, in a surge of flooding that has swept through several Minnesota towns. Though the torrential rains continue, they'll likely have little to no effect on water levels because the Minnesota rivers are starting to recede, Franks said. "I never would have thought, never would have imagined this would happen," Shlieve told CNN affiliate WCCO.
