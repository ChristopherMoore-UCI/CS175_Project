At the time of the stunt, many New Yorkers wondered whether it represented an act of terrorism or an anti-American statement. " "White American Flags" was meant in part as a tribute to the German-born American architect of the Brooklyn Bridge, John August Roebling, who left Germany in 1831 "in search of a better future in the land of freedom and opportunity," the artists' statement said. -- Two American flags that were taken from the Brooklyn Bridge are now in the United States and are expected to be returned to the New York Police Department Friday, a law enforcement official tells CNN. But the artists, Matthias Wermke and Mischa Leinkauf, said the replacement of the American flags with two massive white flags last month was nothing more than an "art project" by the two performance artists meant to deal with "questions of historical legacy and art in the public sphere. The NYPD said they believe a pair of German artists took the flags and replaced them with two white flags late on July 21, the official added.
