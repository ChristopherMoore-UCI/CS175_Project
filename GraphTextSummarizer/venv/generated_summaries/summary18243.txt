The discovery of graphene was made at the university in 2004 by Russian physicists Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, who received the Nobel prize for physics for their work in 2010. "The vision is to have electronic devices which can be integrated with your body or clothing, or computers which can be bent or rolled up and put away," said professor Andrea Ferrari, professor of nanotechnology at the UK's University of Cambridge. -- A breakthrough in graphene research which could pave the way for new smaller, faster, more powerful computer chips has be made by UK researchers. Recent advances at Manchester and other UK universities has prompted the British government to invest Â£50 million ($78 million) in a research hub with the aim of maximizing the commercial potential of graphene. "We are constantly looking at new ways of demonstrating and improving the remarkable properties of graphene," Geim said.
