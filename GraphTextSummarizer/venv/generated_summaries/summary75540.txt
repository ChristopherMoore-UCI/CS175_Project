It was a "dark, moonless night," said Carbonaro's father, Robert Carbonaro, who worried as the search was under way that the two "may have gotten disoriented." Carbonaro said he was worried about abandoned gold mine shafts in the area. Carbonaro and Rice, both of Santa Barbara, California, had traveled to a remote corner of the desert with their girlfriends, hoping to test out Rice's new 2011 Polaris ATV, family members said. "I am so sad to report it is official, Dan and Chris were found deceased," said the search's Facebook page, "Friends of the Chris Rice and Dan Carbonaro search." Steve Hansen said the bodies of Daniel Preddy Carbonaro, 27, and Chris Wayne Rice, 29, were found and the search was ended. But Kern County authorities said the bodies were found in a ravine area with rugged, steep terrain.
