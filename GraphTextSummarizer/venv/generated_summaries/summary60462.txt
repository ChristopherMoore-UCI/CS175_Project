Kroos hit the post in the 32nd minute then made the second goal seven minutes later with a diagonal pass to Eren Derdiyok, who headed past Jens Lehmann from eight meters. The convincing win lifted them three points clear of Werder Bremen, who had taken over at the summit on goal difference with a 2-2 draw with defending champions VfL Wolfsburg on Saturday. He sealed his hat-trick in the 87th minute from the penalty spot after Lehmann had pulled down Derdiyok. Later on Sunday, Bayern Munich eased a little of the pressure on coach Louis van Gaal with a 3-0 win over Hannover to move to fourth in the Bundesliga. A Mario Gomez strike in the 90th minute sealed the victory after van Gaal had been reportedly told by the club's director of sport Christian Nerlinger that he must win the final four games of 2009 to keep hold of his job.
