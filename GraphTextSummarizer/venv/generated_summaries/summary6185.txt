Iran and Iraq have enjoyed closer ties in recent years, especially as Iraq's Shia Muslim majority has solidified its power in the absence of former leader Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Muslim. Last year, at the height of the protests, Bahrain called in troops from member nations Saudi Arabia and the UAE and cracked down. The GCC was formed in 1981, soon after Iran instituted a Shiite theocracy and went to war with primarily Sunni Iraq. "I think President (Mahmoud) Ahmadinejad, when he visited the Abu Mousa island a couple weeks ago, in a way he highlighted the need for the union to counter the adventurism of the Iranian government," said GCC Assistant Secretary General Abdel Aziz Aluwaisheg. After U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq last year, Tehran expanded military and security cooperation with Baghdad.
