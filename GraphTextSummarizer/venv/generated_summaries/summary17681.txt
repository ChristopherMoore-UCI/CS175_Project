Before becoming Indonesia's fourth president, Wahid was the revered leader of Nahdlatul Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, with more than 30 million members. -- Former Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid has died, his family told CNN. He was seen, however, as a candidate of compromise, and the Central Axis, a coalition of Muslim forces, lobbied in his favor. He had been in frail health for many years and was partially blind and unable to walk. Wahid was known for injecting humor into his religious sermons and political speeches.
