Researchers concluded that women who had high levels of BPA in their blood were at "significantly increased risk of miscarriage compared to women with the lowest levels." She advises against leaving plastic water bottles in the car, microwaving plastic containers, eating canned foods and touching paper receipts that contain BPA. " Researchers say they don't know why certain women in the study had higher BPA levels; they did not ask whether the women were doing specific things like leaving their plastic water bottles outside in the heat, something thought to increase BPA levels in the water dramatically. "(But) we found BPA was higher in both chromosomally normal and abnormal miscarriages." BPA may be linked to childhood obesity Lathi suggests that the BPA "may be acting in other ways to cause miscarriages. "We expected BPA exposure to be associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy (genetic defects in) miscarriages because of animal studies linking BPA exposure with chromosome abnormalities in eggs," study author Dr. Ruth Bunker Lathi said.
