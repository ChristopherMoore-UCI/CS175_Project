I always make a point of stopping at the grave of Audie Murphy, the most decorated combat soldier of World War II; his headstone is no different or more ornate than the other hundreds of thousands on the grounds, a soldier among soldiers. Arlington remains a working cemetery; it is a place, in the words of the cemetery's own defining statement, "where dignity and honor rest in solemn repose," and that touches you most deeply when you see the newly arrived family of a veteran standing with bowed heads at another fresh grave site. Whatever burdens you may be carrying in your own life, whatever problems may be weighing you down, a few hours walking the quiet pathways of Arlington will remind you of the sacrifice and service of people you never met, people who wanted the country to endure so that new generations could live, and hope to prosper, and strive to enjoy. -- As we head into a workweek that ends with a federal holiday on Friday, you can expect the usual: Newspaper, television and Internet advertisements touting special sales and slashed prices on selected items. Make a promise to do what you can, whenever you can, to pay a visit to an unforgettable American place: Arlington National Cemetery, just across the Potomac River from Washington.
