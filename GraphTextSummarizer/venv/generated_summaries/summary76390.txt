The 2.5 inch-by-1.75 inch commemorative American flag framed with an Apollo 15 uniform patchâ€”which also went to the moonâ€”was sold to McGlynn for $27,741.35, according to Bobby Livingston, executive vice president of New Hampshire-based RR Auction. Seventy items from Apollo 11 -- the first manned mission to land on the moon -- also were offered, including pieces from the personal collections of Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. But the biggest seller was a complete Apollo 15 rotational hand controller used by Commander David Scott to fly and land his lunar module on the surface of the moon in 1971. The market is hot for space items, especially lunar-surface artifacts and prices are continually going up, Livingston said. It was the most used of all the missions," Livingston said, adding that Scott had to manually land with the joystick because he was off-course during his descent onto the moon.
