Rushkoff has watched the movement with cautious optimism, penning editorials on CNN and organizing November's Contact Con, a powwow of net roots activists and open source hackers working to foster new civic-minded apps and hardware. Rather than shun corporate sponsors, Rushkoff revels in what they bring to the table, and in the contradictions of the movement. "There are ways to slowly move towards a sustainable life path, and it's just a matter of doing that, and I'm hoping that more people in Occupy start seeing it that way -- in that more subtle way, rather than exclusively in the kind of activist, let's-get-pepper-sprayed by cops way." "A society that looked at the Internet as a path toward highly articulated connections and new methods of creating meaning is instead finding itself disconnected, denied deep thinking, and drained of enduring values," Rushkoff writes in his recent "Program or Be Programmed." For someone who likes to talk about the virtues of disconnecting, the media critic Douglas Rushkoff seems surprisingly always on.
