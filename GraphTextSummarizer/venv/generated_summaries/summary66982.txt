Fernando Cutz, 21, said the group and Original Mother's in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood had reached an agreement that would also see the nightclub sponsoring four fundraisers and its managers attend diversity training classes. The celebration at Original Mother's had been arranged with the bar in advance by the student class board, which includes two of the African-American students who later were denied entry, Cutz said. "These six [students] were better-dressed than I was," Cutz told CNN. Bar personnel cited dress code violations -- specifically baggy jeans -- in barring the African-American students, Cutz said. " Roberts approached the same manager who had turned away the African-American students, paid the entry fee and was allowed in, Cutz said.
