It also appeared that sending the body overseas was an unlikely option -- Tamerlan Tsarnaev's parents in the Russian region of Dagestan said they would not fly his body back to Russia for burial, citing passport problems, spokeswoman Heda Saratova said. Imam Mohamed Haidara, whose mosque oversees that cemetery, said Tsarnaev's remains are not in that city. " Tsarnaev's uncle Ruslan Tsarni confirmed Thursday afternoon that his nephew is buried outside of Massachusetts and that he has not told Tsarnaev's parents where. The remains of the slain Boston Marathon bombings suspect have been entombed thanks to a "courageous and compassionate individual (who) came forward," police in Worcester, Massachusetts, said Thursday. The body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, killed in a police pursuit days after the bombings, went unclaimed for nearly two weeks.
