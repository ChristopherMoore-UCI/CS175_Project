The government has said the disrupted oil production, from the seizures of ports as well as protests and strikes at other oil facilities, is costing the country $130 million a day. The rebels were pushed back and government troops boarded the ship, which is loaded with what the United States said is "illicitly obtained oil." Culture Minister Habib al-Amin told reporters at a late-night news conference that government forces skirmished with rebels in speedboats as the ship left port Monday morning. Libya has seen its oil exports shrink to just 12.5% of its output since the revolution two years ago that led to the death of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. The dispute is one snapshot in the bigger picture of who controls -- and who profits from -- Libyan oil sales.
