"My wife masterminded it," says Bob Bryan, one half of the most successful men's doubles partnership in tennis history. Bob (@Bryanbros) has almost 110,000 Twitter followers, Mike (@Bryanbrothers) has nearly 75,000, their Facebook page has just passed 45,000 likes and they also have an official website. "I had a birthday (in April) and Novak Djokovic wrote me a direct message on Twitter -- it's a way we stay connected. " Although he has nowhere near the online following of Nadal and Federer, who both have upward of 10 million followers on Facebook alone, Bob says he was one of the first regular tennis tweeters -- and now many players use it to communicate during the downtime of touring life. And she's being primed for a life in tennis -- already boasting a racket deal "after a long 16 months of negotiations" according to a post on her Twitter page in June.
