Long considered a shoo-in for a Best Actor nominee, Fassbender was edged out by first-time nominee Gary Oldman for "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy" and dark horse nominee DemiÃ¡n Bichir for "A Better Life." " Joining Fassbender and Gosling in the notable snubs in the acting races are Golden Globe and SAG nominee Leonardo DiCaprio for "J. Edgar" (Best Actor), Gosling's "Drive" co-star Albert Brooks (Best Supporting Actor), and "We Need To Talk About Kevin's" Tilda Swinton, who lost her spot in the Best Actress race to "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo's" Rooney Mara. As if awards show perennials like DiCaprio and Swinton getting left out weren't surprising enough, there were plenty of other baffling snubs in other categories. Hollywood legend and three-time Oscar winner Steven Spielberg was snubbed from the Best Director category for "War Horse." (Though the latter would have been in the Best Supporting Actor race.)
