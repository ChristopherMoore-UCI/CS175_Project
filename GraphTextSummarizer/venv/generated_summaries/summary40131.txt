"Criminals riding on a motorcycle ... stopped next to the parked car she was driving and shot her twice in the neck and shoulder through the window on the driver's side," Kale Kayihura, the inspector general of police, said Tuesday. Joan Kagezi stopped at a roadside produce stand in a Kampala suburb Monday evening to buy some fruit when her assailants approached, according to police. The blasts erupted in an Ethiopian restaurant and a rugby center while crowds watched the World Cup finals on TV. "The murder of Joan Kagezi should only serve to increase our resolve to hunt down and bring to justice all those elements bent on disturbing the security and development of our country," Kayihura said. Kayihura called her death a big loss for the country and promised to hunt for her killers.
