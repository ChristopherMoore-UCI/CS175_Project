Take into consideration the families who receive Social Security benefits on account of the premature death of a parent or disability, and in 2012 Social Security lifted more than 22 million Americans out of poverty. Social Security has afforded millions of Americans the opportunity to retire with dignity after a lifetime of hard work. The paucity of such stories in America today should not be misinterpreted as a sign that we no longer need Social Security but instead taken as proof of the program's success, and evidence of the importance of its continued existence for future generations. I'll admit that contributing to my appreciation of the Social Security program is that it is one of my grandfather's proudest legacies. Even without the assurance of walking out the door 40 years down the line with a gold watch and a pension, younger Americans today have far less reason to fear living out their final years in abject poverty.
