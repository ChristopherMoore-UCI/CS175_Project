Crowds in a Syrian town surrounded by government troops cheered Arab League monitors who visited Sunday as others fled the town on foot to escape the fighting inside. A number of journalists have been allowed in to the country in recent days, including a CNN correspondent, to travel with Arab League monitors. But reports of carnage mount every day, despite the presence of Arab League observers in the country and international calls for a halt to the crackdown. The monitors got a different reception from Syrian soldiers, who berated them as the soldiers carried off the body of one of their comrades they said had been shot by opposition forces. In Zabadani, a CNN crew heading into the city with the Arab League monitors saw men, women and children trudging out of the city to get away from the fighting.
