"I'm very happy to finally win this year, that was the most important thing for me because I was practicing very hard," Kaymer said after landing the $1.25 million first prize at the Nedbank Challenge in Sun City, South Africa. That ended on Sunday as former world No. 1 Kaymer clinched his first tournament win since November 2011 and McDowell posted his first victory since 2010 in another exhibition tournament. Kaymer followed up compatriot Bernhard Langer's victory in the seniors event in Sun City on Saturday. The German finished two shots clear of South Africa's 2011 Masters winner Charl Schwartzel in a 12-man field that also included 2010 British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen and former world No. 1 Lee Westwood. We talked at the Ryder Cup on the Saturday in the players' lounge when I didn't play at all, and we talked about the spirit and the attitude of the Ryder Cup, and you can use that for regular tournaments as well," Kaymer said.
