Emerton laid on the third just before halftime with another cross from the right which was met by the head of Brett Holman. Rank outsiders India, coached by Englishman Bob Houghton, are making their first appearance in the Asian Cup for 27 years and looked out of their depth against an Australia team with several English Premier League regulars. Everton star Cahill opened the scoring in the 11th minute as he netted at the near post after a fine cross from Brett Emerton. South Korea were given a stiffer challenge by a battling Bahrain side but a double from Koo Ja-Cheol either side of halftime gave them a comfortable advantage they could have increased. Tim Cahill scored twice as Australia opened their Asian Cup campaign with a convincing 4-0 win over India in their Group C match in Doha Monday.
