Attorney General George Jepsen filed the request with the state's Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, which is already investigating CL&P over its response to power outages during Tropical Storm Irene in September. As of Friday night, about 283,000 households who get service through Connecticut Light and Power remained in the dark. The utility, which at one point had 831,000 such outages, has promised to return power to 99% of its customers by Sunday night. " Eighty shelters were open around Connecticut on Friday night, in addition to 109 warming centers. Eight people have died in Connecticut due to the storm, four of them from carbon monoxide poisoning, Gov. Dannel Malloy has said.
