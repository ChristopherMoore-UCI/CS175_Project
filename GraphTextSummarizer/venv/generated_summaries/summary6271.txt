-- Former Vice President Dick Cheney said in an interview broadcast Sunday that the Justice Department's decision to review waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques is politically motivated. Former Vice President Dick Cheney criticized the review of interrogation methods. Cheney said he opposes the decision by Attorney General Eric Holder to ask a former prosecutor to review CIA interrogations of high-profile terrorism suspects. A primary question is whether the techniques led to suspects providing valuable information that prevented further terror attacks. The Bush administration has acknowledged that it authorized enhanced interrogation techniques against suspected terrorists, arguing they produced valuable intelligence without violating U.S. laws banning torture.
