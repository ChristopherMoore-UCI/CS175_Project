-- A day after he won a new trial in the murder of a 15-year-old girl, Michael Skakel, the nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, filed a bond motion Thursday asking he be released from prison pending a second trial's outcome. John Moxley, Martha Moxley's brother, told CNN Thursday that he still believes that Skakel is guilty and would be opposed to his release from prison. " Moxley's body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. Prior to his trial, Skakel voluntarily surrendered to authorities in January 2000, and when he was released on bond after that arrest, "he never failed to attend court," the motion said. His continued incarceration isn't "necessary to protect" the public or the Moxley family, which now resides outside of Connecticut, court papers said.
