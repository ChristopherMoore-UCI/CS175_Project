The bad part of what happened yesterday is that Clint Eastwood in his own way upstaged Mitt Romney," said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. " Romney adviser: Eastwood a 'great messenger' Senior Romney campaign strategist Stuart Stevens downplayed the notion that Eastwood's "improv" would be a distraction to the candidate's message. Given the narrow window before the Democratic National Convention -- which begins on Tuesday -- Eastwood's performance and the ensuing backlash on social media stole valuable time that the Romney campaign could have used to dominate the media cycle. "Tomorrow you'll know Romney hit it out of the park when the media spends its time talking about Eastwood," responded conservative radio host Erick Erickson, who is also a CNN contributor. Van Jones, who some say became a distraction himself just before the former Obama administration green jobs czar left the White House in controversy when conservatives linked him to past liberal political statements, offered Eastwood a bit of advice on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer on Friday.
