The Dutch version of festive St. Nicholas is once again landing on the naughty list for some in the Netherlands, who say his Black Pete sidekick is a racist throwback to the colonial era. The Dutch government replied that it was aware that the practice was offensive to some, and that it had received dozens of complaints a year concerning Black Pete since 2011. The tradition has grown increasingly contentious in recent years, with the United Nations arguing last year in favor of a national dialogue on the practice. Only one person was arrested in Sunday's event, according to CNN affiliate RTL and Dutch national broadcaster NOS. Experts working under the auspices of the Office of the High Commissioner for Humam Rights last year said people of African descent found the character's depiction "rooted in unacceptable, colonial attitudes that they find racist and offensive."
