A key figure in the club's revival thanks to his extensive network of contacts, Leonardo handed in his resignation as sporting director, signaling the second major departure from PSG in two weeks after coach Carlo Ancelotti -- Leonardo's friend -- left for Real Madrid. Before the Brazilian leaves, PSG could tie up a deal for sought after Napoli striker Edinson Cavani, a boost for Ancelotti's managerial replacement Laurent Blanc. Earlier this month Leonardo's suspension for shoving a referee following PSG's 1-1 draw with Valenciennes in May was extended from nine to 13 months, although the ban wouldn't have affected most of his duties as sporting director. Leonardo, like Blanc a World Cup winner, earned more than 50 caps for Brazil and was a fan favorite during his four years at A.C. Milan, the club most commonly associated with Ancelotti. With Ancelotti at the helm and the likes of Ibrahimovic, Silva and the now retired Beckham -- for a short while -- on the pitch, PSG last season claimed the league title for the first time since 1994.
