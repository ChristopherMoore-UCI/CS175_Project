The six-line notice under "forthcoming marriages" is so straightforward, it would be easy to read past it before realizing that it's taking about THE Benedict Cumberbatch: "The engagement is announced between Benedict, son of Wanda and Timothy Cumberbatch of London, and Sophie, daughter of Katharine Hunter of Edinburgh and Charles Hunter of London. Yes, "Sherlock" star Benedict Cumberbatch is engaged to director and actress Sophie Hunter -- cue the crying emojis from some fans on Twitter -- but the actor revealed the news in a refreshingly humble way. Instead of releasing a statement through an army of publicists or posting a photo of engagement rings on Instagram, Cumberbatch went old-school and posted an engagement notice in the Wednesday edition of UK paper The Times. " The lack of fanfare isn't unusual for Cumberbatch, 38, and Hunter, 36, as they've kept their romance under the radar. Still, the news of a Cumberbatch wedding is a tough pill to swallow for some admirers.
