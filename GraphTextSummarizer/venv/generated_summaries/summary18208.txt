-- The man who shot Pope John Paul II in 1981 was released from prison in Turkey Monday, Turkey's Anadolu news agency reported. The pope visited Agca in prison on December 27, 1983, and reportedly forgave him in person. In 2006, a military hospital ruled that he was not fit for the obligatory military service due to a severe anti-social personality disorder, but the Ministry of National Defense did not approve the exemption, the Turkish news agency said. Agca was due to be taken to a military facility to assess his fitness for military service after his release. Agca was arrested a few minutes after the attack, tried, and sentenced to 19 years in prison.
