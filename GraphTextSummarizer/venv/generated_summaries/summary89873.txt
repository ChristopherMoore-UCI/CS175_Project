Mario Ganora, a lawyer who works with La Alameda, an Argentinian nonprofit that helps victims of human trafficking, said the increase in human trafficking was connected to an increase in drug consumption. The bishops pledged to raise awareness of the problem, push for legal reforms and assist victims -- noting that within the church there had been "an absence of proposals dedicated to attracting young people (to the church), and the absence of a more decisive and broad response to the problem (of human trafficking). According to official data from Argentina's Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, 176 people were rescued from human trafficking networks in Argentina in April, a higher number than the entire previous trimester. -- Dozens of Roman Catholic bishops in South America say human trafficking has seen "alarming growth" in the region. The women who are used for sex trafficking are also used for the delivery of drugs," he said.
