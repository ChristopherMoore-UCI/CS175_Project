After his triumph at Roland Garros, Nadal has guaranteed his place in this year's O2 Arena showpiece alongside newly-crowned world number one and Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic. The ATP's annual season-ending World Tour Finals event -- held at London's O2 Arena since 2009 -- will see a 30% increase in prize money, with the amount given to the eight participating players set to soar to $6.5m over the next three years. The 2010 World Tour Finals had a prize fund of $5m, with the number-three ranked Roger Federer defeating reigning French Open champion Rafael Nadal to clinch the title. "We are privileged to be experiencing a golden era in men's professional tennis," said the body's executive chairman and president Adam Helfant. -- The ATP have announced an increase in the prize fund available to male tennis stars on the ATP World Tour which will see the total amount available exceed $90 million by 2014.
