Nodding disease seems to only affect children between 1 to 19 years, with the worst affected at ages 3 to 11, based on anecdotal evidence gathered by health workers. We ruled out three dozen potential causes and we are working on a handful of probabilities," says Dr. Scott Dowell, director of global disease detection and emergency response at CDC. Nodding disease gets its name from the strange nodding-like symptoms that children display in the first stages of a seizure. We were told that several houses in areas we visited had been burnt down by children suffering from nodding disease. "We know from past experience an unknown disease could end up having more global implications," says Dr. Dowell.
