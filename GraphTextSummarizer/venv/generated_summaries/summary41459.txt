-- Israeli soldiers and several dozen Palestinians clashed in Jerusalem Saturday, exchanging volleys of rocks, tear gas, fire bombs, and rubber bullets, according to eyewitnesses and the Israeli military. He was shot the day before by Israeli security forces in a protest opposing Israeli police entering the compound that houses Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, Palestinian officials said. Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld denied the reports and said access to the location was being administered under normal guidelines. The military spokesman said Ramiyeh's death was still under investigation, but a preliminary report suggested that he had been engaged in a "violent riot" and aimed fireworks at Israeli security personnel who responded with live fire. During the past week, clashes around the sensitive religious site known the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims and the Temple Mount to Jews erupted on multiple occasions amid rumors that Israeli authorities were allowing right-wing Jewish activists access to the compound in order to stoke tensions with Palestinians.
