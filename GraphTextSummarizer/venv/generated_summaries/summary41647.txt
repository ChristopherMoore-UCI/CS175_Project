Use rates of at least 90 percent were tallied for 16 states and territories: Michigan, Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Maryland, Iowa, Puerto Rico, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Texas, Nevada, New Mexico, Illinois and the District of Columbia. States with laws mandating the use of seat belts tended to have higher use rates. "States like Michigan are raising the bar on seat belt use, making communities safer and keeping families intact," said LaHood. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood credited more widespread seat belt use for the drop. Massachusetts, Wyoming and New Hampshire had the lowest use rates -- all below 70 percent.
