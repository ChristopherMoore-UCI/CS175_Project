The new constitution would eliminate term limits and allow President Evo Morales to run again for president. -- Bolivians are widely expected to approve a new constitution Sunday that would allow leftist President Evo Morales to run for another term this year, which he can't do under the current document. The constitution was formulated, he said, "during a time of fat cows, but it is being voted on during a time of skinny cows. Under provisions of the new constitution, current terms would not be counted, so Morales could run in December and in 2014. Others say the referendum is a way for Morales to keep himself in power, a move that could plunge the country into further violence, division and uncertainty.
