-- A Delaware pediatrician was indicted Wednesday on 58 additional counts of rape and other sexual offenses in the alleged child abuse of his patients, state Attorney General Beau Biden announced Monday. Wednesday's indictment -- which includes charges of rape, unlawful sexual contact, continuous sexual abuse of a child and sexual exploitation -- involves 24 girls he saw as patients from 1999 to 2009. Bradley, whose practice was in Lewes, Delaware, also has medical licenses in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Florida. In a February 24 interview with CNN, Bradley's attorney said he would base his client's defense on mental health. Biden has said the charges are based on "video and digital evidence" seized from Bradley's home and medical practice in December, when the doctor was arrested.
