Konias is believed to be in possession of at least three handguns and is thought to be within the United States, said Pittsburgh Police Commander Thomas Stangrecki. -- Two big piles of cash, one at a grave site and another at a home, have been recovered by Pittsburgh police and are believed to be part of the $2 million an armored truck driver allegedly stole after killing his partner. His mother, Renee Konias, told police that she had received a "strange call" from her son, less than an hour after the shooting, asking to speak to his father, but she informed him that he would have to call the house to reach him. The armored truck company, Garda Cash Logistics, is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of Konias. According to the complaint, Konias' father said he saw his son drop off a blood-spattered work jacket at his home.
