He testified Moussaoui's stated goal of learning to fly from Heathrow Airport in London to New York's John F. Kennedy Airport was unusual from the beginning, because Moussaoui had 50-odd hours of flight time on a single-engine propeller plane and no pilot's license. Moussaoui is the only person charged and convicted in connection with the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. A day after Prevost went to his bosses with his concerns, two Pan Am program managers called the FBI, leading to Moussaoui's arrest on an immigration violation. Prevost, a retired Northwest Airlines pilot, has never spoken publicly about Moussaoui, but testified during the sentencing phase of Moussaoui's trial. Prevost wanted to know if Moussaoui could explain the Hajj to him and asked, "Are you Muslim?" Prevost testified that Moussaoui responded by raising his voice and saying, "I am nothing!" Prevost testified that he approached his managers, and recalled telling them, "We don't know anything about this guy, and we're teaching him how to throw the switches on a 747."
