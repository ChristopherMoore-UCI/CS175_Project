Malcolm McCulloch, an electrical engineer from the UK's Oxford University, says: "They are interesting, but the problem is that the specific energy -- energy per unit mass -- is very high in air cars." Professor Paul Shayler from the School of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering at the UK's University of Nottingham says: "It's an idea that's worth pursuing, but compressing air is both a strength and a weakness. -- Hydrogen and electric vehicles might be leading the charge, so to speak, towards cleaner transport, but will cars powered by air and the sun ever surpass the sales figures of gasoline cars? India's biggest car maker, Tata Motors, and a U.S. startup, Zero Pollution Motors, have both signed deals with MDI and hope to have air cars on the road by 2010. VERDICT Compressed-air engines are not new technology -- the French were powering trams with compressed air back in the 19th century.
