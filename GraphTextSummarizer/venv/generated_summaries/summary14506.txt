Because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes, even minutes before re-entry, it will be impossible to pinpoint an exact location, Mark Matney of NASA's Orbital Debris team said Wednesday. -- A satellite whose orbit is degrading is likely to crash back to Earth on Friday, and 26 pieces have a good chance of surviving the heat of re-entry, NASA said. On top of that, he said, "part of the problem is the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it's coming down even right before the re-entry." NASA says most of the six-ton spacecraft is made of aluminum, which has a relatively low melting temperature and will burn up on re-entry. Because water covers about 70 percent of the Earth's surface, NASA believes most, if not all the debris that survives will land in an ocean or sea. This is the largest NASA satellite to re-enter in about 30 years, but at six tons, it's only a fraction of the size of the 75-ton Skylab that fell back to Earth in 1979.
