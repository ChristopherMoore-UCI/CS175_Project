-- After posting a series of disturbing tweets about rape, musician CeeLo Green has returned with a 140-character apology. Yet those messages, captured by Billboard, were soon gone too as Green appeared to shut down his Twitter account altogether. According to Billboard, Green aired his thoughts about the case Sunday on Twitter. An online petition urged the network to end the program after Green's tweets, but a source from TBS told CNN the series wasn't picked up for a second season due to low ratings. That mea culpa arrived just as TBS, which shares a parent company with CNN, canceled Green's new reality show, "The Good Life."
