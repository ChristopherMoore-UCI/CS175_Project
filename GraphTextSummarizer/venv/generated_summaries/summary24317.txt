Ancelotti then laughed when it was suggested to him that Real Madrid was under less pressure in the Champions League this season because it captured a 10th title -- or 'Decima' -- last year. "It is clear that Cristiano Ronaldo lives to score goals," Ancelotti was quoted as saying by UEFA. "It was good," Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti told Sky Sports. Ronaldo netted the opener and assisted on Marcelo's thunderbolt as Real Madrid moved closer to a place in the quarterfinals of the Champions League by defeating Schalke 2-0 in Germany on Wednesday. Real Madrid took the lead in the 26th minute when Ronaldo headed Daniel Carvajal's cross past an out of position Timon Wellenreuther -- and was never really troubled thereafter.
