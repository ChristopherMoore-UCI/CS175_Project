The reason for this latest round of tensions, violence and bloodletting is a perfect storm of factors that include the sense of isolation and frustration on the part of the Palestinians of East Jerusalem who don't have the benefit of the social services and economic advantages of Israelis in the west; Israel's effort to expand their communities and presence in East Jerusalem; Hamas' efforts to incite and fan the flames; and the grim realization that the future seems almost certain to be more of the same. In this regard, Jerusalem is unique in that it is one of the only places where Israelis and Palestinians (the vast majority who aren't Arab citizens of Israel) mix every day and have almost unrestricted access to one another. That platform, situated within the walls of Jerusalem's Old City, is in essence a physical manifestation of overlapping sacred space. And nowhere has the religious complexity of the Jerusalem issue been clearer than on the question of who controls and what will happen to the Haram al-Sharif (Noble Enclosure) and Har Habayit (Temple Mount). Keep in mind that the sacred space issue is only one dimension of the Jerusalem problem.
