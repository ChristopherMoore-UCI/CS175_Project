This strategically located town in eastern Ukraine is one more casualty of the fighting that has intensified in recent weeks between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian forces. The remaining people only come out to board a bus or car that will carry them to safety, or when relief workers arrive to hand out rice, pasta, canned foods and other supplies. At least 224 were killed and more than 540 others injured in the final three weeks of January, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said last week. They wait for for cars, small buses or full-sized buses driven by relief workers to arrive and carry them to safe havens. Dozens of people huddle in dank underground bunkers and sleep on cots and old beds carried in.
