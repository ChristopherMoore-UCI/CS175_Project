Erica Bartoe, a CNN iReporter from Hamburg, New York, said that people had come to her town from other areas to help shovel snow and drop off donations. Warming temperatures forecast for Sunday will start to melt 7 feet of snow that fell last week. "At least 3 feet of snow has melted so far," she said Sunday afternoon. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told residents in the Buffalo area to be ready to evacuate if they think floodwater caused by melting snow could reach their residences. The National Weather Service says flood-prone areas will be inundated but warns there will be more widespread flooding, too. "(We) expect 5 to 6 feet of water in some areas in a short period of time," Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz said Saturday.
