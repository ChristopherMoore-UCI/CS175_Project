"That means Voyager has traveled outside the bubble of our sun," explains Voyager project manager Suzy Dodd. While measurements allowed NASA to feel confident enough to confirm Voyager 1 had entered interstellar space, two University of Michigan scientists who have worked on the Voyager missions remain skeptical. SEE: Moon maps through the ages To that end, Gloeckler and fellow University of Michigan professor and study co-author Len Fisk, predict that when Voyager does cross the threshold into interstellar space, the probe will identify a reversal in the magnetic field, which will be relayed back to scientists on Earth, conclusively determining the spacecraft's location. Thirty-seven years after it launched, Voyager 1 is still out in the vast expanse of space, periodically relaying new data back home. That alignment of planets only happens every 176 years," says Dodd -- who has described Voyager 1 as "the little spacecraft that could.
