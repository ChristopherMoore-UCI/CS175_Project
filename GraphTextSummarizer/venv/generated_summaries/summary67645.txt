While "eurocrats" in Brussels hope that the likely turmoil in Greece will lead voters in Spain and Portugal to play for safety, it could have the opposite effect, emboldening voters to swing behind populist parties without coherent financial programs. Participation in the coalition government has badly damaged the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives' partners, and in the aftermath of the referendum on independence for Scotland, the Scottish National Party is polling at a level that suggests it could wrest at least 20 Westminster seats from Labour, which has always depended on a hefty contingent of MPs in Scottish seats to win national elections. On January 1, 2015, EU leaders were able to celebrate one measure of progress: Lithuania became the last of the three Baltic states which entered the Union in 2004 to ditch its old currency, the litas, and to become a fully-fledged member of the euro club. " Should the Conservatives led by David Cameron again emerge as the largest single party and form part of another coalition government, he would have to implement his pledge to stage an "In or Out" referendum on continued UK membership of the EU, after he has sought to renegotiate the terms of that membership with other leaders in Brussels. But Greece is not alone in having euroskeptic parties riding high in the opinion polls.
