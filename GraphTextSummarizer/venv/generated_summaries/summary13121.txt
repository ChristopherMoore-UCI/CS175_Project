Four Louisiana men have been arrested after 63 semi-automatic rifles were reported missing at a shipping warehouse, Caddo Parish Sheriff Steve Prator said Wednesday. On October 14, two days after a gun shipment arrived, officials at Con-way Freight in Shreveport learned that one of five pallets carrying the Colt AR-15s was missing. Hundreds of Park Police guns unaccounted for, report says They were being shipped from Hartford, Connecticut, to a Shreveport-area gun distributor. The release said it is possible some of the guns may have been sold to unwitting buyers.
