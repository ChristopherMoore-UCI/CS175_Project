And in another sign of the global economy, the fabric woven here is rarely sent to American plants to be turned into jeans. A $12 pair of jeans often comes from the same roll of denim as a $150 designer pair. It's likely they began right here at Mount Vernon Mills, one of the last functioning cotton mills in America and the nation's No. 1 producer of denim. The company owned everything in town back then, from the tiny mill houses that surround the plant to the town hospital where Henderson and many of his co-workers were born. In a tiny enclave of northwest Georgia, Wolfe and 1,200 of his colleagues churn out enough denim per week for 800,000 pairs of blue jeans.
