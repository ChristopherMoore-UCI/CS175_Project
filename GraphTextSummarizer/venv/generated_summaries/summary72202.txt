New Zealand exports almost $9.5bn of dairy products a year, and nearly a fifth of that goes to China. Even without an outright ban, the image of New Zealand dairy in China is at risk. Tim Groser, New Zealand's trade minister, initially told state broadcaster Television New Zealand that China had banned imports of all milk powder, a move he deemed "absolutely appropriate". It was then mixed with other ingredients to produce 870 tonnes of product sold in a number of markets including New Zealand, Australia, China and Saudi Arabia. It demanded that four companies recall products that might have been affected by contaminated milk, including Wahaha, China's biggest beverage producer.
