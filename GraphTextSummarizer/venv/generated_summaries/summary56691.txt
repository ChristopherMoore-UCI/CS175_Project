The coast guard said it's 52 times bigger than the iconic Tokyo Dome. Magma and lava from a Japanese volcano is forming new geography in a remote part of the Pacific Ocean. The evolving land mass is 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tokyo. The volcano is erupting five to six times a minute, spewing out volcanic rock, the coast guard says. An eruption on the tiny volcanic island of Nishinoshima in November 2013 formed a small islet right next to it when molten lava cooled.
