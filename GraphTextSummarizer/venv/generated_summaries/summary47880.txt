"Our advantage is that we are almost 10 days quicker on transit time from South Africa into the European markets so in general in the stone fruit season in we produce about 60/70% of the out of season stone fruit production for Europe," he explains. "If you don't pick it at the right maturity, then it doesn't get overseas at the right eating quality," explains fruit farmer Tol Malherbe. According to horticultural experts Hortgro, almost 16 million cartons of stone fruit were exported during the 2013-14 season, of which 10.5 million cartons were plums. As the African market for stone fruit grows by 100 per cent year on year, the growers and producers need to adapt to the market. According to the National Agricultural Marketing Council, plum production in South Africa has increased from 60,000 tons in 2009/2010 to nearly 80,000 tons in 2013/2014.
