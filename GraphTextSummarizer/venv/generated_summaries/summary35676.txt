Let us know your views of drugs and drug testing in football. The FA is far from blind to the issue of drugs in English football and since the Ferdinand incident their policies and punishments have been tightened. But as long as a player's chances of getting caught remain comparatively small, drugs in football appears to be an issue the FA is keeping a lid on rather than eradicating. "Testing at no notice and out of competition is where we think we've got the best chance of being able to catch any sportsmen taking drugs," he added. The FA's guidelines state that for a first offence a minimum suspension of three months up to a maximum of two years will apply, but a lack of consistency has always dogged punishments for drug offences.
