Ethnic violence between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks has displaced 300,000 people inside Kyrgyzstan and forced 100,000 more to flee Kyrgyzstan, the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimated. The clashes, which erupted last week, were the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds of people died in Osh. -- Kyrgyzstan will investigate allegations that government troops were involved in ethnic violence, an official said Sunday. Ikromjon, too, said he saw Kyrgyz troops spray a crowd with bullets in the southern city of Osh. Uprooted people on both sides of the Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan border said they are frightened by the Kyrgyz military.
