The Voting Rights Act had succeeded in doing what it was created to do: create millions of new black voters, and -- less understood -- free white Southern politicians from always opposing black gains. While the nation waits to see whether the 1965 Voting Rights Act will be dismantled by the U.S. Supreme Court, it is worth reviewing how the act affected one group that had long opposed black suffrage: Southern white politicians Before 1965, many white officeholders helped build their career by preventing blacks from voting. Al Lingo -- head of Alabama's State Troopers and one of the architects of Bloody Sunday, the assault on Selma-to-Mongomery marchers on March 7, 1965, by state troopers and deputies -- sought black votes in his race for Jefferson County sheriff. She faced a challenge from Attorney General Richmond Flowers, the first Democrat to seek black votes. Because black votes now counted, reporters covering the campaign noted that the n-word, once a political staple, had disappeared.
