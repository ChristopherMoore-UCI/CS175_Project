Some fans seem unwilling to believe that Cobain, whose name was synonymous with the movement called Grunge that transformed rock, fled into the arms of death to escape the torments of depression and drug abuse in 1994. Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain killed himself at age 27 with a shotgun, a Seattle police investigation concluded, and nothing has changed about that assessment 20 years after his death. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems. But Mike Ciesenski was merely re-reading Cobain's materials, just in case. Then news on Thursday that a cold-case detective was reviewing Cobain's file triggered a storm of digital chatter.
