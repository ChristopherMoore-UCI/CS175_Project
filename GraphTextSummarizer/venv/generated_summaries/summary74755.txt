A 17-year-old male fatally shot an Iraqi man watching his first snowfall in his new American hometown, targeting him and then continuing to fire as the immigrant rushed to get inside, Dallas police said Friday. " Dallas police named the suspected shooter, though CNN is not identifying him yet since he's a minor and it's not clear if he'll be charged as an adult. Authorities don't believe the suspected shooter knew the victim, Ahmed Al-Jumaili, Dallas Police Maj. The teen was brought to Dallas police headquarters for another interview, and he changed his story. While police haven't given any indication this was a hate crime, though Alia Salem -- executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in the Dallas and Fort Worth area -- noted "a heightened sense of awareness with regard to hate crimes against Muslims."
