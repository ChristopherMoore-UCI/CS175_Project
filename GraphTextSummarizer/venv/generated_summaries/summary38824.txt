Mexico's foreign ministry said Tuesday that it "welcomes the principles that have been set out" in U.S. President Barack Obama's remarks calling for immigration reform, and the proposal presented Monday by a bipartisan group of U.S. senators. In legal briefs and public speeches, they've argued against racial profiling they said would be fostered by U.S. state immigration laws and called for changes in federal laws to bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. And Mexico's foreign ministry has sharply condemned what it has called "disproportionate use of lethal force in the exercising of immigration control functions" by U.S. Border Patrol agents. A Mexican lawmaker told CNN en EspaÃ±ol that U.S. politicians were proposing a plan that would help millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States -- nearly 60% of whom are Mexican, according to government estimates. The Mexican government hasn't shied away from pushing for changes in U.S. immigration laws in the past.
