The Yamaha rider overhauled reigning world championship Casey Stoner midway through the race and went clear for his 42nd career title. -- Spain's Jorge Lorenzo extended his lead in the world championship standings with a storming victory in the British MotoGP at Silverstone Sunday. Alvaro Bautista of Spain, who had claimed pole, took fourth place ahead of American Ben Spies on the second Yamaha. Only a bad mistake with four laps to go might have cost Lorenzo, but he had time to spare to recover and cross the line clear of Stoner whose Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa of Spain finished third. Cal Crutchlow gave the home crowd reason to cheer with a battling display to finish sixth after starting on the back of the grid having crashed and missed qualifying Saturday.
