-- A crew member of a fishing vessel seen on the "Deadliest Catch" reality show was found dead in a Homer, Alaska, hotel room Tuesday, police said. Justin Tennison, 33, died of "unknown causes," but his body was flown to Anchorage, Alaska, for an autopsy, according to a statement from the Homer, Alaska, Police Department. Police and paramedics were called to Homer's Best Western Bidarka Inn Tuesday afternoon after Tennison's body was found, police said. Phil Harris, the tattooed and gruff captain of the Cornelia Marie, died a year ago of complications from a stroke suffered while his crew offloaded crab at St. Paul Island, Alaska. Tennison's is the second death in a year among the Discovery Channel show's cast.
