-- I was working at my desk in D.C., following race reports from Boston on Twitter, wondering as I do every year if I'll ever be fast enough to qualify. Take the pledge to run for Boston And for so many of us who take to the roads, paths and trails, the essence of running is freedom; our freedom to step outside, stretch our legs and fly along the ground wherever we choose for as long as we please. For well over a century, Boston has been hallowed ground for those of us who run. Some runners who had just covered nearly the whole course were among the first to rush over and offer aid. We marathoned together a few years back, and we still join each other for races whenever we can.
