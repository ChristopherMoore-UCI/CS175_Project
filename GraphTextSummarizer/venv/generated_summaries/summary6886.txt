Built in 1886, the railway bridge is being transformed as part of an upgrade by Network Rail -- the owner and operator of rail infrastructure in the UK -- to the existing Blackfriars station. Blackfriars Bridge is an ideal location for solar," Derry Newman, chief executive of Solar Century, said in a statement. Constructed in the age of steam, we're bringing it bang up to date with 21st century solar technology to create an iconic station for the city," Lindsay Vamplew, Network Rail's project director for Blackfriars said in a statement. Over 4,400 individual photovoltaic panels are expected to produce around 900,000 kilowatt hours of electricity every year, providing the station with half of its energy needs, according to Solar Century, the UK company installing the solar roof. In addition to the solar panels (manufactured by the SANYO Electric Co. Ltd), the station will also include rain-harvesting systems and sun pipes for natural lighting.
