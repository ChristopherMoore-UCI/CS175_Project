"In El Salvador converge in a very clear way three issues that are crucial when it comes to the relation between the United States and Latin American countries: migration, trade and security," Casas-Zamora said. As Mexico has scored important victories against major drug cartels, these criminal organizations have moved into Central American countries, including El Salvador. Arnson says that in a relatively short period of time, the Central American country has managed to professionalize and downsize its army and establish a system of political competition in which everyone agrees on the rules of the game (a great achievement when one takes into account that El Salvador was ravaged by a civil war that lasted from 1979 to 1992). And former Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva defied most countries on the U.N. Security Council last year (and certainly the United States) on the issue of sanctions against Iran for its nuclear program. "As we respond to these immediate crises abroad, we also will not let up in our effort to tackle the pressing, ongoing challenges facing our country, including accelerating economic growth," he said as he made the case for economic opportunities for U.S. businesses in Latin America.
